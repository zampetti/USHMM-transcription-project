Knüemann--K-N-E-U-E-M-A-N-N.</span> <span id="s15">Knüemann.</span> <span id="s16">And I was born in Bydgoszcz, Poland.</span> <span id="s17">Actually, the Germans called it Bromberg.</span> <span id="s18">A very difficult name to spell, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Uh, 1922, 15th of November.</span> <span id="s21">And, of course, uh I lived there until 1932.</span> <span id="s22">And in November, we left Poland because my father was German citizen and businessman.</span> <span id="s23">We had a small factory--bakery machinery and stuff like this.</span> <span id="s24">Uh, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What was it like growing up?</span> <span id="s26">You can look at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s28">In Poland, actually, compared with Germany, it was a free country.</span> <span id="s29">I came to Germany expecting a paradise.</span> <span id="s30">My parents had told me that it would be like this.</span> <span id="s31">But it turned out that life in Poland was like living in a democracy.</span> <span id="s32">There was strike, there was economic hardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it.</span> <span id="s33">Most of my friends were Polish boys from the streets, and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic minority and the Poles.</span> <span id="s34">The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so, my friends came up to me and said, "Tomorrow!"</span> <span id="s35">It meant actually they were mad at me; but they never came with a knife and cut my throat.</span> <span id="s36">I didn't expect them to either, you know.</span> <span id="s37">They didn't expect to do that either.</span> <span id="s38">So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic problems.</span> <span id="s39">And you get used to it.</span> <span id="s40">And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not getting upset about it, you know.</span> <span id="s41">My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent, all three.</span> <span id="s42">The family came from Hungary originally via Salzburg.</span> <span id="s43">And Frederick the Great took these Salzburg Germans into East Prussia.</span> <span id="s44">That's where my mother landed.</span> <span id="s45">And the family mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person.</span> <span id="s46">My mother is just...is not getting upset about anything.</span> <span id="s47">But already as a child I knew when a problem came up, she stepped right in and helped solving it.</span> <span id="s48">She never turned her back.</span> <span id="s49">My father same thing.</span> <span id="s50">I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents.</span> <span id="s51">So it dropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal mistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem and make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it.</span> <span id="s52">So I was a happy child.</span> <span id="s53">My father was a hunter.</span> <span id="s54">He went fishing.</span> <span id="s55">He was socially quite active.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">We had parties our house.</span> <span id="s57">Being a businessman in Poland meant actually that you had your clients invite at least once or twice a year.</span> <span id="s58">Once at least for a big hunt.</span> <span id="s59">Uh, that's why my father really kept the hunting ground to have a party opportunity to reward his customers.</span> <span id="s60">My father also became honorary consul of the German Weimar Republic, so as a businessman...And he served in this function, I think, until '29 or so.</span> <span id="s61">And, of course, he knew about the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever.</span> <span id="s62">Because of the foreign office in Berlin things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already indicated that Hitler will take over very soon.</span> <span id="s63">So the message of doom, at least for my father, was quite clear.</span> <span id="s64">It didn't...it took one incident.</span> <span id="s65">My father was riding by train from Berlin to Bydgoszcz.</span> <span id="s66">And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman.</span> <span id="s67">And another person came into his compartment--a German who traveled to Germany, too--and after the train started to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out, [the] Volkischer Beobachter.</span> <span id="s68">My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person anyhow.</span> <span id="s69">He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man.</span> <span id="s70">He saw this, my father really angry.</span> <span id="s71">He took his briefcase from out of the rack and told this guy, "I don't want to share my compartment with a man who reads the Nazi paper. "</span> <span id="s72">That's what the kind of person my father was.</span> <span id="s73">Because he addressed the right person.</span> <span id="s74">This person was actually his replacement.</span> <span id="s75">You know, he was on a visit to Bydgoszcz to talk to my father how he would take this over, you know.</span> <span id="s76">And later on, a day or two later, he met him.</span> <span id="s77">This guy came visiting and said, "I am Consul [Bernhard (ph)]. "</span> <span id="s78">And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting; and my father was relieved of his position in a week's time.</span> <span id="s79">This guy had gone back to Germany and wrote up the incident in the compartment; and that really fixed my father's future for good.</span> <span id="s80">My father, of course, didn't need that job at all.</span> <span id="s81">It was really uh more bother than reward.</span> <span id="s82">He ran his business.</span> <span id="s83">But then the recession came and Poland was very hard hit.</span> <span id="s84">My father was German citizen living on a passport.</span> <span id="s85">So the Poles said, "Mr. Knüemann, why don't you go back to Brandenburg?"</span> <span id="s86">That is what Germany was called in Poland.</span> <span id="s87">And we got an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of 1932 to Germany.</span> <span id="s88">My father could have gone to Essen; but Berlin was the next city, really big city.</span> <span id="s89">And he had probably better opportunities to get a job.</span> <span id="s90">But he was in error.</span> <span id="s91">He came and he was told, "No job for you. "</span> <span id="s92">Because of his remark.</span> <span id="s93">And Hitler was not even in power then.</span> <span id="s94">But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic positions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not.</span> <span id="s95">So my father never got a job offer.</span> <span id="s96">He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How did you survive financially?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: He was...he was actually a veteran.</span> <span id="s99">But being a German national, he had actually abdicated his right for pension because "I don't go and collect from my father[land]. "</span> <span id="s100">That was the attitude.</span> <span id="s101">An idiot, of course.</span> <span id="s102">(Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick.</span> <span id="s103">He had TB, open TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a veteran's hospital.</span> <span id="s104">And his pension was restored, but on a level about 50% disability.</span> <span id="s105">But he was really 250% disabled, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">So he spent uh half a year in the hospital; was operated several times, of course, to no avail.</span> <span id="s107">But the acute conditions were removed.</span> <span id="s108">My mother and my sister and I, we lived in apartment which cost as about 80% of our income.</span> <span id="s109">And when we came to Berlin, people didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s110">They thought we were criminals.</span> <span id="s111">Kicked out from Poland for not paying taxes, or stealing something, and so forth.</span> <span id="s112">I mean, the Germans to me were completely insensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Why did they think that you were criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: They thought I had a Polish accent.</span> <span id="s115">That is enough.</span> <span id="s116">You know, (laughing) people have funny notions.</span> <span id="s117">If you are Hungarian, you are necessarily a Gypsy or violin player.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Hungarians can play violins very well.</span> <span id="s119">Most, I guess, don't play violins.</span> <span id="s120">But being of Polish, being...having this title "Polak"...And I, as a child going into Berlin school, was treated as a Polak.</span> <span id="s121">My German was really quite good, but not perfect.</span> <span id="s122">I had a Polish accent and also uh didn't have the wealth of words to describe things in German.</span> <span id="s123">So when this happened, I sit down and really learned German.</span> <span id="s124">And actually better than most Germans.</span> <span id="s125">I really speak even today better German than most Germans.</span> <span id="s126">Definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Tell me about your school.</span> <span id="s128">You brought some photographs with you.</span> <span id="s129">Tell me about the birth certificate you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s131">Here is my Polish birth certificate.</span> <span id="s132">This is a major obstacle in my whole life.</span> <span id="s133">When people ask me, "What are you?"</span> <span id="s134">I say "Polish. "</span> <span id="s135">They say, "No, your German gives you away.</span> <span id="s136">You are German. "</span> <span id="s137">And, of course, here in America I am now American citizen.</span> <span id="s138">Often people say, "But you have an accent. "</span> <span id="s139">Then I say, "Yes, I was born Polish. "</span> <span id="s140">And they say, "No, you have a German accent. "</span> <span id="s141">I say, "Unfortunately, I suffered from being born in Poland.</span> <span id="s142">Because I had to immigrate here.</span> <span id="s143">The quota was full, and no entry for me in this country.</span> <span id="s144">For long years, you know, I. .</span> <span id="s145">So you get hit, no matter what you are.</span> <span id="s146">If you are different, you get it.</span> <span id="s147">And I learned that in Poland, even when I was born, the kids came and met this...It was not meant in a bad way, (cough) it was just the type of reaction they had when they saw something who was different from them.</span> <span id="s148">And it's everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: You have other things as well.</span> <span id="s150">What is that you have now?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: This is actually my German maturation diploma, which entitles me to go to university.</span> <span id="s152">Q: You want water?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s154">So this took also some doing, you know.</span> <span id="s155">I had avoided joining Nazi Youth Organization and so forth.</span> <span id="s156">I had a terrible time to fake myself through to be admitted here and so forth.</span> <span id="s157">Of course, I had a very good Jewish doctor who gave me attestations I was the sickest kid on the block.</span> <span id="s158">So they got easy on me, you know.</span> <span id="s159">And uh besides, legal speaking, my age was a little bit too advanced to force me in it.</span> <span id="s160">The law actually uh spared those born before 1924.</span> <span id="s161">So I was born '22, and didn't encounter much trouble.</span> <span id="s162">But the authorities, when I applied going to...to--let's say, college--would call, they said, "You are not member of any Nazional Socialistice (ph) organization, you know.</span> <span id="s163">Only we...are only interested in people who become leaders here. "</span> <span id="s164">(Laughter) I said, "I am not very much interested being a leader, anyway. "</span> <span id="s165">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Show me what else.</span> <span id="s167">You have some photographs of you growing up.</span> <span id="s168">Now these would be in Poland as a young child?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s170">Here, that's the height of my career!</span> <span id="s171">(Laughter) I always tried to climb up that tree.</span> <span id="s172">(Laughing) And finally, my father helped me and took a picture.</span> <span id="s173">I was 2-1/2 years old.</span> <span id="s174">So this was taken in 1924.</span> <span id="s175">This was my highest point in my career.</span> <span id="s176">I was really proud of it.</span> <span id="s177">You can see the branches all debogged because I always tried again and again to climb up.</span> <span id="s178">You see, I'm restless.</span> <span id="s179">I am a go-getter.</span> <span id="s180">(Laughing) Actually to maybe familiarize you, my father immigrated, not immigrated, this area was German under the Kaiserreich and the were interested in getting Germans in that because they wanted to, uh, discourage Poles to live there.</span> <span id="s181">So people wanted to expand, get a new business.</span> <span id="s182">My uncle had done so.</span> <span id="s183">He was from Essen in West Germany.</span> <span id="s184">And my father went to Poland--or at that time it was Germany--to beat...to learn the trade of sales representative in my uncle's firm.</span> <span id="s185">So, where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">My father was the 24th child, by the way.</span> <span id="s188">The woman had two husbands.</span> <span id="s189">Of course, in succession, not at the same time.</span> <span id="s190">Although one could think...But there was no child after him.</span> <span id="s191">That was the end of the line.</span> <span id="s192">(Laughing) But the house where my family comes from was built in 1210, and is still standing--miraculously--in Eisenberg or Poleberg (ph).</span> <span id="s193">And I have just met people from Eisenach, and they say, "Oh, my uncle is a neighbor of the Knüemann family, and they lived next to this house. "</span> <span id="s194">Was taken by my father, I think, in 1923 or so.</span> <span id="s195">And these are my grandparents sitting in front.</span> <span id="s196">My grandfather was uh miner.</span> <span id="s197">There were these many children.</span> <span id="s198">One could only operate the farm, so the others naturally went into the...under...into the mines.</span> <span id="s199">My grandfather worked there 73 years.</span> <span id="s200">And on the day of his retirement, he collapsed and was dead.</span> <span id="s201">Real great thing to have a pension waiting for you.</span> <span id="s202">(Laughing) And they kept it all, you know.</span> <span id="s203">And another distinction my family had, my father was a veteran in the first World War.</span> <span id="s204">Lung shrapnel hit him.</span> <span id="s205">My grandfather--a veteran of 1971--the same...the same uh (laughing) injury in the Prussian front.</span> <span id="s206">The French were...My grandfather, the same injury.</span> <span id="s207">In the war with Prussia/Austria.</span> <span id="s208">So same...almost the identical.</span> <span id="s209">I am first one without an injury.</span> <span id="s210">I think I learned a lesson from the past, you know.</span> <span id="s211">My father said, "If you go into this war, and you get injured, you come home I beat you up like you never have been. "</span> <span id="s212">(Laughing) First thing was, of course, he didn't want his son to stand for this Hitler.</span> <span id="s213">He considered Hitler simple gangster.</span> <span id="s214">Nothing else, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">He took everything and gave nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Tell me about...Tell me...You have one more picture there I want to show, about a school woman.</span> <span id="s217">And I would like you to talk about your father.</span> <span id="s218">Yeah, that one.</span> <span id="s219">Tell me about that and the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">1 NB: 1871.</span> <span id="s221">This would have been during the Franco-Prussian War.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">2 1866.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: This is...my schooling started in a gymnasium.</span> <span id="s224">I think this was a second year in the school.</span> <span id="s225">It was a normal...</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: In Berlin.</span> <span id="s228">Was a normal school.</span> <span id="s229">Was still.</span> <span id="s230">.</span> <span id="s231">it was 1934 when I entered this.</span> <span id="s232">I was a little late.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">I was a year older, or two years older, than the rest of my...Because of my transfer from Poland, I had only Polish as a foreign language.</span> <span id="s234">And not French or Latin, or so.</span> <span id="s235">So I had to go back.</span> <span id="s236">Also, my German was not that great.</span> <span id="s237">(Pause) They found.</span> <span id="s238">And uh so this teacher was a Doctor [Dunmeyer (ph)].</span> <span id="s239">A very strange occurrence.</span> <span id="s240">He was a hunchback.</span> <span id="s241">And, of course, like anyone in Germany who was considered a weakling of normal--hunchback, cross-eyed, flat feet--that was an unwanted citizen.</span> <span id="s242">And this man, because of his...I think, of his constants endurance of being looked at as a defective person was (sobbing) enormously kind.</span> <span id="s243">A person who... (sobbing)</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Take a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: ...you could only love.</span> <span id="s246">And then this broken system came in, and this man was almost destroyed.</span> <span id="s247">You could feel it, that he was not Jewish or anything.</span> <span id="s248">But he knew me--as being what I am, I presented a target for these gangsters who came in.</span> <span id="s249">I was defective.</span> <span id="s250">Well, just before this picture was taken, maybe a day or two before, our room was decorated with romantic scenes of landscape and quieting pictures.</span> <span id="s251">In the middle of class, suddenly two workmen come in with a great stack of pictures.</span> <span id="s252">And you can see these pictures here.</span> <span id="s253">They represent German warships, tanks, military pictures.</span> <span id="s254">(Laughter) We knew at that time romanticism was over.</span> <span id="s255">We were supposed to sit in a semi-military environment, and pay attention to the great designs of our Führer.</span> <span id="s256">Nobody said anything, but (laughing) what else was this, you know?</span> <span id="s257">You could look out of the window, and maybe there was no swastika flag; but you could look in your room, classroom.</span> <span id="s258">Students often sleep; and when you open your eye it is quieting to see tree, a landscape, you know, pastoral scene.</span> <span id="s259">Now you open the window, what did you see?</span> <span id="s260">(Laughing) War in progress.</span> <span id="s261">What a change!</span> <span id="s262">(Laughing) You didn't have to be very intelligent to notice.</span> <span id="s263">So here is another class picture.</span> <span id="s264">That was probably three years later.</span> <span id="s265">Oh, it was April '38, we...I can be seen here.</span> <span id="s266">I was on the outside to begin with.</span> <span id="s267">I always (laughing) had my escape route secure automatically.</span> <span id="s268">But here my three other friends--we were a clique of four.</span> <span id="s269">We didn't belong.</span> <span id="s270">We all four didn't belong to the youth movement, and so forth.</span> <span id="s271">And uh there are some prominent people here, who actually this man was a most intelligent man I ever met.</span> <span id="s272">He had the first name "Carl Heinz," like I have, but he...you know, difficult task he finished in 10 minutes.</span> <span id="s273">We sit there three hours and couldn't solve it.</span> <span id="s274">His name Witzberger, of course, made him suspect to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s275">And he...like Germans, they know exactly who is a Jew and who is not, you know--like Americans, they know what a Negro is and not.</span> <span id="s276">I mean, know people have their preoccupation in identifying people.</span> <span id="s277">Like this man--he [was a] young man--he was a genius, really.</span> <span id="s278">And he became later, after the war, the President of the East Berlin University.</span> <span id="s279">And actually he headed the Department of Americanism...American studies, you know.</span> <span id="s280">Even the communist people I know, East German government people, the record of this man was unquestioned qualified as nobody else.</span> <span id="s281">There was not even an idea of their head to take a communist and plug him in.</span> <span id="s282">Witzberger was their man.</span> <span id="s283">I heard some speeches of his over a shortwave radio.</span> <span id="s284">Of course, he catered to the communist view; but as such, he was fantastic man.</span> <span id="s285">The other man here is my friend--who's now, so to speak, the Cary Grant of Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">And he has a very peculiar situation.</span> <span id="s287">I was at a draft board with him during the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s288">We all tried... at that time, we wanted to be drafted actually; because we could have uh avoided taking the examination to get the diploma.</span> <span id="s289">We would have been given this for free.</span> <span id="s290">You see, going through the rigorous study...I mean, even becoming a Nazi soldier was not such a bad thing, you know.</span> <span id="s291">It...I hadn't studied anything.</span> <span id="s292">I started (laughing) four weeks before.</span> <span id="s293">But I had two subjects, geography and biology, [in which] I was tops all through my school years.</span> <span id="s294">So I..</span> <span id="s295">.</span> <span id="s296">English was a very hard subject.</span> <span id="s297">Latin...Because of my political interest, I did less and less for school but more and more for other things, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Tell me about your biology teacher.</span> <span id="s299">You .... .</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yah, this was our class teacher actually.</span> <span id="s301">Classroom teacher, and here he is in full uniform.</span> <span id="s302">Now this looks pretty fierce, but he was really not.</span> <span id="s303">He was really a very kind and educated man.</span> <span id="s304">Even some people had ideas he was probably looking out for little boys, because he had assistant which stayed with him in the back.</span> <span id="s305">And, of course, being out of view, you can always say he does this or that.</span> <span id="s306">Germans have a wonderful sense of unfairness.</span> <span id="s307">When they suspect, it's already fact.</span> <span id="s308">So this man was dedicated teacher, very good in his uh...I mean, very rigid schedule of instruction.</span> <span id="s309">We had to repeat, had to draw keyper logs and so.</span> <span id="s310">For me, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s311">I was A-1 graded.</span> <span id="s312">I didn't actually particular...I mean, I was not attached to this man.</span> <span id="s313">He was fair and harsh, you know; but fairness is almost can he everything.</span> <span id="s314">I mean, my favorite teacher was Dr. Hatcher, my mathematics teacher.</span> <span id="s315">And, of course, '36 or so he disappeared.</span> <span id="s316">He was Jewish; and quietly uh one day didn't come.</span> <span id="s317">Fortunately, he had a chance to come here.</span> <span id="s318">I'm not...I am still not quite sure where Dr. Hatcher is.</span> <span id="s319">Not the famous Dr. Hatcher.</span> <span id="s320">I mean, it could be.</span> <span id="s321">I mean, this man was a genius in his field.</span> <span id="s322">And as a educator, I have never seen something like that again.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Talk now about your family, particularly about your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s325">My father was, of course, very sick.</span> <span id="s326">And uh his friends were...we had a very close relations with one family.</span> <span id="s327">It was a professor of pharmacology in Berlin, Professor Wolfgang [Heumer (ph)] and his wife.</span> <span id="s328">They were known anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s329">My father knew very influential persons, in the military, in politics.</span> <span id="s330">For instance, later President Heuss, my father...The main plotter against Hitler way back in already 1933, was the really mayor of Leipzig, Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Goerdeler.</span> <span id="s332">He was the organizer of the rebellion against Hitler.</span> <span id="s333">And my father, being in 3 Carl Friedrich Goerdeler conspired with Johannes Popitz and Ludwig Beck to oppose Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">politics, he was in the supervisory commission on the Versailles Treaty.</span> <span id="s335">The people of Western Poland had the option to vote whether they want to be Polish or German.</span> <span id="s336">And there was a German ?</span> <span id="s337">, they stayed at our house.</span> <span id="s338">One man was Dr. Goerdeler--the main conspirator at the 20th of July; and Theodor Heuss, later President of the West German Republic.</span> <span id="s339">Actually, the German currency was so much devalued, this gentlemen had no money.</span> <span id="s340">They stayed at my family's house just living on what ever they got from ...People also felt sorry for him, you know.</span> <span id="s341">He had been in World War I a pilot; and to some degree, people attached some romantic ideas with this.</span> <span id="s342">It was the early pilot yet, got his pilot license in 1908.</span> <span id="s343">It was issued on a bicycle permit because (laughing) there was no form for pilot license.</span> <span id="s344">Actually, it came his...We had this later.</span> <span id="s345">My father had his old factory; and a neighbor of his was a hobby pilot and builder of aircraft out of broom sticks, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">And he urged my father get into the flying business.</span> <span id="s347">My father did.</span> <span id="s348">Got his license; and when the war started, he volunteered as a pilot in the army.</span> <span id="s349">I mean, there was no air force or anything like here, you know.</span> <span id="s350">And this is a very significant point, because he had to be trained to be a soldier by his sergeant, you know.</span> <span id="s351">He had to learn how to walk, how to turn right, how to turn left, how to obey commanders, and so on.</span> <span id="s352">So this was a man with a heroic name.</span> <span id="s353">His name was "Coward," actually Feige which means coward in English [NB: German], you know.</span> <span id="s354">But Feige is a very bad name for a military man.</span> <span id="s355">But this guy was strict.</span> <span id="s356">He had a hair cut like me--no hair--and very determined, you know.</span> <span id="s357">So this...uh...My father--like I, like my mother...I don't know, we are naturals at making contact.</span> <span id="s358">I mean, I can...I walk here over the street and in one block I make 5 new acquaintances, usually nice ones.</span> <span id="s359">(Laughing) I don't know what it takes.</span> <span id="s360">I personally feel I am entitled, and I should talk to everyone who doesn't want or wants to talk to me.</span> <span id="s361">I talk to everyone--from President Bush, Carter, and so on down to uh Mrs. Thatcher.</span> <span id="s362">Uh (laughing) and, you know, I always have something to say; something new, you know, because I know everything.</span> <span id="s363">So I knew everything in Germany, because my father was collecting what is going on in politics and so on.</span> <span id="s364">So soon groups formed a civilian, actually.</span> <span id="s365">They were businessmen and suddenly they didn't like Hitler.</span> <span id="s366">Because there was no business with Hitler, you know.</span> <span id="s367">It was only Hitler business; and all the others had to do exactly like the Führer wanted it.</span> <span id="s368">This brought money into the scene.</span> <span id="s369">And, of course, any plot needs a lot of money.</span> <span id="s370">And my father was instrumental to...Since he was unemployed, he was not wanted to be working.</span> <span id="s371">So he had a wonderful job doing the plotting against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Talk...elaborate on that.</span> <span id="s373">How did he get involved?</span> <span id="s374">How did he work with Dr. Goerdeler, who is a very important figure?</span> <span id="s375">Talk about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: You know, of course, one thing, once we came to Berlin we knew exactly there is a big problem coming up with Jewish populations.</span> <span id="s377">We...I mean, Professor [Heumner (ph)] was a friend of Einstein.</span> <span id="s378">I even had to shake Einstein the hand, I didn't know it was that jerk was.</span> <span id="s379">I mean, as a little boy I thought avoid people as much as you can.</span> <span id="s380">I was so shy, you know.</span> <span id="s381">No, 4 Elected September 12, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">they say, "Boobie"--that was my nickname, Boobie--you know, and my mother calls me that to...to my greatest displeasure.</span> <span id="s383">And (laughing) I go in, shake hands with the professor.</span> <span id="s384">There were four professors, Hoimner, Einstein, I think Dr. Lindler or so, uh, biochemist.</span> <span id="s385">And, I mean, they were all in the medical special fields.</span> <span id="s386">(Laughter) I went stumbling.</span> <span id="s387">I knew there was somebody famous, you know.</span> <span id="s388">With the others, I got easier off; but I got a red head, just disappeared to the woodwork, not to be ever seen that day, you know.</span> <span id="s389">I had enough.</span> <span id="s390">Besides, there was no piece of chocolate or anything, as was usual.</span> <span id="s391">Of course, Professors, they always take...they sit there.</span> <span id="s392">Even I think (laughing) Einstein didn't carry chocolate in his pockets.</span> <span id="s393">I didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s394">But I don't remember anything really.</span> <span id="s395">So (laughing) he doesn't remember either.</span> <span id="s396">He never remember nothing.</span> <span id="s397">But I wasn't cross.</span> <span id="s398">This type of people suddenly became endangered species.</span> <span id="s399">And [Heumner (ph)]'s assistant for influence, Dr. Levy, and [Heumner (ph)] had gotten...[Heumner (ph)] was known as being an anti-Nazi and here Minnesota University, they had invited him to come here and teach, and he had considered it, but he talked to his assistant, Dr. Levy, and said, "Look, you go. "</span> <span id="s400">[Heumner (ph)] suspected correctly that this would end in this Holocaust, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s401">You know, he was privy to government deliberations, you know, being sort of a FDA director.</span> <span id="s402">Because of this pharmaceutical institute in Berlin was acting as a screening agent for the government, to approve medication and so on.</span> <span id="s403">He knew when, you know, was great resentment maybe finally agree to immigrate to United States which saved his life, you know.</span> <span id="s404">It didn't make...[Heumner (ph)] survived all this.</span> <span id="s405">He was one of the first German scientist, he attended the International Pharmaceuticological Congress in Paris in 1935.</span> <span id="s406">He was instructed to greet the audience with "Heil Hitler," which he didn't do.</span> <span id="s407">(Laughter) But furthermore, he even said, "Colleagues, I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s408">I come from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">From the research which I have reviewed in the last two years, I have to conclude that these tests are actually performed on living human beings. "</span> <span id="s410">He thought he would turn the world over.</span> <span id="s411">Like it is in conventions, nobody listens to these damn, lousy, boring papers.</span> <span id="s412">So this announcement was just completely disregarded.</span> <span id="s413">Nobody paid any attention.</span> <span id="s414">The Nazis did, of course.</span> <span id="s415">But seeing that it was not heard, just disregarded.</span> <span id="s416">They were smart.</span> <span id="s417">They didn't do anything to [Heumner (ph)].</span> <span id="s418">First, he was very famous.</span> <span id="s419">And punishing him, which would have been automatic for anyone else--they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s420">Not only this, they bestowed on him an honorary golden party membership--which [Heumner (ph)] refused, but he had to take it.</span> <span id="s421">I mean, they just put it on his table and said, "Take it or leave it.</span> <span id="s422">You are a party member.</span> <span id="s423">Golden party.

and I knew exactly that was the man.</span> <span id="s1011">You know that, nothing like in Hollywood film, code words, you know you forget code words by the way.</span> <span id="s1012">That is a very great danger.</span> <span id="s1013">You know, you have other things to worry about and, uh, now the code word.</span> <span id="s1014">You are shot before you remember.</span> <span id="s1015">But here it was just that you recognize this man at least wanted to have a life style which was yours.</span> <span id="s1016">That you knew that yours and his were non-Nazi so that was all it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">You could talk to these people at once without identification and so I went, after hours, to the canteen and look my desire is to do anything to damage the Nazi factory.</span> <span id="s1018">Finally, I think I would like to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1019">No problem, you know.</span> <span id="s1020">I told him that I had connections in Berlin for weapons.</span> <span id="s1021">I mean I could buy machine guns, anything.</span> <span id="s1022">Like here, it's forbidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">But actually Nazis were not that crazy.</span> <span id="s1024">They...I mean you could have weapons, you know.</span> <span id="s1025">My father had hunting weapons, I mean, very dangerous ones, you know.</span> <span id="s1026">And, uh, since there were warriors and robbers anyhow, the old government, they didn't take it so seriously.</span> <span id="s1027">Besides, the Nazis really thought that they controlled everything.</span> <span id="s1028">They had no...they didn't even have a suspicion that there was a segment of the population really going after them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">They didn't know this.</span> <span id="s1030">I mean there was the West that they contributed...you see that they were the victims of their own philosophy.</span> <span id="s1031">They thought Jews were the typical resistance.</span> <span id="s1032">There was...actually for a Jew, it was very, very difficult to be a fighter because people, officials...you looked Jews, Jewish.</span> <span id="s1033">I don't know some Jews I know looked more, they looked more like Siegrfied, you know.</span> <span id="s1034">But they looked for that type you know.</span> <span id="s1035">I mean everywhere.</span> <span id="s1036">In all countries.</span> <span id="s1037">If they were gypsies, a chicken is stoled, and a gypsy was there a week ago, he did it.</span> <span id="s1038">There was always a minority which can be easily recognized.</span> <span id="s1039">Round up the usual suspect.</span> <span id="s1040">Like in the Casablanca film, you know.</span> <span id="s1041">If they didn't find any of them, it was, uh, Jews do it any how.</span> <span id="s1042">But in this case here, these Frenchmen, the ethic French men, they were not trusted.</span> <span id="s1043">But they were sent for occupation duty in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1044">The Poles were not trusted.</span> <span id="s1045">They were sent for occupation duty in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1046">So, there was need for weapons and I had the military pass.</span> <span id="s1047">My father (laugh) conveniently got sick.</span> <span id="s1048">I went to Berlin and bought two big suitcases full of pistols.</span> <span id="s1049">And I repeated it several times.</span> <span id="s1050">I..</span> <span id="s1051">.</span> <span id="s1052">you see at that time, the Nazis collected weapons from civilians, mostly weapons man had brought back as souveniers from war crimes.</span> <span id="s1053">And these women were impressed if they would be caught by, for instance, if Russians, if they ever would come, they would be of course raped 15 times, mangled, (laugh) and all that.</span> <span id="s1054">And these Nazi officials stood there and took the weapons in, you know, and I stood outside the collection point.</span> <span id="s1055">I know even the place, it was Horst Wessel Platz.</span> <span id="s1056">It was actually former headquarter of the communist party in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1057">It had been turned into the Nazi office building and downstairs, they had the collection agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">And I stood in front of this, in my uniform, of course.</span> <span id="s1059">I said, "I come right from the front.</span> <span id="s1060">You know what we need.</span> <span id="s1061">We need more weapons.</span> <span id="s1062">You know the German army is not providing us with pistol, you know.</span> <span id="s1063">When the enemy comes running up to you, you cannot use your rifle.</span> <span id="s1064">I give you five dollars. "</span> <span id="s1065">(laugh) In 30 minutes, I had 2 big suitcases.</span> <span id="s1066">I couldn't even carry it, but I was soldier, I was, of course, a front soldier in Denmark, eating whip cream by the gallon and so I delivered.</span> <span id="s1067">That French man, he just gobbled it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Actually, these Frenchmen had full uniforms already for the loss of the war and at once established a French army unit in Denmark, out of the German army.</span> <span id="s1069">And, of course, he had the connection with the Danish Army, and so...I went to Berlin 3 times, did this and always with the Wehrmacht train, the military train.</span> <span id="s1070">It was never controlled.</span> <span id="s1071">You could actually take anything you wanted.</span> <span id="s1072">And the Danes were happy.</span> <span id="s1073">I was happy.</span> <span id="s1074">I brought butter to Berlin and so forth you know.</span> <span id="s1075">And so I was never afraid really.</span> <span id="s1076">It was...if you know, if you do it for the right cause, nothing stops you.</span> <span id="s1077">And whenever it comes, the threat of this thing and you have your right cause, do it.</span> <span id="s1078">Don't talk.</span> <span id="s1079">Do it.</span> <span id="s1080">You know, it's.</span> <span id="s1081">.</span> <span id="s1082">nothing is better than doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Trying to abolish it.</span> <span id="s1084">Even if this is go yet.</span> <span id="s1085">You just throw the stone where it hurts.</span> <span id="s1086">And you know yourself you never can, uh, uh, let this guy fall down.</span> <span id="s1087">But you might hit where it hurts, and you are finally getting through with your message.</span> <span id="s1088">So not that much difficulty.</span> <span id="s1089">You see...I think human beings are too civilized.</span> <span id="s1090">I think maybe, in part, Israel is a good example.</span> <span id="s1091">They do it, against all odds.</span> <span id="s1092">It's the only country which does it, I mean in my opinion.</span> <span id="s1093">But I think anyone can do it if he just wants it.</span> <span id="s1094">If he sees the danger which is directly against him, what he is running into.</span> <span id="s1095">Don't run into it.</span> <span id="s1096">Abolish this danger.</span> <span id="s1097">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: What else did you do besides run guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: No, of course, I first provided the full secret Morse codes to the other side.</span> <span id="s1100">And I ran it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Actually we had our headquarters above the German headquarters in Aalborg.</span> <span id="s1102">We used the German antenna.</span> <span id="s1103">That way we couldn't be detected.</span> <span id="s1104">We attached our wires on that and, you know, that was it.</span> <span id="s1105">They came, they circled around, found a signal but it was there own...their own antenna.</span> <span id="s1106">So that one of them.</span> <span id="s1107">Finally, uh, uh, on the last trip I came back and my company was dissolved.</span> <span id="s1108">So I had no organization to turn to and that was, of course, dangerous, uh, you know.</span> <span id="s1109">And, uh, there was a way out.</span> <span id="s1110">I figured it out.</span> <span id="s1111">There was a central reporting point for the soldiers who had lost their unit and that was, you know, the Nazi system contrary to belief here was completely disorganized, at least in my eyes.</span> <span id="s1112">It had so many weak points.</span> <span id="s1113">You imagined there was no computer yet.</span> <span id="s1114">The transfer of a name was so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">.</span> <span id="s1116">just impossible in a speedy fashion.</span> <span id="s1117">Today, it's a one button, and the computer spues out whatever you want.</span> <span id="s1118">It was a very big problem, but the other problem, they over organized.</span> <span id="s1119">So many things were illegal.</span> <span id="s1120">I mean more than legal.</span> <span id="s1121">Everything was illegal to keep track what violation had happened, what people, uh, were involved was almost impossible to manage.</span> <span id="s1122">I mean, to get somebody, it's difficult everywhere.</span> <span id="s1123">Let's say you search for a criminal, but you are not getting your hands on this man that speedily.</span> <span id="s1124">Now you do, but then it was really very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1125">To be a Jew, that was a different...people had a model in front of them.</span> <span id="s1126">It was a dark hair...certain features people thought was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1127">My brother-in- law is Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1128">He looks like 14 Jews.</span> <span id="s1129">I mean, it happened, during his stay in Berlin, he was accosted by people not to wear the Jewish Star, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Move up a little to June 1944.</span> <span id="s1131">You said that your father was involved in a plot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: My father had become so sick, he was not more involved.</span> <span id="s1133">His T. B..</span> <span id="s1134">.</span> <span id="s1135">actually we had relatives in Poland.</span> <span id="s1136">.</span> <span id="s1137">and he had rented relatives...</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Talk a little louder please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: We had relatives...my uncle from my mother's side, they lived there.</span> <span id="s1140">Actually, my uncle was Polish officer.</span> <span id="s1141">And, uh, because of the air raids in Berlin, his being there was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s1142">And also the food shortage and so on.</span> <span id="s1143">So he had rented from friends or relatives a little house with a garden.</span> <span id="s1144">He lived there.</span> <span id="s1145">But, of course, he knew all what was going on, you know, and actually we had two contacts.</span> <span id="s1146">I mean it was Goerdeler and the initial plot never came off.</span> <span id="s1147">Actually, the plotters were doing this since really 34 and, uh, uh, they never could get agreement from the generals because weapons are needed for a thing like this.</span> <span id="s1148">And they objected, they had given the oath of office on Hitler and so forth and besides, don't kid yourself, they never make a plot successful.</span> <span id="s1149">(laugh) Through German history, these Germans are outspoken cowards.</span> <span id="s1150">You know they are only form...not some...nothing in them.</span> <span id="s1151">They are actually removed from the people, you know.</span> <span id="s1152">It's not a people's army in Germany.</span> <span id="s1153">It's the king's army or the Führer's army, and that was the biggest problem.</span> <span id="s1154">And it seemed that this whole thing would never go off.</span> <span id="s1155">So my father was at that point not in it.</span> <span id="s1156">But the...what really brought it off...and that was Johannes Popitz, the Prussian Finance Minister.</span> <span id="s1157">He was head of a sort of semi-conservative people's party before Hitler, and Hitler tried to 5 From 1925-1929.</span> <span id="s1158">Previously advisor to Prussian Interior Ministry, 1914-1919.</span> <span id="s1159">Known as a tax expert, his skills were utilized by the Nazis, although he never joined the party.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">give some unimportant government offices to non-Nazis.</span> <span id="s1161">At least, for the first time.</span> <span id="s1162">And he was in the state government, in the State of Prussia--which was reduced to non-functioning, really.</span> <span id="s1163">He left this government alive, but they had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s1164">Popitz found plenty of time to conspire.</span> <span id="s1165">The best thing was, you know, Mrs. Popitz was a Dutch born lady.</span> <span id="s1166">And you know who caught a fancy on her?</span> <span id="s1167">Heinrich Himmler!</span> <span id="s1168">She looked like a real Dutch.</span> <span id="s1169">You know, not the most French-like; she looked a little bit more like a milk cow.</span> <span id="s1170">She was blonde.</span> <span id="s1171">I mean, a wonderful personality; but Himmler was really interested in her feature, not in personality.</span> <span id="s1172">And Himmler courted this lady day and night.</span> <span id="s1173">Sent her big boxes, silver boxes, with inscriptions and so forth.</span> <span id="s1174">That last until '36 and she died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1175">Himmler was heartbroke.</span> <span id="s1176">And he called the daughter whom I knew--and I knew the other son, Hans Popitz--and he showered this family with attention.</span> <span id="s1177">And, of course, Popitz didn't like this at all.</span> <span id="s1178">But you can't say no to Himmler, actually, if you want to live.</span> <span id="s1179">So they accepted the...I later sold it on the black market, these (laughing) silver boxes, to raise cash for the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">But they...Himmler still kept an eye on this family.</span> <span id="s1181">And also the daughter, you know.</span> <span id="s1182">She got gifts, too.</span> <span id="s1183">And so on.</span> <span id="s1184">But Popitz--who was the greatest conspirator, you know--he had put this group together and so on.</span> <span id="s1185">And there were almost attempts.</span> <span id="s1186">And uh in '44, Popitz got a call from his old friend, Himmler.</span> <span id="s1187">He said, "Johannes, we know everything.</span> <span id="s1188">We know what you are doing.</span> <span id="s1189">Don't think that you can operate here without me knowing.</span> <span id="s1190">But you know what that means: that you and all your conspirators are done with. "</span> <span id="s1191">You know, Himmler was the first defector from the Nazi group.</span> <span id="s1192">And this is not known.</span> <span id="s1193">I know it from personal knowledge.</span> <span id="s1194">Himmler proposed to Popitz that he would tolerate the plot.</span> <span id="s1195">That if successful, the plotters would actually guarantee Himmler and whatever entourage he wanted free exit from German into a neutral country; and that he would support any attempt of Hitler's life, as long as it successful.</span> <span id="s1196">If it is not successful, of course, he will abdicate any responsible.</span> <span id="s1197">And will kill everybody at once out of necessity, of course.</span> <span id="s1198">Because if investigation would have prove that Himmler knew.</span> <span id="s1199">But, you know, Himmler knew that Germany was cooked.</span> <span id="s1200">I mean, no one else knew it much better than him.</span> <span id="s1201">He knew the war is finished, over with.</span> <span id="s1202">He knew that he is the major criminal in this game, and his only chance to survive was making a deal.</span> <span id="s1203">And Popitz met seven times personally with Himmler.</span> <span id="s1204">I know it from Popitz's daughter.</span> <span id="s1205">She was even involved, too, you know.</span> <span id="s1206">It's an awful scheme.</span> <span id="s1207">And very dangerous, of course, for Popitz.</span> <span id="s1208">Now they agreed on this; and that actually persuaded the military to come in.</span> <span id="s1209">The chance that they...You see, Popitz worked on this like an eager beaver, you know.</span> <span id="s1210">He was a very honest human man--small, low voiced, nothing.</span> <span id="s1211">Goebbels's wrote in his diary that actually vindicated any... any accusation against Popitz.</span> <span id="s1212">Goebbels wrote, "And this dog Hans Popitz does nothing else but conspiring against us. "</span> <span id="s1213">Goebbels wrote this in '43.</span> <span id="s1214">If this diary was found, you can read it.</span> <span id="s1215">So they went ahead and failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Because the military didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1217">They are not courageous enough.</span> <span id="s1218">(Laughter) And I know Stauffenberg, and so on; and they don't know how it happened.</span> <span id="s1219">It happened--in my opinion, of course--they were just not brutal enough.</span> <span id="s1220">I mean, the French Revolution never happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1221">I mean, Germans do it...if they kill people, they cut their heads off.</span> <span id="s1222">If it was all sealed, official stamp of approval--like the killing of the Jewish and so--this was all legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">You know, there were laws permitting it.</span> <span id="s1224">So they did it.</span> <span id="s1225">But do it on your own and resist, you never get a German to do it.</span> <span id="s1226">They are like German shepherds.</span> <span id="s1227">Only they bite on command, and they are puppies if they are not told to bite.</span> <span id="s1228">But unfortunately, if an outsider comes and bite, they bite you.</span> <span id="s1229">I have been bitten by a German shepherd, and a six year old.</span> <span id="s1230">And I never forget it.</span> <span id="s1231">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: We are going to hold it and we are going to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Okay, let's go back.</span> <span id="s1235">You were telling me about your mother and friends and Himmler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1237">Strange relationship.</span> <span id="s1238">My mother was, of course, sort of an angel really.</span> <span id="s1239">She helped everybody.</span> <span id="s1240">Now when it came to our attention or people came to us or to our friends, they needed immediate help.</span> <span id="s1241">Something had to be done.</span> <span id="s1242">A visa had to be gotten to exit Germany or somebody was in the KZ and maybe a case could be made to release them again.</span> <span id="s1243">And there comes in my father's career as a pilot.</span> <span id="s1244">As I said before, he was assigned a sergeant who trained him to become a soldier, and, uh, this man was just a sergeant, a professional soldier, and when we moved from Poland to Berlin, he worked and had risen to a pretty prominent position as a civil servant in the Veterans Administration.</span> <span id="s1245">But my father needed to have his pension restored, so this man helped him, but this man had turned into a raving Nazi.</span> <span id="s1246">But because as a old comrade so he overlooked the anti-Nazi attitudes of my father, and rehelped him getting his pension and so on.</span> <span id="s1247">They met once.</span> <span id="s1248">.</span> <span id="s1249">and then my father discovered that he had married a wife who was born in the hometown of Mrs. Himmler's wife.</span> <span id="s1250">And somehow, this man's name, this Veteran's Administration official, had the heroic name Feige which means in English coward.</span> <span id="s1251">(laugh) This was really a laugh, but as they...He had indicated he wanted to meet with my parents and so on to do the right thing...became sort of acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1252">I think my parents were there socially once.</span> <span id="s1253">And they never came and visited us.</span> <span id="s1254">But Feige had moved from the Veterans Administration once Hitler came in and had become Goebbels assistant.</span> <span id="s1255">Of course, it helped to know Mrs. Himmler, that was for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">And, he.</span> <span id="s1257">.</span> <span id="s1258">he is also listed in the government publications as being Goebbels Ministerialrat, one of them.</span> <span id="s1259">But he had influence.</span> <span id="s1260">But we saw also a possibility to influence Himmler, because Mrs. Feige or this coward's wife, she being the school mate of Mrs. Himmler met with her once a week and both ladies played Bach on a harmonia, on a miserable harmonia, in Feige's household.</span> <span id="s1261">And this too...I mean non-political people, they didn't care about one thing or the other...only Bach.</span> <span id="s1262">So Bach was right.</span> <span id="s1263">And they played for 2, 3 hours on the harmonia, and departed but, of course, like some women do they chat a lot and all this, so we could see that there was a possibility to influence Himmler and when we got really...and I mean we, that means my mother, of course...got cases where nothing would have.</span> <span id="s1264">My mother called Mrs. Feige, and said, "I have here a terrible case, you know, once a personal acquaintance of friends of mine.</span> <span id="s1265">Although we know these are difficult times and so on, what can we do?</span> <span id="s1266">Can you tell Mrs. Feige his name is so and so and so and so.</span> <span id="s1267">(laugh) Can you do something.</span> <span id="s1268">Tell Mrs. Feige.</span> <span id="s1269">She can tell her husband.</span> <span id="s1270">We guarantee you this is completely justified and so on.</span> <span id="s1271">In most cases, this worked.</span> <span id="s1272">I mean these were not really prominent cases, but say this, but prominent people, let's say economics was enough to get killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1273">In their book it was a crime of major proportions.</span> <span id="s1274">But Himmler wanted to keep up apparently his image like a normal man also.</span> <span id="s1275">And, of course, his wife probably had a lot to do with this.</span> <span id="s1276">She was probably nagging him and he conceded and then my mother got a call from the Himmler headquarters, Sicherheitshauptamt, that she was called to pick up the visa for so and so.</span> <span id="s1277">My mother has absolutely no fear.</span> <span id="s1278">I mean she has nerves like steel.</span> <span id="s1279">She can sleep in the most trying circumstances, and she just went there.</span> <span id="s1280">To go in there was a very big favor alone you know.</span> <span id="s1281">These SS guys, they knew that Himmler had something to do with my mother's coming, got up, saluted here, and so on.</span> <span id="s1282">And my mother looks like Mrs. zero.</span> <span id="s1283">She does not arouse any interest.</span> <span id="s1284">She was just about, if Himmler would let in, let's say a Jewish woman who was alive but in his mind, but already dead.</span> <span id="s1285">That's how my mother looked.</span> <span id="s1286">She looked completely nonentity.</span> <span id="s1287">She got the visas.</span> <span id="s1288">They saluted.</span> <span id="s1289">My mother marched out.</span> <span id="s1290">Case closed.</span> <span id="s1291">You know, and that...I don't want to make propaganda for Himmler, but there is a side you probably would not have expected.</span> <span id="s1292">Not everybody has connections to the wife of a dictator, but if you do, there is a chance you get somewhere.</span> <span id="s1293">So we used to...I l mean some of the 20th of July people also got arrested and needed to get out, you know.</span> <span id="s1294">My mother got them out.</span> <span id="s1295">Jewish people or professors and so on, you know.</span> <span id="s1296">So Mrs. [Heumner (ph)]...we got them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: You got them out through Mrs. Feige?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yah, Mrs. Feige, Mrs. Himmler, and Mr. Himmler finally.</span> <span id="s1299">I mean it is unbelievable, I mean, to me, even today.</span> <span id="s1300">I mean I wouldn't...you know being a youngster I might have gone into the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, but anyone over 20 would not, because that was a place not to be.</span> <span id="s1301">For no reason.</span> <span id="s1302">And that was that.</span> <span id="s1303">I mean, you see it takes courage and the nerve to stay on your charted course.</span> <span id="s1304">You know a dictators really dislike enemies, but they dislike enemies who waver, you know.</span> <span id="s1305">And actually, if you are staying on your course, they are not suspicious because you act like them almost.</span> <span id="s1306">You see they don't waive, they don't give in on anything.</span> <span id="s1307">And you appear as if you are ready to get what you came for and then they give you a break.</span> <span id="s1308">I think it's the similarity of format you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: You have brought...you have got pictures here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Yah, by looking through my pictures, to my astonishment I see a picture which I have never seen.</span> <span id="s1311">Somehow it, I thought it is a friend and former colleague of my father, Mr. actually Albert Gunter.</span> <span id="s1312">He called himself usually Albougie.</span> <span id="s1313">(ph) It's a picture here in Szopot near Danzig, a resort, seaside resort, with his daughter and wife, a very elegant woman and a very sweet girl.</span> <span id="s1314">But he was...he was, you know, as you can see, a typical family picture, at a summer vacation at the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s1315">Uh, this man had worked in my uncle's office...in my uncle's factory as sales manager trainee, as has my father, who went out.</span> <span id="s1316">They became friends naturally and when this area became Polish again he went to Germany and joined a company in Stettin, which produced bakery ovens, bakery equipment, and that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s1317">My father kept on and off, you know, contacts and so on.</span> <span id="s1318">When we came to Berlin, moved to Berlin, he came visiting us, you know, sort of see how we are doing, and I think it was in 35 or so, this picture is 36.</span> <span id="s1319">He came in and I overheard the conversation, and he said, "Carl, Imagine!</span> <span id="s1320">I got an order for I think it was 50 ovens for the concentration camp in Oranienburg, near Berlin.</span> <span id="s1321">What do you think?</span> <span id="s1322">Do they expect that many prisoners?"</span> <span id="s1323">50.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">These were ovens to bake bread.</span> <span id="s1325">At that time, it was who knows.</span> <span id="s1326">It looks quite dim if they need that much bread, they probably get so and so many people and so actually, the existence of KZ concentration camp was known all over Germany by the way.</span> <span id="s1327">That is simply not true what Germans say now, in my opinion at least.</span> <span id="s1328">I knew it the first day.</span> <span id="s1329">Why shouldn't intellectual Germans know it the second day.</span> <span id="s1330">No, it was better not to know.</span> <span id="s1331">But this man had some misgivings about this firm, was Kirst und Soehne, from the Sttetin, was probably the fifth or so largest producer of ovens and so on.</span> <span id="s1332">And, after awhile, Mr. Gunter came visiting us again and they ordered even more, and he indicated that they are using these ovens to not bake bread, but to burn corpses.</span> <span id="s1333">He was really shocked.</span> <span id="s1334">I mean if you got news of that kind in Nazi Germany, you were really not much shocked you know.</span> <span id="s1335">You knew they did everything imaginable, mean to people.</span> <span id="s1336">But he was shocked, and he slightly felt responsible, I think, that he had lent his hand, maybe in the beginning, of course, not knowing what this was for.</span> <span id="s1337">These ovens were regular baking ovens as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1338">I mean I have seen films...I have seen films actually with the firm's label on the door of these ovens and I don't think they were modified for this new type of application so.</span> <span id="s1339">.</span> <span id="s1340">but, of course, knowing it, that its use to it, possibly I mean, actually, I wouldn't have gone through with it.</span> <span id="s1341">I would have retired or something, but he went to apparently to the very last and, uh...in 44, he called on our home, apartment door.</span> <span id="s1342">My mother was gone, my father was out of the city, and he talked to me and this man broke completely down.</span> <span id="s1343">He said, "What have I done?"</span> <span id="s1344">I must tell you I was not a friend to him.</span> <span id="s1345">You know he was much older and somehow, this man was so nervous, so super nervous, he said.</span> <span id="s1346">.</span> <span id="s1347">what have...and he asked me...I was what...I was 20 years old...and I was so embittered to see a man before me that I said, "Mr. Gunter, the only thing you can do...commit suicide. "</span> <span id="s1348">It was terrible for me to say it, but I knew everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Not from him, but from...of course, you knew everything.</span> <span id="s1350">And for me, having somebody before me, an intelligent German man, having done this did not say no, I mean, he probably could have invented hundreds of reasons...so I was really...maybe it wouldn't have been my style...I said you have nothing else to do but commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1351">By the way, he did.</span> <span id="s1352">Not that I have great power of persuasion, but he felt that's the only thing you can do.</span> <span id="s1353">Things which have been done, you lent your hand, your talent, you knew, at least along the line, that you actively supported, for me this was your death.</span> <span id="s1354">It would have been my death.</span> <span id="s1355">That's why I simply had a very strong commitment not in any way support this system.</span> <span id="s1356">It was my life really because if they kill others, they kill you.</span> <span id="s1357">Nobody has to get killed for political reasons.</span> <span id="s1358">And I knew if I am in it, I kill myself.</span> <span id="s1359">I don't kill other people.</span> <span id="s1360">I kill myself.</span> <span id="s1361">It's everywhere like this.</span> <span id="s1362">If you see reasons to kill, do it only then when you want to kill yourself.</span> <span id="s1363">That is the crummiest thing you can do.</span> <span id="s1364">So later on, my mother lived in West Germany and low and behold, she met Mrs. Gunter and her, by then, very pretty grownup daughter.</span> <span id="s1365">I mean, she didn't know about this visit, of course.</span> <span id="s1366">I think he never returned to her.</span> <span id="s1367">We didn't even know that he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1368">Only when my mother met her in West Germany, she told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: You have other photographs and papers.</span> <span id="s1370">Tell us about those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Yah, Here, I just have had a Otto Nifert (ph).</span> <span id="s1372">Actually was a Colonel during the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s1373">Prior to that he was our neighbor.</span> <span id="s1374">He lived in the apartment in Poland below us.</span> <span id="s1375">He was a member of parliament in Poland for the German minorities.</span> <span id="s1376">They even had...but he was also knowingly...we found out later...that he was also a paid German Nazi agent.</span> <span id="s1377">He received money.</span> <span id="s1378">We found out through connections, something like 43.</span> <span id="s1379">By that, he had already was drafted into the army...and, uh, I mean during the upheaval occupation of Poland, he had been arrested by the Polish government.</span> <span id="s1380">They found out about this later, secretly, but later we found, he.</span> <span id="s1381">.</span> <span id="s1382">he survived all this...and established.</span> <span id="s1383">.</span> <span id="s1384">he was...had a repair business...a plumbing business...had big orders, and so was a very industrious man, but politically, he was a Germany chauvinist as you ever seen one, you know.</span> <span id="s1385">He had...was officer in first World War.</span> <span id="s1386">He had this typical Prussian officer's attitude.</span> <span id="s1387">Only me, no one else!</span> <span id="s1388">So, but he was a piano player, a very voracious man, and so, he became in Nazi Army, a Colonel, and then rose up, up, and became the last Commandant of Danzig.</span> <span id="s1389">He finally moved out with the evacuation ships, and landed in Bonn of all places, and established a new (laugh) a new plumbing business there, also successful and all that.</span> <span id="s1390">There must be somebody who is re- establishing these people.</span> <span id="s1391">And, of course, his attitude toward Poles, Jews and so was that what you could expect, you know.</span> <span id="s1392">But to know a person and you always think, all these guys, they don't come back.</span> <span id="s1393">They don't come back.</span> <span id="s1394">But they do.</span> <span id="s1395">As we see now in Germany, no objection to this.</span> <span id="s1396">Here's another case.</span> <span id="s1397">This man used to be my law professor at Berlin.</span> <span id="s1398">I studied 2 semesters, 43, 42 and 43 at Berlin Law School because I wiggled out of the army.</span> <span id="s1399">I did some important work for the German armament industry, and they (laugh)...I had to commit myself half a year to serve in the air.</span> <span id="s1400">The equipment was such.</span> <span id="s1401">.</span> <span id="s1402">laboratory out of Berlin where everything the Germans had up their sleeve, was developed, evaluated and known.</span> <span id="s1403">I sit right in the right place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Where did you send it and how?</span> <span id="s1405">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: How did you transmit the material out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Uh, actually, through not direct contacts, but I had...I suspected that these people...they couldn't tell me of course, that they would put it in the right hands.</span> <span id="s1408">I mean I became aware of the development of the V1, V2 weapons.</span> <span id="s1409">This was, by the way, quite an open secret amongst those who knew.</span> <span id="s1410">The other things, the Colonel who became my super...I was in personnel...I had a very low...but personnel is a very good position to know everybody.</span> <span id="s1411">My superior was Hauptmann Schwabel, it...was the guy from Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1412">Actually being a Bavarian, you could think maybe he had some leanings to the Brown movement, but he was low and behold an anti-Nazi as you could possibly get it you know.</span> <span id="s1413">I came into the office and we sit there like little choir boys who couldn't sing you know.</span> <span id="s1414">Everybody was thinking, is that guy anti or for?</span> <span id="s1415">And, of course, this was the decision.</span> <span id="s1416">This man.</span> <span id="s1417">.</span> <span id="s1418">his family lived in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1419">He was alone.</span> <span id="s1420">He couldn't talk to anyone.</span> <span id="s1421">So I came in there, and sounded to me awfully uncomfortable, and then some remarks I did and so, and he covered and then I took the risk, and became full fledged anti-Nazi and told him everything I heard over BBC and this man got so additive.</span> <span id="s1422">Me telling him.</span> <span id="s1423">He was there at 6:00 just not to miss me, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">And we became like this.</span> <span id="s1425">I could find out anything.</span> <span id="s1426">He was waiting to betray his great Führer as best as he could, you know.</span> <span id="s1427">And we had fun, you know.</span> <span id="s1428">All these things were not done in the style of...not with me like you see it in Hollywood... two serious men talking serious stuff only.</span> <span id="s1429">We laughed our head off.</span> <span id="s1430">Of course, this whole thing was a big joke once you looked through this fakery and outsidish activity which was all fake, fake, fake.</span> <span id="s1431">I mean you could have a laugh of your time.</span> <span id="s1432">You...if it wouldn't have been for this killing and murdering, I could have laughed Hitler off and he would have been out in the rubble of history, never to be remembered.</span> <span id="s1433">But what he really established is the unchallenged position as a most mass murder ever.</span> <span id="s1434">Nobody has ever single handedly...I mean on a single order...killed that many.</span> <span id="s1435">And the dumbest in this whole game are the Germans themselves.</span> <span id="s1436">And they still have not found out that they were the victims too, including the German Jews, including Jews everywhere, including everyone who was just not a German, you know.</span> <span id="s1437">I mean...but the Germans paid dearly and willingly.</span> <span id="s1438">For what reason?</span> <span id="s1439">Only stupidly!</span> <span id="s1440">The most intelligent people on earth are also the dumbest and why?</span> <span id="s1441">Social organization pits one German against the other.</span> <span id="s1442">Nothing has changed, in my opinion at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Here's another wonderful German.</span> <span id="s1444">He was a coach for law students.</span> <span id="s1445">His name is uh, uh, uh, Professor Reinhart Höhn.</span> <span id="s1446">He was a coach in Jena.</span> <span id="s1447">And he...</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Yah, he was mentioned here in this letter (coughing) as a conduct Himmler to him.</span> <span id="s1450">I seem to know all the people who uh have a way to get to Himmler.</span> <span id="s1451">When I met this man, he was Professor at Berlin Law School, Berlin University.</span> <span id="s1452">He had become party member at 32, and (cough) got the attention of Himmler through some unspecified contacts.</span> <span id="s1453">And Himmler was looking for somebody to establish a special...a special section in the Reichssicherheitshauptamt [NB: the RSHA], in his headquarter, to establish an index to all persons who were suspect of being anti-Nazis abroad and inside Germany, or presenting a danger to the Nazi system.</span> <span id="s1454">Of course, without saying, Jews were in it automatically.</span> <span id="s1455">All of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1456">And Höhn was a man who developed...which finally ended up into something like 50 million index files where all Jews in the world, all anti-Nazis, all socialist, all union members, all modern artists which did not present the ideas of art of the Führer, or anything...Anyone who ever came to the attention of the authorities.</span> <span id="s1457">By the way, the German foreign service was instrumental in this.</span> <span id="s1458">For instance, getting the names and addresses of Jews in America.</span> <span id="s1459">Unfortunately, unwilling, at least there was a couple of Jewish foreign service officers in the German foreign service who were advised to get address lists from synagogues.</span> <span id="s1460">They went to their synagogues.</span> <span id="s1461">Got the addresses there.</span> <span id="s1462">But other Germans, they posed as Jews from Germany, (cough) obtained freely address material and send them on to Berlin.</span> <span id="s1463">You see, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible for the Germans to know where Jews lived.</span> <span id="s1464">Coming to Italy, coming to France, coming to Estonia, so...It was not always (cough) German agents who knew where to knock.</span> <span id="s1465">The Germans knew before they came there where to knock.</span> <span id="s1466">Telephone number, whatever.</span> <span id="s1467">And this was this man's work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">And actually, he couldn't do it along.</span> <span id="s1469">He is the man who hired Eichmann.</span> <span id="s1470">And I think 6 See Raul Hilberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">nobody knows who hired him.</span> <span id="s1472">Eichmann...was but us know (ph) (laughing).</span> <span id="s1473">Eichmann was recommended to him, you know, for being a diligent worker.</span> <span id="s1474">And this Eichmann, of course, helped; and probably he was...I never met Eichmann.</span> <span id="s1475">Although I must say, my rowing boat club, student club, was located next to Eichmann's office in Kleinerwannsee...Actually, next to it was Höhn's office.</span> <span id="s1476">His university institute for state law he ran.</span> <span id="s1477">Also,a fake the fact this faculty did not really exist, but Hitler appointed Höhn a professor because he wanted Höhn as SS man.</span> <span id="s1478">And he became finally SS General.</span> <span id="s1479">Uh, and uh Himmler's personal counselor, if he nedeed one.</span> <span id="s1480">But this Institute was on the Kleinerwansee, on a bridge.</span> <span id="s1481">The next house was a longish, brownish bungalow type--but very large.</span> <span id="s1482">Nobody knew who lived there.</span> <span id="s1483">But I personally saw these SS men with these long coats.</span> <span id="s1484">I mean, they looked like murderers; and you couldn't have any doubt they were monsters, as persons, even.</span> <span id="s1485">You know, nobody talked to them or even looked at them.</span> <span id="s1486">People...And next to it was the club house for, you know, gymnasium students.</span> <span id="s1487">It was an association, this club house existed since 50 years or so.</span> <span id="s1488">So we went there rowing; and so you saw these...Made your heart stop, you know, just seeing them so.</span> <span id="s1489">An obvious brutality, you know, as they walked or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: How did you find out that Höhn hired Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Oh, this was reported by a very famous German journalist.</span> <span id="s1492">Let's see.</span> <span id="s1493">Yah, there is a documentation on that.</span> <span id="s1494">I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s1495">But the President of the German Pen Club, I know him personally, also.</span> <span id="s1496">I worked with the British information service after the war.</span> <span id="s1497">And he was...he had fled to Britain, and became our security chief.</span> <span id="s1498">I discussed what's his name... He is very famous, he has written about...had documentation on it, because of his British position.</span> <span id="s1499">He had really easy access, and uh I think it is not disputed.</span> <span id="s1500">It has been uh reported many times, but what really happened to Professor Höhn--being a big shot in the Himmler hierarchy...One aspect of this index was also to record Nazis who had embezzled money, who had misbehaved, sexual offense, and so.</span> <span id="s1501">And Höhn inserted this due to his office anyone who was a danger.</span> <span id="s1502">But you know, the old cronies of Hitler were in this index, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">And it backfired to them.</span> <span id="s1504">And many of these cronies went to Hitler directly--because they worked with Hitler on a personal basis in the pre-Hitler days--and complained that "What is this man doing?</span> <span id="s1505">Is he trying to stamp out us old Nazis?</span> <span id="s1506">We helped you.</span> <span id="s1507">Remember it. "</span> <span id="s1508">And Hitler got really angry.</span> <span id="s1509">Hitler was not attached so much to this man.</span> <span id="s1510">Himmler was.</span> <span id="s1511">But not.</span> <span id="s1512">.</span> <span id="s1513">Hit[ler].</span> <span id="s1514">So Höhn got removed from this position, and who ran it was Eichmann himself.</span> <span id="s1515">But Himmler pressed and pressed to get Höhn back.</span> <span id="s1516">And Hitler then, how I think the...the idea was to appoint a SS man as a professor.</span> <span id="s1517">Because as a professor, he could spy on the general professors in Germany who [had] the reputation not to follow necessarily so willingly a Nazi Regime.</span> <span id="s1518">But Hitler gave in and appointed him, this Höhn, as a law professor.</span> <span id="s1519">They created a new faculty, state law faculty.</span> <span id="s1520">Actually, the whole idea was to prove to the public that the Führer system is actually legitimate form of government, you know.</span> <span id="s1521">This was...but he got...when the started and the Germans invaded Poland, he was...this Professor Höhn was very much involved in Germanizing Poland.</span> <span id="s1522">And doing this, I, of course, became a student.</span> <span id="s1523">I wanted to know everything this man had on his mind.</span> <span id="s1524">Unfortunately, everything...the most terrible thing which could be thought of was his recommendation.</span> <span id="s1525">A minimum sentence for any offense was death.</span> <span id="s1526">I wonder (laughing) what more severe punishments would be.</span> <span id="s1527">It was completely crazy, you know.</span> <span id="s1528">So uh I had a girlfriend, and she had enlisted to become a doctor.</span> <span id="s1529">And her doctor father was this.</span> <span id="s1530">She was not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1531">She was not a Nazi; but as usual, a student in Germany, once you were to make a doctor, the university more or less prescribes to you who should be supervising your work.</span> <span id="s1532">And that was she.</span> <span id="s1533">She became a assistant under Höhn.</span> <span id="s1534">They usually used the doctorins as secretaries, more or less.</span> <span id="s1535">You know, they look over the doctoral dissertation and only with was one eye.</span> <span id="s1536">But it's even done today.</span> <span id="s1537">I mean, students in Germany have complained since 200 years about this.</span> <span id="s1538">But so did Höhn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">And she told me a few things what he was appointed Professor at two universities, Kraków and Poznan, in the occupied zones of Poland.</span> <span id="s1540">And he actually gave training courses to Nazi officials and SS, how to really clean up Poland.</span> <span id="s1541">Actually, he helped in the formation of the Polish penal code--which was a German code, extra for Poles.</span> <span id="s1542">They were not under German law, but under SS law.</span> <span id="s1543">I mean, people who stole, blow head off, you know, and so.</span> <span id="s1544">And uh he was contacted by ethnic German doctor from Chomutov, which is actually in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1545">And he is of German descent.</span> <span id="s1546">And he writes here in this letter, "Dear Doctor Höhn, since I know that you have close relationships with Reichsführer SS Himmler, I want to present you the following. "</span> <span id="s1547">And he refers to an article which was written in a medical journal--the possibility of sterilizing men forever by medical injection.</span> <span id="s1548">It's a sad moment, planned and so forth.</span> <span id="s1549">And there is uh uh the contact, and don't let anyone see it; because you know bureaucratic ways, things get lost and so. "</span> <span id="s1550">But this too important, you know.</span> <span id="s1551">And he suggested (ph) prisoners of war in German and practically everyone they don't like, but would liked to have work for them but not propagate, so that they don't endanger the German stock.</span> <span id="s1552">I mean, a very nice proposition.</span> <span id="s1553">And apparently Himmler got this.</span> <span id="s1554">Höhn said, "I never forwarded it.
