<html><body><p><span id="s1">Regina Hoffman, December 13, 1977</span></p> <p><span id="s2">Q: When and where were you born</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: On the 25th of July, 1912 in Tarnoff, Poland</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Did you grow up in Tarnoff</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: No, I was two years old when I left.</span> <span id="s6">We went to Berlin</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Did you get your education in Berlin</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: No.</span> <span id="s9">in Pirmasens.</span> <span id="s10">After I was six months in Berlin, we went to Pirmasens where I spent all my years until I came to this country</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about your education</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Well, I first went when I was 5½ to a Jewish public school.</span> <span id="s13">You see, in Bavaria, we were separated.</span> <span id="s14">The Catholic children went to Catholic school, Protestants, Jews, we were separated for four years and then if you went to high school, you were mixed in with all the others.</span> <span id="s15">But elementary school was strictly in your own religion.</span> <span id="s16">And interesting enough, I suffered a lot in that Jewish school because the German Jews had a hatred toward Polish Jews and being an emigrant from Poland, the German Jews were very resentful.</span> <span id="s17">My parents did not come as beggars in that respect.</span> <span id="s18">We went to Pirmasens on account that my mother had a brother there who was quite successful.</span> <span id="s19">He had a big shoe factory there and took my father in.</span> <span id="s20">I have a complex, a terrible complex all my life towards German Jews who always talk about the Pollacks and the Russian Jews and today their children marry these pollacks and they are so proud and happy and they say—and I purposely, there I am mean, I say who did your daughter marry?</span> <span id="s21">Ach, it’s a second generation here and it bothers me to no end because going through emigration twice and being persecuted by gentiles, if you find this under your own.</span> <span id="s22">So you see this is one factor that’s very strong for me with all my fighting against it and my husband who is a German Jew, he cannot understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: In what ways were you—did you feel hurt</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: They wanted to make me feel I’m different—I’m not up to their level because my parents spoke with an accent.</span> <span id="s25">My parents spoke German because in Poland when you went to a school—most of them couldn’t even go, they only went to a cheder, they called it—but these people who went to school learned languages.</span> <span id="s26">My parents spoke German as well as I speak English today.</span> <span id="s27">Maybe der die and das, maybe they don’t speak so correctly and you know children are sensitive.</span> <span id="s28">I always said to my mother, If I bring a child home, mommy, don’t talk much.</span> <span id="s29">You know it bothered me.</span> <span id="s30">You want to be up to the level of other children.</span> <span id="s31">And this was a big factor in my life and I can’t shake that.</span> <span id="s32">I don’t hate anybody but when they come out with these statements and you see these people here from the small villages, the German Jews, how primitive they are and they still think they are it—they are superior.</span> <span id="s33">My husband says why do these people bother you, you know who and what you are but it’s not something I can reason out.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: When you left this Jewish school, you went to a high school</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: To a Lyceum, an all girls school but mixed.</span> <span id="s36">And in this lycee, the girls who were on top could make an entrance exam to another school—the abitur.</span> <span id="s37">This only those who wanted to study did and I wanted to study medicine so I needed that education and so I went to that school, and that was mixed with more gentiles than Jews.</span> <span id="s38">I think only one other Jewish girl was with me.</span> <span id="s39">I made the arbitur and this was already in 1932 and I did not go to the University because it was very an ti- semitic already in Pirmasens.</span> <span id="s40">We were not equal anymore—at the prom we were not accepted anymore and things like this.</span> <span id="s41">In smaller towns, they started early.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: This was when Hitler had already taken over?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: No.</span> <span id="s44">it was 1932.</span> <span id="s45">By 1932,33—it was already bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: How did the Jewish girls feel not being able to as you said go the prom or</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Well, we felt rejected of course but I think when you are young—this didn’t make such an impression because we always felt—you see we felt double bad.</span> <span id="s48">We were Jewish towards the gentiles and they didn’t like it and I was a polish Jew towards the German Jews.</span> <span id="s49">I never felt equal.</span> <span id="s50">As a matter of fact, interesting, I never cry.</span> <span id="s51">I control my emotions very well.</span> <span id="s52">But whenever I hear a national anthem, not matter which one it is, I soften up probably because I never felt I belong to that country where the anthem is played.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: When you heard the German national play at that time…</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I felt German.</span> <span id="s55">I wanted to be German but I didn’t feel like the others probably did.</span> <span id="s56">I meant more to me to be able to sing this full-heartedly.</span> <span id="s57">I always felt I’m not in the place where I should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Did you have many gentile friends at the time</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Almost all.</span> <span id="s60">But you see I felt better with them and that’s why I guess I had them because you see if a gentile friend, them likedme and I felt very equal with them.</span> <span id="s61">Even if they would have made an anti-semitic remark, I would have felt it was justified because I am different—I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s62">But amongst Jews I couldn’t see it.</span> <span id="s63">I couldn’t see that Jew who were persecuted already so many years before the Germans were persecuting them an that’s why they had all these poor Polish Jews—there were not allowed to go t schools.</span> <span id="s64">They were kept down like the colored people were kept down here.</span> <span id="s65">So I couldn’t see when you come together with your own people—the Jewish people—that there should be a difference but you see the German Jews were first German and then Jews.</span> <span id="s66">They were first Germans and then Jews and I was brought up—I didn’t know any different than being Jewish.</span> <span id="s67">My father was a Zionist already in Poland His dream was always to have our own state—the Jews should have a state because he went through so much.</span> <span id="s68">He was persecuted all his life—there already—even being a big business man.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you belong to a congregation in Pirmasens</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Sure, where all the German Jews went.</span> <span id="s71">It wasn’t so orthodox.</span> <span id="s72">Pirmasenser Jews didn’t keep much.</span> <span id="s73">As a matter of fact, my parents were more Jewish than they.</span> <span id="s74">In a sense, going to Temple to pray—I wasn’t brought up with a lot of—we ate ham for instance, I that respect I was brought up very modern.</span> <span id="s75">We traveled on Saturday, we did carry things on Saturday.</span> <span id="s76">But we were Jewish but I guess we had different values.</span> <span id="s77">When I saw here these Jews who had a key pinned to their tie, to me this is so hypocritical that there I act like a gentile.</span> <span id="s78">Maybe because I don’t want to be anymore different than other people are—I suffered to much for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Getting back to when you were in school, did younotice a change in the gentile attitude towards the Jews after Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: No, as a matter of fact we did not.</span> <span id="s81">You see my father was very much liked by the gentiles.</span> <span id="s82">My father later on had a shoe factory of his own and he employed about 400 workers himself and all his business friends who were not Jewish, they loved him.</span> <span id="s83">No, maybe that’s why my parents stayed too long too.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Were most of these employees…</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Only gentiles.</span> <span id="s86">Maybe we had one or two Jewish people.</span> <span id="s87">Who worked really in a factory in Germany—very few Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you know many people who became members of the Party</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, later on.</span> <span id="s90">But you see they said they are all forced to do it.</span> <span id="s91">And I tell you the truth, Rosalyn, at that time I was such an optimist—not an optimist but I couldn’t think that it s possible that a program like Hitler put it—I thought he is crazy.</span> <span id="s92">We laughed about it.</span> <span id="s93">If we were so immature or—it was really not justified because going through the emigration from Poland, we should have believed it.</span> <span id="s94">We should have believed that something like this can happen if you think back.</span> <span id="s95">But when you are young and you are in it, you don’t want to have it true and I did not see in Poland anybody killed or anything like this.</span> <span id="s96">Today I know I went through an emigration then.</span> <span id="s97">But maybe all things look bigger to me now since it passed then when I went through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Today we look at it from hindsight and it is much easier to have 20-20 vision.</span> <span id="s99">But at the time, was you father’s business affected at all by the Nazis coming to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Not in the early years, only in the later.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: You mentioned you finished school in 1932, you made the abitur.</span> <span id="s102">Did you continue</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span> <span id="s104">I did not go.</span> <span id="s105">You see, I met my husband before I made the abitur and I really didn’t want to leave town anymore and in order to go to the University, I would have had to leave town and friends were telling me how bad it was and Hitler would not let the Jews study and things like that.</span> <span id="s106">I felt why should my father spend money on something which will not have any value any more.</span> <span id="s107">So I went in my father’s shoe factory and worked there in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Was your husband already a doctor in Pirmasens</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s110">He was at that time a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: When did you get married A Much later—in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Until 1937 then, you worked in the shoe factory.</span> <span id="s113">How did Hitler’s growing power effect you</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: If effected me in the way that we could not travel abroad—we could not get passports.</span> <span id="s115">We had to be very restrained—in the movies, they didn’t want you anymore, in the theater they didn’t want you.</span> <span id="s116">You had no cultural life.</span> <span id="s117">You did stick to yourself, more or less.</span> <span id="s118">Because in a small town they knew us.</span> <span id="s119">In bigger towns—for instance, what we did for our honeymoon.</span> <span id="s120">We went to Berlin—it was a big city and nobody knew us.</span> <span id="s121">We went to theaters and concerts and we still had three weeks of good time.</span> <span id="s122">But the Berlin Jews, they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s123">But for us it was like going abroad.</span> <span id="s124">It was a big city, we lived in a hotel.</span> <span id="s125">They accepted us in the hotel and didn’t ask for Jews at that time, because when you got a passport later, they put the J in and the name Sara, but that came later.</span> <span id="s126">This we didn’t have so we could go and nobody bothered us.</span> <span id="s127">But of course it bothered us but you see, I had very strong family ties.</span> <span id="s128">We were all together—my family was together so to me that was a shelter and I never thought it could get that bad that they would kill us or destroy us.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: What about in the shoe factory?</span> <span id="s130">Out of 400 workers, there must have been…</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No.</span> <span id="s132">They were very glad to be paid well and to have a job.</span> <span id="s133">You see the job was very important.</span> <span id="s134">There was a lot of unemployment—that’s why Hitler could do all these things too.</span> <span id="s135">No, they were—you see, the whole thing to me is not clear.</span> <span id="s136">I cannot really speak objectives.</span> <span id="s137">I say on the one side, it could happen here the same way.</span> <span id="s138">I think every people is the same, you have good and bad.</span> <span id="s139">If you find one nut that gets up here and has this power over people what Hitler had—he had power.</span> <span id="s140">You were fascinated.</span> <span id="s141">I was fascinated in a bad sense—I was afraid of him.</span> <span id="s142">They saw good in him so they were fascinated that he had—he had some gigantic sick power.</span> <span id="s143">It was sick but it was a power.</span> <span id="s144">This is the reason that I sometimes contradict myself—I have a great hatred towards the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Did you ever see signs of Juden Unerwuenscht</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s147">You see we didn’t have any way of going to a swimming pool—there was no swimming pool nearby.</span> <span id="s148">So we always had to travel inorder to go swimming.</span> <span id="s149">But then they built a beautiful swimming pool—the first thing when that was ready—there was nobody in there yet—the big sign Juden Unerwuenscht.</span> <span id="s150">It was just one block away from where we lived.</span> <span id="s151">It was just outside of the town and we lived outside of the town in a villa—quite nicely.</span> <span id="s152">But at that time—look, if we would have felt it so terribly, we would have left.</span> <span id="s153">But there was another thing—we had no relatives here.</span> <span id="s154">We really didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s155">We couldn’t emigrate to America.</span> <span id="s156">My father came, with all the hardships of the German Jews and all that, he still felt good in Germany because that was culture.</span> <span id="s157">It was from coming from Poland even if you come from a city where there was cultrue, still the Germans were clean, they were neat, they were prompt, they were punctual.</span> <span id="s158">They had a lot of traits that were good—no matter how big our hatred is, you can see it here.</span> <span id="s159">We have a superintendent who has golden hands—out of dirt.</span> <span id="s160">So you have to give them their good traits.</span> <span id="s161">And my father was fascinated by that.</span> <span id="s162">And my mother was fascinated by the fact that the kids went to school dressed so nicely.</span> <span id="s163">In Poland, only the upper 500 had it.</span> <span id="s164">We had it but we were a minority—all the others were really poor and sloppy—they went barefoot.</span> <span id="s165">It was a different culture.</span> <span id="s166">So they felt very much at home there—they wanted to stay.</span> <span id="s167">There was no reason for them to want to go to a strange country—they were successful, they had a nice life—who wants to go?</span> <span id="s168">Do you want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Of course not.</span> <span id="s170">When did you begin to feel the hardships?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: When my husband had his practice taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: When was that</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: On the first of October, 1938.</span> <span id="s174">That we have to leave eventually, we felt before because people had trouble going to Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s175">They made it hard on them but my husband was privileged—they loved him.</span> <span id="s176">He was a young efficient doctor and they came.</span> <span id="s177">They even made a big “to do” to get these Scheine, krankenkassescheine—it was made hard on them and they still came to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Was he able to treat non-Jewish patients</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: He had almost all non-Jewish patients.</span> <span id="s180">There were not too many Jews in the town.</span> <span id="s181">They were almost all non-Jewish and they were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Was there ever a question of an SS or Gestapo….</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: The SS did not really come anymore.</span> <span id="s184">But this was only towards the end when they were forced to enter the SS that they didn’t come anymore.</span> <span id="s185">A regular SS man didn’t come.</span> <span id="s186">But there were so many who weren’t in the Party until they were forced to get in.</span> <span id="s187">There came a law then that whoever wasn’t in the Party couldn’t get a job.</span> <span id="s188">And there I always say when I reason with myself—how would you have acted?</span> <span id="s189">If you would be the father of a family and you are gentile and they say look, we don’t like the Jews and we discriminate against them, we throw you out of your position, if you don’t enter the party, maybe I would have gone too.</span> <span id="s190">You see I contradict myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: But that’s a question we all have to ask.</span> <span id="s192">What would we have done.</span> <span id="s193">But when your husband’s practice was taken away, what happened to you</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Well, then we moved to my parents—You see, my parents always stayed Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s195">My father never took on the German citizenship because somehow, first it was hard to get it as a Jew and then when he could get it, it was already a time when he didn’t want it anymore.</span> <span id="s196">He was settled, there was no advantage for him.</span> <span id="s197">He said we are Polish, we suffered for our being Polish—we stay Polish.</span> <span id="s198">I don’t want to become German.</span> <span id="s199">And my father could stay and the consul in Cologne where we belonged to always assured my father, it’s only against the German Jews.</span> <span id="s200">Hitler is only against the German Jews.</span> <span id="s201">The Polish citizens in this country—nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s202">And that was a big factor in my father’s life and that’s why he stayed.</span> <span id="s203">He had a big factory, he had a villa, he had money.</span> <span id="s204">Even when he soldit, he could live comfortable, why should he emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: When did he sell the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: He had to sell it in 1937 and it was not good anymore because we had alot of Jewish trade in the country that bought our shoes, Leisa-Berlin was a relative of ours and he was the biggest in Berlin and a lot of these big firms that supported us were Jews and so business went down and we of course lost money because they couldn’t pay their debts and my father saw that coming and he sold the business to an Aryan—he took it over.</span> <span id="s207">He wasn’t forced at that time but he would have been forced because it would have liquidated itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: It was not forcibly Arisiered then?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No.</span> <span id="s210">not directly.</span> <span id="s211">But I still did get restitution money.</span> <span id="s212">They recognized it that the business went down and my father lost all that money on account of the boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Was he able to sell it at a reasonable price.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s215">He would have gotten a different price if that had not happened.</span> <span id="s216">It was worth much more.</span> <span id="s217">First of all, the business would have stayed bigger.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did your father suffer at all because of his lack of German citizenship—was he considered stadtenloss?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, you see, they started with the Polish first.</span> <span id="s220">They took the Polish citizens on the first of October 1938—I was there when they took my parents away and shipped them to Poland.</span> <span id="s221">And my parents at that time still had alot of relatives in Poland and they heard about it and they came to rescue them.</span> <span id="s222">It was near Kattowitz, near Boiten or what that frontier was (Sbontzyn) and they came there and they took them away from the transport.</span> <span id="s223">I don’t know where the other went but my parents went to Cracow—my mother had a sister there who was well established with a big business man and alot of other relatives.</span> <span id="s224">My father had brothers—one brother took him into business even and you see, my mother and father, when they were taken—I was visiting my parents and we didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s225">All of a sudden, the SS came and they took my parents away and they took me too but by marriage, I became a German citizen.</span> <span id="s226">So I said look, first of all, my parents are Polish.</span> <span id="s227">If you take German citizens, you can take me.</span> <span id="s228">So I called this consul but he didn’t do anything either—he didn’t save us.</span> <span id="s229">He said—this comes from the top and I cannot do anything.</span> <span id="s230">Mrs. Hoffman, you r parents have to go.</span> <span id="s231">And I went with my parents to that gefangnis in Pirmasens and they let me free but they kept my parents.</span> <span id="s232">And at that time we didn’t know what they are going to do with them.</span> <span id="s233">I was very upset but you hope that it is not bad.</span> <span id="s234">I didn’t think they were going to take my parents and send them to Poland and then kill them.</span> <span id="s235">This was not done like this.</span> <span id="s236">But the next day I knew that they were taken away from the gefangnis but I didn’t know where and then we found out—my parents wrote us that they are in Cracow, And my mother took her jewelry—my mother had alot of jewelry like alot of the Polish Jews—they always believed in diamonds and things—to have something of value—what they can always take in case they have to leave—so my parents had the same thing.</span> <span id="s237">So my mother took her jewelry—I saw that—in a handkerchief and did hide it and with this jewelry, with part of it, my father could re-instate himself in a business and they did quite nicely.</span> <span id="s238">And then my father did get the permission to come back and get all his belongings and at that time, my sister was still there, she was married to a brother of my husband—with her child.</span> <span id="s239">My father was so happy and was doing so nicely in Poland that he said, you know what, before you can go to America, she had a high number and it would have taken two or three years, I’ll take you to Poland andyou emigrate from there.</span> <span id="s240">What a foolish thing—hindsight also.</span> <span id="s241">My friends always told me—your parents must have been stupid—how could they do a think like this?</span> <span id="s242">But look my sister was with her child.</span> <span id="s243">Her husband was in Dachau after the 10th of November and he had to leave the country.</span> <span id="s244">He only could come out of the concentration camp on the condition that he is leaving the country.</span> <span id="s245">So he got a visa through a friend of my father to go to France.</span> <span id="s246">And my sister with her child could have gone to France but they had no money and they were not allowed to work in France and they did not want to be supported by this friend of my father who was a strange man who did enough already to grant an affidavit.</span> <span id="s247">So my sister was sitting with her child in Pirmasens and my parents came back and took their belongings and their money and went to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: They were able to take their money</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s250">So my father said I’m going to hire a lawyer who will take you (my sister) with the child over the frontier.</span> <span id="s251">They did this—you know, with money you could get things like this.</span> <span id="s252">And they were successful—they smuggled my sister with her child into Poland with the help of the lawyer and they were happy for a few months.</span> <span id="s253">But then, Hitler came to Poland and took them to a ghetto and from there to the vernichtungslager.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: What ghetto did they go to</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: To Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: While they had gone to Poland, were you and your husband still in Pirmasens</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: No.</span> <span id="s258">We had emigrated to the United States in February of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What happened to you and your husband on Kristallnacht</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: On Kristallnacht, they came.</span> <span id="s261">When my husband had to give up his practice, my parents had that big house and he wasn’t making any money so for us to sit in an apartment and pay rent was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s262">We went and moved to my parents villa and put all our furniture there in storage.</span> <span id="s263">So in the Kristallnacht, my sister who lived on the other end of town—that’s where they started to take the men out—called me and said Gustav and Grandfather—she lived close to my father-in-law—were just picked up.</span> <span id="s264">They caught all the Jewish men—hide Max.</span> <span id="s265">And my husband got dressed and went into the woods.</span> <span id="s266">But they didn’t leave me alone—they came and they said “Hmm, the bed is still warm here—wo is der vogel?</span> <span id="s267">I said he was called by a patient—he had no license anymore, it is not true—I said he went to help somebody who was sick.</span> <span id="s268">It was foolish but they let it go because my husband was so loved in that town performing for those poor people for a minimum of money.</span> <span id="s269">He didn’t send bill and so—he was an idealist at that time.</span> <span id="s270">When he had a rich father—he could be an idealist.</span> <span id="s271">But they really respected him and as long as it was not really an order, they would not have done him any harm.</span> <span id="s272">So they let me get away with that remark that he went to see a patient but he was in the woods.</span> <span id="s273">Later on I the afternoon, he called me.</span> <span id="s274">He went to a phone, he managed to come out.</span> <span id="s275">So I said look, they are going to arrest me because that’s what they said to me.</span> <span id="s276">If my husband doesn’t show up, they are going to arrest me.</span> <span id="s277">So of course, my husband went to headquarters and signed himself in.</span> <span id="s278">And from there, they took all the Jews and sent them to France.</span> <span id="s279">And now you can see how the other nations are—there were 63 Jewish men that were sent to France from Pirmasens.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Was your husband among the 63?</span> <span id="s281">Where did they send him?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes, he was with them and they went to a small village near the border.</span> <span id="s283">And they sent them back—the 63—France sent them back.</span> <span id="s284">They knew what was going on so if they were such a wonderful nation, why didn’t they keep these people?</span> <span id="s285">They didn’t—they sent them back and the SS took them and they made them march I don’t know how many miles.</span> <span id="s286">And my husband was with the marchers too and there was a blind man and he collapsed and my husband, being a doctor, picked him up and then they took a wagon and let him drive in with this blind man and of course, he picked up his father too and put him in the wagon.</span> <span id="s287">My father-in-law was an old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Was your brotherin law there too</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s290">And they had to march back about 23 miles, in rennen—they didn’t march—they were chased.</span> <span id="s291">And from there, they took them to Dachau.</span> <span id="s292">But my husband fainted before he was taken.</span> <span id="s293">I was not married too long so I had the feeling I want to be near my husband.</span> <span id="s294">So I went to see—they were all collected in Volksgartenhalle—that was the place—and I said to my sister who had a small child—I look what they are doing with these men—I’ll go out.</span> <span id="s295">And all the women were sitting together and talking what should we do.</span> <span id="s296">I said I go and look.</span> <span id="s297">So they said don’t—how could you dare—they might do something to you.</span> <span id="s298">So what, I said and I went and when I came there, my husband had just fainted.</span> <span id="s299">So, they let him lie there.</span> <span id="s300">Roslyn, I cannot tell you, it was a miracle because usually I wouldn’t—if I think back, I wouldn’t do it today but if you have to—you have alot of guts.</span> <span id="s301">So I went away and a block away was a doctor, a gentile doctor, who hated my husband because he had a big office and I went up to his office and he had alot of people there and I took him by the arm and said you come along, my husband his sick and you have to help him.</span> <span id="s302">And he said what, let him kripiern.</span> <span id="s303">I’m not coming and I took him and I shook him and I said you are going, you are going and he really went.</span> <span id="s304">And when he came with me there and he examined my husband, he said he can go to Dacahu—he’s allright.</span> <span id="s305">So I went in front of these SS people and I screamed and I yelled and I said what—a man who did so much good for this city—you are going to take him to a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s306">How dare you?</span> <span id="s307">And they were standing with guns and they said if you don’t go out of the way, you Jewish woman, we will shoot.</span> <span id="s308">I said go ahead, you shoot I don’t care.</span> <span id="s309">I don’t know how but I got my husband out and I got him to a hospital.</span> <span id="s310">They didn’t want to accept him either and there was a director—there were two—an old one who loved him and a young one</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Had he practiced in this hospital</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s313">And the young one hated him also.</span> <span id="s314">All these young doctors were very jealous and they didn’t want Jewish doctors especially not the successful Jewish doctors so my husband came through and he of course said to me in a low voice that I should try to get that old director when he is admitted but I couldn’t—the young one was there and he didn’t want to accept him.</span> <span id="s315">And I screamed and yelled with him and he kept him and in the morning, he said he can go home and he can report to where they were still assembled from the night before.</span> <span id="s316">But I tried to get some protection and I went to an alte kreisartzt and he didn’t want to write a certificate that my husband has something wrong with his heart but finally he wrote that that he cannot be taken to prison—that he is not able to go t prison.</span> <span id="s317">And with this I really saved him—they did not inquire anymore.</span> <span id="s318">And we had relatives by that time here who sent the affidavit out and I always told them it’s on the way it’s on the way.</span> <span id="s319">It wasn’t really on the way but they were working on it and we emigrated then in February of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: When had you applied for the affidavit</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: After the 10th of November.</span> <span id="s322">No, there was something that I left out.</span> <span id="s323">My husband had a nurse working for him who worked in this country and when it got so bad, she always said Dr. why don’t you emigrate.</span> <span id="s324">And my husband said he had nobody there.</span> <span id="s325">I cannot go.</span> <span id="s326">And she asked should I write to my former boss?</span> <span id="s327">Maybe he can give you an affidavit—he was quite a well known man—a lawyer.</span> <span id="s328">And she wrote to Mr. Heinsheimer here, to her former boss.</span> <span id="s329">And this boss wrote a letter to the consul in Stuttgart that he had 50 or 60 people of this own to bring out but if he still could include someone, he certainly would let us come out.</span> <span id="s330">So when the time got very bad, my husband had a friend who was baptized but they fell under the same laws so he said, look, it’s not going to take long anymore with our office.</span> <span id="s331">Let’s go to Stuttgart and by the sheerest luck, that letter got a mark and we had the lowest number—124.</span> <span id="s332">But this was all a miracle.</span> <span id="s333">It was not our doing—it just had to be like that.</span> <span id="s334">When my husband went, he got a number for my sister also—it was already 22,000.</span> <span id="s335">So the man said to my husband, Dr. you have a number here.</span> <span id="s336">If you bring an affidavit, tomorrow you can go.</span> <span id="s337">That’s how we got out because this low number was called right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: When you emigrated in Feb. 1939, what happened to your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: She was in Primasens until Sept. 1939 and then she was taken.</span> <span id="s340">My parents came in May, 1939 to get all their things and she was taken Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And Gustav, your brother in law.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: He was in France all the time and then he went to the fremten Legion.</span> <span id="s343">The French people didn’t let him work and so they took to a fremten legion and he worked in Africa on the road.</span> <span id="s344">He was a prisoner of France then.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: When you came here, who met you</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The man who gave us the affidavit, my husband’s uncle</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Where did you go that first day</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: We had a furnished room—my uncle took a furnished room for us at 510 W. 186th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What impression did you have of New York when you first came.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Well, when I came down from the boat—we went first class on the boat because this was paid in German marks.</span> <span id="s351">We paid it becauseour moeny didn’t have any value—we couldn’t take it along.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: You only left with the 10RM</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s354">And when I arrived here, first of all I was very seasick the whole time and when we arrived, Pres. Benes from Czechoslovakia was with us on the boa t and so he came down and everybody was applauding.</span> <span id="s355">We didn’t really know what it was so my husband was kidding me, he knew it was for Benes but he said oh look the welcome, they give us.</span> <span id="s356">My impression was, oh there must be a fire here—look at the dirt, all the newspapers on the street.</span> <span id="s357">The city struck me right away very dirty.</span> <span id="s358">What I didn’t see later on at all any more—now I see it again.</span> <span id="s359">But after that it looked clean to me.</span> <span id="s360">That was the first impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: I wanted to ask you before, how did you feel on the day you left Germany</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Well, very shaken up—very sad of course.</span> <span id="s363">Look, I left my sister and her small child.</span> <span id="s364">She was the only one left.</span> <span id="s365">My parents</span></p></body></html>
