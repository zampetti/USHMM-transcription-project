<span id="s16">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I was born in Szikszó, Abaúj-Torna Vármegye,in Hungary.</span> <span id="s18">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in February the 14, 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Tell me about your parents and about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Well, my parents, my parents – when my mother – my father was 50 years old when I was born and my mother was 46 and we were 12 children all together.</span> <span id="s22">We were three girls and, and, and nine boys.</span> <span id="s23">I was the youngest between them.</span> <span id="s24">And as a child I remember when I was about six or seven years old, I didn't even know I'm Jewish that – till I – the first time I went to – we had a soccer stadium in our village.</span> <span id="s25">The shtetl, we used to call them.</span> <span id="s26">And as I was, as I was going to the football game as a little boy, I brushed against a, a goyim, as a, as a gentile man, you know.</span> <span id="s27">So he call, he called me a "Jew bastard."</span> <span id="s28">So then I went home and said to my mother and father, said, "They called me a 'Jew bastard.'"</span> <span id="s29">You know, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s30">So she said to me, said "The next time don't brush against the same guy – same man."</span> <span id="s31">Well, the Christians have always been antisemitic in, in Hungary and they, they got it probably from their mother's milk.</span> <span id="s32">They were, they were taught in a Sunday School, I suppose by the clergy, to hate us or whatever.</span> <span id="s33">To always – used to call us I remember as kids, you know, "dirty Jews" and "Jew bastards," you know, as I was growing up.</span> <span id="s34">But somehow I never, I never called them anything, any names or we never taught in school you know to, anything about to hate Christians.</span> <span id="s35">But nevertheless the – I suppose the clergy for centuries and generations there, they were teaching their children in Sunday School to be antisemitic and not just Hungary, it was all over you know.</span> <span id="s36">So sometimes, you know, they used to call the old childhood words like, “sticks and stones doesn't,” what you call it, “sticks and stones might hurt my bone but words never hurt me.”</span> <span id="s37">You know, you ever heard that?</span> <span id="s38">So that was our philosophy you know.</span> <span id="s39">They can call us anything.</span> <span id="s40">It's what a different–</span></p> <p><span id="s41">1 County (Hungarian)</span></p> <p><span id="s42">01:04:53</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Tell me about your, your, your childhood with your brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s44">Did you play a lot?</span> <span id="s45">Did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Well, with children, I was the youngest and I have a brother, he was 27 year older than I, and he was – I remember when he got married, I was three or four years old and I had a brother, his name was Joe, Joseph.</span> <span id="s47">He came to America when I was, before I was born back in 1922, and I was born in 1923.</span> <span id="s48">And he used to send some – sometimes he had little extra money, used to send money to home, to Hungary you know.</span> <span id="s49">And my, my father used to, he used to be a bootmaker and shoe, shoebuilder – shoe, shoe – you know, he used to….</span> <span id="s50">But he didn't make too much money, you know, and with a lot of kids you know.</span> <span id="s51">But nevertheless I had a brother Hugo, he was – he went to Catholic Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s52">He wanted to be a medical doctor, and only way he could go to Gymnasium, he went to a Protestant Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s53">Gymnasium is, you know, is like high school you know here.</span> <span id="s54">So, but Jews – they were very hard to get into those schools you know, the, the parochial schools, Catholic schools for instance, but because my – our name Bernath, it wasn't solid Jewish and we came through the name problem.</span> <span id="s55">But there was the money problem also, you know.</span> <span id="s56">So we came through the somehow the money problem and he graduated from Gymnasium in – he was 18 years old in Miskolc and he, he applied to medical school in Prague, Czechoslovakia, because in Hungary the Jews couldn't get into med.</span> <span id="s57">school.</span> <span id="s58">It was just – it was impossible.</span> <span id="s59">So he applied to Prague, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s60">He was accepted and but later on he – after a year, he transferred himself to Bologna medical school and first he had to learn the Czech language, then he had to learn the Italian language fluently because he had to go to med.</span> <span id="s61">school you know.</span> <span id="s62">And beside in, in the gymnasium they had to learn three more languages, German, Latin and English.</span> <span id="s63">He, my brother, was very – he knew, he knew six, seven, eight languages, my brother.</span> <span id="s64">But he finished his medical studies in Bologna and became a medical doctor in Bologna.</span> <span id="s65">Well actually, Bologna is the first medical – it was the first medical school in the world.</span> <span id="s66">So, he came home and came home.</span> <span id="s67">He worked in the – then they accepted him.</span> <span id="s68">The Christians accepted him in Hungary.</span> <span id="s69">Well when was finished as a doctor, then he could work in the hospital you know.</span> <span id="s70">So he was working next to a surgeon and finally took him to Russia, to a slave – you know, slave labor camp, and disappeared and in 1943, in Voronezh, by the Don River.</span> <span id="s71">I don't know if you've ever heard it – it was a big push that time and he just disappeared and we never heard of him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">01:08:37 Then I had another brother, Andy.</span> <span id="s73">He was – he came to the United States in 1939, just in nick of the time.</span> <span id="s74">Just, with my uncle, escaped certain death you know from the.</span> <span id="s75">… Then we left home just one, one brother, Sandor, and, and my two sisters, mother and father 2 High school (German) and all my, my aunt my aunts and cousins and most of them, most of them, they were killed – mother and fathers, brothers, sisters, children.</span> <span id="s76">And one sister, Magda and I, who survived the, survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s77">So just I remembered when I, in 1943, like I told you, the antisemitism became so rampant in – and there were Jew-haters before, but in 1943 start getting so harsh on us.</span> <span id="s78">And we heard the cries like from Czechoslovakia, from Poland – “they're killing us,” you know.</span> <span id="s79">We didn't – who – we didn't want to believe it, you know, such a, stories you know.</span> <span id="s80">We wanted – thought here just rumors, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">01:10:13</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Where you had been up to this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I was – well, I was a furrier.</span> <span id="s84">I was working there because I learned to be a furrier in Miskolc.</span> <span id="s85">And then I went to work as a full-fledged fur-furrier in Budapest and, and, and Miskolc.</span> <span id="s86">Then of end of 1943 it was it was just, just unbearable and beginning of 1944 Jews couldn't – we couldn't travel.</span> <span id="s87">It was constant harassment, you know, for identification.</span> <span id="s88">And when the German came in March 1944 into Hungary, I was then 21 years old already and, and I….</span> <span id="s89">So, it was just awful.</span> <span id="s90">And you know start getting the Jews again disappearing, getting the Jews.</span> <span id="s91">And the Christian population – grown up together you know in the town – we used to know each other – whole families you know, became so anti-Jewish you know.</span> <span id="s92">Our neighbors and Jewish men used to walk on the street, used to – with, with the beard, used to grab – the Christian boys used to grab him and used to cut his, his beard through his neck.</span> <span id="s93">We had to see that, you know, many times.</span> <span id="s94">And they came to our houses and take inventory you know of the – we were 1,200 Jews.</span> <span id="s95">We lived in this little town with them 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s96">Between 5,000 were 1,200 Jews – women, men, children.</span> <span id="s97">And they took everybody's name and livestock, whatever have, you know, took inventory in the house, and used to rob, rob everything.</span> <span id="s98">Their food supplies, they tell us, “You know, you don't need – Jews, you don't need – you Jew bastards, you don't need this anymore.”</span> <span id="s99">So, my poor mother, you know she was she used to in desperation in desperation you know, to call the Lord to help us, you know – “Shema Israel.”</span> <span id="s100">She was determined.</span> <span id="s101">Seventy-one years old – my father was 71, and family looked up to my father and in his desperation looked up for, for help, you know, to Him.</span> <span id="s102">But he couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s103">He in desperation called the Lord, “Shema Israel.”</span></p> <p><span id="s104">01:13:52 Then they gathered, the first day they gathered the about three, 400 of us.</span> <span id="s105">I was one of them, one of the first transport because I had the, the induction papers going to the slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s106">So they gathered us three or four hundred and took us to the middle of this town.</span> <span id="s107">It was it was in a government building, the yar– their yard.</span> <span id="s108">The gendarmes, you know, the gendarmes, the gendarmes, with the bayonet fixed on the – they took helpless children and their mother's arms and old ladies and the women, the Rabbi and they told 3 Hear, O Israel (Hebrew); declaration of God’s unity and watchword of Jewish faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">everybody to undress.</span> <span id="s110">"What's the matter with you, Jew bastard, mother fuckers.</span> <span id="s111">Where you hiding your, your jewelry, necklaces?</span> <span id="s112">We going to find them.”</span> <span id="s113">And said, said, “Just spread your, spread your legs and, and bend over and keep your mouth open, you going to find.</span> <span id="s114">You bastard Jews."</span> <span id="s115">You know.</span> <span id="s116">So old religious women you know, that they never learned these words, you know, these nasty words and it never, didn't know how to act in front of strangers, you know, and they had to search them.</span> <span id="s117">And if anybody complained, the rifle butts came down on him, on that person, whatever – children whatever and the, and the little boys, they would try to shield their mothers.</span> <span id="s118">The cursing and hitting constantly, "You Jew bastards," you know the.</span> <span id="s119">… And they had to do a certain terrible searches you know, of little girls and little babies.</span> <span id="s120">The people on stretchers, they turned them over you know – they're, they're looking, looking for valuables, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">And the Chris-Christians outside the – you can look inside from outside you know, you could look inside the courtyard – the cheering, cheering on, you know, from the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">01:16:42 So and the next morning they herd us, everybody to rails.</span> <span id="s123">Everybody with stretcher to go to the railroad station and about six o'clock in the morning and there they had four boxcars there.</span> <span id="s124">They can – and everyone of them for about 400 Jews, you know, it gathered the first day.</span> <span id="s125">They took, they took us to Kassa, Kassa – that's a ghetto in, in Kassa.</span> <span id="s126">Kassa's Košice – same thing.</span> <span id="s127">It's about 70, 80 kilometers from my town.</span> <span id="s128">And they came with the – they herd – they were herding the Jews and some of them couldn't walk and finally I went – at the railroad station I went to the Rabbi I remember and he blessed me, you know.</span> <span id="s129">So, he told – said the old biblical blessing you know the "Yivarekhekha Adonai v'yishmerekha.</span> <span id="s130">Ya’eir Adonai panav eilekha vikhuneka.</span> <span id="s131">Yisa Adonai panav eilekha, v'yaseim lekha shalom.</span> <span id="s132">"And I looked in his eyes.</span> <span id="s133">I could have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.</span> <span id="s134">And put everybody in – when the train arrived they put everybody in-into the wagon, in the boxcars and they threw in a bucket or bucket you know for waste and wasn't enough for a one hour, you know, for someone to put 80 or 100 person one boxcars.</span> <span id="s135">They couldn't – just standing up, couldn't sit down.</span> <span id="s136">Cursing and the – “You Jew bastards,” you know.</span> <span id="s137">Some of them begging for water you know – not, not me, but a little girl, little baby.</span> <span id="s138">“You Jew bastards.</span> <span id="s139">Mother fuckers,” you know cursing.</span> <span id="s140">Nothing but help from the Christians, you know, some passengers helping, helping, they helped to step how high the boxcars from the throwing in the, helping, pushing and shoving into, the Jews into the boxcars.</span> <span id="s141">It took them maybe 10 hours to get in, to get into Kassa ghetto.</span> <span id="s142">There they were already, they have assigned places they could, they could have go.</span> <span id="s143">They were – but I had to go into the slave labor camp myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">01:20:00 Had to report.</span> <span id="s145">There were thousands and thousands of men up to thir–30, maybe 35, you 4 (May) the Lord bless and guard you/ (May) the Lord shine His face upon you and be gracious to you/ (May) the Lord lift His face to you and grant you peace.</span> <span id="s146">(Hebrew); priestly blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">know, in this labor camp.</span> <span id="s148">And they took my name.</span> <span id="s149">“What's your father's name?</span> <span id="s150">And what's the whore, whore name?</span> <span id="s151">What's my mother?”</span> <span id="s152">– they were call my mother, “the whore, the whore name,” you know, the, the – if anybody tried to complain that she's not a whore, then he didn't have too many teeth left in his mouth.</span> <span id="s153">They were there brutality, the – it was, was worse than the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s154">They were they were antisemitic and we know that.</span> <span id="s155">The Hungarian gendarmes were antisemitic , but they wanted to tease the – to show the Germans they were they could do, they could do better than they.</span> <span id="s156">And, and they were just bru– they were – the brutality was, I tell you, unspeakable.</span> <span id="s157">So in the Kassa, in the – when I was in the slave labor camp, they didn't do much and but I heard that they got – they – I find out where's they’re – from the ghetto actually they took the Jews into a brick factory – about 30,000 of them from Kassa, from the area of Kassa, Košice.</span> <span id="s158">It was a brick factory and I want to see my family.</span> <span id="s159">They're all there.</span> <span id="s160">And my girlfriend, she was only 16, 16½ and I was 21.</span> <span id="s161">Just want to see them again.</span> <span id="s162">But to get inside you know, in the – into the brick factory was just as, it was it was terrible you know.</span> <span id="s163">They would, could shot you on sight, you know the….</span> <span id="s164">So, what I did with the risk of my life, I took off my yellow star and arm band, yellow arm band.</span> <span id="s165">And I approached the gate.</span> <span id="s166">So said to me, "You, what are you doing outside, you Jew bastard.</span> <span id="s167">What you doing out?"</span> <span id="s168">I said – I remember I said, “I went out with the” – I lied to them that I went out with the funeral detail from the camp and they coming after me.</span> <span id="s169">So they finally believed, believed in me you know, otherwise they would shoot me right there to the German, German shepherd.</span> <span id="s170">They were surrounded you know, this ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:22:50 Finally, I went in.</span> <span id="s172">I found my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s173">And my mother was so worried that somebody going to, you know, find me and they shoot me right, right away.</span> <span id="s174">It was no buts, you know.</span> <span id="s175">This was slightest punishment for the Jew – they shoot him.</span> <span id="s176">But they wanted to take him, you know.</span> <span id="s177">They really didn't want to shoot them – they, you know – right there.</span> <span id="s178">They want to take everybody out away you know from the extermination camp.</span> <span id="s179">So it was a big problem how to get out from the brick factory.</span> <span id="s180">So finally with another lie I said – with another funeral detail, I got out, you know, from the area, and I went back to my, my unit, you know, to the slave labor camp.</span> <span id="s181">And May, it was May 15th when I heard that they're going to ship them out.</span> <span id="s182">They're going to take them to further.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">We didn't know exactly where they're going to take them but we know already they take them to, out of the country, you know.</span> <span id="s184">The ghetto – they going to liquidate the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Not the ghetto, the factory but actually it was a ghetto and factory.</span> <span id="s186">So I tried to get in.</span> <span id="s187">I tried to go out and get in.</span> <span id="s188">I could get out from the forced labor camp easier but to get into the ghetto it was impossible already.</span> <span id="s189">The trains, they just pull-pulled into, into the – directly into the boxcars in into the brick factory, and 10,000 they can fit in hundred boxcars.</span> <span id="s190">They put them in-into the into the boxcars without any food or water.</span> <span id="s191">And they ship them to Auschwitz, from there directly to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s192">10, 20 of them, 30 of them were dead; they were when they arrived.</span> <span id="s193">That's what I heard already from – my sister told me.</span> <span id="s194">She was with them.</span> <span id="s195">She, then she told me from there on, because I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s196">But she told me then what happened after and when they arrived to, half-dead, you know, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s197">And without food and water the little babies you know – they couldn't sit down.</span> <span id="s198">They were – they were pulling them out by their hair from, the from the wagons.</span> <span id="s199">"Raus,you verfluchte Juden."</span> <span id="s200">You know, they were speaking German there already.</span> <span id="s201">"Raus, you bastard Jews!”</span> <span id="s202">You know, and they're worse, they're, they're worse.</span> <span id="s203">Didn't know what's what, you know.</span> <span id="s204">They were, they were half dead.</span> <span id="s205">They were lined them up and she said and it was in distance – there were thousands of them.</span> <span id="s206">You know, 10s – 10,000.</span> <span id="s207">There was a nice gentleman there with the, the white glove and just pointing on which side they should go, you know, the left or the right.</span> <span id="s208">Children, with babies and my sister had a little – she was a two year old little girl.</span> <span id="s209">She was so cute.</span> <span id="s210">She right away to the left, they sent her mother and my father, my older brother – he was Sandor.</span> <span id="s211">He was at that time 47, 48, and my sister Mag-Magda she was, the only one sent to the right, you know, to, to work.</span> <span id="s212">And the rest of them, first they went, there was a preparation room and, and they used to cut their hair and they thought they're going into the show – into take a shower, you know.</span> <span id="s213">Then they realized that it was too late, you know.</span> <span id="s214">The, the doors closed and the rest is history.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">01:27:12 But after that they shipped us out to further, further.</span> <span id="s216">We – first we thought we going, send us also to the East.</span> <span id="s217">East was almost certain death.</span> <span id="s218">And West was to give you a little time to live.</span> <span id="s219">So we, so we lived.</span> <span id="s220">I was a furrier.</span> <span id="s221">And they wanted us to work, you know, as a – working for the government you know, to manufacture linings for soldiers you know, from fur, you know, into coats.</span> <span id="s222">And tailors, they were – their different job to make different things.</span> <span id="s223">We were hundreds of them, thousands you know.</span> <span id="s224">And different trades they have – did different things.</span> <span id="s225">First they shipped, we went to a place where we stayed there for a month, then we – they shipped us to, to catalogue the ghettos in Győngyős.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">There was a little town, nice urban town named Győngyős, about 20, 25,000 people.</span> <span id="s227">And our job was, as a furrier my job was to catalogue – we were about two, three furriers – to catalogue furs, you know, what they gathered from the Jews.</span> <span id="s228">That was a sorry sight I'm telling you, these ghettos you know.</span> <span id="s229">The – to see this, the Torahs, you know, scattered around – baby clothes, everybody cried.</span> <span id="s230">We were young.</span> <span id="s231">So some of them even – we were there for a couple of months but some of them guys even spirited out Torah scrolls.</span> <span id="s232">They were wrapping around their bodies, you know, with the – and they spirited out the Torah scrolls to have a minyan.</span> <span id="s233">They still believed in God.</span> <span id="s234">They believe in God, so hard.</span> <span id="s235">Sometimes I wondered; we all wondered.</span> <span id="s236">“We were the chosen, we were the chosen” – sometimes believe you, it, everything was a bullshit.</span> <span id="s237">But nevertheless we always go back to God, you know, because we learned you know.</span> <span id="s238">That's the way we brought us up.</span> <span id="s239">And questioning God present creator, the – real believer if he questions something you know, the existence of God – he shouldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">01:30:20 5 Get out (German) 6 Damned Jews (German) I was, I remember when I was in this camp, and one afternoon, the Kommandant came and said to us – we were about 20, 2,500 people in this camp – he said to us, he said, “Any, any of you wants to turn into Christian faith you can do so.</span> <span id="s241">You have to go to the church and, and kneel down, and, and, and become Christian.</span> <span id="s242">Then you can save your save your life.”</span> <span id="s243">So you know a drowning man can, he can try to lift with, try to lift up himself with a razor blade, you know, from the water – you know, to save himself.</span> <span id="s244">And 99 percent of the Jews in this camp, they went to church and I myself I've never been a religious man even though my grandfather was very religious, was a Talmud khakhem.</span> <span id="s245">And my mother used to have a sheitl – and all her sisters.</span> <span id="s246">I've never been religious, but I just couldn't go to kneel down in, in the church.</span> <span id="s247">I don't know.</span> <span id="s248">I just – I said I'd rather die, you know.</span> <span id="s249">I remember when these boys came back you, know, from church, they felt Christians.</span> <span id="s250">And they were goose-stepping like Christian boys, you know.</span> <span id="s251">They had their, their, their face was shined, you know, up.</span> <span id="s252">And I – then I feeled – felt sorry for God.</span> <span id="s253">I was sorry for them.</span> <span id="s254">They thought they were delivered from the winds of war to survive.</span> <span id="s255">They all died.</span> <span id="s256">They all died.</span> <span id="s257">Didn't help them, but they thought that it will help them because they turned to the Christian faith.</span> <span id="s258">Nothing could have helped them.</span> <span id="s259">Even they were their great grandfather was Jewish, they were, they were good as good as the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">01:33:28 So and later on matter of fact, that was after – I was just going back to these episodes – that when I went to, I went to Israel in 1976, and I went to the Yad Vashem and I passed a monument in the middle of the Yad Vashem and was written that anybody didn't left his faith under duress, you know, is holy something, you know.</span> <span id="s261">So I said, “What is it talking about?”</span> <span id="s262">So I went back.</span> <span id="s263">I read it again, you know, went back.</span> <span id="s264">I, I read it so it was, then I felt good about myself you know that, not because what's a different Christian and the Jews, you know, how they come from the same, they're all Semites you know, the same thing as Jesus Christ was a rabbi himself and I'm sure he'd teach his followers to obeyed his teachings, and every time they didn't listen to him, so such a beautiful words – “Thy, our Father, which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom comes, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”</span> <span id="s265">These beautiful words, they should listen and they should teach their children to honor their savior, the Jesus Christ.</span> <span id="s266">They should listen, they should listen and the Christian clergy, they were teaching hatred against us.</span> <span id="s267">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Many times we asking why they hate us so much.</span> <span id="s269">And they – how many times we try to shake their hands, even in the darkest nights, to be our friends and neighbors.</span> <span id="s270">They'd always, they'd always denied their friendship to us and as always blamed their Christian clergy because they are the ones, they are the one, they are, they teach their the, the children of the Christian faith to be antisemitic .</span> <span id="s271">They always did, and it's – and evidently it's didn't stop yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">01:36:30</span></p> <p><span id="s273">7 Sage (Yiddish) So when I was in this camp when we went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s274">And we worked for the war effort, as a furrier and tailors worked for the different things for, for the government.</span> <span id="s275">And how many times we used to get the, the air raids and the, the bombs used to explode, you know, in height in heights and it was saturated bombing.</span> <span id="s276">How many times 30, 40 feet from me bombs used to explode and here I am to tell you my story.</span> <span id="s277">And then I without a scratch, didn't hit me.</span> <span id="s278">In this camp, one time, it was September 1944, when the underground organization in Budapest approached us, few of us, and asked us if we wanted to join the underground fighters.</span> <span id="s279">I said, “Yes, of course,” I said.</span> <span id="s280">So they told us, “Look, you – sooner or later they're going to kill you.</span> <span id="s281">It's just a matter of time.”</span> <span id="s282">They said, “Why don't you just die with your gun in your hand rather than wait for it, wait till they shoot you.”</span> <span id="s283">So two, 300 of us joined the – said, “yes.”</span> <span id="s284">At a certain time because it was always dark in the night, you know.</span> <span id="s285">It was no light was allowed during wartime.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Otherwise the airplanes coming for surveillance or bombing, they could pinpoint the area easier.</span> <span id="s287">So, it had to be always dark, darkness.</span> <span id="s288">So on a certain date we dug under the fence in our compound and during the night we slipped out under the other side of the fence, and they were waiting for us with pistols.</span> <span id="s289">And they used to – they gave us a pistol and a couple of rounds, couple of magazines of bullets, rounds.</span> <span id="s290">And they told us that anybody wants to ask for identification, shoot them right away.</span> <span id="s291">Had to shoot them, otherwise they'd shoot you.</span> <span id="s292">Because as a Jew – they what they did is, when they asked for identification from you, and they wasn't satisfied with it, they used to take you under the door, and you had to show your penis.</span> <span id="s293">It was only Jews, they were they were circumcised in Europe.</span> <span id="s294">So if they showed, they show you your penis they'll shoot you right on the spot, so we had to shoot them.</span> <span id="s295">That was an order, to shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">01:39:56 And again we got into the this safe houses, you know, when the this underground fighters they gave us directions you know which way to go and how to get there.</span> <span id="s297">We were a little familiar with the area.</span> <span id="s298">We got there so the our command– the commandant, you know, the commandant, he was he was he was 22 years old you know, but he spoke fluent German so he was questioning us, you know, if he want to be sure you know, we're Jew, we're Jewish.</span> <span id="s299">And we had to show him our penis, you know, we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s300">In a couple of days he was crash training – how to use small arms, fire arms and machine guns and grenades, how to throw effectively and in after two days we went to our first job.</span> <span id="s301">So there were about 15 of us.</span> <span id="s302">So I asked him, where we asked the lieutenant – we used to call him lieutenant, he was 22 years.</span> <span id="s303">His name was Laci, Leslie you know in English.</span> <span id="s304">So he said, “You'll find out where we're going.</span> <span id="s305">So, first we had to steal a truck.”</span> <span id="s306">A couple of boys knew how to drive, so they saw a truck and we used to follow each other about 50 feet, you know, not to be suspicious you know during the – it was dark, very dark.</span> <span id="s307">So they find the truck.</span> <span id="s308">They put the, cross the wires, and off we went outskirts to Budapest, because Budapest is two – the River Danube divides it.</span> <span id="s309">One side is Pest.</span> <span id="s310">One side is Buda.</span> <span id="s311">So, that's why they call it “Budapest.”</span> <span id="s312">So, we went to Buda, the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s313">So, finally we had a discussion that says we're going into this ammunition dump, but it was circled and was pro-protected with the Hungarian patrol.</span> <span id="s314">So, he went there by himself alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">01:42:17 He was dressed as a Hungarian officer uniform.</span> <span id="s316">He spoke fluent German and Hungarian, of course.</span> <span id="s317">He was asking for the – he was asking direction.</span> <span id="s318">So, we park that truck, you know, for a short distance from this ammunition dump.</span> <span id="s319">Two guys, both side, two, always two of us one side and two on the other side.</span> <span id="s320">Two patrols.</span> <span id="s321">We grabbed the patrol.</span> <span id="s322">We was told what to do you know before.</span> <span id="s323">Close his mouth with the bayonet, you know.</span> <span id="s324">We had to stab him that many times and this has to be repeated about two, three times before we got into the ammunition factory, dump, dump site.</span> <span id="s325">So there we gathered all we could – the most important thing was mine – to get mines to – because our purpose was to delay their supplies and sabotage their trains, you know, the supply.</span> <span id="s326">So we got as many, much heavy machine guns can and grenades and mines, as much as we could carry, you know, 15 people.</span> <span id="s327">And we loaded the truck – we loaded – got the truck loaded and about two sappers stayed behind to, you know what a sapper is.</span> <span id="s328">They put four, five different places but mines in into the ammunition dump in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s329">Didn't go more than 500 yards.</span> <span id="s330">We saw the like a fires – what do you call it – blaze, you know.</span> <span id="s331">It was like we destroyed the ammunition dump you know, when it were up.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">01:44:26 They were searching for us all over you know.</span> <span id="s333">And they were going to spy, disperse the personnel, you know.</span> <span id="s334">They had to hide.</span> <span id="s335">The mine was the most important thing we have to go in during the evening at night to mine the railroads and bridges.</span> <span id="s336">So, but they start to repairing it you know, the faster and faster, the because they had no more men than we were, you know, the army, you know, the Hungarian army and German collaborators.</span> <span id="s337">So it was, it was – I remember the date – was it September, September 1944, and Horthy,I told you that Horthy Miklós – he was chancellor already in Hungary, and this visit came out from Hungary on a false pretense and this Jew-hater Szálasi,he took over the reign, and he was a well-known Jew-hater.</span> <span id="s338">He was worse than Horthy Miklós, but when he spirited Horthy Miklós out they called him he was he was a Jewish collaborator already, Horthy Miklós.</span> <span id="s339">Besides they call him anything else.</span> <span id="s340">So in March, in September seven – 17, we heard on the radio that they going to make a big parade, when they took over the reign from Horthy, on Vilmos császár street in Hungary.</span> <span id="s341">So we had the order from the American and British intelligence, because we worked for them because that's the underground fighter – they told us that we actually worked for the British-American intelligence.</span> <span id="s342">And we got our reward – they will reward us you know after the – after we do a good jo– good job.</span> <span id="s343">Who cares what they going to reward us?</span> <span id="s344">What they going to do?</span> <span id="s345">But nevertheless, about 200 of us waited for the columns of the parade on Vilmos császár</span></p> <p><span id="s346">8 Miklós Horthy</span></p> <p><span id="s347">9 Ferenc Szálasi street.</span> <span id="s348">We, the night before we placed heavy machine gun and all kind of fire equipment, you know, with submachine gun and grenades and you name it.</span> <span id="s349">We had it.</span> <span id="s350">Pistols, were 200 of us.</span> <span id="s351">Two hundred people, you know, could do a lot of lot of damage.</span> <span id="s352">I remember the waiting in the windows and from the cellars, wherever we were stationed.</span> <span id="s353">And we heard the column.</span> <span id="s354">The column was coming and saw the cheering of the Christians well wishers, you know, with the fascist flags.</span> <span id="s355">They were waving fascist flags and, and sitting on – they have trucks and spick-and-span uniforms, you know, the people who go on the parade.</span> <span id="s356">‘Give them, give them three cheers,” you know.</span> <span id="s357">“Salute.”</span> <span id="s358">And then we gave them the three cheers from our guns.</span> <span id="s359">And 300, 200 angry Jews, they can do a lot of dam – do a lot of damage for them.</span> <span id="s360">We figured that if we do lot of damage you know for the Szálasi regime, then some of the Budapest population might join us you know, to and fight for to end the war, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">01:48:43 But no.</span> <span id="s362">It didn't happen didn't happen that way at all, and our and our job was to sabotage the railroads again, again, again, but they were, like I said, they were fixing them up and faster and faster.</span> <span id="s363">And we became the spies personnel you know.</span> <span id="s364">They were looking for us all, all the time.</span> <span id="s365">And – but luckily the areas you know, during the day, everybody was running for shelters, you know.</span> <span id="s366">They didn't have a chance.</span> <span id="s367">They didn't look for us so much, but nevertheless we – our unit as a underground fighter became obsolete in Budapest.</span> <span id="s368">We was, just couldn't do much.</span> <span id="s369">We, I didn't say, I tell you about, we saw so many times that this Fascist used to come in, used to bring, gather the Jews, used to catch them on the street or in the ghettos in Budapest.</span> <span id="s370">Used to bring them, just hundreds of hundreds.</span> <span id="s371">Used to line them up aside of the River Danube.</span> <span id="s372">Used to just machine gun them down, with babies and children, and anybody didn't fall, they just used to kick them right into the river.</span> <span id="s373">And only a few Christian on-lookers, and helpers.</span> <span id="s374">And it happened so many times, so many times.</span> <span id="s375">And nobody helped.</span> <span id="s376">No thundering and no lightening from above.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">01:50:31</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: May I ask you something?</span> <span id="s379">When you were standing in the windows and you were shooting down at the parade.</span> <span id="s380">What happened?</span> <span id="s381">What was the result of all that shooting?</span> <span id="s382">Were a lot of people killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Did a lot of damage.</span> <span id="s384">A lot of people killed.</span> <span id="s385">Hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s386">Hundreds of people died in that street, on that day and but most of us escaped.</span> <span id="s387">We're under, you know the tunnels and we already knew how to get out you know.</span> <span id="s388">We left all the guns, heavy equipment, mortars, whatever we, what we didn't use.</span> <span id="s389">Only kept a pistol on us.</span> <span id="s390">And the reason was that anybody who got wounded, you know, our comrades, we couldn't leave them alive anymore.</span> <span id="s391">If we couldn't take them to the safe house some how, then we had to shoot, three of us had to shoot him.</span> <span id="s392">Because a wounded man is a tell-tale.</span> <span id="s393">He tells everything, you know, a wounded man.</span> <span id="s394">And that was a good philosophy.</span> <span id="s395">That was – they told us already before hand, “If you got wounded you're a dead man.</span> <span id="s396">If you are wounded so badly we cannot help you.</span> <span id="s397">We cannot take you to hospitals” It was known, we can't get them into hospitals.</span> <span id="s398">“You you'll be killed, because you going to everything and you have to.”</span> <span id="s399">That's why they told us we had, when somebody asking for our identification, we had to shoot them right away.</span> <span id="s400">So, anyway and had to do it so many times, for little boys, boys.</span> <span id="s401">They looked like 14, 15, you know, from the lack of food and lack of vitamins.</span> <span id="s402">So anyway we went; we escaped.</span> <span id="s403">We went down west of Budapest, and we joined – we was, it was getting so hard.</span> <span id="s404">We couldn't stay there.</span> <span id="s405">But we were very sorry later what happened.</span> <span id="s406">But nevertheless we joined forced labor camp and we told the Kommandant that I our guards disappeared.</span> <span id="s407">It wasn't unusual at that time you know, because the, the Russian was coming.</span> <span id="s408">They were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">01:53:33 They, the Christian boys, the gendarmes and the guards, they would like to be, you know, with a gun in their hands.</span> <span id="s410">They don't want to be on the other side of the of the gun.</span> <span id="s411">Did not want to be.</span> <span id="s412">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s413">They went home.</span> <span id="s414">They went someplace.</span> <span id="s415">They were hiding.</span> <span id="s416">So the Kommandant there, our Kommandant acknowledged it.</span> <span id="s417">But that time the, the, the Hungarian Kommandant didn't have too much of the say-so, you know, and the Germans took over us.</span> <span id="s418">That was 200 kilometers from Budapest, west of Budapest.</span> <span id="s419">It was maybe 30 kilometers from Austria, 30 kilometers from Austria.</span> <span id="s420">So one day, the German guard took us over to Schachendorf concentration camp.</span> <span id="s421">We had to march through the, the border, Hungarian-Austrian border.</span> <span id="s422">We marched through, at the border, border we had to undress, and took everything away.</span> <span id="s423">Just left whatever pair of pants, two pair of pants or whatever you had, some clothes.</span> <span id="s424">Some of them didn't have winter coat.</span> <span id="s425">In the winter it's very cold in the Austrian, in the Alps.</span> <span id="s426">And our job was to dig trenches and train tracks in this concentration camp, in Schachendorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: I think at this point I want to stop.</span> <span id="s428">We have to change tapes.</span> <span id="s429">Let's do that and then we'll pick up with Schachendorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">01:53:12</span></p> <p><span id="s432">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s433">02:00:26</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Let's take it – you're now in Schachendorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: In Schachendorf, yeah, in – Schachendorf is a concentration camp about 20, 25, 30,000 laborers, Jewish boys between – none of them was more than 30.</span> <span id="s436">The best maybe 30 to 35.</span> <span id="s437">First of all after 35, you couldn't survive in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s438">You hardly, you just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s439">It was – I remember when we when we arrived into Schachendorf, it was snowing and very cold in the winter, you know, end of December in the Alps.</span> <span id="s440">And the Kommandant came out and said to us "Du verfluchten Juden."</span> <span id="s441">You know, it means you know, "You cursed Jews.</span> <span id="s442">Here you have to work, not with your brain, not with you brow, not with your brains.”</span> <span id="s443">So he assigned a barrack, a barrack, you know, like used to held animals you know.</span> <span id="s444">It was a long barracks, maybe I figure about two, 300 people would fit in it.</span> <span id="s445">But they put us about six, 700 people into this barrack, so we didn't have space to – we have, we had bleachers.</span> <span id="s446">They used to call it bleachers, you know, like bunks you know.</span> <span id="s447">Three, three bunks you know on top of each other.</span> <span id="s448">We had to lay down you know next to each other like sardines.</span> <span id="s449">And just a little row, you know, just to squeeze, pass by.</span> <span id="s450">And you know, in this environment, you know, the, the epidemic very, you know, very easily occurs.</span> <span id="s451">You know, because the lice and then the typhus fever it was rampant before.</span> <span id="s452">I remember even back in, in Budapest in this camp where I was, everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s453">It was a life sen– a life sentence, you know.</span> <span id="s454">I mean it's a death sentence.</span> <span id="s455">Used to take, take them out.</span> <span id="s456">Couldn't work.</span> <span id="s457">As long as you could have worked, you was alright, you know.</span> <span id="s458">After you couldn't work, you were obsolete.</span> <span id="s459">So used to take them in the trucks, you know, take them out.</span> <span id="s460">You know, used by night used to come in and they couldn't, some of them couldn't move, you know, sick.</span> <span id="s461">And they just pulled them out and was pleading, you know – “please, please,” because they know, you know, that once they take them out, he was dead.</span> <span id="s462">And, “Please, just give me time.</span> <span id="s463">I'm not that sick.”</span> <span id="s464">You know, was pleading with the guards.</span> <span id="s465">They said, “Don't worry.</span> <span id="s466">We take you to the sanatorium,” you know.</span> <span id="s467">‘We'll take care of you,” you know.</span> <span id="s468">They knew.</span> <span id="s469">They were – they knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s470">They just take them to the woods.</span> <span id="s471">They used to shoot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">02:03:43 So, what happened – this, this, this Schachendorf, I'm going back to.</span> <span id="s473">The Kommandant says, “At five o'clock in the morning, you get up in the morning and you go to work.</span> <span id="s474">You go to work as long as you can.</span> <span id="s475">After you cannot work, you, you become obsolete.”</span> <span id="s476">So in the morning we lined up and we used to get a pishke– you know what a “pishke” is?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Like a, a little beat-up container, you know, you got the food, you know, you call it “pishke.”</span> <span id="s478">So everybody used to have one.</span> <span id="s479">You know, just in case you get some food, you</span></p> <p><span id="s480">10 Alms-box (Yiddish) know.</span> <span id="s481">So in the cold, you know, we had to stay hours, you know.</span> <span id="s482">You got we got a little tea, no sugar or anything.</span> <span id="s483">And they told us you got a piece of bread at supper time.</span> <span id="s484">You come, come back.</span> <span id="s485">So everybody got pick axe and, and shovel and whatever tools necessary to dig trenches you know.</span> <span id="s486">We always had to run to work.</span> <span id="s487">Always the Germans with thousands of us and the German Shepherd, they were trained, you know, to – they were trained to kill, you know, the German Shepherd with their handlers, not so polite handlers.</span> <span id="s488">The only reason they were the handl– they were handlers because otherwise they would send them to the Front.</span> <span id="s489">So they were trying to do the best job, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">They were seasoned Jew-haters, you know, and so they were every single day, you know, the running.</span> <span id="s491">And we had to run for our lives because they used to shoot the last guys who was running.</span> <span id="s492">Used to kill them.</span> <span id="s493">So nobody wanted to, you know, you have the instinct to live.</span> <span id="s494">So everybody tried to hide from the other, and they were shooting them constantly.</span> <span id="s495">And sometimes 10, 15 guys, they got killed, you know, just running to work.</span> <span id="s496">You know, they were laughing, you know, these guards.</span> <span id="s497">They were German – they were I don't know what kind of people they were there, but they spoke German but many times they used to just take them out from prisons you know, some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">02:05:55 And to, to break the ground during the, the winter time you know in the Alps was first they had to pick, guy with the pick axe had to chop through pieces by pieces the ground.</span> <span id="s499">And once you went down maybe 12 inches you know, it was easier to work.</span> <span id="s500">And sometimes you used to find some roots there you know.</span> <span id="s501">It tasted so delicious, so...like onions you know, tasted, you know.</span> <span id="s502">We used to eat anything.</span> <span id="s503">Grass or tree barks, as long as we could have chewed, the – chew it and swallow it, we eat it because we didn't get food.</span> <span id="s504">At night when we went back, we had to run constantly because the shooting, you know, the Germans – us, "Faster!</span> <span id="s505">Lauf!</span> <span id="s506">Lauf!</span> <span id="s507">"You didn't want to get shoot – shot, so you arrived to supper time, six, seven o'clock, you know, at the compound and there's a couple of two, three Jewish boys with a big container used to call it – with big pots.</span> <span id="s508">Used to have potato peels, you know, used to – the German guard, we had about 50, 60 guards.</span> <span id="s509">I don't know how many guards, you know, there exactly, about 50, I suppose – we used to get potatoes every – the menu you know, is something else, but we used to have potatoes almost every day.</span> <span id="s510">And for the 50 guards they'd peel the potatoes and they used to cook soup for thousands of, two, three thousands of boys, Jews, laborers.</span> <span id="s511">And you were lucky if you get two, three pieces of potato peels with no seasoning, anything.</span> <span id="s512">And before you went into the barracks, you got a piece of, small piece of bread.</span> <span id="s513">But so many times we used to come back, and even that, couple of piece of potato peel wasn't, it wasn't enough for so many people, so it didn't have 50 to 100 guys, you know, kids, didn't have even that little soup, you know, they called it.</span> <span id="s514">Water.</span> <span id="s515">They were crying they were so young, so young – used to give them a spoonful, you know, a sip, you know, each of us tried to give them a sip of soup.</span> <span id="s516">And our dreams, about food, got was so constant, so constant always.</span> <span id="s517">What would you – what – how much you could eat – a loaf</span></p> <p><span id="s518">11 Run (German) of bread.</span> <span id="s519">You know, if you ate a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s520">And what else?</span> <span id="s521">There was – there were even lying some of them.</span> <span id="s522">There were, were dreams, such stories, you know, about food, you know, what they dreamt about what, what they had, you know, eat in dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">02:08:56 And they were, they had a – the Kommandant told – that was a system that they told us before hand that anybody was trying to escape – so many times you know, people, kids, they tried to escape from their from their environment.</span> <span id="s524">So anybody tried to escape their whole area, you know, barrack, would be – every 10 men will die, you know, into that area, in that barrack.</span> <span id="s525">So one night we were at – it was heavy snow.</span> <span id="s526">Temperature must have been 20 degrees below zero, you know, in the Alps.</span> <span id="s527">And the boys just were staying in Appell,you know, Appell they used to call.</span> <span id="s528">Didn't want to – some of them said wait for, you know, we begged, you know, to not to go to work, you know.</span> <span id="s529">And even the dogs who was, you know, they were hiding you know, next to their handlers.</span> <span id="s530">And but the Kommandant came out, "Lauf, you verfluchte Juden.Raus, oder jeden eine wird erschossen."</span> <span id="s531">“Each and every one of you will be shot.”</span> <span id="s532">So one of the guys finally got up and said "Raus!</span> <span id="s533">Go to Arbeit,"you know, so we ran and we ran and we jumped into the trenches.</span> <span id="s534">I remember one time I was in this trench and I find some, some roots, tasted like potatoes.</span> <span id="s535">And I was hiding it in my pocket.</span> <span id="s536">I had roots, you know.</span> <span id="s537">It was food you know.</span> <span id="s538">It wasn't potatoes, but it was some kind of root, but you ta– you ate anything what you could put in your mouth, and you could have chew it, and it would taste something, you know – you ate it.</span> <span id="s539">You didn't care about what you get diarrhea or whatever.</span> <span id="s540">So, so a guard noticed of me, you know, I wasn't working.</span> <span id="s541">I was full of roots.</span> <span id="s542">And said, "Du bist verfluchter Jude.Was hast du dorten?Was hast du in deine Tasche?</span> <span id="s543">"18 So we had to show, show him the – and he was angry.</span> <span id="s544">He stabbed me in my thigh, upper thigh, and, and hit me with the rifle butts on my left eye.</span> <span id="s545">The blood was dripping out and I was – then I remember of my white roots, so always remembered my white roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">02:11:53 So anyway, we went back to the – that night we had to run again, shooting as usual.</span> <span id="s547">And two of the guys in the blizzard, they tried to escape from our barrack, and the guard caught them with the dog.</span> <span id="s548">And they said, “The next morning, every 10 men will be shot.”</span> <span id="s549">Well, you know, we figured that it's a very high price to pay, you know, for was about 450, 500 people at that time, you know, in our barrack.</span> <span id="s550">The rest of them already died.</span> <span id="s551">We 12 Roll call (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s552">13 Damned Jews (German) 14 Get out, or each one will be shot (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s553">15 Work (German) 16 You’re a damned Jew (German) 17 What do you have over there?</span> <span id="s554">(German) 18 What do you have in your pocket?</span> <span id="s555">(German) had – 45 men – hard, hard price to pay for two souls.</span> <span id="s556">So the people start praying, davening, you know.</span> <span id="s557">“Adonai Hoshienu,”“Please God, help us,” you know that means “Adonai Hoshienu.”</span> <span id="s558">Pray all night – it was bent in devotion.</span> <span id="s559">So we got out in the freezing and the Kommandant came out.</span> <span id="s560">He said to us, “For your punishment,” he said, “no tea for one week.</span> <span id="s561">No bread for one week.”</span> <span id="s562">And he said, “This time I'm not going to execute the 45 men, just to show you my good intention,” he said.</span> <span id="s563">So we were jubilant, you know, nevertheless you know, to one more day, you know, to live one more day, you know.</span> <span id="s564">You have an instinct in you, built in.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">02:13:57 So, but it was, it was in March, and we, I wasn't more than maybe 80 pounds that time and people started developing that from the lice, itching.</span> <span id="s566">We had rashes all, all over from the lice and – but we have about three Jewish doctors in our in our in our barrack.</span> <span id="s567">They had no medicine to give us, anything.</span> <span id="s568">They were trying to survive themselves.</span> <span id="s569">But they didn't want to tell any – the guards that there was typhus.</span> <span id="s570">They knew there the typhus fever from the – they used to call “Fleckfieber,”“typhus fever,” and otherwise they would shoot every-everybody.</span> <span id="s571">They usually used to do what, they pour this to hurt – herd everybody in inside the barrack and pour flammable material, benzene, whatever it is, around the barrack and then – and burn them.</span> <span id="s572">Anybody start to escape, they used to machine gun them down.</span> <span id="s573">That was their usual thing, which was the outbreak of the epidemic.</span> <span id="s574">So these boys decide to hide.</span> <span id="s575">Doctors tried to – they were trying to hiding the epidemic.</span> <span id="s576">So I used to see them, the boys you know, we had – we used to have a latrine behind this barrack where we used to stay, about 30 feet long and about four, five feet deep and about four feet wide.</span> <span id="s577">Used to have a big plank, you know, used to sit down, you know, the latrine.</span> <span id="s578">It was open.</span> <span id="s579">Everybody could have find it just by the smell.</span> <span id="s580">It wasn't well you see, the little, the boys used to go out and sit on the latrine and they were so weak from hunger, sick – they just fell into and nobody could have helped them.</span> <span id="s581">They just tried to come out, you know, from the – they drowned.</span> <span id="s582">They tried – such a waste.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Such a terrible – to see a human being discarded.</span> <span id="s584">And we, we didn't help him, because he was dead already.</span> <span id="s585">He was half-dead when he went there.</span> <span id="s586">It, it was they would shoot him anyway and to die in a latrine.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">02:16:46 So, the Kommandant used to get some men, you know, from Hungary, you know, from the camps, wherever.</span> <span id="s588">But the Russian, they were start coming but, you know, they, advancing – the forces, the Russian forces, you know, in our area.</span> <span id="s589">First we thought they are thundering you know.</span> <span id="s590">It was in early March.</span> <span id="s591">It was maybe rain, thunder.</span> <span id="s592">But it wasn't thunder.</span> <span id="s593">It was – it was big guns they were.</span> <span id="s594">But nevertheless, finally I came down with the typhus fever myself.</span> <span id="s595">And the doctor said to me, “I….”</span> <span id="s596">Said to me – came to me, I – 19 Lord, save us (Hebrew)</span></p> <p><span id="s597">20 Typhus (German) said, “Look, you can't go out to work anymore.</span> <span id="s598">We will take care of you.”</span> <span id="s599">I knew what's the story.</span> <span id="s600">I wasn't more than 70 pounds, I suppose, at that time.</span> <span id="s601">Was all bones.</span> <span id="s602">So that just before the Kommandant said to us, that he want to raise the bread and, and the tea – “We'll give you more if you work more.”</span> <span id="s603">They couldn't get anymore men.</span> <span id="s604">But it was too late.</span> <span id="s605">We couldn't help.</span> <span id="s606">We were lethargic.</span> <span id="s607">We didn't care about things then at that point.</span> <span id="s608">And then when I got sick, he told me to stay home, “Stay here.</span> <span id="s609">We'll take care of you.”</span> <span id="s610">And that was the last thing I heard.</span> <span id="s611">I was on the – I couldn't get up from the, from the bunk.</span> <span id="s612">And I remember that I felt it was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s613">I felt so serene, relaxed.</span> <span id="s614">I didn't care about a thing anymore.</span> <span id="s615">Even, and I just figured that, “This is end of my journey.”</span> <span id="s616">And evidently I lost conscious.</span> <span id="s617">The only – when I woke up, I woke up from a smell.</span> <span id="s618">I don't know how long I was unconscious, maybe a day or two, but if because if I would have been alive, they would have shot me, or stabbed me with the bayonets stabbed, would have killed me.</span> <span id="s619">But – the Russian forces that came so rapid-rapidly they advanced – they had to pull out fast.</span> <span id="s620">And they didn't have much time to look around.</span> <span id="s621">Maybe I was – I didn't have any motion.</span> <span id="s622">Didn't show any motion in where I was.</span> <span id="s623">Probably, I was in a coma, in a temporary coma, whatever.</span> <span id="s624">And they left me.</span> <span id="s625">When I woke up, that I, from the smell.</span> <span id="s626">What happened is that I was, when I was on the bunk on the sleeping ,or sta– laying down, there was a little hole for air, you know, on the wall – not a window, just a little hole.</span> <span id="s627">So through that hole the bombs they exploded in the latrine and sprayed the, the life-giving ammonia smell on me.</span> <span id="s628">Was all covered with the feces, of human feces.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">And I woke up from the smell.</span> <span id="s630">And I looked around.</span> <span id="s631">I couldn't move.</span> <span id="s632">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s633">And I saw hundreds of bodies of boys that di– they were dead, dead.</span> <span id="s634">Motionless in a form of different grotesque of motioning – you know, they was frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">02:21:18 And I looked to the door.</span> <span id="s636">I saw a man in uniform at the door.</span> <span id="s637">He didn't come in.</span> <span id="s638">He was afraid to come in, with a, with a sub-machine gun.</span> <span id="s639">And I saw him.</span> <span id="s640">He was motioning at me to come outside.</span> <span id="s641">Well, I was trying to get out, get down.</span> <span id="s642">You know, I was the third bunk you know.</span> <span id="s643">I was – I couldn't come down, was so weak.</span> <span id="s644">But finally about a couple of hours later I finally came down.</span> <span id="s645">I fainted I don't know how many times.</span> <span id="s646">You know, I came down from the, from the bunk, and I finally got to the door.</span> <span id="s647">He never touched me.</span> <span id="s648">This, a couple of soldiers came around, and they looked inside.</span> <span id="s649">They saw all the dead bodies and they were afraid, you know, to come inside.</span> <span id="s650">So I said to – they asked me, you know, things but I didn't understand them.</span> <span id="s651">I, first of all, I couldn't hear.</span> <span id="s652">And I didn't have hair.</span> <span id="s653">They lost that's a symptom of the fleck typhus – you loose your hearing and they're finding out later that and you loose your hearing and you loose your hair.</span> <span id="s654">But I have, still have the yellow armband on me.</span> <span id="s655">So a couple of – I couldn't hear them but I, the couple of words I know from a friend of mine – they were Slovak and they and I know “žid.”</span> <span id="s656">“Žid, žid,” you know – I know what this means?</span> <span id="s657">Means “Jew, Jew.”</span> <span id="s658">And they understood “žid,” because the, the Russians, they, they know what “žid” is.</span> <span id="s659">They used that many times themselves.</span> <span id="s660">So, so they talked to me but I didn't understand them.</span> <span id="s661">So one of them</span></p> <p><span id="s662">21 Jew (Slovakian) gave me a piece of bread and a piece of bacon, you know, to me.</span> <span id="s663">Luckily I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s664">I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s665">I was – that was my main luck, but it was good luck I couldn't eat because I would have, if I would have eat a piece of bacon and would have killed me.</span> <span id="s666">I found out that later, but I don't know why – I just couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s667">So he was motioning to me to go back to the – there were front lines there.</span> <span id="s668">The Russian line was in trenches on one side and the German other side.</span> <span id="s669">They were cross firing at each other.</span> <span id="s670">And I'm telling you I was walking right across between the crossfire without a scratch.</span> <span id="s671">And one time a Russian soldier motioning at me to come to him, and he want to tell me something.</span> <span id="s672">But I couldn't hear him, hear.</span> <span id="s673">He wanted me to lay low.</span> <span id="s674">I didn't know what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s675">Like I said, I was going every 10, 15 feet I had to sit down.</span> <span id="s676">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s677">I was very weak from the sickness.</span> <span id="s678">So I was – I remember I walked through the no-man's land.</span> <span id="s679">And finally I walked all day I suppose, because I remember about one and half or two kilometers you know and came to this artillery position this Russian artillery position, and this guy, and this Russian saw me the yellow star, yellow armband.</span> <span id="s680">He wants to give me a loaf, gave me a loaf of bread and a piece of bacon.</span> <span id="s681">I remember holding that loaf of bread and piece of bacon.</span> <span id="s682">I was squeezing to my body.</span> <span id="s683">It was all mine.</span> <span id="s684">You know, it was something else, you know, that piece of bread you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">02:25:07 So I was going back that – it was a front line, you know.</span> <span id="s686">We, I wanted to get away from as far as I can because any minute, you know, the, the counter-attack it could come from the German and it was bad to worse, you know.</span> <span id="s687">So, I went to went to – finally I went to few kilometers.</span> <span id="s688">Constantly harassing, you know, the Russians – they were asking identification.</span> <span id="s689">Many times just looked at, looked at me and they looked, search in my pocket – they find a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s690">They just let me let me go further back to Hungary.</span> <span id="s691">You know, it was still in Austria.</span> <span id="s692">But one day I got into this headquarters, a Russian headquarters.</span> <span id="s693">I didn't know I where I was.</span> <span id="s694">I was – I sat down on the floor and they wanted to, wanted to know what I was doing there, you know, the Russians.</span> <span id="s695">So one officer came out and he said to me, "Du bist ein Jude?</span> <span id="s696">"in German.</span> <span id="s697">I said to him, “Jawohl, jawohl.</span> <span id="s698">"I could have hear a little, little bit because it was a few days after, after the, I was liberated.</span> <span id="s699">“Ich bin ein Jude.”</span> <span id="s700">Then I said to him, “Shema Israel.”</span> <span id="s701">So he said "Shema Israel," himself .</span> <span id="s702">So he got me a horse and wagon with a soldier, Russian soldiers, and without a stop that horse and wagon took me about 20 kilometers to the Hungarian border, to Red Cross, to – you know, for hospital for Russian soldiers or some civilians.</span> <span id="s703">Over there in the hospital they de-liced me, you know, and washed me and they told me that next day they're going to ship me over to Hungary, you know, on that side.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">So following day they took me over to the veteran's hospital and they want to give us food you know but lucky I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s705">They were hundreds of hundreds of Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s706">They were somehow they escaped the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s707">They were eating and eating 22 Are you a Jew?</span> <span id="s708">(German) 23 Yes, sir (German) 24 I am a Jew (German) and eating.</span> <span id="s709">They were dying and dying and dying.</span> <span id="s710">They were died – hundreds of them, by the thousands.</span> <span id="s711">They would – ‘til they realized what's the problem.</span> <span id="s712">You know – they were all over-eating.</span> <span id="s713">And I feel like a million dollar you know – they gave me a cup you know to – and there was no lice on me or torment – our tormented bodies, you know, was shrunken to like a just a little boy.</span> <span id="s714">But I wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s715">I didn't know if anybody's, anybody came back you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">02:28:35 First it was 200 kilometer to go to Budapest, you know, because from Austria to go Budapest is 200 kilometers, and from Budapest to my town is another 200 kilometers, that's – and in wartime they couldn't get the transportation.</span> <span id="s717">It was – everything was for war effort.</span> <span id="s718">And but one day – I was there in the hospital maybe 10 days, and my gain, my weight gained about – I was at least eighty pounds at that time.</span> <span id="s719">So I left.</span> <span id="s720">I didn't have clothes on me, because they destroyed all my clothes because all they infested, you know, with lice, so on the Schwester,got me some old clothes from two, three sizes larger than – she felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s721">But nevertheless I had something on.</span> <span id="s722">So I was walking there and a boy came with a horse, one horse and wagon, and stopped and said to me, Hungarian said, “You want to get a ride?</span> <span id="s723">Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s724">I said, “I go, you know, toward Budapest.”</span> <span id="s725">He said, “Come.”</span> <span id="s726">So he pulled me up, said, “Well, where, where have you been?”</span> <span id="s727">He said, “I was nearby in this concentration camp."</span> <span id="s728">He escaped.</span> <span id="s729">He said he was hiding in the haystack and luckily the – didn't burn, you know, the haystack, and he, he escaped.</span> <span id="s730">Usually it was a large haystack, because they would they were going with the bayonet many times you know all around just to make sure you know nobody in inside, but he was evidently miss him.</span> <span id="s731">And didn't burn, so he escaped by chance, you know.</span> <span id="s732">But we went to this village and the Russians patrol stopped us.</span> <span id="s733">Says, says – starts talking to us.</span> <span id="s734">Not, not four letter words, but 10 letter words, you know.</span> <span id="s735">"You so and so," you know.</span> <span id="s736">“Where you get the horse?</span> <span id="s737">Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s738">So the other boy, he spoke a little Slovak.</span> <span id="s739">Slovak and Russian are similar, you know, Slovak language.</span> <span id="s740">So, so the sol– the Russian soldier – before he finish his – all the sentence, we jumped off from the – from horse and wagon, said, “You can have the horse and wagon.”</span> <span id="s741">They will shoot us, you know, the it was, the lawlessness was law, you know, those days and the strong was the – weak was the pawn you know and the strong was the rule – the ruler.</span> <span id="s742">But nevertheless, I always – I'm grateful to the Russians.</span> <span id="s743">They were the ones they liberate-liberated me, you know, the even though – because the politic is – the politic is something else, yet.</span> <span id="s744">This is something else, you know.</span> <span id="s745">Nevertheless, they saved, they saved my life.</span> <span id="s746">If they didn't come in days or hours sometimes you know made a big difference between life and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">02:31:54 So we got some somehow we got on this station, got into this Hungarian station, train</span></p> <p><span id="s748">25 Nurse (German) station and we find this freight train.</span> <span id="s749">You know, there are a lot of boxcars.</span> <span id="s750">We asked the stationmaster we could hitch a ride.</span> <span id="s751">Said, “Go ahead.”</span> <span id="s752">So we didn't we didn't know which way the train goes.</span> <span id="s753">We want to go, get away from there the worst way.</span> <span id="s754">We got into this town and there were thousands and thousands of people Hungarians.</span> <span id="s755">They were trying to get a ride you know.</span> <span id="s756">It was transportation was unheard, you know at that time.</span> <span id="s757">But they were – everybody wanted to go home, you know.</span> <span id="s758">So finally, we got on this train, was heading, heading someplace.</span> <span id="s759">Everybody jumped in, jumped on the in the boxcars and the flat train you know, the flat boxcars, you know.</span> <span id="s760">You saw them for tanks you know.</span> <span id="s761">Many times they used to used them for tank carriers.</span> <span id="s762">I remember one – I was sitting at the edge of the one night we were going and there was sitting 100 people, 120 people – I don't know how many could have sit or, or hang on to this to this flat car.</span> <span id="s763">And I was sitting on the edge, and the train was going slow but was shaking up and down, and I fell.</span> <span id="s764">I remember, fell between that the – the train I mean on the on the – so I somehow I threw myself out between the tracks, because it was go slow, but instinct, I throw myself out.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">They pulled me back, you know.</span> <span id="s766">They couldn't kill me you know.</span> <span id="s767">So well finally we had so much tsuris, you know, we, we took days, but we got into Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">02:33:58 And I had an uncle in Buda, in, in, in Buda, before the war, and his wife and two, two of, of, of their children.</span> <span id="s769">I figured maybe they're home, you know.</span> <span id="s770">We didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s771">So I got it; I knew their address.</span> <span id="s772">So to me, I was dressed, you know, I would look like I had a piece of rope tied around my – with waist with holding my, my coat.</span> <span id="s773">It was large, and most, most of the Christians, they thought I'm coming from the home from the prisoners of war camp or something.</span> <span id="s774">So I, I got into there, there, to my uncle's place to walk, and, and my uncle was home and my, my aunt was home.</span> <span id="s775">They, they somehow survived.</span> <span id="s776">They went to the ghetto of Budapest and other – and they, they wait around.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">They have some, they bought some papers from the, from – they got some papers from the Swedish government with something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s778">They, they survived under the pho– under the Christian name, you know.</span> <span id="s779">They were hiding.</span> <span id="s780">But they, they were just by luck, you know.</span> <span id="s781">If the war would have lasted a little longer, they would have been dead also you know.</span> <span id="s782">It was just the timing, it was important.</span> <span id="s783">And when they saw me, they first didn't recognize me right away.</span> <span id="s784">And they saw, she starts screaming, Aunt Margit, "It's you Miklós!"</span> <span id="s785">We call – Hungarians used to call me "Miklós."</span> <span id="s786">Oh, how I looked ter- terrible, I looked.</span> <span id="s787">And she starts screaming about that, because their two, they have two daughters that didn't come home from the – from that time which was in April, and, and the war was still going on all over.</span> <span id="s788">And they asked, and they are screaming that even I came home already and their children, you know, their parents are you know, the, the – their children they didn't come and somebody else came home, you know.</span> <span id="s789">But nevertheless, she was all right.</span> <span id="s790">She was – cooked some something, some, some, some food for me, and I ate some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">02:36:22 And – but to go home, you know, from Budapest, from that was – that it was a terrible thing from, from my home-hometown because the railroad was, it was bombed and it was it took a lot of time, you know, to repair and, and that time.</span> <span id="s792">And so we slowly but, slowly but surely – many times, we – the, the train had to stop and, and, and the Russian soldiers came and identification and, and they used to select some young, young people for, for the war effort, you know.</span> <span id="s793">They all shipped them to – the war prisoners – to, to Russia or they, they used them first for labor, for, for, for laborers, you know, for whatever reason it is.</span> <span id="s794">Many times they start shooting, you know, indiscriminately, to scare the population.</span> <span id="s795">There was no-nobody could have say “no,” you know.</span> <span id="s796">They, they couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s797">They, they were the rulers that time in, in Hungary.</span> <span id="s798">And their atrocities was terrible, you know – the Russian atrocities, you know.</span> <span id="s799">But – and the, the wounded or whatever was laying around by 10s of 10s of wounded.</span> <span id="s800">No one could have helped them.</span> <span id="s801">Was screaming, all over the, the place.</span> <span id="s802">But, I remember my, my uncle gave me 100 pengő.</span> <span id="s803">At that time that value was – maybe I could have buy three kilogram of bread, you know, for it.</span> <span id="s804">And he told me that, “When you have enough money,” you know, to give it back to him, because they didn't have enough.</span> <span id="s805">So, I said “sure.”</span> <span id="s806">So on the way home, so I used that 100 pengő to buy a little bread, you know.</span> <span id="s807">For, for money you can always get something, you know, for the, for the black market.</span> <span id="s808">So sometimes I even bought an onion, an onion to, to season up the, the my menu, you know, the pie– little bread and onion.</span> <span id="s809">And finally I got home, and you'd be surprised that it was 400 kilometers from the, from the front line.</span> <span id="s810">It was, the life was going on just like, just like nor– it was normal, but very, very normal.</span> <span id="s811">Like, you know, we go to buy things.</span> <span id="s812">So first I, I went to – I went, I remember stopped the train and all my memories came to me.</span> <span id="s813">You know, I was – want go home, because my uncle didn't know if anybody lived in my, my, my home because they didn't have communication, didn't have telephone.</span> <span id="s814">Nobody had telephone those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">02:39:13 So, I, I went home and it was in the evening, and I find – I met on the main street – it was a small town, you know, my – I find a friend of mine, was grown up.</span> <span id="s816">His name also was Laci.</span> <span id="s817">So, we start crying each other, you know.</span> <span id="s818">Although at first didn't recognize, didn't recognize me, you know.</span> <span id="s819">Asked him, anybody home, you know because we were 1,200 Jews.</span> <span id="s820">So, we ordered, we 12 of us here, home from the 1,200, 12 people, all between 21, 22, 23 years old.</span> <span id="s821">As he said to me, “Come to me.</span> <span id="s822">Sleep with, sleep in my place,” he said.</span> <span id="s823">He, he was freed in January, and this was in April already, so he got married.</span> <span id="s824">He married a girl, and he slept over one night.</span> <span id="s825">And said, “Tomorrow morning, he said, “Go and see.</span> <span id="s826">Go to your place and see what happened.”</span> <span id="s827">So next morning I went to my father's house.</span> <span id="s828">The houses was built, you know; it was all mud houses you know.</span> <span id="s829">It – was like made from mud bricks, the house.</span> <span id="s830">It – with hay roof, you know, it many other had – some of them had clay roofs.</span> <span id="s831">Some of them had some other roof.</span> <span id="s832">Many of them had just straw, like a hut, looked like a, a….</span> <span id="s833">Anyway, I went to my house, father's house.</span> <span id="s834">Was of course nobody there.</span> <span id="s835">They, they took all, even the window frames out, you know.</span> <span id="s836">Doors was caved in.</span> <span id="s837">They took everything.</span> <span id="s838">The Christians – as the Jews left you know, the, the, the place – took the Jews away from the, the shtetl, you know, from the little villages, the Christians went in and you know, ransacked the place.</span> <span id="s839">They were looking for valuables and whatever.</span> <span id="s840">And they took everything – what furniture, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s841">So didn't find, didn't find anything so and went to my grandfather's house.</span> <span id="s842">My, my un– my aunt used to live, my cousins used to – there was nobody, nobody home.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">02:41:42 There were only 12 people.</span> <span id="s844">So I went to the cemetery from there.</span> <span id="s845">My grandparents were there.</span> <span id="s846">My one brother was buried – pay respect.</span> <span id="s847">But luckily we had a Jointorganization in, in that time already in, in Hungary.</span> <span id="s848">And they supplied – they had a soup kitchen in my town.</span> <span id="s849">They gave us two weeks free food, I mean lunch, just hot lunch, you know.</span> <span id="s850">Just, just one meal, you know, whatever.</span> <span id="s851">But it was good enough.</span> <span id="s852">I know, I always proud of this Joint organization.</span> <span id="s853">But they helped all, all the, the – helped not just Jews, but helped Christians also.</span> <span id="s854">You know, the Jewish Federation.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: How long did you did you stay in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Not, not too long.</span> <span id="s857">I stay, I stayed actually for many, many months, because I was waiting for somebody to come, come home and waiting for my girlfriend to come home, because I was in love with her.</span> <span id="s858">So slowly but surely but people, the, the kids start coming home.</span> <span id="s859">Finally my, I heard my sister is alive, from Budapest.</span> <span id="s860">Somebody said.</span> <span id="s861">Went to see her to the terminal, but every time I went there, she didn't come.</span> <span id="s862">Finally I, one time I didn't go.</span> <span id="s863">She, she was in my place, in my house, not in my house – it's somebody else's house I, I lived for only one day for, for a time being.</span> <span id="s864">She was sitting there.</span> <span id="s865">She was crying, crying, and my girlfriend came home.</span> <span id="s866">I was very happy to – you know, it was, you know, it was, she was – after four months the war, you know, the, the war was over already four months, so you know, I suppose I was sure she was dead already.</span> <span id="s867">But nevertheless she, she came back.</span> <span id="s868">She was already 18.</span> <span id="s869">And we came back, 72 total of the 1,200 Jews, Jews.</span> <span id="s870">Only kids, you know, like us – 72 people.</span> <span id="s871">That means 1,130, 30 some died, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">02:44:29 So, so we figured that our lives wouldn't be just right in, in, in, in Hungary.</span> <span id="s873">And I – and the Christians start getting antisemitic again.</span> <span id="s874">Too many of us came back, they said.</span> <span id="s875">Too many of us.</span> <span id="s876">So – and the Zionist organization became very active in Hungary, and they told us anybody wants to go to Palestine, they help us to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s877">But first we had to go to Germany, because from there was it was impossible to go and they gonna help us go to Germany.</span> <span id="s878">So we decided we had our engagement money, my, my girlfriend and I in, in my hometown, so a few people was there.</span> <span id="s879">And decided we go to, we decided we 26 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 27 Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds going to, we going to escape from, from Hungary to, to Austria first, and then, then Germany.</span> <span id="s880">But it wasn't so simple.</span> <span id="s881">So we went to the Bri– the B’richahelped, helped us.</span> <span id="s882">They gave us shelter in Budapest first.</span> <span id="s883">I'm telling you – these guys, they were deserve a medal.</span> <span id="s884">This – the, the, the, the B’richa, they, they are dedicated personally and nothing could have stopped them.</span> <span id="s885">But it – we were too anxious to leave Hungary.</span> <span id="s886">We decided – seven of us, without the B’richa, we – one, one night, we got on the tra– we got on the train and went to, to the border, Austria-Hungarian border, and border guards stopped us.</span> <span id="s887">They said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s888">I said, “We want to…,” start lying, said, “we want to pray at the grave site,” you know, a lot of graves, Jewish graves in Austria – and we want to take care of the graves.</span> <span id="s889">He let us go.</span> <span id="s890">At night, we slipped through the Hungarian, Austria-Hungarian border but that, that time, it wasn't just simple to just go to the Hungarian and German line.</span> <span id="s891">There were the British line, there were the Russian line – you name it, there was somebody.</span> <span id="s892">They were all patrols you had had to go through you know.</span> <span id="s893">Many times we had to, had to bribe or to give him, we had some, we knew about this, you know.</span> <span id="s894">We had a bottle of schnapps, you know, to a bottle of booze, you know – give them to a guard and they let us go through.</span> <span id="s895">But finally we, we nevertheless we one night we slipped through the, the, the lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">02:47:15 We got into this German, this little Dorf,village, and we almost got arrested there because this Bürgermeisterwanted to know what we're doing there.</span> <span id="s897">I said we came here to pray for the dead Jews.</span> <span id="s898">But we find out that he cannot see.</span> <span id="s899">He couldn't see.</span> <span id="s900">He was blind, the Bürgermeister.</span> <span id="s901">“The Hell with you Jews," he said.</span> <span id="s902">So one guy at the door, he said to us – said to some of them, he said, “Go to this, to this” – it wasn't a forest, it was some trees, “just hide behind it, and a truck will come by and will pick you up.”</span> <span id="s903">That was the B’richa, on the other side, other side – it, it was in, in Austria.</span> <span id="s904">And so we did.</span> <span id="s905">We got into, we got into this little trees, you know, bushes or trees.</span> <span id="s906">We hi– we were hiding there and a truck stopped there.</span> <span id="s907">We, we were seven, eight of us – I don' know how many of us – nine of us, young.</span> <span id="s908">We jumped on the truck and that truck didn't, they, they have many of, of ,of Jews, you know, Jewish boys like me and girls, and they took us to the, the Rothschild Hospital in, in, in Vienna.</span> <span id="s909">When we – there we were, we were – that was a safe house for the, the Jews that time, you know, in, in 1945 – in 19 – 1946.</span> <span id="s910">It was in – it was in May 1946.</span> <span id="s911">So, from there they gave us food and give gave us cigarettes and a few shillings.</span> <span id="s912">And from there – were there about 10, 15 days, 20 days, they shipped us to another camp.</span> <span id="s913">You know, it was a DP camp of, of Enns and Salzburg.</span> <span id="s914">Were there a few days, and we – and from Salzburg they took us.</span> <span id="s915">They gave us a different names, so you had to go through and accustomed to it, but we nevertheless we had to cross, there was a river, small river.</span> <span id="s916">And during the early morning the B’richa had to go, waded through the, the river.</span> <span id="s917">So one guy – first one guy, one girl, you know, the strong – was like, like a 28 flight (Hebrew), organized underground evacuation of Jews from post-war Eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">29 Village (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s919">30 Mayor (German) chain, you know, we were.</span> <span id="s920">And whatever we had we had to hold it over our heads, so we could – the water was up to here, to, to almost to our neck.</span> <span id="s921">So we went to the other side, that was Germany.</span> <span id="s922">I mean Germany was like a haven already for the, for the Jews.</span> <span id="s923">It was a DP camps, you know, or, or a displaced person camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">02:50:11 Once we get there, they just took our name – you know, gave everybody whatever they have, you know, some, a cot and blanket and, and food – they didn't give us maybe 1,400 calories a day – I don't know – or was it 1,800, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s925">They used to call they used to call us Haferflocken.Do you know what a Haferflocken is?</span> <span id="s926">It's like oatmeal, you know.</span> <span id="s927">We, we never used to get in Hungary, that that kind of food, never used to get food and oatmeal.</span> <span id="s928">So nevertheless was food.</span> <span id="s929">Was very good.</span> <span id="s930">I mean, I remember we didn't, didn't complain, but, but they asked us, “Well, where you want to go?</span> <span id="s931">Where you want to work?”</span> <span id="s932">You know, we – you get extra food if you work in, in the camp.</span> <span id="s933">I says, “fine.”</span> <span id="s934">So we – so, I find out I this camp is they used to call it Bad Reichenhal, this DP camp.</span> <span id="s935">And I find out there's another camp, it's a better camp, you know, the DP camps.</span> <span id="s936">So, so you know, the kids who like better things.</span> <span id="s937">So it's called Leipheim.</span> <span id="s938">So it was located between Ulm and Augsburg; it was a town next to the, maybe hundreds of feet from the, the Danube, because the Danube originated from there – Black Forest, in not, not, not far from us, about 20 kilometers from us.</span> <span id="s939">So I joined the, the – they took us, but at first didn't want to take us but with a little bribery, you know – human nature is like that.</span> <span id="s940">You know, we give them, give them a dollar, you know.</span> <span id="s941">They were, we were accepted, you know, in this, this Lageris called.</span> <span id="s942">So, so I got a job working in, in the Black Forest as a as a lumberjack.</span> <span id="s943">So we got some food and, and, and Zulage,we used to call it, the Zulage.</span> <span id="s944">You know, extra, a little food extra, a little cigarettes and what not.</span> <span id="s945">So I, I worked there for, for a long time.</span> <span id="s946">Then I find out that another – I find out another good job is a policeman, so I went to Stuttgart, the pol– the police academy.</span> <span id="s947">And I was trained as a policeman in, in the, in the – in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s948">So, I went back to Leipheim policeman and so I, I didn't have to stay in line.</span> <span id="s949">You know, we you had to stay in line for food, everything, but as a policeman, you know, you just pushed them on the side.</span> <span id="s950">You know, I got so it was, it was, it was, you know, was much better already.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">02:53:01</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Because time is running short, I just need to ask you to condense it a little bit.</span> <span id="s953">Can you tell me how long you stayed in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Well I – we, we were, we were in this DP camp for three years.</span> <span id="s955">Three years.</span> <span id="s956">After three</span></p> <p><span id="s957">31 Oatmeal (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s958">32 Camp (German)</span></p> <p><span id="s959">33 Allowance (German) years, because they didn't allow too man– too many refugees to go to United States – I wanted to come to America because I had two brothers in America.</span> <span id="s960">One brother came, one brother came before I was born.</span> <span id="s961">Another brother came in 1939, just in nick of the time, before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s962">So they had, they had a restaurant – they called restaurant – and they sent me an affidavit.</span> <span id="s963">First I wanted, we wanted to go to Palestine, but said – they said, “You have to come home.</span> <span id="s964">Have to come to America.</span> <span id="s965">Have to come to us,” because they have some family.</span> <span id="s966">We have uncles and, and cousins and everybody in America.</span> <span id="s967">So we came to America.</span> <span id="s968">And they sent me an affidavit as a “counterman.”</span> <span id="s969">You know, but we didn't know what's a counterman because we didn't speak English.</span> <span id="s970">But so one – I had a translator, you know, translated – he knew a little English, he trans– he told me that counterman is, is a very important position.</span> <span id="s971">He says he says it's next to a boss, you know, next to a man, you know, that owns a restaurant.</span> <span id="s972">So, I was bragging to everybody.</span> <span id="s973">I was going to everybody, I was going to be a counterman in America.</span> <span id="s974">So I arrived to finally arrived to America.</span> <span id="s975">We arrived to Boston Harbor.</span> <span id="s976">I'm telling you that was the first ship, refugee ship came, came to America, 1949.</span> <span id="s977">This February 11, 19 – l949, to Boston.</span> <span id="s978">We were treated like royalties on the on the ship.</span> <span id="s979">But I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s980">It was so, we were coming 11 days and we had a terrible storm on the, on the – all of us, 11,000 ton little ship, and it was – everybody was seasick.</span> <span id="s981">You know, the – was good food, you know, what had was wasted, wasted.</span> <span id="s982">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s983">How many times when it was time to get up, you know, and I go to the table, you know, to, to eat – couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s984">Throwing up.</span> <span id="s985">But nevertheless, we came to the – we came and we finally arrived and I was waiting for, who's going to wait for us.</span> <span id="s986">So, my brother Joe was waiting for us, alone, in Boston.</span> <span id="s987">He, he was all gray, I remember.</span> <span id="s988">Was – my sister was with me.</span> <span id="s989">She was also was coming – he was all through with me during this in Germany with, with me.</span> <span id="s990">He's – he had a little two year old son, and I had a little two year old son.</span> <span id="s991">He was born in the Günzburg, where Mandela – what's, what's, what was his name?</span> <span id="s992">That German who was selecting the, the, the, the – in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">02:56:27</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Mene-Mene-Mengele.</span> <span id="s996">Mengele was born in Günzburg, also.</span> <span id="s997">My son was born, he was born in – we got married in, in Leipheim, finally in Germany.</span> <span id="s998">We, we had a two year old son.</span> <span id="s999">My sister had a two year old boy.</span> <span id="s1000">Just about two weeks difference between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">And then when we arrived to Germ– to do – to America, we huddled together there in Boston.</span> <span id="s1002">Figured that anybody would recognize us, you know, we could recognize them.</span> <span id="s1003">So my brother came – says “I'm your brother Joe, Josoph.”</span> <span id="s1004">He was, he was old enough to be my father.</span> <span id="s1005">He was 21 years older than I.</span> <span id="s1006">You know, we was hugging each other, and so we came, all six of us, eight of us probably, put into one car and, and went to, came to the Bronx, Bronx, New York – Holland Avenue.</span> <span id="s1007">Finally got a little down the base- basement, they have a room – they didn't, they didn't – they were – they didn't have –</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">34 Josef Mengele they, they were poor themselves.</span> <span id="s1009">And my family was dirt poor.</span> <span id="s1010">But nevertheless they were, they were, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1011">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1012">And we lived six, six of us in one little room in the basement to – you know, we all came, little room.</span> <span id="s1013">And but nevertheless we, we start prospering you know from, became a furrier.</span> <span id="s1014">I couldn't get a job as a furrier, couldn't speak English.</span> <span id="s1015">And they offered my, my, my brothers, they had a little luncheonette.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">02:59:13 They offered me a job as a dishwasher, and my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1017">We got, we – so my brother told us that, “I give you a job.</span> <span id="s1018">You, you work 12 hours a day, six days a week, and you get 35 dollars and all you can eat.”</span> <span id="s1019">So took the job.</span> <span id="s1020">Was a lot of money, you know.</span> <span id="s1021">Was, well wasn't a lot of money, but it was more than I ever had.</span> <span id="s1022">So, we start working, and after, after a while – after I worked there for quite a many years, then I went into – I saved enough money – $5,000 I remember – and I left my brother's and I opened up my own place as a luncheonette.</span> <span id="s1023">And we prospered from that from this luncheonette.</span> <span id="s1024">We worked night and day, 16 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1025">But that's the American dream.</span> <span id="s1026">And my boy was smart enough in school.</span> <span id="s1027">Sent him to medical school, and he became a….</span>
