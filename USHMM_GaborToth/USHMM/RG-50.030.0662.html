<p><span id="s121">A: My mother's parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s123">So your mother's parents would only observe the high holidays?</span> <span id="s124">Did they

<p><span id="s134">A: He was -- he was a dairyman.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Like Tevye?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s137">He was a dairyman.</span> <span id="s138">I think he was like -- I know that in the States he worked for a dairy company.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Do you know whether that -- that's what was -- that was what he was doing in Russia too?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: In Russia, Russia --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: He did to?</span> <span id="s142">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s143">And on your father's side, you said they were orthodox.</span> <span id="s144">Do -- What did they keep at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: In Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: What did they keep at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: In -- in terms of traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Oh, well they -- they must have kept everything as far -- See, he was the only one in his family who immigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: He -- he left in 1917, I think, or 1916.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Why did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: To escape the Draft of Bizarre and he was -- he was smuggled on a -- in a cold car -- in a cold car in a train and he crossed Siberia and China and came to Japan and came to the United States from Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: First in Seattle and he was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Now, did he have any male siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes, he had a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Now I'm guessing the male siblings would have also been subject to the draft; so, why did your father decide to leave and not the others?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s160">I think the brother may have been exempt for some reason or injured or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s163">I don't remember that about a brother.</span> <span id="s164">I know he had a couple of sisters.</span> <span id="s165">I'm not sure about a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s167">So, did he arrive in the States in 1916?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Do you know why he chose to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Well, he -- he chose to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: But his destination, do you know why he chose this destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s173">I don't know whether he knew anybody here.</span> <span id="s174">I don't think he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s176">So, his port of entry was Seattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

of -- of migration.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: But your mother never recounted to you why she -- why her family had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Specific, no.</span> <span id="s198">I know that she came with two -- with her father.</span> <span id="s199">Her mother had died in Russia and she came with her father and her sister and the other sister, the middle sister, was already engaged or married and she came with -- with her husband or...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Do you know the name of the husband?</span> <span id="s201">Is this -- is this Sophie?</span> <span

id="s212">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s213">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: And then they entered, as far as I know, they came to Chicago right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: And they lived in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So there, your maternal father took up his profession and he worked in a dairy?</span></p> <p><span

States.</span> <span id="s256">But I think she went to high school later or when I was -- after I was born, she took as an adult education.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: So she's 17 when she gets here and already pretty much eligible, marriageable age.</span> <span id="s258">So what does she do until age 26 when she gets married?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I don't -- I don't know what

id="s273">A: So it must have been the next year that he was in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: So they met through friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Oh, wait a minute, they -- I know.</span> <span id="s276">I remember now.</span> <span id="s277">They both had rooms in a boardinghouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: In

Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: So can you tell me where the apartment or house was in Chicago where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah, well in the early days, in infancy and very early childhood, we lived in the Humboldt Park -- Park District, I think it was on Potomac Avenue and then we lived in Albany Park which was like Wilson Avenue was one place Wilson and Spaulding and then later it was Lawrence Avenue, always apartments.</span> <span id="s330">My-- my parents never had a car and they never had a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: I'm just -- I'm just going to put your microphone a little higher because I can see that it's, it's in your way.</span> <span id="s332">Just, sorry about that.</span> <span id="s333">So, you said Potomac Avenue, Albany Park, Wilson Avenue, and Lawrence Avenue.</span> <span id="s334">This is throughout your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s336">Oh, there was another place, Spaulding and Armitage, that's right; before Albany Park it was Spaulding and Armitage.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s338">I will pause the recording right now; just a sec.</span> <span

Spaulding.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Spaulding is before?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: And Armitage area which is -- was more Humboldt Park.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Now, are any of these areas or all of these areas, were they considered Jewish neighborhoods at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Not completely but, but some, somewhat, but not -- not Albany Park was considered a Jewish neighborhood but it was mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: It was mixed.</span> <span id="s347">So, I understand that your parents chose to live in a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah, I would say that in Chicago the division street area was Jewish; the west side, Roosevelt Road area was Jewish, and Albany Park was Jewish.</span> <span id="s349">And then later there was a migration to Rogers Park, which was farther north.</span> <span id="s350">And I think nowadays it's in the suburbs, northern suburbs, but at then, those were the three areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s352">Now, so they were in a pretty much integrated neighborhood throughout your childhood.</span> <span id="s353">Did -- To

any kind of any political actions whatsoever?</span> <span id="s389">They did?</span> <span id="s390">What was important to them?</span> <span id="s391">In -- What were their ideals?</span> <span id="s392">When they put you in a Jewish school, were you taught religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Wait a minute, excuse me, ideals, I would say they were democratic ideals.</span></p>

id="s665">A: A competitive exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: A competitive exam.</span> <span id="s667">And the Central YMCA is in Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah.</span> <span

it?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Everybody talked about it or...</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Well, that's what I'm curious about.</span> <span id="s705">Did you open a newspaper and that's how you learned about it or did someone tell you, run up to you and say hey, this is what just happened?</span> <span id="s706">Do you recall how you heard about it first?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s708">I think somebody probably told me but it was on the radio and then in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s709">I remember seeing the headlines.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s711">How did you feel when you saw the headlines?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Oh, upset and angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: How -- At that

id="s717">How did you think of yourself at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I thought of myself as American.</span> <span id="s719">I guess American Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s721">When you started college did you have a focus?</span> <span id="s722">Did you have a concentration of topic that you knew you wanted to pursue?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: And what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Well, in high school, I wanted to be a journalist because I was the editor-in-chief of the high school weekly paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: And I also won a -- an essay contest.</span> <span id="s728">And but when I started college -- oh, before I started college, I had a high school guidance counselor and she gave me some tests, vocational interests and other things and I was so impressed with her job and her, her function that I decided that I wanted to be that.</span> <span id="s729">So when I started college, I told them I wanted to be a guidance counselor.</span> <span id="s730">I wanted vocational guidance as my major.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Now, what was --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: And they said --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Yeah â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: -- they said that means you should major in psychology.</span> <span id="s735">So that's what I did.</span> <span id="s736">So right from the start I -- I majored in psychology.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And what about vocational guidance that really grabbed you?</span> <span id="s738">What was it that excited you about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I think I think the idea of the -- of the various tests and -- and, I guess, you know, a methodical way to help people with deciding on careers and what to go into.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s741">By the way, that -- that test that she gave you, what was her guidance to you?</span> <span id="s742">What career did she propose?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Personnel administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: She did?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s746">Or something, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Something to that effect?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: -- working with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: So since you were the -- the editor of the high school paper, you must have thought of yourself or other people thought of yourself as a good writer.</span> <span id="s750">Was this something that your parents were particularly proud of?</span> <span id="s751">Interested in?</span> <span id="s752">Did they give you feedback about this or?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I don't -- They were always very, very complementary, very praiseful.</span> <span id="s754">They -- they were always very supportive.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: How -- how good was their English at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Their English was pretty good.</span> <span id="s757">They were very concerned about proper English.</span> <span id="s758">And my mother went to -- went to school to -- to learn more.</span> <span id="s759">Their English was pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: And of course he worked as a salesman, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s763">So he must have been good at communicating.</span> <span id="s764">I'm a little bit concerned -- a little bit confused about the timeline of your father's jobs.</span> <span id="s765">Was he first in dairy and then in textiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: No, he was never in dairy.</span> <span id="s767">My grandfather was in dairy.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Oh, I'm sorry, confusing everyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: My father was -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s771">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: -- in textiles.</span> <span id="s773">He was in tailoring, you know, clothing manufacturing.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s775">Right.</span> <span id="s776">And then he goes into shoe salesman?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Did he work in a store?</span> <span id="s779">Was he his own boss?</span> <span id="s780">How did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s782">He -- he worked in a department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: A department store?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: In a major department store --</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: -- in Chicago.</span> <span id="s787">The Boston Store was the name of it.</span> <span id="s788">Netcher's, Netcher's Boston Store.</span> <span id="s789">And you know later in life, he -- they moved when I moved.</span> <span id="s790">When I got out of the Army, my first -- When I got out of the Army, I went to Stanford.</span> <span id="s791">That was the school I was always interested in.</span> <span id="s792">So I went to Stanford.</span> <span id="s793">I went to Berkeley for the first summer.</span> <span id="s794">And they moved to Berkeley because her sister, Ester, lived in Berkeley.</span> <span id="s795">By the way, the three sisters each had only children -- each had only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s797">What a coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: And one, Ester's and Bernard's son was a physicist and Sophie and Saul's son -- daughter was a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: And so, my parents moved to Berkeley and all the time that I went through Stanford.</span> <span id="s801">And then I moved to Ann Arbor after that, they stayed in Berkeley.</span> <span id="s802">Then I moved to Baltimore and they moved to Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Now, was this because your family was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: And he was -- When he lived in Berkeley, he sold shoes in San Francisco at the major shoe store in San Francisco, I can't remember the name of it.</span> <span id="s805">And then in Baltimore he worked selling shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Well, it seems to me that your parents are moving from town to town to be along with you.</span> <span id="s807">Was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: -- I'm guessing, this was kind of unusual that the nuclear family would stay together even after the child is an adult?</span> <span id="s810">Was this unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Oh?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Was there something about your family that made them more tight knit than usual?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Well, they didn't have anybody else.</span> <span id="s816">They just only had one child, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Did they have a social group of their own?</span> <span id="s818">Did they have people that they would go to dinner or have a card game or --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: -- tea?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: So there weren't people, guests, in the house when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: No.</span> <span id="s824">Well, my grandfather lived with us for a while.</span> <span id="s825">And then when we had a -- when we had the two bedroom apartment, we had a roomer.</span> <span id="s826">We had a grocery store owner who -- who lived with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s828">So he was renting out the -- the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: The room.</span> <span id="s830">So I always slept in the living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s832">I see.</span> <span id="s833">Okay so we are back --</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s835">I never had a room of my own until after...</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: How do you think that affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: I'm very interested in architecture.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Oh, yeah?</span> <span id="s839">Okay.</span> <span id="s840">So let's get back to your college years.</span> <span id="s841">So you start college in '41 and you're studying psychology.</span> <span id="s842">Are you studying anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Well, I took a lot of math because I was advised to take math for statistics.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s845">Were you good at math?</span> <span id="s846">Bad at math?</span> <span id="s847">Didn't really care?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: I was okay.</span> <span id="s849">I got A's and B's in everything.</span> <span id="s850">I had all A's and B's, more A's than B's.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: And I seem to recall in a conversation before this interview you said that you had a passion for music?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: So this is something that came from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: My father was a music lover.</span> <span id="s855">He, you know, he listened to the symphony.</span> <span id="s856">He would go to the symphony.</span> <span id="s857">He would take me to concerts.</span> <span id="s858">He -- I played piano.</span> <span id="s859">My parents gave me piano lessons when I was little.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: But -- but there was no piano in the home?</span> <span id="s861">Or was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Later.</span> <span id="s863">What happened was, my parents got a bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s864">In order to rent a room to a distant cousin, a woman and her daughter.</span> <span id="s865">So they lived with us and they â€“ we had a piano.</span> <span id="s866">We had an upright piano.</span> <span id="s867">I don't know if my parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: -- got it or because I know that my cousin Pat, Pearl was her name; Pat, they changed it to Pat.</span> <span id="s870">She took piano lessons and then I did too.</span> <span id="s871">So, we were both taking piano lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s873">So this -- this piano in your home, when was this?</span> <span id="s874">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Oh, probably 10; 10, 12; 10, 12 to 14, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: And did you play any other instruments?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yeah, I played e flat alto clarinet in the high school -- in the high school concert band.</span> <span id="s878">And I played snare drum in a marching band, a marching drum and bugle corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: So, you said that you did not have your own room growing up but you were playing all of these instruments.</span> <span id="s880">Clearly some of them at school.</span> <span id="s881">But was that not an issue that you had to practice an instrument and you didn't have your own area?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: It wasn't imposing on other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Your father was listening to symphonies on the radio or did he have his own records?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: So -- so there was no gramophone or record or?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s890">So what -- If I understand correctly, you were not drafted; you volunteered?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s893">When was that and why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: I volunteered in '41, I think, or '42, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Well, you were in college how many years before you went into the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: I was in college two, two years but I had three years of credit because I took extra courses.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So if you started in '41 and you did two full years that would have been --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: '43?</span> <span id="s900">So would that have been when you volunteered for the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: No.</span> <span id="s902">No, I went in in '43.</span> <span id="s903">I went into the Army in '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: So you volunteered earlier --</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: In '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: And you actually went in in '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: So what caused the delay?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I -- I enlisted in a program called the ASTP, Army Specialized Training Program; millions of guys did this.</span> <span id="s910">And it was -- it was a way to continue college until, I think, the end of the academic year and -- and not go right away.</span> <span id="s911">So if you enlisted, you could continue college if you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: -- already in college?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: -- in a field.</span> <span id="s914">If you were already in and you were in a field that they considered a specialized field.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: And this was one such field?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s917">So, I went in and was in college but then I-- I don't remember exactly why I got impatient and instead of staying, I -- at the end of that -- of that -- of that year, that Spring of '43 I think, I asked to -- to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: And not continue in ASTP.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: And the ASTP would have given you the right to defer until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Well, indefinitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Until graduation.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Until graduation?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Now, what was your motivation to enlist to volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: I was so interested in personnel administration and industrial psychology that I thought that I could do it in the Army.</span> <span id="s928">And so I asked to -- to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Did someone, some kind of advisor, confirm that that was an option that they would be able to do this or this was just your own idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: No, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: So I went in the Army and -- and I was -- I went to infantry basic training which --</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: It was North Camp Hood, Texas; which now is Fort Hood.</span> <span id="s935">And it was rough and it was -- there was no running -- there was no plumbing and there were lister bags for water.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: What's a lister bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: A lister bag is a water holder.</span> <span id="s938">It's a big -- it's a big bag with a faucet at the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: So you're saying there is no plumbing?</span> <span id="s940">How -- how did you and other guys clean themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: No, I think there -- there were showers but there â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: There were showers?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: -- but there was no water pumps or anything else.</span> <span id="s944">I know we were always short of water.</span> <span id="s945">Basic training started on the 4th of July in Texas.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Of '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yeah, it was really rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Can you describe what kind of -- what kind of regiment you had?</span> <span id="s949">What you had to do in a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Well, all of the usual military training things.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: How physical would it have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: And ending in a 25-mile hike.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: 25-mile hike?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: In a full -- full field pack hike.</span> <span id="s955">And there was also crawling under machine gun fire, the obstacle course, and -- and just and listening to lectures.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Lectures on what?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Military, you know, arms like --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: -- the nomenclature of the rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Now, how did your parents feel about you volunteering?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: That was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: They were --</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: They were worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: -- supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Well, they were worried about me in the service but -- but they were supportive, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: How many of your -- your friends or acquaintances were doing the same at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Well, some were drafted and I don't know whether anybody else was doing what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s969">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s970">In basic training, were you the only Jewish person there in your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: I think there were one or two others.</span> <span id="s972">You know, I should say before I forget that, I'm jumping the gun here, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I was hoping that I would be assigned to personnel or classification because that's what -- that's what I wanted.</span> <span id="s975">And at the end of basic, they did put me in the camp office in classification which is what I liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: How much time was there between the beginning and the end of basics?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Well, basic training was 13-weeks at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, I did work in the office for a little while and I thought I had it all made and that I was part of the camp and I wasn't shipped out.</span> <span id="s980">And then orders came through.</span> <span id="s981">I guess what happened was that the Army needed more troops and more combat troops so the order came in closing or -- or changing our office.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: How much time did you spend in the office before that order came through?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: I don't think it was more than a month or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s985">So we're still in '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: So then -- So, I was shipped out and along with maybe one or two other people that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: And so I was shipped out to a the 71st Light Division which was jungle and mountain.</span> <span id="s991">And that was at Camp Carson Colorado.</span> <span id="s992">And that was in preparation for Asia.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s994">What kind of training was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: That was also rough and it was -- there was a maneuvers there -- in the -- it was raining and -- and there we had no light -- light infantry means this was a mule pack outfit.</span> <span id="s996">There was -- there were three light divisions: The 89th, the 14th, and the 5th.</span> <span id="s997">I was in the 5th, regiments, pardon me.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: The 5 regiment and the 14th and the 66th.</span> <span id="s1000">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: You said something mule.</span> <span id="s1002">What was the expression you used?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Oh, mule.</span> <span id="s1004">Mule pack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Mules like our outfit was just backpacks and carts I think pulling, pull-carts, backpacks.</span> <span id="s1007">And another Light Division was all mules.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1009">So -- so what is all mules?</span> <span id="s1010">You said you were carts and backpacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Mules.</span> <span id="s1012">Yeah, we were backpacks and something else, I forgot.</span> <span id="s1013">Light, meaning that you could go without cannon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: Without tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Without heavy trucks and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1018">So it was all on foot.</span> <span id="s1019">But I think we had a kind of a cart.</span> <span id="s1020">But another division was all mule packs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: So what is a mule pack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: A mule is -- is a donkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Oh, so these are actually mules?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: I thought it was maybe a code for some kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: No, no they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Mules.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: -- mules.</span> <span id="s1029">They had mules that carried --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: So they had mules with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: And they would carry things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1033">I see.</span> <span id="s1034">But you were not in that division?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1037">Now, given that you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: But I -- I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1040">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: -- want to say that by volunteering and going into that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: -- then I was just in the infantry and I was -- I was in the -- in the mud.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: One day a guy from headquarters that I knew was a friend of mine saw me in a foxhole in the rain and he said Les, is that you?</span> <span id="s1046">And he said considering your background, let's see what we can do.</span> <span id="s1047">And so he got them to -- to think of me for -- for Service Company, which would be classification.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: So then later, when I was in classification, I was in charge of getting the new men coming into the outfit into their units.</span> <span id="s1050">Well the new men coming into the outfit, by then I was a corporal, the new men coming into the outfit were buck privates and they were -- they were raw like raw recruits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Recruits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Because they had just come from ASTP.</span> <span id="s1053">ASTP ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1055">So it would have been your cohort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: And they were all shipped out of college.</span> <span id="s1057">So I, you know, had the advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1059">This, this man who you knew, a friend of yours, do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Do you remember where you knew him from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: From the Army itself.</span> <span id="s1063">From just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: But from Colorado or maybe had you been together in Texas or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: No, I think it was Colorado.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: And so, during this whole process you said that maybe there was one other Jewish person there.</span> <span id="s1067">Was -- Did the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: There was one Jewish guy who was the newspaper reporter.</span> <span id="s1069">His name was Irving Werstein.</span> <span id="s1070">I remember him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Did the other men in this unit know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: The 5th Regiment was originally in Panama in peacetime and most of the people in it were from Kentucky and Tennessee and they were hillbilly types.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: And they didn't -- they didn't know much about that.</span> <span id="s1075">About Jewish or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: So they would not have been aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: No, I think there was some anti-Semitism from somewhere but it wasn't -- it wasn't so much Jewish as it was city and college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1079">And you had both?</span> <span id="s1080">You had been a college boy and a city boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Was this an issue?</span> <span id="s1083">Did they make it an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1085">Yes, because they were in much better shape.</span> <span id="s1086">I mean, they were more used to that kind of life than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1088">Did they taunt you or did they treat you badly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Well, I remember one day I was huffing and puffing climbing a mountain and I said, I'm not used to this.</span> <span id="s1090">I said, I grew up in Chicago where -- where I'm used to escalators and elevators.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: So, so he laughed.</span> <span id="s1093">But later that night around the campfire, he told the other guys what I said and they in a taunting, teasing, hostile way.</span> <span id="s1094">So I..</span> <span id="s1095">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: But this -- this didn't escalate?</span> <span id="s1097">They didn't actually hurt you or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: There was no -- They didn't isolate you for being different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: No, I think I was closer to a couple of guys that were more city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: That we were different from the -- from everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: And you had your own support group then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Now given that you had had very different ideas about what was going to happen before you got the desk job, before your friend finds you in the foxhole, so during those months, how are you coping with the disappointment?</span> <span id="s1106">Is it a disappointment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: It wasn't.</span> <span id="s1108">I mean, I just took it as life; something to cope with.</span> <span id="s1109">I didn't -- I didn't try to do anything about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: You weren't angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: -- except cope with it.</span> <span id="s1112">No, it's just the Army, that's all.</span> <span id="s1113">I mean, I figure that's just normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: When I got orders to go -- to go to the 71st Light Division, I did look up what a Light Division was in the camp library and it said jungle/mountain, mule pack, amphibious, and paratroop.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: And what did you think when you saw that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: And then I -- I said God, I don't want any of those.</span> <span id="s1118">And then it turned out to be a combination of two of them: Jungle and mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1120">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: But you know my son was a paratrooper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: When?</span> <span id="s1125">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Oh, 20 years ago or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: 20 years ago or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No, more than that.</span> <span id="s1129">He's in his 50's so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Was there a war on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: It was in peacetime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1135">Because you were not drafted.</span> <span id="s1136">You were -- you were a volunteer.</span> <span id="s1137">Did you enjoy any perks?</span> <span id="s1138">Was there anything given to you as a reward for that or you were just treated the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: My impression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it was an old Panama outfit.</span> <span id="s1140">It was a regular Army outfit, 5th Infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: So those were not draftees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: No.</span> <span id="s1143">But -- but then there were draftees, too.</span> <span id="s1144">So, there were both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: And there was no distinction between an enlistee and a draftee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Well, I think the newer ones, like the ones who were drafted, along with me, we -- we were different, you know, coming from cities or with more education than these other guys that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: But the system didn't treat you differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1150">Okay.</span> <span id="s1151">So this -- this man recognizes you in the foxhole.</span> <span id="s1152">This is your -- your big breakthrough moment and he -- he takes you where?</span> <span id="s1153">Where do you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: In Service Company, the same regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: But instead of Company F, which is a line company, and I was on mortar.</span> <span id="s1157">I was a 60-milimeter mortar ammunition bearer.</span> <span id="s1158">And I thought that I was lucky to get that -- to get that assignment because the mortar squad is a little behind the lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Because you have to shoot over --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: You know -- but I was there were -- there were seven ammunition bearers in a mortar squad, I think, or five or seven, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1163">And I was tail end.</span> <span id="s1164">I was the last one in.</span> <span id="s1165">So I considered myself really lucky --</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: -- that I got that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: And then you're taken out of that company and put into Service Company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: And what -- what letter is that?</span> <span id="s1173">The Service Company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: Just Service Company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Oh, it doesn't have a letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1178">And are you given training in the Service Company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: I don't remember any training.</span> <span id="s1180">I think I had to learn the personnel situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Personnel procedures and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: So you said earlier you were processing the new recruits, the boys who had been ASTP and who had just -- just graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: That was in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: In this company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Are you still in Colorado at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: No, we moved to -- We changed to a Full Division from a Light Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: So I think that's why I got the job in Service Company because it expanded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Everything expanded and classification specialist, I guess, was created or I don't know whether it was there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: But when we changed to a Full Division instead of a Light Division, we went to Fort Benning, Georgia and that's where we were.</span> <span id="s1199">Fort Benning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: How long did you stay in Fort Benning?</span> <span id="s1201">Approximately when did you get there and when did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I think until we went to overseas.</span> <span id="s1203">We went overseas from New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1204">We were there just very briefly in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1205">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: So when did you get to Georgia and when did you leave Georgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Well, I don't think we went -- we got overseas until '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: January '45 is when you got overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: So, when you enlist, this is '43, you do 13 weeks of basic training.</span> <span id="s1211">So 13 weeks, what is that?</span> <span id="s1212">That's about three months?</span> <span id="s1213">So, you're in the Fall of '43 and then you're going into -- your -- then you go to Colorado because basic training is in California; did I get this right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Texas, Texas is basic training.</span> <span id="s1216">And then you go to Colorado?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: And then Colorado.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: And you stayed in Colorado a whole year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Part of Colorado was in, I think part of Colorado I must have been in Service Company too at the end of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: But -- but I may have been there a full year but I -- I think we were in Fort Benning longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: How long did you stay in Georgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1225">Was -- was your job different in Georgia?</span> <span id="s1226">Did you do different tasks there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, there it was Classification Specialist 275.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: And when you get your orders to ship out, how do you feel?</span> <span id="s1229">What's your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: Just expected, that's all it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: You weren't worried?</span> <span id="s1232">Scared?</span> <span id="s1233">Apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: No, not that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1236">All right.</span> <span id="s1237">So in '45, at the beginning of that year, where -- where are you shipped to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: We landed in Normandy but by then there was no beachhead anymore.</span> <span id="s1239">It was all a port.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1241">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: You know, so, with -- with landing docks and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1243">So we landed there and we camped in Fort -- now what was it called, Camp Lucky Strike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: This is in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yeah, Camp Lucky Strike.</span> <span id="s1246">Camp Chesterfield.</span> <span id="s1247">I think we were -- the French called it, "Lukey Streak".</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Was it close to Normandy?</span> <span id="s1249">Was it in Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: In Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: In Normandy.</span> <span id="s1252">And what were you doing in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1254">Well, the same, same things.</span> <span id="s1255">I mean, I was working in Service Company and classification.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: But -- but what kind of tasks were you assigned?</span> <span id="s1257">Or were you still processing new draftees in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: I don't know, it was just keeping track of personnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: How long were you in Normandy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Shifts, promotions, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1263">I don't remember how long but I know that when we started going across, I â€“ I remember there was a town of Bitche, B-I-T-C-H-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: B-I-T-C-H-E?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: And Kulmbach in Germany was -- we were in Alsace Lorraine first.</span> <span id="s1266">I don't remember the town, but I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: While you were in -- still in France, were you interacting with any of the local population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: So what -- what kinds of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: I took French in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: So, I was the French interpreter.</span> <span id="s1273">It was rough.</span> <span id="s1274">I mean, I -- I mean, my French was rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: But I was the official getter of wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: So how did that happen?</span> <span id="s1278">How did you get the wine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Well, at the end of the day, you know, we could go into town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: So we went into the village and I would ask for -- for wine and there was something else, there was two things.</span> <span id="s1282">And of course, we were always in good shapes to -- good shape to barter because we had cigarettes and that was what everybody wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Was that the only thing you bartered or was there anything else?</span> <span id="s1284">Rations or chocolate or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Chocolate.</span> <span id="s1286">But I remember saying, (?</span> <span id="s1287">"Aba do divan"?)</span> <span id="s1288">.</span> <span id="s1289">Oh, I know, it was "vin rouge or vin blanc".</span> <span id="s1290">That's right.</span> <span id="s1291">It was only two --</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: So you didn't get down to the varietals.</span> <span id="s1293">You didn't talk about what kind of wine it is?</span> <span id="s1294">You didn't say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: -- I would like a burgundy wine?</span> <span id="s1297">Or no?</span> <span id="s1298">No, it was just red or white?</span> <span id="s1299">Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Did they have both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Did you have a preference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: But mostly red, I think.</span> <span id="s1305">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1306">I wasn't hot on wine drinking any way.</span> <span id="s1307">I brought it back for the other guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Was -- was actually alcohol consumption, was that something your parents did?</span> <span id="s1309">Did they drink wine at home ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: My parents didn't drink.</span> <span id="s1311">My father would take a shot of schnapps only at a party or something.</span> <span id="s1312">And he never was drunk.</span> <span id="s1313">My mother wouldn't drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: And so growing up had you had any experience with alcohol in high school?</span> <span id="s1315">In college, before you entered the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: There were no parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: With alcohol?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: So when you were tasked to bring back this wine, you had no interest in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: No.</span> <span id="s1323">I don't -- I'm not sure about that.</span> <span id="s1324">Maybe I was interested in tasting it or but not a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: And the other -- the other soldiers, did they drink too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Well some of them did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: They did?</span> <span id="s1328">Did they misbehave when they drank too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Oh, yeah, there was some times cases of fighting or passing out or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: So the misbehavior would be on base?</span> <span id="s1331">It would not be in the village?</span> <span id="s1332">It would not be in with locals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: There was no incidents with locals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: No, I don't remember any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: When somebody misbehaved, given that you're in classification, did you have to write up a report?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: No, that was -- that was done -- that was not done by me.</span> <span id="s1338">That was court-martials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1340">Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1341">So you were bringing back wine.</span> <span id="s1342">And what other tasks did you do as an interpreter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Laundry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: So you took -- You were speaking with the locals in order to get the laundry done?</span> <span id="s1345">With women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: I don't remember anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: So, how long -- how long was your stay in France?</span> <span id="s1348">You get there at the beginning of the year.</span> <span id="s1349">Is it still cold when you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1351">I think it must have been.</span> <span id="s1352">I -- I do remember Kulmbach and there was beer --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: -- there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: This is Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Now, approximately where in Germany?</span> <span id="s1358">What's a big city there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Kulmbach was -- was a big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1361">Close to or in, in which state?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: It's -- I don't know the state but it was closer to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1364">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1365">Is it spelled K-U-M-B-A-C-H?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: K-U-L-M-B-A-C-H.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1368">All right.</span> <span id="s1369">So that's your -- in your memories that's your first German experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Yeah, if I could see a map, there might be a some other -- some other towns that we stopped in before that but I can't remember them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Uh-huh, all right.</span> <span id="s1372">So tell me about Kulmbach.</span> <span id="s1373">What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Nothing except that it was an interesting, it was a German city and there was -- it had the buildings and the narrow streets and so on and beer and that's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1376">Tell me about the beer.</span> <span id="s1377">You weren't very interested in alcohol so why did you mention the beer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Well, I just remembered that was one of the features there that they talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1380">What about the locals in Kulmbach?</span> <span id="s1381">Did you interact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: It seems to me that I -- I was suspicious of all of the Germans and didn't know who was a Nazi and who wasn't and was kind of not friendly with them like I was with the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: And how did you feel about the Germans in general?</span> <span id="s1384">Did you, because the way you're describing it, what I'm understanding, is that you had a sense that some were not Nazi's.</span> <span id="s1385">Did you have a feeling that some had been part of the system and some had not?</span> <span id="s1386">Or did you have a stronger sentiment of kind of a blanket feeling regarding towards them that they must of all been a part of the system?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Well, everybody said "nicht Nazi, nicht Nazi."</span> <span id="s1388">But no, I had a sense that some were and some were not but most were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1390">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1391">So does that mean that you were -- you pretty much did not interact with the population at that point yet because you weren't sure what you were in for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1393">Also, we weren't there.</span> <span id="s1394">We weren't at any place long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: How long did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: You know, well, we -- we got into combat 54 days before the end of the war; okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: So, when was -- when was V-E day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: May 8th?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: May 8th.</span> <span id="s1401">So 54 days before May 8th was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Roughly two months.</span> <span id="s1403">So that would put it at early March; right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1405">So that's when we went into combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: And where did you go into combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: And I think it was around Kulmbach; but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1409">Okay.</span> <span id="s1410">And what was your first experience of combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Well, see, I was in Service Company; so it was, I don't-- I don't -- We weren't in combat.</span> <span id="s1412">I mean, they were, the front lines, the line companies were in actual combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: And we were behind them, following them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1416">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: So we knew what was going on but we weren't directly in it.</span> <span id="s1418">Where we were, we were taking over what had already been --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: -- victorious for us, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: And -- and again, what -- what tasks were you doing?</span> <span id="s1422">Were you still only processing your own people's --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: -- papers?</span> <span id="s1425">So you were -- you were not working on local issues while the Army was advancing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: No, not that I -- no not that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Did you ever see combat before the end of the war?</span> <span id="s1428">Were you in any kind of danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yeah, there was -- there was one time when there was some shooting or some sniper or something.</span> <span id="s1430">But in general, no, I was not in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1432">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: There was one day, one -- one time that was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1434">I don't remember whether it was a truck, something was blown up or shot or something but.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1436">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: But I wasn't hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: How did you learn that the war was over in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1440">I think it just was announced all over and celebrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Where were you when -- when the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: We were in Steyr Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Or near Steyr Austria on the Inn River; we had met the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: So when did you meet the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: That was -- When was the war over, May?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: May 8th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: May 8th.</span> <span id="s1449">So I would say it was in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: So that -- that one week, it was one week before.</span> <span id="s1451">It was the week of -- that's when you met the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: I think so, around then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: So can you describe what happened when you met the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: All I remember was that there was toasting and -- and joyful meeting and celebrating and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Did the -- did the two groups mix?</span> <span id="s1456">Was there any kind of interaction between the Soviet Army and the U.S. Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: I don't -- A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Did you -- Do you recall ever meeting the Soviet soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: More by the officers, not much by us.</span> <span id="s1460">Our -- our major-- our major meeting was with former concentration camp people that were strewn, that were wherever we went, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: When did that start happening?</span> <span id="s1462">That wherever you would go you would bump into, run into?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Oh, I would say probably from -- from Central Germany on; especially in Bavaria and Austria.</span> <span id="s1464">It was the worst in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: So, if it started in Germany, do you recall when you first -- when your company first came across a concentration camp survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: No, I don't remember when --</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Do you recall -- do you recall your first thoughts?</span> <span id="s1468">Did you know who these people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Yeah, I knew they were -- Well, they wore striped, striped like pajama like uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: And some of them looked like skeletons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Where were you coming across these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Several places across Germany and Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Fields?</span> <span id="s1475">Roads?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: But I think the most -- the most -- the largest one was this camp that we opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1478">So, tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Well, that was -- What was the name of it again?</span> <span id="s1480">During --</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Gunskirchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1483">Gunskirchen Lager.</span> <span id="s1484">Another GI and I walked away from our unit and just strolling and we -- we came across this camp and we opened the door and out poured some prisoners and some of them were so, looked like skeletons and -- and one -- one called to me in Yiddish and said, "I'm one of you."</span> <span id="s1485">"I'm one of you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: -- So the prisoner said to you, I'm one of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Now, did he know that you spoke Yiddish or understood Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: He didn't.</span> <span id="s1490">I guess I looked Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: And so you hear this.</span> <span id="s1492">What -- what is passing through --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: He said, "Haberach Monus (ph)" have pity, have sympathy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: What did you do when you heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I didn't, nothing.</span> <span id="s1496">I just, I mean, you know, we had a rifle and a steel helmet and we were in full gear and they stumbled out and -- and some, he -- he dropped and I think he dropped dead.</span> <span id="s1497">And there was some who dropped dead and some just started flowing out so we ran back to our unit to try to get medics and to try to get everybody involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: But this was not the first time you had seen people in these striped uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: No, I had seen -- we had seen others before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: How frequently had you seen them?</span> <span id="s1501">Just a few incidents or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: And those incidents were -- I â€“ I understand you probably don't remember the exact location but what was the -- where was it in a field?</span> <span id="s1504">Or on a road?</span> <span id="s1505">Or in an other camp where they concentrated?</span> <span id="s1506">Was it many people?</span> <span id="s1507">Few people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: I think it was a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: I think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: And you had known what about them exactly at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: That they were concentration camp prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: And you knew about concentration camps because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Because I read about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1517">Maybe, maybe the Yank paper, maybe the GI paper or -- or well, I knew about concentration camps from the time I was a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: But would you -- would you know that the striped uniform is what a concentration camp inmate wears?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Did the Army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: I think -- I think they did.</span> <span id="s1522">I think there was some discussion about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Do you have any concrete examples?</span> <span id="s1524">Any details?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: No, I don't.</span> <span id="s1526">No.</span> <span id="s1527">In military government we learned a lot about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: But that was after having --</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: That was â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: -- liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: -- that was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: -- Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s1533">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1534">So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what you're seeing is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: You know, I'm a little confused about prisoners of -- German prisoners of war that were huddled together in trucks and they were carried, they were driven away from where they were captured and prisoners of -- and concentration camp prisoners with the striped uniforms in trucks.</span> <span id="s1536">It seems to me that I saw them in trucks, too but I'm not sure that they were rescued and carried and that I -- we passed some of them on the roads.</span> <span id="s1537">I don't know, I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before that time and that we saw some.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: So as you were describing, you opened the gates.</span> <span id="s1539">Were the gates locked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Why had they not opened it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: And the guards were all gone.</span> <span id="s1545">The guards had left already and they took all of the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Do you know why they had not opened it?</span> <span id="s1547">The gate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Because it seems to me you're saying that it was easy to open?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1551">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1552">The other guy and I lifted it and opened it and I said my God, we opened it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Do you remember the other guy's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: No.</span> <span id="s1555">I've been trying to think of it and I -- I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s1556">I remember what he looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Careful of the mic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: He was also in Service Company.</span> <span id="s1559">He -- I don't know whether he was a clerk of some sort or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: But so you opened the gate and this is when you hear the man speaking Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Well, he -- he started coming out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: What were your thoughts -- thoughts when you heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: -- "have pity.</span> <span id="s1567">Have" --</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Well, just felt, I'm touched, you know, moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: The fact that he was speaking Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Yeah and that he was so, so thin.</span> <span id="s1571">And then he, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: So did you immediately decide to go back to your company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: So you -- At that point you are not interacting with any of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: How long did it take you to get back to the company, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: Oh, immediately.</span> <span id="s1578">We turned around and ran back when we saw all of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: And what did you tell your company?</span> <span id="s1580">What had you just seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: That we opened a concentration camp and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: And what did -- and what did your â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1585">And what did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: They did.</span> <span id="s1587">As I recall they went there and they evacuated the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Did you go back with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: With ambulances, you know, they got ambulances and they got -- Yeah, well, I don't -- I don't remember too much after that.</span> <span id="s1590">Where we -- where we were or where we were assigned to something else right away or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: So did you ever go -- go back to Mauthausen during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: There was -- there was just that one interaction of, I'm sorry, Gunscarium (sic), that -- that one situation where you're opening the gate and then you immediately went back to the company.</span> <span id="s1594">So you did not enter the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: Maybe, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: How many people did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Maybe dozens in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: What was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: It smelled of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Tell me -- tell me about the smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Just -- it just had an awful smell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: What was it reminiscent of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1606">Smelled bad and people said that's the smell of death?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Which people?</span> <span id="s1608">Who said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Guys in the Army.</span> <span id="s1610">I just don't remember too much of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: What was the weather like that day?</span> <span id="s1612">Was it raining?</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: It was not raining, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Was it fairly warm by then?</span> <span id="s1615">Or was it a cold Spring?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s1617">I think it was fairly -- It must-- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1618">I know it wasn't raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: I'm going to pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: This is a Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lester Libo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Conducted by me, by Johanna Newman (ph), on October 25, 2012 in Washington D.C., and this interview is being conducted over the phone.</span> <span id="s1625">And now I'm introducing myself to you.</span> <span id="s1626">I understand that you had some interview already, part of your interview already took place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yes, there was an interview there in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Uh-huh, I see, oh, I see, okay.</span> <span id="s1629">Well, I think -- I hope you're comfortable and sitting down â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yes, I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: --and relaxing.</span> <span id="s1632">Okay, very good.</span> <span id="s1633">Where are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Iâ€™m in Albuquerque.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: New Mexico?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: New Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Thatâ€™s where you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Uh-huh, okay, very good.</span> <span id="s1640">Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a little bit to the original interview what your function was after World War II.</span> <span id="s1641">How did you get involved with the denazification and why were you chosen -- chosen to be part of that program?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Well, I was -- I was in the infantry --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: -- and we were in occupation in Augsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: And I was just bored, I guess, and I -- and I heard about military government needing people, so I applied for a transfer and I got it, and they transferred me to Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: And when I went to -- I was put into Public Safety Special Branch and it turned out that the head of denazification, the enlisted man who was the head, the title is chief clerk, that he was leaving in a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: And I had a few years of college credit in psychology and I guess they thought that -- that I could do it.</span> <span id="s1651">So I was only 22 years old, but I wanted it and they thought I could do it, so they trained me to fill his spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: I -- I suppose it was quite a challenge for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Now, what -- how -- now in retrospect, how successful do you think that this program worked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Well, in our district, which was -- the state of the niederbayern and obersfeldt (ph) where Regensburg is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: We had the highest number of -- of -- what you call it, of screenings, we had the highest number of evaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than anyone else in the U.S. Zone.</span> <span id="s1658">We had -- we were very successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: When you say successful, do you think that it had an impact on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: That what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: -- on the Nazis to -- well, let's say nevermind repent, but they realized finally how wrong they had gone or how criminal their government had been or do you think that they -- they did this mostly so that they would be spared from trials or prison or worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Well, they didn't do it, we did it, we removed them.</span> <span id="s1663">We-- we evaluated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: This was the U.S. government, it wasn't the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: No, no, I understand, I know that, but I was just wondering --</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: We removed them from office â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: -- in important jobs, like in the government and in important jobs, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: -- administrative jobs and we removed thousands and that-- that was our mission, to cleanse the new government of -- of Nazis as much as possible at the higher levels.</span> <span id="s1672">I mean at the lower levels there were -- there were many Nazi party members, but we kept -- if they were -- if -- if they had joined the party after summer of '37 they were considered okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Because then they were forced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1675">If they hadn't held any position -- any official positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: The reason that you felt that way is because at that point they were forced, whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: -- they liked it or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: It was mandatory that they join.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1681">My question merely -- my next question actually was: Who were the individuals you were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime?</span> <span id="s1682">So in a way you have answered that already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1685">You said that they were â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: -- they had been in the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: And -- well, and you think that those who went into the party after '37 by -- in their hearts they were not Nazis?</span> <span id="s1690">Do you think 00?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Oh, I don't -- no, it was mixed, I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: That some believed in it and some were -- didn't and were forced into it, but.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Now, how do you think -- what was the reaction on the parts of these Germans?</span> <span id="s1695">They were removed from their office by the United States military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: And what was their reaction to being chosen to be denazified?</span> <span id="s1698">I assume that some were beyond that.</span> <span id="s1699">In other words, that they, you know, either ended up in prison or could not be used --</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Oh, yeah, the ones who -- who were suspected of being war criminals, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: -- we didnâ€™t â€“ we didnâ€™t process them.</span> <span id="s1703">We turned them over to--</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: -- counter-intelligence, you know, to intelligence â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: I see, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: -- but we didn't deal with those.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: So you had good reason to think that the people you were dealing with, it was worthwhile trying to change them â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Yeah, it didn't last long, though.</span> <span id="s1712">We understand â€“ I understand that it changed about, you know -- in 1946, I think it was, late 1946.</span> <span id="s1713">I was there only until May '46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Uh-huh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: I was there from September to May '46.</span> <span id="s1716">And we were very-- we were very aggressive in pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: And some people -- I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasn't worth doing or something, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1719">One -- I remember one Nazi party official that we removed from office said to me that he had -- he had his days of glory and now -- and now it's turned over, so, you know, it's --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: It's sort of worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: In what language did you interrogate these people?</span> <span id="s1723">How did you deal with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Well, I had -- I had a German American -- I had an American originally from Germany as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s1725">He was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: So he was an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: By the way, have you ever come across the name of a American lawyer by the name of Kemp -- not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner (ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Kempner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Kempner, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Sounds familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Because apparently he is -- was a -- a -- a lawyer who interrogated also this -- these kind of people, people who had been in office, who had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Oh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: -- held government jobs and trying to find out how much did they know what was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: -- and were they in favor of it or not, and so apparently he -- you know, he became quite well known.</span> <span id="s1737">That's maybe why the name is familiar to you.</span> <span id="s1738">Yeah, Kempner was the name.</span> <span id="s1739">He was a German interrogating his own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1742">Okay.</span> <span id="s1743">So how -- let's see, did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to escape punishment and, therefore, participated in the program?</span> <span id="s1744">What would you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: No, I -- well, they were being investigated, they wanted to get away -- I don't think they cooperated.</span> <span id="s1746">They were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: They did not cooperate with the American --</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: Well, who -- who were you thinking of?</span> <span id="s1749">The people who were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: The people who were supposed to be denazified.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: The people who were screened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Yeah, they filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: That was my question, too: How honest were the answers or could you assess that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Well, that's an interesting question because a lot of -- many Germans came from the east zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: And there were no records to check on their responses, but in our zone, in our area, Regensburg itself --</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: -- had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records.</span> <span id="s1760">So people from the local area we could check on, so we had --</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: -- so we had a routine check in the records center â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: -- in Regensburg on everybody, but people who came from Poland or East Germany,--</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: -- whatever, we had no way of checking on them, so of course they were more sus -- they were more suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1768">So you think that some of them really -- well, let me ask you this then: How did you determine who -- whom to get into the program?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: How did you choose the individual that you thought would qualify to be in the program and be denazified?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: I -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1772">We didn't -- we didn't choose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: Somebody chose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: I see, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Military government, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1777">We -- we were -- we were the evaluators, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: -- but we didn't do the initial choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: So you were handed a list of people â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: I see, I understand.</span> <span id="s1783">And then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of them, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Not to get the Nazi ideology out of them, but to keep the ones that were more serious Nazis out of -- out of important jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: I mean we didn't expect to change their ideology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: And -- {coughing} excuse me.</span> <span id="s1788">And how did you -- you were a young person, as you mentioned earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden?</span> <span id="s1791">I mean in a way from a human point of view this is quite a -- a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebody's future in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Not at all, it was a joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: I was glad to do it.</span> <span id="s1795">It was revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Well, that I can understand, right.</span> <span id="s1797">Now, how was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: I was -- you know, I'm Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: So I -- you know, I saw that as a -- as a good kind of revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: I see, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1802">And -- well, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: My interpreter was also Jewish, he was -- he was a German Jewish refugee who was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1805">Well, many of them came â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: -- at an age here to America and then enlisted in the Army, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: You know I come from that part of the world, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: You came from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: I'm originally from -- from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Oh, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Well, that's in the north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1816">Okay.</span> <span id="s1817">Now, what was the procedure, was this program conducted on a one -- one-on-one basis or did you have groups at the same time, and how exactly did you proceed in this project, in this program of denazification?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Well, we had the fragebogens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: And they would come in, and they would have to be evaluated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: Oh, I see, uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: And there were -- they went over them and -- and they would come to me and say this one looks suspicious or this one, you know, and so on, but they would -- there were -- there were procedures to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: So you followed a protocol, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Uh-huh, I see, okay.</span> <span id="s1830">But then -- and then let's say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 of these individuals.</span> <span id="s1831">Was it conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one-to-one basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: No, one-to-one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: It was one-to-one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Well, each -- each questionnaire was â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: -- was a -- it was a separate investigation, a separate procedure for each individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: What was the procedure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating in -- there were five categories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: You know, you know those five categories: Number one is mandatory removal, number two is -- is discretionary adverse recommendation, number three is discretionary no recommendation, number four is no evidence of anti -- no evidence of Nazi activity, and number five was evidence of anti-Nazi activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: And so each individual would get a rating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: That would be the conclusion.</span> <span id="s1847">And then if they were in the four or five, they would be removed from office or not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the Allies, by the Americans for, you know, like homes could be used for troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1849">And how long did such a process take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: The evaluation process?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Yes, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Just -- just -- it was -- I don't know, I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: It depended on if there were any complications, because we also had a special investigations unit that would look into difficult case -- cases that were, you know, harder to figure out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Right, right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: They -- you know, they might -- they might go to -- to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1858">Or did you interview members of their family or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: -- I donâ€™t know what â€“ uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Or friends or â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: either.</span> <span id="s1864">Most -- the action in most cases was taken on the basis of the questionnaire alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: We would bring them in for interviews if we had questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s1868">Oh, you mean you got the fragebogen, that you evaluated, but you didn't necessarily have the individual in front of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span> <span id="s1871">I didn't realize that.</span> <span id="s1872">Now I suppose I had a -- I had a different concept somewhat.</span> <span id="s1873">I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who was suspicious or wasn't suspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a -- I don't want to call it brainwashing, but some kind of a, you know, democratic viewpoint or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Oh, no, no.</span> <span id="s1875">No, it was strictly â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">Q: Based on their fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: It was, yeah, strictly screening, no attempt to change them or argue with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: And were they cooperative, were they hostile, antagonistic or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Well, I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it, you know, to say that they were innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: "Nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi" was -- was their motto.</span> <span id="s1882">There was one case -- -</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Well, that was easy to say afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: There was one case I remember where this man said that-- that he understands that the tables were turned and he had his days of glory and now his side has lost and he's prepared to take the consequences, and he -- you know, he said well, we had our day and now you have your day.Well, that was very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Uh-huh, to admit that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: For anybody to do that.</span> <span id="s1887">Most of them wereâ€”made excuses.</span> <span id="s1888">You know, they said they were forced or that they were not really a Nazi and so on.</span> <span id="s1889">And of course the people from -- who came from East Germany, there was no way to check.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: That's the other big problem, exactly, right.</span> <span id="s1891">So I was-- one of the questions I had in my mind was: Was any material used during this process, but I guess it wasn't 'cause I had a different concept of it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures --</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1895">There was no attempt to change anybody.</span> <span id="s1896">It was completely screening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1898">And get the least suspicious back into the workforce?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force?</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">A: Yeah, to -- well, to allow them to continue in their -- on their jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: Or to be hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Yeah, I understand, yeah.</span> <span id="s1905">Okay.</span> <span id="s1906">Let's see now, what qualifications did you have or required in order to be part of this process?</span> <span id="s1907">Well, you said that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">A: Well, I was -- I was a college student, I was a psychology major, and I also had experience working in personnel administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: I see, oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: So I had administrative experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1912">And were you in charge of the -- of this particular program?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yes, I was -- well, I was an enlisted man, I was a sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: The person in charge of the whole thing was an officer, a captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: And he -- and there was also a lieutenant, so I remember there were two American officers that were in charge, but the day-to-day work was done by -- the day-to-day work of -- of being in charge, I mean, --</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: -- was done by an enlisted man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: And my predecessor was the one who was being discharged.</span> <span id="s1922">He was also a Jewish guy â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: -- from the States.</span> <span id="s1925">And I was put in to learn â€“ learn the ropes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: I see, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: And learn the job â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: -- that he did heading up the staff, supervising the staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1931">So you were in a supervisory position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: The title was chief clerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: I see, good, very good.</span> <span id="s1936">Were there Germans that participated under oath?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Well, let's say those who filled out the fragebogen -- fragebogen, and was there anywhere where they had to, I don't know, sign that -- like we say here in the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: I think -- I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: You know, to whatever I wrote that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">A: I think they signed it -- I think they -- when they signed it it said -- it probably said in there that something about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: But they were not under any verbal oath or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: Well, they -- I think they got away with too much, quite honestly, but never mind.</span> <span id="s1945">Well, that was another question I had: How could you be sure that what they put down in their fragebogen was an honest answer?</span> <span id="s1946">But I think you answered that already and you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: The record center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1949">You could check it unless they came from the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1952">Well, that's, of course, a big problem, but -- and that I guess wasn't really eliminated until the '90s, right, when they got records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: What did you hope to achieve with this denazification program?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Cleansing.</span> <span id="s1956">Well, to keep the new Germany, the new German government more democratic, and not -- not back in the hands of the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: And do you think you succeeded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: We succeeded in -- in our job, but we understand that the new German government kind of weakened and we had heard that Nazis were being kept or hired again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: And that was under Adenauer or â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: Well, I guess you were dealing here with what, 52 million people or however many --</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: So you told me already where you were located, right?</span> <span id="s1964">In -- in Regensburg â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: -- or where was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: Regensburg on the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1969">And that's where -- where your work was concentrated, in that part of Bavaria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: How long did you work in this capacity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: I was there from September of '45 through May of '46.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: At the time that I was in a DP camp in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: Beyond that even, until August, I guess, of '46.</span> <span id="s1976">Okay.</span> <span id="s1977">What were some of the most memorable incidents that you remember from that period?</span> <span id="s1978">You already told me about the guy who said you had your day --</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: I mean we had our day, now you have your day.</span> <span id="s1981">I'm sure you came across a number of other memorable incidents with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Well, I think one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest number of removals in the whole US zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1984">The highest removal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: That's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: Yeah, the highest number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Well, Bavaria is sort of Hitler country â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: -- perhaps that's why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Munich, that's part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: Also, we had heard --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: -- that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis, and that the French, I don't know -- the French were either very vengeful or just didn't care, but that the United States forces were the most serious about denazification, so we were proud that we were doing a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s1997">But specifically on a one-to-one from an individual, do you have any memorable incidents that occurred with, you know, you speaking to any of these people or in conversation or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: I don't -- I don't remember any specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2000">Now, you think that the program was effective?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Well, it was effective while we were doing it, but it was -- but it was overturned; you know, it was watered down and then it was done away with.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: How soon would you think was it watered down?</span> <span id="s2003">I think that really is also an important point because was there already a new younger generation coming in or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: No, not while we were there.</span> <span id="s2005">It was after -- we heard that it was done afterward, probably in late '46.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: What, that they over turned this program?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: That's what I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2009">Were any other highlights that you remember during this period?</span> <span id="s2010">I mean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way?</span> <span id="s2011">I assume that perhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some --</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Anybody specific?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: No, I can't remember any -- any big -- big name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: Yeah, I mean really big shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: No, I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2018">What about -- or how was it justified that some of the Nazis scientists, etcetera, ended up here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: Oh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2020">I don't know anything about that.</span> <span id="s2021">I guess the United States needed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the -- of the -- of the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: Do you think -- well, let me ask you this: What are some of the strengths or weaknesses of this program?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Well, I think -- the weakness was not having record centers -- not having records on people who came from other areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Other than that, I think it was done very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: You know, and they were serious and people were removed and gradually jobs were -- were given to people who were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s2030">There weren't many -- there weren't many around, you know.</span> <span id="s2031">There was -- practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of the mandatory membership --</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Right --</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: -- from '37 on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: {Coughing} excuse me.</span> <span id="s2035">No, that I realize and that, of course, very difficult to make this distinction and then to be sure that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Yeah, very difficult.</span> <span id="s2038">Did you -- were you able to -- to obtain lists of Nazi party members?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: As I recall, there was one time when -- when somebody uncovered a record or a list of -- of -- of members that we could check against -- against our applicants.</span> <span id="s2040">It was kind of a surprise treasure that was uncovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: I can imagine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: And probably to the great disappointment of some of the people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: There you had it black and white, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2048">I had a question of how were the candidates for denazification chosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">A: It was a routine thing on their job.</span> <span id="s2050">It was because of what -- what position -- I guess -- I guess it was, you know, everybody in certain jobs in the government or in important positions in society.</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: That you really needed in order to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: We didn't -- we didn't select them, they were -- we received -- we received them, somebody else selected them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Made the selection.</span> <span id="s2054">When you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies, not from within the Germans themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s2056">I don't -- I don't really know.</span> <span id="s2057">It might be that an order went in from military government that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: I see, okay, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2059">So really everything, all the -- all the selection, and I hate to use that word for obvious reasons, but let's -- let's just use it for lack of a better word, so all the selections were really based entirely on the fragebogen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: On -- all the selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Yeah, who was going to be denazified or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s2063">Well, it started with the fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: Then if there were questions or suspicions, then -- then there would be interviews and further investigations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: Did you do some of the interviews yourself as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: No.</span> <span id="s2070">We had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator and he would -- he would do them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: He would do the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Interviews.</span> <span id="s2073">And he -- and he would do the -- he would do further investigation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2075">So really was a whole team work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Oh, yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2078">Now, the -- the workload must have been overwhelming, as we said before, dealing with a whole nation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Well, we only had one state.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Now, did this -- that's a good answer because that brings me to another question.</span> <span id="s2081">Did you -- did the United States have such programs all over Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2085">It was in the -- the whole US zone â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: -- was divided into areas and all of them had the same kind of thing we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: We were just -- we were just in one state.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: You're just the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: Niederbayern and obersfeldt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: Niederbayern, yeah.</span> <span id="s2093">Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s2094">This really was a very well organized undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: I mean -- so what would you say, roughly how many people in your sector, on your section were involved in this?</span> <span id="s2097">Germans, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: Oh, I -- the population?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: I don't -- I don't know.A million.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2103">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Well, it was a vast undertaking.</span> <span id="s2105">And you -- you -- you talk about the Americans having done that, and I was not aware of that either that -- that this was not an allied undertaking.</span> <span id="s2106">I always was under the impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: No, this was American.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2109">And the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: And the others had their own systems.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2112">Did they also call it denazification?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I don't know what they had.</span> <span id="s2116">I mean we -- we had heard that -- that -- that the British were having tea with the Nazis and the French were just wrecking their stores and homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: So not -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Oh, and the Russians were terrible, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: Yeah, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: Everybody ran away from the Russians â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: -- and said that they were monsters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2124">Now that I heard --</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: Because they were so -- they were so vengeful â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: Right, even from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: -- at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: And also a lot of Russians died because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2131">So let me ask you this: What would you say, how-- how did this experience affect you as a young person in such a responsible position, you know, which involved really impacting the course of people's lives?</span> <span id="s2132">Were you aware of your power, were you troubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: No, actually, I think it matured me.</span> <span id="s2134">I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s2135">We lived well.</span> <span id="s2136">I mean we had -- we had a hotel room, we had a â€“ we had -- we -- you know, we lived in a hotel, we had dances, we had an orchestra, we had a bar, we -- I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2137">We had a chauffeur to go wherever we wanted to, like to a play or an opera or concert.</span> <span id="s2138">It was -- it was a very educational experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: I mean I was -- I was so young.</span> <span id="s2141">I had -- I had three years of college credit, which I had done in two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: And so, you know, --</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Did you pursue that psychology at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: Yes, I went on and got a PhD in psychology.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Very nice, lovely.</span> <span id="s2147">Well, so you're telling me that so close after the war ended, this horrible war, they had already concert, theater, opera, dances --</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: -- and everything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: I guess people are very resilient.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Well, Regensburg wasn't -- wasn't wrecked as much as some other cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: I know, I know.</span> <span id="s2156">Hamburg was destroyed, 75 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: Oh, yeah, bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2159">And were you -- well, you said you enjoyed it, so I assume you enjoyed the feeling of having power over these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Well, it wasn't that, it was just having an important job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: Important job, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: And having a lot of the luxuries of -- of, you know, living well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: I mean there were also the problems of being away from home and living in -- still living in a hostile environment.</span> <span id="s2165">I mean we weren't -- you know, it was dangerous to walk down the streets alone at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: You just asked -- you just answered my next question, which really was How dangerous or how hostile were these people against the -- well, the allies in general but the United States Army soldiers that were in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Well, they were -- there were always stories about an attack.</span> <span id="s2168">You know, there were -- there were German Army veterans, was Hitler Youth former members, there were true believers.</span> <span id="s2169">There were stories that there were attacks on GIs and -- but I don't remember that anybody in our unit was attacked, but -- but we were always careful.</span> <span id="s2170">I mean I remember walk -- walking down the street myself at night, like if I took my girlfriend home, and then I would walk back to my hotel, I would carry a knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2172">So one really did need a little bit of protection after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: You were not welcomed with open arms?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2176">Although many of them acted that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2178">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: Oh, yeah, they acted that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Well, it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: That's right, and they were glad the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2183">Well, that's for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: And cigarettes were very important, cigarettes and chocolate and stockings, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: What days these were, oh, my God.</span> <span id="s2186">I remember them quite well still.</span> <span id="s2187">Well, I had a question whether, you know, you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it was, you know, partially your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not honest, etcetera?</span> <span id="s2188">What guided your -- your work more, the protocol that you had to follow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: Probably both.</span> <span id="s2190">You know, for instance if there was a contradiction in dates or functions or -- see I -- I didn't -- I wasn't an evaluator myself, I was the head of the unit, so the evaluator would come to me with a question.</span> <span id="s2191">They would say here's -- here's a fragebogen where this guy answers this and this place and that on that place and it looks like a contradiction and so on, so they would come to me with questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: But they would -- they would do the evaluations, I wouldn't, but I would train them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: I see, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2195">Now, another question just came to my mind.</span> <span id="s2196">Most of Germany was mobilized into the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or -- or were working for the government in a -- in a different capacity.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Not in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: How did they -- how did they manage to stay out of the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: I -- I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: But these guys, in other words, had -- that you were dealing with had not been in -- in the military in the Wehrnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: I'm -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s2206">I think some were -- some were in both.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">A: Civilian and had been in the Army too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2211">I think they were in the Army and then they were -- this was peace time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Well, just a few months, yeah, they may have been â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: -- demobilized by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2216">So maybe the records show that they were in the Nazi party and then they were in the Army and now they were out in a job and they were being screened in the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Now, how often did you come across or did they honestly --</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: How what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that he was a member of the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: Oh, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Nobody, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: No.</span> <span id="s2223">We didn't come -- we didn't come across many SS.</span> <span id="s2224">I think they were picked up by other intelligence.</span> <span id="s2225">Maybe they were picked up before -- before they got to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: I don't remember many -- I don't remember many SS members.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: I remember some SR members --</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2231">Well, that was the forerunner.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Sturmabteilung.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Well, they were the forerunners to the SS actually, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: Yeah, they were the brown shirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Yeah, the beginning of the whole business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2238">How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position, to work with Nazis and trying to sort of get them back on a normal footing on the -- on the non-Nazi lifestyle or non-Nazi outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">A: Well, I was -- I was certainly motivated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: As a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2242">I was glad to pay them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: And I was glad to see justice being done.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: What happened, by the way, to those people that were fired from their jobs and did not -- could not be re-employed in -- into the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: Yeah, that's a good question, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2247">We -- we always wondered about that, what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: Maybe they -- they just did some -- some kind of business by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: Well, this was -- Germany has always been a big bureaucratic --</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: -- structure, but â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: Maybe this went into some kind of business or got jobs in a business where --</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: But you don't -- you don't know what â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: I mean unless they ended up in prison.</span> <span id="s2257">I suppose some of these people had a record or -- a record came to light --</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: -- where they actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: They weren't imprisoned.</span> <span id="s2261">They -- I mean some of them lost their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: Well, you said they -- their finances were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: Yeah, their bank account was frozen.</span> <span id="s2266">They were allowed to take out just like $200 a month, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: They were punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Not enough, but what can you do.</span> <span id="s2272">You could have taken a whole nation and cut them off from the member of the world like Mr. Morgenthau you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: By the way, I wanted to ask you â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: -- kind of a far out question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: I have written a novel based on my experience there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: It's called The Finishing Touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">A: And it's about the nazification, and it has a love story woven in and out of it, but, you know, it's about an American who falls in love with a German woman and the German woman has two brothers, one of whom was in the -- notorious Nazi and the -- and one -- one died, and the one who was the Nazi takes on the identity of the one who died and tries to pass as the one who died and so there is this intrigue about who -- which -- which brother is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: -- and trying to trace and find out so on.</span> <span id="s2284">It's a suspense novel.</span> <span id="s2285">And I would like to find a publisher or an agent for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2287">Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s2288">That is very very intriguing.</span> <span id="s2289">You did that in recent years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: I just wrote it.</span> <span id="s2291">I just finished it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: How lovely.</span> <span id="s2293">That's really quite an undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Well, that's always very, very difficult to find a publisher, but I suppose you could approach a number of, you know, known publishers and send them the manuscript.</span> <span id="s2296">I guess that's how you go about it â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: -- or you can go through some of the universities publish books.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: But I don't know whether -- you know, as a novel, but it's really a historic novel, I assume?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: Yeah, it's a historical novel.</span> <span id="s2302">It's all about the kinds of things that we talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2304">Okay.</span> <span id="s2305">So possibly some of the universities might be interested.</span> <span id="s2306">I mean you have to start somewhere and usually, you know, one person gives you an idea and another person and eventually you may --</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: -- find somebody who does -- sounds fascinating to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Well, it's related Holocaust museum, that's why I asked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: We don't do any publishing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: We don't do any publishing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: We have a book steward that sells novels and mostly authentic stories about the Holocaust --</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: -- but these are all published books, but we do not -- we in the museum do not publish books, but you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Oh, by the way, when I was in the infantry, we had opened -- we had opened a concentration camp as -- I was in Patton's Army as we swept across France, Germany and Austria and it was almost like a different town every-- every day the advance was so fast --</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: -- but we-- we came upon a Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: Oh, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: And our unit opened one of the camps of Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s2323">You mean one of the subcamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Subcamps, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Yeah, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: And that was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: I bet.</span> <span id="s2328">And you found survivors there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2332">Lots of people were -- were there and we opened the gates and they streamed out --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Mauthausen, was that â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: Some dropped dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: -- in Austria or was that in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: Mauthausen, was on the German side or Austrian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: I think it was -- I thought it was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: Could be, I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: I mean our unit went farther west -- I mean farther east --</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">A: -- than any other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: So how long were you in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">A: We met the Russians near Styer, Austria.</span> <span id="s2345">I was in the Army for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: You enlisted or you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: Yeah, I enlisted.</span> <span id="s2348">I enlisted in '41 â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">Q: After Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">A: -- and then they had a program where you could stay in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Oh, oh, I see, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: And so I didn't -- actually didn't go in until '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s2354">Well, those were the worst years, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: '43 and '46.</span> <span id="s2356">And then I was -- I was put in the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: So -- but I was -- I was put in classification, so I was the head of the classification part of the infantry regiment, which is a personnel, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">Q: So you saw a lot of battle though?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: A lot of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Battle.</span> <span id="s2362">I mean active warfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: I saw a lot of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: Of active warfare, of battles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: Warfare?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2367">I mean you were in the trenches, so to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: Oh, yeah, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s2369">No, I saw a lot, but I was not in -- I was not actually in the front line.</span> <span id="s2370">I was in service -- service company, which is -- which is in -- it's an infantry regiment, but it's -- but it's -- it's -- it's the clerks and the drivers and the supply people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: -- and so on, so we were -- we were a little behind.</span> <span id="s2373">We were not in -- in the foxholes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2375">Did you -- you had a staff that worked with you, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: In -- in denazification?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: How large a staff would you say did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: Oh, there were 35 people altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: I see, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2382">And you were the -- you were the supervisor --</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: -- of these 35 people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2387">And they had to report back to you of their findings, --</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">Q: -- etcetera?</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2392">And who were they mostly, they â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: They were mostly Germans and DPs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s2395">Not the American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: There were -- there were a few American soldiers, but they were not the evaluators.</span> <span id="s2397">The evaluators were all German speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: So they were Germans out of the population of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Some -- some were Germans and some were DPs from -- from other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: But spoke German?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2405">And DPs, also Jewish DPs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: There were a few, but most of the DPs were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: I see, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2408">Well, that's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: There were a few -- I remember there was a Polish -- couple of Polish Jews, there were a couple that were in concentration camps, and then there were others that were hidden or escaped, but the majority were not Jewish, but there were some Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2410">Q: How long do you -- would you say that this whole program last?</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: Well, as I understand -- as I understand, it didn't last much longer after I left.</span> <span id="s2412">That somehow with the new government they changed the thing, maybe the whole program lasted a year or a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2414">So that's not very -- no, I -- excuse me.</span> <span id="s2415">I remember as a teenager hearing about this -- papers were full of this denazification, denazification, but I don't think that we ever had really a concept of what that really involved.</span> <span id="s2416">I think perhaps, maybe only in my own mind, I thought that really was kind of a -- how shall I say, yeah, a curriculum, that's probably the right way of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: Oh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these people's outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: But you're telling me now that this was not it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: No, it was never -- it was never like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: It was political screening.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: Cleansing of job holding.</span> <span id="s2426">But I think they -- I think they let Nazis back in because they needed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: They needed their job skills.</span> <span id="s2429">And also the whole scientific and technical â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: -- development.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: And then you had the scientists that they needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: What were the dynamics between your team members?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: And?</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: No, I said the dynamics between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or whatever, yeah, especially in view of what you just told me that there were DP people and there were Germans and then there was the Army, so how did all that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: It was -- it was fine.</span> <span id="s2438">I mean everybody worked together, everybody seemed to -- everybody got along --</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Even --</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: Everybody had stories to tell about their own hardships.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: Well, that I would believe, yeah.</span> <span id="s2442">Do you remember some of those stories or some of those hardships that people were talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Well, as I said, a couple were in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Some, you know, had to leave their homes and travel --escaped, were in hiding for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: No, I -- as I recall, everybody got along fine.</span> <span id="s2448">There were no frictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: Even among the people who were in the concentration camp and the Germans that they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: Well, the Germans on our staff were anti-Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: Yeah, that I can understand, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: So that was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2454">But among themselves they got along, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2456">Seems to me they got along fine.</span> <span id="s2457">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: I mean you did not notice any frictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2461">Well, I guess maybe they were all out to do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s2463">No, we were all doing an important job, we -- we realized that, and it was -- it was Nazi hunting, and, you know, somebody would find a fragebogen that would have a contradiction in it or show something or -- or some -- something would come up from the record center showing that somebody that we had screened turned out to be an important Nazi office holder, they would come into my office and hold it up like victory.</span> <span id="s2464">Yeah, look what we found.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: I can imagine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: That was -- those were the high spots was discovering somebody who had been cheating or finding a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Do you -- well, I can imagine that that was regarded as a major victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Well, I don't know whatever we -- we try to do, I hope we accomplished this in some way or other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">Q: Was this an emotional situation for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">A: Yeah, somewhat, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: As an American or as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Well, my family did not -- my -- my parents and grandparents did not come from Germany, they had -- they had -- they were American immigrants, they came from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: And they came a lot earlier, so they were not affected by what was going on in Germany with Hitler.</span> <span id="s2477">But everybody, of course, was very involved and very interested and cared a lot about what was happening in Germany, so my -- my work there in military government was -- was highly respected.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: I can imagine, yeah.</span> <span id="s2479">That I can imagine.Well, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: But the strange thing was that it didn't last very long and that -- you know, within a year after I was out --</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: There was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: -- it went back into German hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2484">That's really too bad.</span> <span id="s2485">I didn't -- must confess that I did not realize it, but then at that point I had come to the United States â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: -- and I guess, you know, your -- you start a new life and a new language and a new everything, and somehow you leave these horrible events of the past behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: Is your name Johanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: So how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Right now I'm 81.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s2493">I'm 89.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: Oh, so you -- yeah, so you came to the States then, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">Q: 1946 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">A: Oh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2498">Q: -- after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">A: Same as me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: But you grew up here, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: My parents had the good fortune of finding --</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: No, we knew -- you know, in the States during the '30s we knew German Jewish refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: Some of them came early, they were smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Well, my parents found out that Albania allowed Jews to come in and that's where we went and that's where we survived the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Albania?</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2511">But, you know, the Germans occupied that country as well in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">Q: Yeah, yeah, but the Albania people were exemplary among the nations of saving --</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: They were what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">Q: They were exemplary among the nations of saving Jews and not handing them over and not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">A: Oh, that's interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: That's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2520">Yes, it is, and it's not much known, not well known at all.</span> <span id="s2521">And in fact, you know, I speak in many places, in schools, etcetera, to talk about that part of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: And it's really important that people have to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: That's why I want my novel to be published.</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">A: You know, I wanted to ask you, this interview is going to be on -- is going to be on a CD -- on a CD or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">Q: I believe so, but I â€“</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">A: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">Q: This is actually the first time that they have asked me to do an interview, you are my guinea pig, and -- so I really don't know the exact correct answer to your question.</span> <span id="s2532">I believe it's going to be on a DVD, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: Because we -- yeah, because we wanted, the family wanted a -- wanted a DVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: Yeah, I'm going to ask the young lady who talked to you earlier and who interviewed you the first time --</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s3384">Q: When was that and why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">A: I volunteered in 41 I think or 42 probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">Q: You were in college how many

army specialized training program.</span> <span id="s3397">Millions of guys did this.</span> <span id="s3398">and it was a it was a way to continue college until I think the end of the academic year and not go right away.</span> <span id="s3399">And so if you enlisted you could continue college if you were in a field, if you were already in and you were in a field that they considered a specialized field.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">Q: And this was one such field.</span></p> <p><span id="s3401">A: Yeah right so, I, I went in and was in college but then I donâ€™t remember exactly why I got impatient and instead of staying at the end of the, of that, of that year in the spring of 43 I think, I asked to go and not continue in ASTP.</span></p> <p><span id="s3402">Q: And the ASTP would have given you the right to defer until when.</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">A: Well indefinitely.</span> <span id="s3404">Until graduation right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3405">Q: what was your motivation to enlist, to volunteer</span></p> <p><span id="s3406">A: I was so interested in personnel administration, industrial psychology that I thought that I could do it in the army.</span> <span id="s3407">And so I asked to, to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">Q: Did someone, advisor confirm that that was an option, that they would be able to do this or this was just your own idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3410">So I went in the army and, and I was, went to the infantry basic training which</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">Q: Where</span></p> <p><span id="s3412">A: It was north Camp Hood Texas which now is Fort Hood and it was rough and there was no running, there was no plumbing and there were lister bags for water.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s3416">Q: So youâ€™re saying thereâ€™s no plumbing.</span> <span id="s3417">How did you and other guys clean themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">A: No I think there were, there were showers, but there was no water pumps or anything else.</span> <span id="s3419">I know we were always short of water.</span> <span id="s3420">Basic training started on the 4th of July in Texas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3421">Q: Of 43</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">A: Yeah it was really rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">Q: Can you describe what sort of regimen you had, what you had to do in a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">A: Well all the usual military training drills, ending in a 25 mile hike and a full filed pack and there was also crawling under machine gun fire.</span> <span id="s3425">The obstacle course.</span> <span id="s3426">And, and just listening to lectures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">Q: Lectures on what</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">A: Military you know arms, the nomenclature of the rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">Q: How did your parents feel about you volunteering.</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">A: That was ok.</span> <span id="s3431">They were worried, well they were worried about me in the service but, but they were supportive you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">Q: How many of your friends or acquaintances were doing the same at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">A: Well some were drafted.</span> <span id="s3434">And I donâ€™t know whether anybody else was doing exactly what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: In basic training were you the only Jewish person there?</span> <span id="s3436">In your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">A: I think there were, there was 1 or 2 more but others.</span> <span id="s3438">You know I should say before I forget that I am jumping the gun here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">A: I was hoping that I would be assigned to personnel or classification because that what, thatâ€™s what I wanted and at the end of basic they did put me in the camp office in classification which is what I liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">Q: How much time was there at, between the beginning</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">A: Well basic training was 13 weeks at that time, so I did work at the office for a little while and I thought I had it all made, that I was part of the camp and I was shipped out.</span> <span id="s3443">And then orders came through.</span> <span id="s3444">I guess what happened was that the army needed more troops, more combat troops so the order came in closing or changing our office.</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">Q: How much time did you spend in the office before that order came</span></p> <p><span id="s3446">A: I donâ€™t â€˜think it was more than a month.</span> <span id="s3447">Or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">Q: So weâ€™re still in 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3450">so then I so I was shipped out and along with maybe one or two other people, thatâ€™s all.</span> <span id="s3451">And so I was shipped out to the 71st light division which was jungle and mountain and that was at Camp Carson Colorado.</span> <span id="s3452">And that was in preparation for Asia.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: What kind of training was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">A: that was also rough and there was a, there was a maneuvers there and in the, in, it was raining and there we had no light, light infantry means that this was a mule pack outfit.</span> <span id="s3455">That there, there was, there were 3 light divisions.</span> <span id="s3456">The 89th, the 15th and the Fifth.</span> <span id="s3457">I was in the fifth.</span> <span id="s3458">Regiments pardon me.</span> <span id="s3459">The fifth regiment, the 14th and the 66th and</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">Q: You said something, mule, what was the expression you used</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">A: Oh mule, mule pack.</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">Q: what is that</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">A: Oh mules oh like our outfit was just back packs and carts, Iâ€™d say pull, pull carts back then.</span> <span id="s3464">And another light division was all mules.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">Q: SO what is all mules.</span> <span id="s3466">You said you were carts and back packs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">A: Yeah we were back packs and something else, Iâ€™ve forgotten.</span> <span id="s3468">Light meaning that you could go without cannon, without tanks, without heavy trucks and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s3469">so it was all on foot.</span> <span id="s3470">But I think we had a kind of a cart, but another division was all mule packs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">Q: So what is a mule pack</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">A: A mule, itâ€™s a donkey.</span></p> <p><span id="s3473">Q: Oh these are actual mules.</span> <span id="s3474">I thought maybe itâ€™s a code for some kind of</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">A: No, mules carried and they would carry things.</span></p> <p><span id="s3476">Q: But you were not in that division</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3478">Q: Given that you had had</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">A: I want to say that by volunteering and going into that then I was just in the infantry and I was in the mud.</span> <span id="s3480">One day a guy from headquarters that I knew, he was a friend of mine, saw me in a foxhole in the rain and he said Les, is that you.</span> <span id="s3481">and he said considering your background letâ€™s see what we can do and so he got them to, to think of me for, for service company which would be classification.</span> <span id="s3482">So then later when I was in classification I was in charge of getting the new men coming into the outfit into their units.</span> <span id="s3483">Well the new men coming into the outfit by then I was a corporal.</span> <span id="s3484">The new men coming into the outfit were buck privates and they, they were raw, like raw recruits because they had just come from ASTP.</span> <span id="s3485">ASTP ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">Q: I see, so it would have been your cohort</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">A: And they were all shipped out of college so I you know had the advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">Q: This man who you knew, a friend of yours, do you remember his name</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">Q: Do you remember where you knew him from?</span></p> <p><span id="s3491">A: From the army, from</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">Q: But from Colorado or maybe had you been together in Texas.</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">A: No, I think it was Colorado.</span></p> <p><span id="s3494">Q: During this whole process you said maybe there was one other Jewish person there.</span> <span id="s3495">Was did the other</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">A: There was one Jewish guy who was the newspaper reporter.</span> <span id="s3497">His name was Irving Worstein, I remember him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">Q: Did the other men in this unit know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">A: The fifth regiment was originally in Panama.</span> <span id="s3500">In peace time and most of the people in it were from Kentucky and Tennessee and they were hillbilly types and they didnâ€™t they didnâ€™t know much about that.</span> <span id="s3501">They, about Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3502">Q: So they would not have been aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">A: NO I think there was some anti-Semitism from somewhere but it wasnâ€™t, it wasnâ€™t so much Jewish as it was city and college and</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">Q: You had both.</span> <span id="s3505">You had been a college boy and a city boy.</span> <span id="s3506">Was this an issue, did they make it an issue</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">A: Yes, yes because they were in much better shape.</span> <span id="s3508">I mean they were more used to that kind of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3509">Q: Did they taunt you, did they</span></p> <p><span id="s3510">A: Well I remember one day I was huffing and puffing climbing a mountain and I said Iâ€™m not used to this.</span> <span id="s3511">I said I grew up in Chicago where, where Iâ€™m used to escalators and elevators so, so he laughed but later that night around the camp fire, he told the other guys what I said and they, they in a taunting teasing hostile way.</span> <span id="s3512">so I</span></p> <p><span id="s3513">Q: This didnâ€™t escalate, they didnâ€™t actually hurt you or</span></p> <p><span id="s3514">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s3515">Q: there was no, they didnâ€™t isolate you for being different.</span></p> <p><span id="s3516">A: No.</span> <span id="s3517">I think I was closer to a couple of guys that were more city that we were different from everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">Q: And you had your own support group then.</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: Now given that you had very different ideas about what was going to happen before you got the desk job, before your friend finds you in the fox hole.</span> <span id="s3521">So during those months how are you coping with the disappointment.</span> <span id="s3522">Is it a disappointment?</span></p> <p><span id="s3523">A: It wasnâ€™t, I mean I just took it as life, something to cope with.</span> <span id="s3524">I mean I didnâ€™t try to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s3525">Except cope with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3526">Q: You werenâ€™t angry</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">A: Just the army, thatâ€™s all.</span> <span id="s3528">I mean you know what, I figured thatâ€™s just normal and when I got orders to go to the 71st light division, I did look up what a light division was in the camp library.</span> <span id="s3529">And it said jungle, mountain, mule pack, amphibious and paratroop.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">Q: And what did you think when you saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">A: and then I, then I said god I donâ€™t want any of those and then it turned out to be a combination of two of them, jungle and mountain.</span> <span id="s3532">But you know my son was a paratrooper so</span></p> <p><span id="s3533">Q: What year</span></p> <p><span id="s3534">A: Oh 20 years ago or something.</span> <span id="s3535">Or no more than that.</span> <span id="s3536">heâ€™s in his 50s</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">Q: Was there a war on</span></p> <p><span id="s3538">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">Q: It wasnâ€™t his time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3540">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3541">Q: Because you were not drafted, you were a volunteer, did you enjoy any perks, was there anything given to you as a reward for that or you were just treated the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s3542">A: My impression was that there were a lot of enlisted personnel in our outfit because it was an old Panama outfit.</span> <span id="s3543">It was a regular army outfit fixed infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3544">Q: So those were not draftees.</span></p> <p><span id="s3545">A: No but, but then there were draftees too so there were both.</span></p> <p><span id="s3546">Q; There was no distinction between an enlistee and a draftee</span></p> <p><span id="s3547">A: Well I think the newer ones, like the ones who were drafted along with me, would, we were different you know coming from cities or with more education than these other guys that</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">Q: But the system didnâ€™t treat you differently</span></p> <p><span id="s3549">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: This man recognizes you in the fox hole, this is your big breakthrough moment.</span> <span id="s3551">He takes you where, where do you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">A: In the service company, the same regiment but instead of company F which is a line company and I was a mortar, I was a 16 millimeter mortar ammunition bearer and I thought that I was lucky to get that, to get that assignment because a mortar squad is a little behind the lines cause you have to shoot over you know and but I was, there were 7 ammunition bearers in a mortar squad.</span> <span id="s3553">5, 5 or 7 I donâ€™tâ€™ remember and I was tail end.</span> <span id="s3554">I was the last one in so I considered myself really lucky that I got that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3555">Q: And then youâ€™re taken out of that company and put into service company</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">A: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">Q: And what letter is that, the service company.</span></p> <p><span id="s3558">A: Just service company</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">Q: Oh it doesnâ€™t have a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3560">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">Q: Are you given training in the service company.</span></p> <p><span id="s3562">A: I donâ€™t remember any training.</span> <span id="s3563">I think Iâ€™d have to learn the personnel situation, personnel procedures.</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">Q: You said earlier you were processing the new recruits, the boys who had been ASTP and who had just, just graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3565">A: That was in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3566">Q: In this company</span></p> <p><span id="s3567">A: No, yeah.</span> <span id="s3568">right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">Q: Are you still in Colorado at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3570">A: No we moved to we changed to a full division from a light division so I think thatâ€™s why I got the job in service company because it expanded everything expanded.</span> <span id="s3571">And classification specialist I guess was created or I donâ€™t know whether it was there before.</span> <span id="s3572">But when we changed to a full division instead of a light division we went to Fort Benning Georgia, and thatâ€™s where we were Fort Benning.</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">Q: How long did you stay in Fort Benning?</span> <span id="s3574">Approximately when did you get there and when did you leave</span></p> <p><span id="s3575">A: Until we went to overseas, We went overseas from New Jersey.</span> <span id="s3576">We were there just very briefly in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">Q: When did you get to Georgia and when did you leave Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">A: Well I donâ€™tâ€™ think we went, we got overseas until 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">Q: January of 45 is when you got overseas</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">A: Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3581">Q: So when you enlist this is 43, you do 13 weeks of basic training, so 13 weeks what is that, thatâ€™s about 3 months.</span> <span

Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">Q: Fields, roads</span></p> <p><span id="s3790">A: I think the most of the largest one was this camp that we opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3791">Q: Ok so

Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s3795">Another GI and I walked away from our unit.</span> <span id="s3796">We were just strolling and we came across this camp.</span> <span id="s3797">and we opened the door and out poured prisoners and some of them were so looked like skeletons and one, one called to me in Yiddish and said Iâ€™m one of you and Iâ€™m one of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">Q: So the prisoner said Iâ€™m one of you.</span> <span id="s3799">how did he know that you spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s3800">Or</span></p> <p><span id="s3801">A: He didnâ€™t.</span> <span id="s3802">I

<p><span id="s3806">Q: And what did you do when you heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">A: I didnâ€™t, I nothing.</span> <span id="s3808">I just I mean you know we had a rifle and a steel helmet and we were in full gear and, and they stumbled out and he, he dropped.</span> <span id="s3809">And I think he dropped dead.</span> <span id="s3810">And there were some who dropped dead and some just started flowing out so we ran back to our unit to try to get medics and to try to get everybody involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s3811">Q: but this was not the first time you had seen people in the striped uniforms</span></p> <p><span id="s3812">A: No we had seen others.</span> <span id="s3813">Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3814">Q: How frequently had you seen them.</span> <span id="s3815">Just a few incidents</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">A; Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">Q: and those incidents were, I understand you probably donâ€™tâ€™ remember the exact location but what was, was it in a field or on a road or in a other camp were they concentrated.</span> <span id="s3818">Was it many people, few people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">A: I think it was few.</span></p> <p><span id="s3820">Q: So you had come across these people in the striped clothing</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">A: I think so yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">Q: And you had known what about them exactly at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">A: that they were concentration camp prisoners</span></p> <p><span id="s3824">Q: and you knew about concentration camps because</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">A: Because I had read about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">Q: In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s3827">A: I donâ€™t know maybe, maybe the Yanks paper, maybe the GI paper or I knew about concentration camps from the time I was a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">Q: But would you, would you know of that the striped uniform is what a concentration camp inmate wears.</span></p> <p><span id="s3829">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3830">Q: Did the army ever brief you on who these people are or what to expect about these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3831">A: I think they did.</span> <span id="s3832">I think there was some discussion about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">Q: Do you have any concrete examples, any details.</span></p> <p><span id="s3834">A: No.</span> <span id="s3835">I donâ€™t.</span> <span id="s3836">no.</span> <span id="s3837">the military government we learned a lot about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">Q: But that was after having liberated</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">A: That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">Q: So when you happened upon this camp your idea of what youâ€™re seeing is what</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">A: You know Iâ€™m a little confused about prisoners of, German prisoners of war that were huddled together in trucks and they were carrying, they were driven away from where they were captured and prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners in the striped uniforms in trucks.</span> <span id="s3842">Seems to me that I saw them in trucks too but Iâ€™m not sure what they were rescued or carried and when we asked some of them on the roads.</span> <span id="s3843">And I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s3844">I just felt that I knew about concentration camps and prisoners well before that time and that we saw some.</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">Q: So as you were describing you opened the gates.</span> <span id="s3846">Were the gates locked</span></p> <p><span id="s3847">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s3848">Q: So you could just turn a handle and open it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3849">A: yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s3850">Q: Why had they not opened</span></p> <p><span id="s3851">A: And the guards were all gone.</span> <span id="s3852">The guards had left already and they took all the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s3853">Q: Do you know why they had not opened it?</span> <span id="s3854">the gate</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s3856">Q: Cause it seems to me youâ€™re saying</span></p> <p><span id="s3857">A: Yeah the other guy and I lifted it and opened it and I said my god we opened it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">Q: Do you remember the other guyâ€™s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">A: No, I have been trying to think of it and I canâ€™t remember.</span> <span id="s3860">I remember what he looked like.</span> <span id="s3861">He was also in service company.</span> <span id="s3862">He, I donâ€™tâ€™ know whether he was a clerk of some sort or but</span></p> <p><span id="s3863">Q: So you opened the gate and this is when you hear the man speaking Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3864">A: He, he started coming out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3865">Q: What were your thoughts when you heard that.</span> <span id="s3866">have pity</span></p> <p><span id="s3867">A: I just felt touched.</span> <span id="s3868">Moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">Q: the fact that he was speaking Yiddish</span></p> <p><span id="s3870">A: Yeah and that he was so, so thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3871">Q: So did you immediately decide to go back to your company</span></p> <p><span id="s3872">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">Q:

company</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">A: Oh immediately.</span> <span id="s3877">WE, we turned around and ran back when we saw all the, all these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3878">Q: and what did you tell your company, what had you just seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">A: That we opened a concentration camp and take over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Q: Ok and what did they do</span></p> <p><span id="s3881">A: They did.</span> <span id="s3882">As I recall they went there and they evacuated the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3883">Q: Did you go back with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">A: It was amb, you know they got ambulances and they got yeah I well, I donâ€™tâ€™ remember too much after that.</span> <span id="s3885">Where we, where we, we were assigned to something else right away or</span></p> <p><span id="s3886">Q: So did you ever go back to Mauthausen during that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s3887">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3888">Q: There was just that one interaction of, Iâ€™m sorry Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s3889">That one situation where youâ€™re opening the gate and then you immediately went back to the company so you did not enter the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3890">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3891">Q: And you must have been there just a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3892">A: May, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3893">Q: How many people did you see</span></p> <p><span id="s3894">A: Maybe dozens in the background.</span> <span id="s3895">They smelled of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s3896">Q: Tell me about the smell</span></p> <p><span id="s3897">A: It just had that awful smell.</span></p> <p><span id="s3898">Q: What was it reminiscent of</span></p> <p><span id="s3899">A: I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s3900">it smelled bad and people said thatâ€™s the smell of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">Q: Which people</span></p> <p><span id="s3902">A: the guys in the army.</span> <span id="s3903">I just donâ€™tâ€™ remember too much of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">Q: What was the weather like that day.</span> <span id="s3905">Was it raining</span></p>

Johanna Neumann</span></p> <p><span id="s3915">(file: RG-50.030.0662.02.02)</span></p> <p><span id="s3916">Q: This is Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s3917">Interviewing with Lester Libo, contacted by me, by Johanna Neumann, October 25, 2012 in Washington, DC.</span> <span id="s3918">And this interview is being conducted over the phone.</span> <span id="s3919">And now I am introducing myself to you.</span> <span id="s3920">I understand that you had some interview already, part of your interview already took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s3921">A: Yes, it was an interview there, in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s3922">Q: I I see ok.</span> <span id="s3923">Well I think I hope you are comfortable and sitting down and relaxing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">A: Yes, I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">Q: Ok, very good.</span> <span id="s3926">Where are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">A: I am in Albuquerque.</span></p> <p><span id="s3928">Q: Ah, New Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">A: New Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s3930">Q: Thatâ€™s where you live</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">Q: Ok, very good.</span> <span id="s3933">Well I was very much interested to hear and I also listened a little bit to the original interview.</span> <span id="s3934">What your function was after World War II.</span> <span id="s3935">How did you get involved with the de-Nazification and why were you chosen to be part of that program.</span></p> <p><span id="s3936">A: Well I was, I was in the infantry and we were in occupation in Augsburg and I was just bored I guess.</span> <span id="s3937">And I heard about military government needing people so I applied for a transfer and I got it and they transferred me to Regensburg and when I went to, was put into public safety special branch.</span> <span id="s3938">And it turned out that the head of de-Nazification, the enlisted man who was the head of, the title was Chief Clerk, that he was leaving in a few days.</span> <span id="s3939">And I had a few years of college credit in psychology and I guess they thought that, that I could do it.</span> <span id="s3940">So I was only 22 years old but I wanted it and they thought I could do it.</span> <span id="s3941">So they trained me to fill his spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3942">Q: I suppose it was quite a challenge for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3943">A: Yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3944">Q: Now in this respect, how successful do you think that this program worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3945">A: Well in our district which was the state was Niederbeir and Oberfaus where Regensburg is.</span> <span id="s3946">We had the highest number of what you call it screenings.</span> <span id="s3947">We had the highest number of evaluations and removals of people from their jobs, Nazis, than anyone else in the US Zone.</span> <span id="s3948">We had, we were very successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3949">Q: When you say successful do you think that it had an impact on the Nazis.</span> <span id="s3950">To well letâ€™s say never mind repent but that they realized finally how wrong they had gone or how criminal their government had been or do you think that they did this mostly so that they would be spared from trials or prison or worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s3951">A: Well they didnâ€™t do it.</span> <span id="s3952">We did it.</span> <span id="s3953">We removed them.</span> <span id="s3954">We evaluated them.</span> <span id="s3955">And this is the US government.</span> <span id="s3956">It wasnâ€™t the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">Q: No, no I understand.</span> <span id="s3958">I know that.</span> <span id="s3959">but I was just wondering</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">A: We removed them from office in important jobs like in the government and in important jobs, administrative jobs and we removed thousands.</span> <span id="s3961">And that was our mission.</span> <span id="s3962">To cleanse the new government of Nazis as much as possible, at the higher levels.</span> <span id="s3963">I mean at the lower levels, there were many Nazi party members but we kept, if they were, if they had joined the party after summer of 37, they were considered ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s3964">Q: Because then they were forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s3965">A: If they hadnâ€™t held any po, any official position.</span></p> <p><span id="s3966">Q: The reason that you felt that way is because at that point they were forced, whether they liked it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3967">A: It was mandatory that they joined.</span></p> <p><span id="s3968">Q: Right, well my question really my next question actually was who were the individuals you were dealing with and had they been officials during the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s3969">So in a way you have answered that already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3970">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3971">Q: You said that they were, they had been in the government</span></p> <p><span id="s3972">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3973">Q: And you think that those who went into the party after 37, but in their hearts they were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s3974">Do you think</span></p> <p><span id="s3975">A: Oh, I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s3976">No I think it was mixed Iâ€™m sure.</span> <span id="s3977">That some believed in it and some were didnâ€™t and were forced into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3978">Q: How do you think what was the reaction on the part of these Germans.</span> <span id="s3979">They were removed from their office, by the United States military and what was their reaction to being chosen to be de-Nazified.</span> <span id="s3980">I assume that some were beyond that.</span> <span id="s3981">In other words, that they you know either ended up in prison or could not be used in</span></p> <p><span id="s3982">A: Oh yeah well the ones who were suspected of being war criminals, we didnâ€™t, we didnâ€™t process them.</span> <span id="s3983">We turned them over to counter intelligence, you know to intelligence.</span> <span id="s3984">And but we didnâ€™t deal with those.</span></p> <p><span id="s3985">Q: So you had good reason to think that the people you were dealing with it was worthwhile trying to change them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3986">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3987">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3988">A: Yeah, it didnâ€™t last long though.</span> <span id="s3989">We understood, I understand that it changed about you know in 1946 I think it was, late 1946.</span> <span id="s3990">I was there only until May 46.</span> <span id="s3991">I was there from September to May 46.</span> <span id="s3992">And we were very, we were very aggressive in pursuing Nazis and getting them out of office.</span> <span id="s3993">And some people I mean I understand the Germans themselves felt that it wasnâ€™t worth doing or something.</span> <span id="s3994">I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s3995">One I remember one Nazi party official that we removed from office.</span> <span id="s3996">Said to me that he had his days of glory and now itâ€™s turned over so you know itâ€™s wasnâ€™t worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3997">Q: In what language did you interrogate these people.</span> <span id="s3998">How did you</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">A: Well I had a German American.</span> <span id="s4000">I had an American originally from Germany as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s4001">He was in the army and so he was an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s4002">Q: By the way have you ever come across the name of an American lawyer by the name of Kent, no not American, German lawyer by the name of Kempner.</span></p> <p><span id="s4003">A: Kempner</span></p> <p><span id="s4004">Q: Kempner.</span> <span id="s4005">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4006">A: Sounds familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s4007">Q: Oh because apparently he is was a lawyer who interrogated also these kind of people, people who had been in office, who had held government jobs and trying to find out how much did they know.</span> <span id="s4008">What was going on.</span> <span id="s4009">Were they in favor of it or not and so on.</span> <span id="s4010">And apparently he you know he became quite well known.</span> <span id="s4011">Thatâ€™s maybe he was, why the name is familiar to you.</span> <span id="s4012">Yeah, Kempner is his name.</span> <span id="s4013">He was German interrogating his own people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4014">A: Unh hunh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4015">Q: Ok so did they honestly cooperate or did they just want to escape punishment and therefore participated in the program.</span> <span id="s4016">What would you think.</span></p> <p><span id="s4017">A: No.</span> <span id="s4018">I well they were being investigated.</span> <span id="s4019">They wanted to get away with, they, I donâ€™t think they cooperated.</span> <span id="s4020">They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s4021">Q: They did not cooperate with the American military.</span></p> <p><span id="s4022">A: Well who were you thinking of.</span> <span id="s4023">The people who were</span></p> <p><span id="s4024">Q: The people who were supposed to be de-Nazified.</span></p> <p><span id="s4025">A: the people who were screened.</span></p> <p><span id="s4026">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4027">A: well yeah, filled out the fragebogen and handed it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s4028">Q: That was my question too.</span> <span id="s4029">How honest were the answers.</span> <span id="s4030">How could you assess that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4031">A: Well thatâ€™s an interesting question because a lots, many Germans came from the east zone.</span> <span id="s4032">And there were no records to check on their responses.</span> <span id="s4033">But in our zone, in our area, Regensburg itself had an intact record center that had all the Nazi records.</span> <span id="s4034">So people from the local area we could check on.</span> <span id="s4035">So we had so we had a routine check in the record center, in Regensburg on everybody.</span> <span id="s4036">People who came from Poland or east Germany, whatever, we had no way of checking on them so of course they were more susp, they were more suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s4037">Q: So you think that some of them really well let me ask you this then.</span> <span id="s4038">How did you determine who was to get into the program.</span></p> <p><span id="s4039">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s4040">Q: Yeah how did you choose the individuals that you thought would qualify to be in the program and be de-Nazified.</span></p> <p><span id="s4041">A: I, I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s4042">We didnâ€™t choose.</span> <span id="s4043">Somebody chose.</span> <span id="s4044">Military government, I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s4045">We were the evaluators, but we didnâ€™tâ€™ do the initial choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s4046">Q: So you were handed a list of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4047">A: yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4048">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4049">I understand and then you did your best to try and get the Nazi ideology out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4050">A: Well not to get the Nazi ideology out of them but to, to keep the ones that were more serious Nazis out of important jobs.</span> <span id="s4051">I mean we didnâ€™t expect to change their ideology.</span></p> <p><span id="s4052">Q: And how did you, you were a young person as you mentioned earlier.</span> <span id="s4053">How did you feel to carry out such a difficult burden.</span> <span id="s4054">I mean in a way from a human point of view, this is quite a hard burden to carry because you decide on somebodyâ€™s future in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s4055">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s4056">It was a joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s4057">Q: Oh ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s4058">A; I was glad to do it.</span> <span id="s4059">it was a revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s4060">Q: Well that I can understand, right.</span> <span id="s4061">Now how was the</span></p> <p><span id="s4062">A: You know Iâ€™m Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s4063">Q: I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4064">A: So I you know I saw that as a good kind of revenge.</span></p> <p><span id="s4065">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4066">And well ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s4067">A: My interpreter was also Jewish.</span> <span id="s4068">He was a German Jewish refugee who was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">Q: Yeah well many of them came at an age here to America and then enlisted in the army.</span> <span id="s4070">Thatâ€™s right.</span> <span id="s4071">you know I come from that part of the world too.</span> <span id="s4072">I am originally from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4073">A: Oh yeah, well thatâ€™s in the north.</span></p> <p><span id="s4074">Q: Ok now what was the procedure.</span> <span id="s4075">Was this program conducted on one, on a one on one basis or did you have groups at the same time and how exactly did you proceed in this project, in this program of de-Nazification.</span></p> <p><span id="s4076">A: Well we had the fragebogens.</span> <span id="s4077">And they would come in and they would have to be evaluated.</span> <span id="s4078">And we had a staff of evaluators that were about 30 people.</span> <span id="s4079">And there were they went over them and they would come to me with say this one looks suspicious and this one.</span> <span id="s4080">You know and so on but there were, there were procedures to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s4081">Q: I see ok, so you followed a protocol in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s4082">A: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s4083">Q: Ok but then and then letâ€™s say now you have chosen 10 or 20 or 30 these individuals.</span> <span id="s4084">It was conducted like in a classroom or was it conducted on a one to one basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s4085">A: No, one to one</span></p> <p><span id="s4086">Q: It was one to one</span></p> <p><span id="s4087">A: Well each, each questionnaire was, it was a separate investigation.</span> <span id="s4088">A separate, a separate procedure for each individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s4089">Q: I see, and what was the procedure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4090">A: The procedure was to evaluate their questionnaire and to come up with a rating and there were five categories.</span> <span id="s4091">You know.</span> <span id="s4092">you know those five categories.</span> <span id="s4093">Number one is mandatory removal.</span> <span id="s4094">Number 2 is discretionary adverse recommendation.</span> <span id="s4095">Number 3 is discretionary no recommendation.</span> <span id="s4096">Number 4 is no evidence of anti, no evidence of Nazi activity.</span> <span id="s4097">And number 5 was evidence of anti-Nazi activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s4098">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4099">A: And so each individual would get a rating that would be the conclusion and then if they were in the 4 or 5 they would be removed from office or un, not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the allies, by the Americans for you know like homes could be used for troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s4100">Q: Yeah and how long did such a process take.</span></p> <p><span id="s4101">A: The evaluation process.</span></p> <p><span id="s4102">Q; Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4103">A: Just, just.</span> <span id="s4104">It was I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s4105">I would say anywhere from an hour to a couple of days.</span> <span id="s4106">It depended on if there were any complications because we also had a special investigations unit that would look into difficult cases that were you know harder to figure out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4107">Q: right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4108">A: You know they might go to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s4109">Q: Did you interview members of their family or I donâ€™t know</span></p> <p><span id="s4110">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4111">Q: Or friends or</span></p> <p><span id="s4112">A: We didnâ€™t necessarily interview them either.</span> <span id="s4113">Most were, the action in most cases was taken on the basis of the questionnaire alone.</span> <span id="s4114">We would bring them in for interviews if we had questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s4115">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4116">Oh you mean you got the fragebogen that you evaluated, but you didnâ€™t necessarily have the individual in front of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4117">A: thatâ€™s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4118">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4119">I didnâ€™t realize that.</span> <span id="s4120">Now I suppose I had a different concept somewhat.</span> <span id="s4121">I thought that after you went through the fragebogen and you decided who was suspicious or wasnâ€™t suspicious, that they somehow got some kind of a I donâ€™tâ€™ want to call it brain washing, but some kind of a you know democratic viewpoint or, or</span></p> <p><span id="s4122">A: Oh no, no it was strictly</span></p> <p><span id="s4123">Q: Based on their fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s4124">A: Yeah it was strictly screening.</span> <span id="s4125">No attempt to change them.</span> <span id="s4126">or, or argue with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4127">Q: And were they cooperative.</span> <span id="s4128">Were they hostile, antagonistic or</span></p> <p><span id="s4129">A: Well I would say the main attitude was to try to get out of it.</span> <span id="s4130">you know to say that they were innocent.</span> <span id="s4131">You know nicht Nazi, Nicht Nazi was, was their motto.</span> <span id="s4132">There was</span></p> <p><span id="s4133">Q: That was easy to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s4134">A: There was one case I remember where this man said that he understands that the tables are turned and he had his days of glory and now his side had lost and heâ€™s prepared to take the consequences.</span> <span id="s4135">And he you know he said well we had our day and now you have your day.</span> <span id="s4136">Well that was very unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s4137">Q: To admit that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4138">A: To do that.</span> <span id="s4139">Most of them were made excuses.</span> <span id="s4140">You know and they said they were forced and that they were not really a Nazi and so on.</span> <span id="s4141">And of course the people from, who came from east Germany there was no way to check.</span></p> <p><span id="s4142">Q: Thatâ€™s the other big problem in Nazi mind.</span> <span id="s4143">So I was, one of the questions I had in my mind was, was there any material use during this process.</span> <span id="s4144">But I guess it wasnâ€™t cause I had a different concept of it at all.</span> <span id="s4145">You know I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures</span></p> <p><span id="s4146">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s4147">there was not attempt to change anybody.</span> <span id="s4148">It was completely screening.</span></p> <p><span id="s4149">Q: And at the least suspicious back into the work force.</span></p> <p><span id="s4150">A: To what</span></p> <p><span id="s4151">Q: I said and then to get the least suspicious individuals back into the working force.</span></p> <p><span id="s4152">A: Yeah well to allow them to continue in their jobs.</span> <span id="s4153">Or to be hired.</span></p> <p><span id="s4154">Q: I understand, yeah.</span> <span id="s4155">Ok letâ€™s see now.</span> <span id="s4156">What qualifications did you have or were required in order to be part of this process.</span></p> <p><span id="s4157">A: Well I was a college student.</span> <span id="s4158">I was a psychology major and I also had experience working in personnel administration.</span> <span id="s4159">So I had administrative experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s4160">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4161">And were you in charge of this particular program.</span></p> <p><span id="s4162">A: yes I was well, I was an enlisted man.</span> <span id="s4163">I was a ser, a sergeant.</span> <span id="s4164">The person in charge of the whole thing was an officer.</span> <span id="s4165">A captain.</span> <span id="s4166">And he and there was also a lieutenant.</span> <span id="s4167">So I remember there were 2 American officers that were in charge, but the day to day work was done by the day to day work of being in charge, I mean, was done by an enlisted man.</span> <span id="s4168">And my predecessor was the one who was being discharged.</span> <span id="s4169">He was also a Jewish guy from the states.</span> <span id="s4170">And I was put in to learn, learn the ropes.</span> <span id="s4171">And learn the job.</span> <span id="s4172">That he did.</span> <span id="s4173">Heading up the staff.</span> <span id="s4174">Supervising the staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s4175">Q: I see, so you were in a supervisory position.</span></p> <p><span id="s4176">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4177">The title was chief clerk</span></p> <p><span id="s4178">Q: Good, very good.</span> <span id="s4179">Were the Germans that participated under oath.</span> <span id="s4180">When I say those who sent out the fragebogen and was there anywhere where they had to I donâ€™t know sign that like we say here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s4181">A: I think, I think they signed it, they had, when they signed it, it said it, I think it probably said in there that something about</span></p> <p><span id="s4182">Q: But they were not on any verbal oath or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4183">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4184">Q: I think they got away with too much.</span> <span id="s4185">Well that was another question I had.</span> <span id="s4186">How could you be sure that what they put down in their fragebogen was an honest answer, but I think you answered that already.</span> <span id="s4187">And you could check it unless they came from the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s4188">A: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s4189">Q: Yeah well.</span> <span id="s4190">Thatâ€™s of course a big problem but and that I guess wasnâ€™t really eliminated until the 90s right when they got records.</span> <span id="s4191">What did you hope to achieve with this de-Nazification program.</span></p> <p><span id="s4192">A: Cleansing.</span> <span id="s4193">Well to keep the new Germany, the new German government more democratic.</span> <span id="s4194">And, and not, not back in the hands of the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s4195">Q: And do you think you succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s4196">A: We succeeded in, in our job.</span> <span id="s4197">We understand that the new German government kind of weakened and we had heard that Nazis were being kept or hired again.</span></p> <p><span id="s4198">Q: And that was under Adenauer or</span></p> <p><span id="s4199">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4200">Q: Well I guess you were dealing here with what 52 million people or however many</span></p> <p><span id="s4201">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4202">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4203">so you told me already where you were located right.</span> <span id="s4204">And in Regensburg or where was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4205">A: Regensburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s4206">Q: And thatâ€™s where your work was located, in that part of Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s4207">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4208">Q: How long did you work in this capacity.</span></p> <p><span id="s4209">A: I was there from September of 45 to May of 46.</span></p> <p><span id="s4210">Q: At the time that was in a DP camp in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s4211">A: Oh</span></p> <p><span id="s4212">Q: Well beyond that even and so August I guess of 46.</span> <span id="s4213">Ok.</span> <span id="s4214">What are some of the most memorable incidents that you remember from that period.</span> <span id="s4215">You already told me about the guy who said you had your day.</span> <span id="s4216">I mean we had our day, now you have your day.</span> <span id="s4217">Iâ€™m sure you came across a number of other memorable incidents with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4218">A: Well I think one was when the statistics came out to show that we had the highest number of removals in the whole US zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s4219">Q: The highest removal.</span> <span id="s4220">Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s4221">A: The highest number.</span></p> <p><span id="s4222">Q: Well Bavaria is sort of Hitler country, perhaps thatâ€™s why.</span> <span id="s4223">Munich thatâ€™s part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4224">A: Also we had heard that the British were sitting and having tea with the Nazis and that the French I donâ€™t know, the French were either a very vengeful or just didnâ€™t care but that the United States forces were the most serious about de Nazification so we were proud that we were doing a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s4225">Q: Ok but specifically on a one to one from an individual did you have any memorable incidents.</span> <span id="s4226">That occurred with you know you speaking to any of these people or in conversation or</span></p> <p><span id="s4227">A: I donâ€™t remember any specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s4228">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4229">Now you think that the program was effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s4230">A: Well it was effective while we were doing it but it was overturned.</span> <span id="s4231">You know it was watered down and then it was done away with.</span></p> <p><span id="s4232">Q: How soon would you think was it watered down.</span> <span id="s4233">I think that really is also important point because was there already a new younger generation coming in or</span></p> <p><span id="s4234">A: No it was not while we were there.</span> <span id="s4235">it was after.</span> <span id="s4236">We heard that it was done afterward.</span> <span id="s4237">Probably in late 46.</span></p> <p><span id="s4238">Q: What that they overturned this program.</span></p> <p><span id="s4239">A: Thatâ€™s what I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s4240">Q: Unh hunh.</span> <span id="s4241">Well any other highlights that you remember during this period.</span> <span id="s4242">I mean some really heavy duty Nazis that were discovered in this way.</span> <span id="s4243">I assume that perhaps through the fragebogen you did discover some</span></p> <p><span id="s4244">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4245">Q: Anybody specific</span></p> <p><span id="s4246">A: No I canâ€™t remember it.</span> <span id="s4247">any big, big name.</span></p> <p><span id="s4248">Q: Yeah I mean really big shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s4249">A: No I donâ€™t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s4250">Q: What about how was it justified that some of the Nazis signed this et cetera, ended up here.</span></p> <p><span id="s4251">A: Oh I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s4252">I donâ€™t know anything about that.</span> <span id="s4253">I guess United States needed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4254">Q: Or they would have fallen into the hands of the, of the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s4255">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4256">Q: Do you think, now let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s4257">what are some of the strengths or weaknesses of this program.</span></p> <p><span id="s4258">A: Well I think the weakness was not, not having record centers, not having records on people who came from other areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s4259">Q: Youâ€™re right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4260">A: Other than that I think it was done very well.</span> <span id="s4261">You know and was serious.</span> <span id="s4262">People were removed and gradually jobs were, were given to people who were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s4263">There werenâ€™t many there werenâ€™t many around you know.</span> <span id="s4264">there was practically everybody was in the Nazi party because of the mandatory membership.</span> <span id="s4265">From 37 on.</span></p> <p><span id="s4266">Q: Not that I realize and thatâ€™s of course very difficult to make this distinction.</span> <span id="s4267">And then to be sure that yeah, really difficult.</span> <span id="s4268">Did you were you able to obtain lists of Nazi party members.</span></p> <p><span id="s4269">A: If I recall there was one time when somebody uncovered a record or a list of, of members that we could check against, against our applicants.</span> <span id="s4270">It was kind of a surprise treasure that was uncovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s4271">Q: I can imagine yeah.</span> <span id="s4272">and probably to the great disappointment of some of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4273">A: Yeah right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4274">Q: there you have it black on white.</span></p> <p><span id="s4275">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4276">Q: I had a question of how were the candidates for de Nazification chosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s4277">A: It was a routine thing on their job.</span> <span id="s4278">It was because of what, what poss, I guess to.</span> <span id="s4279">I guess it was you know everybody in certain jobs in the government or in important positions in the society.</span></p> <p><span id="s4280">Q: that you really needed in order to</span></p> <p><span id="s4281">A: We didnâ€™t, we didnâ€™tâ€™ select them.</span> <span id="s4282">they were we received, we received them.</span> <span id="s4283">Somebody else selected them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4284">Q: Made the selection.</span> <span id="s4285">Now when you say somebody else, you mean from among the allies, not from within the Germans themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s4286">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s4287">I donâ€™t, I donâ€™tâ€™ really know.</span> <span id="s4288">it might be that an order went in from military government that everybody in a certain industry had to submit a fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s4289">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4290">So really everything all the, all the selection and I hate to use that word for obvious reasons, but letâ€™s just use it for lack of a better word.</span> <span id="s4291">So all the selections were really based entirely on the fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s4292">A: On the all the selections.</span></p> <p><span id="s4293">Q: Yeah who was going to be de Nazified or not</span></p> <p><span id="s4294">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s4295">Well it started with the fragebogen and then if there were questions or suspicions then, then there would be interviews, and further investigations.</span></p> <p><span id="s4296">Q: Did you do all the interviews yourself as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s4297">A: Did what</span></p> <p><span id="s4298">Q: Did you do personally some of the interviews yourself or</span></p> <p><span id="s4299">A: No we had an American GI originally from Germany who was a special investigator and he would, he would do them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4300">Q: He would do the</span></p> <p><span id="s4301">A: The interviews.</span> <span id="s4302">And he would look into and he would do further investigation.</span></p> <p><span id="s4303">Q: I see so it really was a whole teamwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s4304">A: Oh yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s4305">Q: Now the work load must have been overwhelming.</span> <span id="s4306">As you said before, youâ€™re dealing with a whole nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s4307">A: Well we only had one state.</span></p> <p><span id="s4308">Q: now this, thatâ€™s a good answer because that brings me to another question.</span> <span id="s4309">Did you, did the United States have such programs all over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s4310">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4311">Yes it was the whole US zone was divided into areas and all of them had the same kind of thing we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s4312">Q: I see, I see</span></p> <p><span id="s4313">A: And we were just one, we were just in one state.</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">Q: The Niederbier yeah.</span> <span id="s4315">I see so this really was a well-organized undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s4316">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4317">Q: I mean so what would you say roughly.</span> <span id="s4318">How many people in your sector or in your section were involved in this.</span> <span id="s4319">Germans I mean</span></p> <p><span id="s4320">A: Oh the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s4321">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4322">A: I, I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s4323">A million, I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s4324">I donâ€™t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s4325">Q: Well it was a vast undertaking.</span> <span id="s4326">When you talk about the Americans having done that.</span> <span id="s4327">And I was not aware of that either, that this was not an allied undertaking.</span> <span id="s4328">I always was under the impression that this was a cooperative undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s4329">A: NO this was American.</span> <span id="s4330">And the others had their own systems.</span></p> <p><span id="s4331">Q: Did they also call it de Nazification</span></p> <p><span id="s4332">A: I donâ€™tâ€™ think so.</span> <span id="s4333">I donâ€™tâ€™ know what they had.</span> <span id="s4334">I mean we had heard that the British were having tea with the Nazis and the French were just wrecking their stores and homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4335">Q: So not a</span></p> <p><span id="s4336">A: Oh and the Russians were terrible you know.</span> <span id="s4337">Everybody ran away from the Russians and said that they were monsters.</span> <span id="s4338">They were so vengeful at the destruction that the Germans did of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s4339">Q: Well and also a lot of Russians died because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4340">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4341">Q: So let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s4342">What would you say how did this experience affect you as a young person, in such a responsible position you know which involved really impacting the course of peopleâ€™s lives.</span> <span id="s4343">Were you aware of your power.</span> <span id="s4344">Were you troubled by the fact that you did not have experience in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s4345">A: No, actually I think it matured me.</span> <span id="s4346">I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s4347">we lived well.</span> <span id="s4348">I mean we had a hotel room.</span> <span id="s4349">We had a, we had a you know we lived in a hotel.</span> <span id="s4350">We had dances.</span> <span id="s4351">We had an orchestra.</span> <span id="s4352">We had a bar.</span> <span id="s4353">We I had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s4354">We had a chauffeur to go wherever we wanted to like to a play or an opera.</span> <span id="s4355">Or a concert.</span> <span id="s4356">It was a, it was a very educational experience.</span> <span id="s4357">I mean I was so young, I had 3 years of college credit, which I had done in 2 years and so you know</span></p> <p><span id="s4358">Q: Did you pursue psychology in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s4359">A: Yes, yeah I went on and got a PhD in psychology.</span></p> <p><span id="s4360">Q: Very nice, lovely.</span> <span id="s4361">Well so you were telling me that so close after the war ended, this horrible war, they had already concerts, theater, opera and dances and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s4362">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s4363">Q: I guess people are very resilient.</span></p> <p><span id="s4364">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4365">Well Regensburg wasnâ€™t wrecked as much as some other cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s4366">Q: Yeah I know, but Hamburg was destroyed by 75%</span></p> <p><span id="s4367">A: Bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4368">Q: yeah and were you, you said you enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s4369">so I assume you enjoyed the feeling of having power over these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4370">A: Well it wasnâ€™t that.</span> <span id="s4371">it was just having an important job.</span> <span id="s4372">And having a lot of luxuries of, of you know living well.</span> <span id="s4373">I knew there were also the problems of being away from home and living in you know still living in a hostile environment.</span> <span id="s4374">I mean we werenâ€™t you know it was, it was dangerous to walk down the streets alone at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s4375">Q: You just answered my next question which really was how dangerous or how hostile were these people against the well the allies in general but the United States army soldiers that were in</span></p> <p><span id="s4376">A: Well there were, there were always stories about an attack.</span> <span id="s4377">You know there were, there were German army veterans.</span> <span id="s4378">There was Hitler Youth, former members that were true believers.</span> <span id="s4379">There were stories that there were attacks on GIs and but I donâ€™tâ€™ remember that anybody in our unit was attacked.</span> <span id="s4380">But we were always careful.</span> <span id="s4381">I mean I rambler walk, walking down the street, myself at night like if I took my girlfriend home and then I would walk back to my hotel, I would carry a knife.</span></p> <p><span id="s4382">Q: I see so you really did need a bit of protection after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s4383">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4384">Q: You were not welcomed with open arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s4385">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s4386">although many of them acted that way.</span> <span id="s4387">oh yeah they acted that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s4388">Q: Well it probably netted them some chocolate and nylon stockings and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s4389">A: Thatâ€™s right and they were glad the war was over.</span> <span id="s4390">And cigarettes were very important, cigarettes and chocolate and stockings yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4391">Q: What days these were.</span> <span id="s4392">Oh my god.</span> <span id="s4393">I remember them quite well still.</span> <span id="s4394">I had a question whether you had to follow a protocol in this process or whether it was you know partially your own instinct to realize who was honest, who was not honest, et cetera.</span> <span id="s4395">What guided your work more, the protocol that you had to follow or the instinct that you felt when confronting some of these fragebogen.</span></p> <p><span id="s4396">A: Probably both.</span> <span id="s4397">You know for instance if there was a contradictions in dates or functions.</span> <span id="s4398">See I didnâ€™t, I wasnâ€™t an evaluator myself.</span> <span id="s4399">I was a head of the unit so the evaluator would come to me with a question.</span> <span id="s4400">They would say here is, here is this fragebogen where this guy answers this on this place in that and that place and it looks like a contradiction and so on.</span> <span id="s4401">so they would come to me with questions.</span> <span id="s4402">But they would, they would do the evaluations.</span> <span id="s4403">I wouldnâ€™t.</span> <span id="s4404">But I would train them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4405">Q: A question just came to my mind.</span> <span id="s4406">Most of Germany was mobilized into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s4407">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4408">Q: And these people that you dealt with were people who were holding office jobs or, or were working for the government in a different capacity, not in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s4409">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4410">Q: How did they manage to stay out of the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s4411">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s4412">Q: but these guys in other words had that you were dealing with had not been in, in the military in the Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s4413">A: I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s4414">I think some were, some were.</span> <span id="s4415">In both.</span> <span id="s4416">Civilian and had been in the army too.</span> <span id="s4417">I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s4418">I think they were in the army and then they were this was peace time.</span></p> <p><span id="s4419">Q: Well just a few months, yeah they may have been demobilized by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s4420">A: Right so maybe the records show that they were in the Nazi party and then they were in the army and now they were out in a job.</span> <span id="s4421">And they were being screened in the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s4422">Q: how often did you come across or did they honestly</span></p> <p><span id="s4423">A: how what</span></p> <p><span id="s4424">Q: How often did you come across somebody who honestly said that he was a member of the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s4425">A: Oh none, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s4426">Q: Nobody, I see A; No, we didnâ€™t come we didnâ€™tâ€™ come across many SS.</span> <span id="s4427">I think they were picked up by other intelligence but maybe they were picked up before, before they got to us.</span> <span id="s4428">I donâ€™tâ€™ remember many, I donâ€™tâ€™ remember many SS members.</span> <span id="s4429">I remember some SA members.</span></p> <p><span id="s4430">Q: Yes well that was a forerunner.</span></p> <p><span id="s4431">A: Sturm aftilung</span></p> <p><span id="s4432">Q: Yes, well they were the forerunners to the SS actually I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s4433">A: Yeah they were the brown shirts.</span></p> <p><span id="s4434">Q: Yeah the beginning of the whole business.</span></p> <p><span id="s4435">A: yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4436">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s4437">How did it affect you as a Jew to be put into this position to work with Nazis and trying to sort of get them back on the normal footing, on the, on the non-Nazi life style.</span> <span id="s4438">Well non-Nazi outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s4439">A: Well I was certainly motivated</span></p> <p><span id="s4440">Q: AS a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s4441">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4442">I was glad to pay them back and I was glad to see justice being done.</span></p> <p><span id="s4443">Q: What happened by the way to those people that were fired from their jobs and did not could not be reemployed and enter the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s4444">A: yeah thatâ€™s a good question.</span> <span id="s4445">I donâ€™t know.</span> <span id="s4446">we always wondered about that.</span> <span id="s4447">what happened to them.</span> <span id="s4448">maybe they, they just did some kind of business by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s4449">Q: Well this was Germany has always been a big bureaucratic structure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4450">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4451">Q: but</span></p> <p><span id="s4452">A: Maybe they went into some kind of business or got a job in a business where</span></p> <p><span id="s4453">Q: But you donâ€™tâ€™, you donâ€™t know what I mean unless they ended up in prison.</span> <span id="s4454">I suppose some of these people had a record or a record came where they actually</span></p> <p><span id="s4455">A: They werenâ€™t in prisons.</span> <span id="s4456">They I mean some of them lost their homes.</span> <span id="s4457">And</span></p> <p><span id="s4458">Q: well you said they, their finances were</span></p> <p><span id="s4459">A: yeah their bank account was frozen.</span> <span id="s4460">They were allowed to take out just like $200 a month, something like that.</span> <span id="s4461">they were punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s4462">Q: Not enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s4463">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4464">Q : Not enough but what can you do.</span> <span id="s4465">You could have taken a whole nation and cut them off from the map of the world like Mr. Morgenthau wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s4466">A: By the way I wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s4467">kind of a far out question.</span></p> <p><span id="s4468">Q: Yes, ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s4469">A: I have written a novel based on my experience there.</span> <span id="s4470">itâ€™s called the Finishing Touch and itâ€™s about de-Nazification.</span> <span id="s4471">And it has a love story woven in and out of it.</span> <span id="s4472">but you know itâ€™s about an American who falls in love with a German woman and the German woman has two brothers.</span> <span id="s4473">One of whom was a notorious Nazi and the and one died.</span> <span id="s4474">And the one who was the Nazi took, takes on the identity of the one who died and tries to pass as the one who died.</span> <span id="s4475">And so there is this intrigue about who which, which brother is this and trying to trace and find out and so on, so.</span> <span id="s4476">Itâ€™s a suspense novel.</span> <span id="s4477">And I would like to find a publisher or an agent for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4478">Q: oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s4479">Sounds really very intriguing.</span> <span id="s4480">You did that in recent years.</span></p> <p><span id="s4481">A: I just wrote it.</span> <span id="s4482">I just finished it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4483">Q: how lovely.</span> <span id="s4484">Well thatâ€™s really a quite an undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s4485">A: yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4486">Q: Well thatâ€™s always very, very difficult to find a publisher but I suppose you could approach a number of you know known publishers and send them the manuscript.</span> <span id="s4487">.</span> <span id="s4488">I guess thatâ€™s how you go about it.</span> <span id="s4489">or you can go through some of the universities publish books.</span> <span id="s4490">But I donâ€™tâ€™ know whether you know, as a novel, but itâ€™s really a historic novel I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s4491">A: Yeah itâ€™s a historical novel.</span> <span id="s4492">It tells all about these kind of things that we talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s4493">Q: So possibly some of the universities might be interested.</span> <span id="s4494">I mean you have to start somewhere and usually you know one person gives you an idea and another person and eventually you may find somebody who does, sounds fascinating to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s4495">A: Well itâ€™s related to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s4496">Thatâ€™s why I asked you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4497">Q: Yeah, yeah right.</span> <span id="s4498">well we donâ€™tâ€™ do any publishing.</span> <span id="s4499">We have a book store that sells you know novels and mostly authentic stories about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s4500">And but these are all published book but we do not, we in the museum do not publish books.</span></p> <p><span id="s4501">A: By the way when I was in the infantry we had opened a, we had opened a concentration camp as, I was in Pattonâ€™s army as we swept across France, Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s4502">And was almost like a different town every, every day.</span> <span id="s4503">The advance was so fast.</span> <span id="s4504">But we, we came upon a Mauthausen and our unit opened one of the camps of Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s4505">Q: You mean one of the sub camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s4506">A: Yeah the sub camps.</span> <span id="s4507">Right.</span> <span id="s4508">and that was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s4509">Q: I bet.</span> <span id="s4510">And you found survivors there.</span></p> <p><span id="s4511">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s4512">Yeah.</span> <span id="s4513">Lots of people, itâ€™s were, were there.</span> <span id="s4514">we opened the gates and they streamed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4515">Q: Mauthausen, was that in Austria or was it in Germany.</span> <span id="s4516">Mauthausen was on the German side or Austrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s4517">A: I, I think it, I thought it was German.</span> <span id="s4518">But</span></p> <p><span id="s4519">Q: Could be, I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s4520">Iâ€™m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4521">A: I mean our unit went farther west, farther east than any other.</span></p> <p><span id="s4522">Q: So how long were you in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s4523">A: We, we met the Russians in, near Stier Austria.</span> <span id="s4524">I was in the army for 3 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s4525">Q: You enlisted or you</span></p> <p><span id="s4526">A: Yeah I enlisted.</span> <span id="s4527">I enlisted in 41.</span></p> <p><span id="s4528">Q: After Pearl Harbor</span></p> <p><span id="s4529">A: And then they had a program where you could stay in college.</span> <span id="s4530">And so I didnâ€™t actually didnâ€™t actually go in until 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s4531">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4532">Those were the worst years I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s4533">A: 43 and 46.</span> <span id="s4534">And then I was I was put in the infantry.</span> <span id="s4535">So but I was put in classification so I was the head of the classification part of the infantry regiment which is a personnel so</span></p> <p><span id="s4536">Q: So you saw a lot of battle though</span></p> <p><span id="s4537">A: A lot of what</span></p> <p><span id="s4538">Q: Battle.</span> <span id="s4539">I mean active warfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s4540">A: I saw a lot of what.</span></p> <p><span id="s4541">Q: Of active warfare.</span> <span id="s4542">Of, of battles.</span></p> <p><span id="s4543">A: Warfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s4544">Q: Yeah, I mean you were in the trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s4545">A: Oh yeah, yeah right.</span> <span id="s4546">No I saw a lot but I was not in, I was not actually in the front line.</span> <span id="s4547">I was in service, service company which is, which is in, itâ€™s an infantry regiment but itâ€™s, itâ€™s the clerks and the drivers and the supply people so we were, we were a little behind.</span> <span id="s4548">we were not in the foxholes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4549">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4550">Did you, you had a staff that worked with you, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4551">A: in the, in de-Nazification.</span> <span id="s4552">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4553">Q: How large a staff would you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s4554">A: Oh there were 35 people altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s4555">Q: and you were, you were the supervisor.</span> <span id="s4556">Of these 35 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4557">A: yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4558">Q: And they had to report back to you of their findings et cetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s4559">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4560">Q: Ok.</span> <span id="s4561">And who were they mostly.</span> <span id="s4562">They</span></p> <p><span id="s4563">A: They were mostly Germans and DPs.</span></p> <p><span id="s4564">Q: Oh I see, not the American soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s4565">A: there were, there were a few American soldiers but they were not the evaluators.</span> <span id="s4566">The evaluators were all German speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s4567">Q: I see, so they were Germans out of the population of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s4568">A: Some, some were Germans and some were DPs.</span> <span id="s4569">From, from other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s4570">Q: they spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s4571">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4572">Q: And DPs, also Jewish DPs.</span></p> <p><span id="s4573">A: There were a few but most of the DPs were not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s4574">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s4575">Well thatâ€™s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s4576">A: There were a few, I remember there was a Polish, couple of Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s4577">There were a couple that were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s4578">And there were others that were hidden or escaped.</span> <span id="s4579">But the majority were not Jewish, but there were some Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s4580">Q: How long would you say that this whole program last.</span></p> <p><span id="s4581">A: Well as I understand as I understood it, it didnâ€™t last much longer after I left.</span> <span id="s4582">That somehow with the new government they changed the thing.</span> <span id="s4583">Maybe the whole program lasted a year or a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s4584">Q: So thatâ€™s not very, no I excuse me.</span> <span id="s4585">I remember as a teenager hearing about this, papers were full of this de-Nazification, de-Nazification but I donâ€™t think that we ever had really a concept of what that really involved.</span> <span id="s4586">I think that perhaps maybe only in my own mind, I thought that it really was kind of a how shall I say it, yeah a curriculum thatâ€™s probably the right way.</span></p> <p><span id="s4587">A: Oh unh hunh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4588">Q: I thought it was like a curriculum of changing these peopleâ€™s outlook</span></p> <p><span id="s4589">A: No, no</span></p> <p><span id="s4590">Q: But youâ€™re telling me now that this was not it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s4591">A: No it was never, It was never like that.</span> <span id="s4592">it was political screening.</span> <span id="s4593">Cleansing of job holding.</span> <span id="s4594">But I think they, I think they let Nazis back in because they needed them.</span> <span id="s4595">They needed their job skills.</span> <span id="s4596">And also the whole scientific and technical development.</span></p> <p><span id="s4597">Q: And then you have the scientists that they needed</span></p> <p><span id="s4598">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4599">Q: What were the dynamics between your team members.</span></p> <p><span id="s4600">A: And</span></p> <p><span id="s4601">Q: No I said the dynamic between your team members, among themselves, the 35 or whatever, yeah, especially in view of the , of what you just told me that there were DP people and there were Germans and then there was the army so how did all that work.</span></p> <p><span id="s4602">A: It was every, it was fine.</span> <span id="s4603">I mean everybody worked together and everybody was changing, everybody got along.</span> <span id="s4604">Everybody had stories to tell about their own hardships.</span></p> <p><span id="s4605">Q: Well that I would believe yeah.</span> <span id="s4606">You remember some of those stories among those hardships that people</span></p> <p><span id="s4607">A: Well you know as I said a couple, a couple were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s4608">Some you know had to leave their homes and travel, escape, were in hiding.</span> <span id="s4609">For many years.</span> <span id="s4610">No I, as I recall everybody got along fine.</span> <span id="s4611">There were no frictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s4612">Q: Even among the people who were in a concentration camp and the Germans that they were</span></p> <p><span id="s4613">A: Well the Germans on our staff were anti-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s4614">Q: Yeah that I can understand, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s4615">A: So that was ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s4616">Q: But among themselves, they got along you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s4617">A: Yeah seems to me they got along.</span> <span id="s4618">I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s4619">I</span></p> <p><span id="s4620">Q: You did not notice any frictions.</span></p> <p><span id="s4621">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4622">Q: Well I guess maybe they were all out to do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4623">A: Yeah exactly.</span> <span id="s4624">No we were all doing an important job.</span> <span id="s4625">We realized that and it was, it was Nazi hunting.</span> <span id="s4626">And you know somebody would find a fragebogen that would have contradiction in it or show something or, or some, something would come up from the record center, showing that somebody that we had screened turned out to be an important Nazi office holder.</span> <span id="s4627">They would come into my office and, and hold it up like a victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s4628">Q: That flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s4629">A: yeah look what we found.</span> <span id="s4630">That was, those were the high spots was discovering somebody who had been cheating or finding a</span></p> <p><span id="s4631">Q: Do you, well I can imagine.</span> <span id="s4632">That that was regarded as a major victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s4633">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4634">Q: Well I donâ€™tâ€™ know.</span> <span id="s4635">whatever we tried to do I hope we accomplished it in some way or the other.</span> <span id="s4636">Was this an emotional situation for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s4637">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4638">somewhat I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s4639">Q: As an American or as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s4640">A: Well my family did not , my family, my parents and grandparents did not come from Germany.</span> <span id="s4641">They had, they had the were American immigrants.</span> <span id="s4642">They came from Russia and they came a lot earlier so they were not affected by what was going on in Germany with Hitler.</span> <span id="s4643">But everybody of course was very involved and very interested in, and cared a lot about what was happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s4644">So, so my work there in military government was, was highly respected.</span></p> <p><span id="s4645">Q: I can imagine yeah.</span> <span id="s4646">and I can imagine.</span> <span id="s4647">Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s4648">A: But the same thing was that it didnâ€™t last very long.</span> <span id="s4649">that you know within a year after I was out it went back into German hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s4650">Q: Thatâ€™s really too bad.</span> <span id="s4651">I didnâ€™t must confess that I did not realize it.</span> <span id="s4652">but then at that point I had come to the United States and I guess you know you start a new life and a new language and a new everything.</span> <span id="s4653">And somehow you leave these horrible events of the past behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s4654">A: Is your name Johanna</span></p> <p><span id="s4655">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s4656">A: So how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s4657">Q: Right now Iâ€™m 81.</span></p> <p><span id="s4658">A: Oh, ok.</span> <span id="s4659">Iâ€™m 89.</span> <span id="s4660">Oh so you yeah so you came to the states then.</span></p> <p><span id="s4661">Q: Yeah at 1946.</span> <span id="s4662">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s4663">A: Then same as me.</span></p> <p><span id="s4664">Q: Yeah but you grew up here.</span> <span id="s4665">I didnâ€™t.</span></p> <p><span id="s4666">A: Yeah right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4667">Q: My parents had the good fortune of finding</span></p> <p><span id="s4668">A: You know in the states during the 30s we knew German Jewish refugees</span></p> <p><span id="s4669">Q: Yeah well some of them came early.</span> <span id="s4670">They were smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s4671">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4672">Q: Well my parents found out that Albania allowed Jews to come in and thatâ€™s where we went and thatâ€™s where we survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s4673">A: Albania.</span> <span id="s4674">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4675">Q: But you know the Germans occupied that country as well in 1943.</span> <span id="s4676">Yeah but the Albanian people were exceptional among the nations.</span> <span id="s4677">Of saving, they were exceptionally among the nations of saving Jews and not handing them over and not</span></p> <p><span id="s4678">A: Oh thatâ€™s interesting.</span> <span id="s4679">Thatâ€™s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s4680">Q: Yeah, yes it is and itâ€™s not much known, not well known at all and in fact you know I speak in many places, in schools et cetera to talk about that part of history.</span> <span id="s4681">And itâ€™s really important that people have to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4682">A: yeah, thatâ€™s why I want my novel to be published.</span> <span id="s4683">You know I wanted to ask you this interview is going to be on, is going to be on CD, on a CD or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s4684">Q: I believe so but I have this is actually the first time that they have asked me to do an interview.</span> <span id="s4685">You are my guinea pig.</span> <span id="s4686">And so I really donâ€™t know the exact correct answer to your question.</span> <span id="s4687">I believe itâ€™s going to be on a DVD yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4688">A: Because yeah because we wanted the family wanted, wanted a DVD.</span></p> <p><span id="s4689">Q: Yeah Iâ€™m

<span id="s4748">I am sure that there is so much material out there on many different issues and many different topics that we do not have information on so you know weâ€™re trying to get as much as possible.</span> <span id="s4749">You know this is really the only source that people can come to and our how shall I say, big aim in a way is to educate the youth, the next generation and the next generation.</span> <span id="s4750">Unless we have all of this material on the website or available for students, for teachers, et cetera we are really missing a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s4751">A:
