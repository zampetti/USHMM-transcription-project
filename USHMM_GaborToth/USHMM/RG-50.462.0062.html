Interview Date\: October 26, 1981" Tape 1, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">JF: This is an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman, on October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s3">Can you tell me, Mr. Fuhrman, where and when you were born, and a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">AF: Yes, I was born in the town of Czernowitz, that's in the Bukovina, that was, at that time, in 1924, when I was born it was part of Romania.</span> <span id="s5">In later years, in '40, the Russians took it over, as usual, and claimed that it’s their territory.</span> <span id="s6">What really even now is their territory, and it's part of the Ukraine, in that part of the world.</span> <span id="s7">Like I said, I was born.</span> <span id="s8">The first years I was living in the town of Czernowitz, you know how to spell it if you need.</span> <span id="s9">Later years, my father was a tailor, and he tried to better himself, so he decided, in other words, he wants to move to Vienna, because Bukovina was years ago when my father and mother was born, was part of Austria, the Empirium [Empire] of Austria-Hungary.</span> <span id="s10">The Kaiser Franz Joseph that was the first king, he was an emperor of that part then, and they were having the Bukovina part of that Empirium.</span> <span id="s11">So they were speaking in that part of town, it was like a part of Austria.</span> <span id="s12">So he felt that we could move to Austria, and to Vienna, more specific, and he'd be able to make a living there.</span> <span id="s13">But it seems that at that time, it was impossible to get an authorization for work, or whatever name it was--a license, that's the right name, a license to work.</span> <span id="s14">So, after he spent a lot of money, put together the store with everything set up, and then he went to obtain a license, they wouldn't give it to him.</span> <span id="s15">So, he had, we had to move after two years, I think or a year and a half.</span> <span id="s16">I was then a little boy, I think I was 4 or 6, 6, 7 years old, because I even made the first grade of my education I made in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">JF: You moved to Vienna, then, when you were about 4?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">AF: No, I think I was 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">JF: About 6?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">JF: Do you have memories of Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">AF: Yes, I'll come to that.</span> <span id="s23">Yes.</span> <span id="s24">I just want to bring this point up.</span> <span id="s25">So like I said, so my first memory, the reason why I'm saying this episode before any others is in 1931, when we were living there, I had my first experience with actually the Hitlerism.</span> <span id="s26">Because, it was already starting that you could see already the swastikas there, and the first glance of Hitlerism already in Vienna, you could see that there.</span> <span id="s27">In 1931, ‘32 already, was the first, I'm not sure if Hitler was already then at his--let's not call it Hitlerism but Nazism--was already in the picture at that time.</span> <span id="s28">As a boy, I could already like--my father--I was going around--we had to avoid this thing .</span> <span id="s29">It was like the first nucleus of that particular situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">JF: You remember, you said, the swastikas?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">JF: And what other memories do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">AF: Of the burning--I'm not, it's like--it looks in my memory just very faint.</span> <span id="s34">It was so many years, since then, but I still remember that kind of people were talking about it, the Jewish in the synagogue, we were going, and I remember it was Simchas Torah, the Rabbi something-- it's very vague in my memory, but that was my first encounter with it.</span> <span id="s35">I really didn't understand what it was all about, but at this point, thinking back about the situation then, it just flashes back what really happened at that period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JF: Did you have any experiences in Vienna at that time that were antisemitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">AF: Not really.</span> <span id="s38">I was a boy of 6, 7.</span> <span id="s39">So I really didn't relate to it that way.</span> <span id="s40">But it really was just a flashback of my memory while I was talking about it.</span> <span id="s41">So, the first grade, like I said, I made there, but my father did not succeed to get his license although he had spent a lot of money, and we returned back to Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">JF: The school that you had been attending in Vienna, was this a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">AF: It was a public school, and funny enough, I remember certain flashes about it, like they would give us, in the middle of the day, I don’t know what time of the day, they would give us milk, hot milk.</span> <span id="s44">It was like a practice there.</span> <span id="s45">And, funny, the only thing I remember about this milk, that it was the first time in my life I got, how you call it, a straw.</span> <span id="s46">That was the first time in my life, and I'll always remember that.</span> <span id="s47">And I think the way I remembered it was because the straw, it was not plastic, like now, because plastic wasn't the thing.</span> <span id="s48">Thinking now, plastic then in the beginning of the '30s, there were no plastics available, because plastics came in the ‘40's.</span> <span id="s49">So, you know, what really happened, is that you really had a straw, and that was always in my memory.</span> <span id="s50">Look it was a straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">So, as I said, due to the fact, I could say it was, the reason I think was antisemitic, my father's license.</span> <span id="s52">I think he didn't get it because he was Jewish, he was a Jew, and we had at that--my father had bought even a quarter of a house.</span> <span id="s53">In other words, you could buy in partnership with other people, a house, and I'm not even sure we sold it, because this I was too little to understand.</span> <span id="s54">But I know in later years, after the war, I visited Vienna, and I still seen that house standing, and funny, it was supposed to be a condemned, it was a building, a big building.</span> <span id="s55">It was about I think, six stories high, and a big courtyard in the middle, like they have it in Vienna, and it was supported by pieces of wood, probably from the war, but the people were still living there.</span> <span id="s56">I walked in, I tried to see if somebody there remembered anything, but it seemed like nothing.</span> <span id="s57">I was a visitor in that year, the school I was going.</span> <span id="s58">And also, we were living near the North Railroad Station, what was nearby.</span> <span id="s59">And that station was already a condemned building, and still people know about the Nord Bahnhof, it means the North Railroad Station, and that I couldn't even go in because it was closed.</span> <span id="s60">But the school I still seen, the school is still a school, and probably the children are just getting their milk, probably now like I did then.</span> <span id="s61">I was walking in there, and there was nobody in the school.</span> <span id="s62">It was a period when the school was closed, but that was one of my things that I had later seen when I visited Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">JF: Did you father talk at this time of the possibility of leaving Europe, or going somewhere else, because of what was happening with the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">AF: Let me tell you here an episode, and the roots, the ties, let me put it this way, of families were so strong at that point, that you would give up everything.</span> <span id="s65">We could have.</span> <span id="s66">We had a choice from Vienna, at that point, I remember my father or my mother told me later, in later years, we had the choice, all go back to Czernowitz or go to Palestine at that time, in the ‘30's.</span> <span id="s67">Because we had that choice, it was costing just the same probably to get here or there, or whatever.</span> <span id="s68">But my mother was so longing--longing, you say?</span> <span id="s69">--to her family.</span> <span id="s70">She never had a mother and father, she don't remember them, but she has an aunt, a sister of her mother's who actually she was raised by.</span> <span id="s71">So, she was, I mean screaming, she wants to go back.</span> <span id="s72">I mean, she was crying, she wants to go not to Palestine but back to Romania, to Bukovina, to Czernowitz, it was Romania then, yes.</span> <span id="s73">But the episode I want to mention is we had a--my father had a cousin.</span> <span id="s74">And now I'm jumping from the ‘30's to the end of ‘30's, from beginning to end.</span> <span id="s75">And this uncle, we called him Uncle, but he was actually a cousin of my father's.</span> <span id="s76">Not even she, his wife, their children--So at that point, at the end of the ‘30's, when the whole thing was already going on, we had this aunt, we called her.</span> <span id="s77">They moved to Chile, South America.</span> <span id="s78">In the ‘40's, they came back to Czernowitz, because she was so lonesome, so missing her family, that she came back from Chile to Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s79">She was deported to the concentration camp together with us.</span> <span id="s80">We lived through three and a half years concentration camp.</span> <span id="s81">She came back with all of us to Czernowitz, and then he applied again, and they moved back then to Chile, in later years, to Brazil.</span> <span id="s82">And they lived in Brazil, and to show you how the destiny of a family or of a person can be, because, you see here, it was meant to be, or whatever made this fatalistic, I don't know how to really--to come, to be there, to know the fire and the thing going what’s going on here in Eastern Europe, to come back because you wanted to go to family, to see family, and go through the hell of concentration camp, and survive, all four of them survived.</span> <span id="s83">There were two children, one survived in Russia, and the daughter with them was together with us in concentration camp, all these years...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">JF: They knew what was happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AF: I imagine that they knew, at that time you heard, nobody could imagine, they couldn't figure out that such a horrible thing could really happen.</span> <span id="s86">But being that, they didn't really care.</span> <span id="s87">They wanted to see family, it was the mother, and cousins and brothers and everything--they want to be here.</span> <span id="s88">So they came back, and they had to go through all the hell, and then go back.</span> <span id="s89">And luckily, all of them survived.</span> <span id="s90">So, to come back to my original story, because this was like an interlude.</span> <span id="s91">What do you call it?</span> <span id="s92">So, we have stayed in Vienna I think a year and a half, and then we came back to Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s93">And funny enough, that all the family, my father, not all of them, but some of the family, moved with us to Vienna, like a brother of my father, and also a sister, with her husband with her children, of my mother, who also came.</span> <span id="s94">And they were, I think, in partnership, I remember, with that house.</span> <span id="s95">But later on was, I think so, but I'm not sure even, maybe they didn’t even, weren't even able to sell it.</span> <span id="s96">OK, so now we are back in Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JF: Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">AF: No, we are three.</span> <span id="s99">I am the youngest.</span> <span id="s100">I am, as they say in Yiddish, the mezinik.</span> <span id="s101">It means, the last born.</span> <span id="s102">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">JF: You had what, a brother...</span></p> <p><span id="s104">AF: Two sisters, two older sisters.</span> <span id="s105">One was difference of two years, and one of five years, the way I remember.</span> <span id="s106">I think, yeah.</span> <span id="s107">One is 22 and one--Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s108">From the first sister I am five years, and from the second I am two years.</span> <span id="s109">So, then, when I came back to Romania, I went to school normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JF: Again, was this a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s112">All was public schools.</span> <span id="s113">As was Romania, where you used to learn Romanian, you used to learn in that schools in Romania at that time, you had to learn French.</span> <span id="s114">French was the second language of the country.</span> <span id="s115">Even the capital of Romania, even up to now, Bucharest, is called a small Paris.</span> <span id="s116">Although, it has changed now.</span> <span id="s117">You don't learn so much French, most of them learn English, some learn Russian, and so on.</span> <span id="s118">But being that our town was all these changes, like, you had Germany, I mean Austria there, and you had Russia take it over, and Romania being there, you automatically had--your background was three languages, besides the Yiddish language, which you spoke at home, so, with your grandparents mostly.</span> <span id="s119">But, German, Russian, Romanian, not Russian, let's say Ukrainian, Romanian and Yiddish, you have four languages.</span> <span id="s120">You didn't have to have any struggle to do it, not like here, you're lucky with one of them.</span> <span id="s121">But there, being that it was the surroundings of the different people, sections of Ukrainians and sections of Germans who were living there, and Jews, because our town was a town of, I think it was 65% of the town was Jewish.</span> <span id="s122">I'm not sure, but it was a big population of Jewish .</span> <span id="s123">I mean, if you hear Czernowitz, I think the first Yiddish conference, I don't remember which year it was, was in Czernowitz, when they established the Yiddish language.</span> <span id="s124">With all the big writers coming together in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s125">It was even called the Czernowitzer Konferenz, [C2 Yiddish Language Conference Aug/Sept 1908] when it was established that Yiddish was a language, you know, with the grammar and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Now, going back to that period, so I went to school, OK?</span> <span id="s127">But my father didn't believe in school.</span> <span id="s128">He felt that you have to have a trade.</span> <span id="s129">OK?</span> <span id="s130">He says, learning is fine, but you have to have how to make a living out of it.</span> <span id="s131">So he, after I finished the first like five grades, and then I went to Gymnasium, he decided that I was already old enough to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s132">That was at 14.</span> <span id="s133">This was in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">JF: Before we get to that period of time, can you describe Czernowitz in those years before the war, in terms of the community that you lived in, the participation the family might have had with religious organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">AF: Now, my father wasn't a religious person, to put it this way.</span> <span id="s136">He didn't even know how to write, I mean, Latin.</span> <span id="s137">The only education he had was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s138">He was reading Yiddish, and writing Yiddish, and the newspaper, I remember, he used to read for us children all kinds of little storybooks, like he would read it and we would listen to it, and we were getting involved.</span> <span id="s139">It was like little pamphlets, like continuation stories in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s140">Why?</span> <span id="s141">Because he was a very big family.</span> <span id="s142">My father was about six brothers and two sisters, something-- A few died, but most of them survived.</span> <span id="s143">And at that period, only the oldest got to go to have education.</span> <span id="s144">I don't know if you know it.</span> <span id="s145">But like the other ones had to be on their own.</span> <span id="s146">They were sent to yeshiva, they were sent to cheder to learn Hebrew, the way you call it, but it's like davening, it's like praying Hebrew.</span> <span id="s147">They were educated in that, all of them.</span> <span id="s148">But really, what do you call it, the modern education, schooling, the way we know it, only the older one was entitled to it, especially in the family where my father grew up, his father had died very young because he was an exporter of chickens, something the way my mother was telling us, and he was exporting somewhere to out in the country chickens, and it came an epidemic, and all the chickens died.</span> <span id="s149">And then he was bankrupt, and from aggravation he died.</span> <span id="s150">So my grandmother actually raised all the children by selling, I remember, eggs on the market, like the peasants would do it, they would go buy these eggs, and then sit and sell them.</span> <span id="s151">And this way she could bring up her children.</span> <span id="s152">And she couldn't even afford to send more than one son to go to school.</span> <span id="s153">And I’m really not sure which of the sons, because there were so many that I remember only four, I think, and two sisters.</span> <span id="s154">The rest is like vague, because they might have died at a young age, and so, I know it was a very big family.</span> <span id="s155">And my grandmother got married at 14, so, I mean from my father's side.</span> <span id="s156">So this is how it came to be that he did not know.</span> <span id="s157">But in Yiddish he was very good and he was reading.</span> <span id="s158">Do you remember why I brought back this?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">JF: Yes, I was asking you about the religious atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">AF: Ah, yes, so like I said.</span> <span id="s161">Like even here, it was the same kind, like Rosh Hashone and Yom Kippur was the only time when everybody was going to synagogue, and Pesach, we used to make a Seder, and that was about it.</span> <span id="s162">I had a very religious zeyde, grandfather, who I used to go with him.</span> <span id="s163">That was on my mother's side.</span> <span id="s164">Wait, he was an uncle of my mother's, because she grew, like I told you before, without parents.</span> <span id="s165">But, he was very religious, I remember, and with a beard, white beard, and I used to go with him every Saturday when I was a child.</span> <span id="s166">Go to synagogue, go to shólesh súdes.</span> <span id="s167">[third meal on Sabbath afternoon] You know what shólesh súdes means?</span> <span id="s168">It means the Saturday before down, before sundown, you get there, you pray, and you get herring or fish, and for me it was something, you know.</span> <span id="s169">This guy gave this time herring, and this guy--you see, somebody donates it.</span> <span id="s170">And it was a kind of being a child, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">JF: Did you go to cheder as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s173">And as a matter of fact, we had a cheder in the house where we were living.</span> <span id="s174">When we came back from Vienna, we moved in on the street, and in that courtyard we had the cheder.</span> <span id="s175">And I went there to that cheder a few years until my Bar Mitzvah, how to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">JF: Was your family observant at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">AF: My mother was very observant.</span> <span id="s178">She was very religious, up to the last days.</span> <span id="s179">Even now, in our home, everything is still the way she left it.</span> <span id="s180">She was with us till she died three years ago, and she kept it very, very kosher, everything.</span> <span id="s181">So we still keep it the way she left it.</span> <span id="s182">We try to keep the memory this way at least, and keep our home as really kosher.</span> <span id="s183">My mother stayed with us, because with one of the sisters she would always say, “I could never stay with her, because she never kept her kosher things.”</span> <span id="s184">She would never even eat there.</span> <span id="s185">When we used to visit her, she would bring her own things, you know, on the platter, and eat it because it was-- The other sister, the middle sister, she is already like my mother.</span> <span id="s186">She keeps kosher and everything in the house, so there she would go and eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">JF: Did you have any experiences during those early years with any antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">AF: OK, so the cultural, before we go into your question about antisemitism and everything else, the cultural activities were like, in my house, being that I had two sisters, especially--let me put it this way, the way youngsters were, just like now, there were two big currents what were absorbing the youth at that time.</span> <span id="s189">One was the Zionist, and one was the Communist.</span> <span id="s190">So, because they were both, one was maybe also, the Zionist at that time was also--how do you say it in English?</span> <span id="s191">--not Communist, also an advanced tide, we called it an advanced tide.</span> <span id="s192">[Does he mean Socialism?]</span> <span id="s193">It was actually a, the Communists, you know what they actually were.</span> <span id="s194">But even the Zionists were work-inclined.</span> <span id="s195">In other words, like we have now in Israel the working party, at that time, that was even more.</span> <span id="s196">Like in Israel, you have like Hashomer Hatzair, what’s actually Communism, but, still with nationalism combined.</span> <span id="s197">It was very funny to really combine these two things.</span> <span id="s198">How can you be a Communist and at the same time a Nationalist?</span> <span id="s199">But then and even now, you see that this is possible because they were, they felt that they want to be Jews also, because if you are a Communist, you are a nobody, have no religion, you have no-- Now they are trying to separate, like Russians and Ukrainians, and give them culture separate, and give them hope, I don't know.</span> <span id="s200">This is what people say.</span> <span id="s201">But at that time, the Zionists were like the Hashomer Hatzair, is really a left wing of the Zionism.</span> <span id="s202">OK.</span> <span id="s203">There were also Zionists, Right Wings and Middle Wings, and Revisionists, in other words, like Betar, like Begin's party at that time, and even now.</span> <span id="s204">So there were many factions of that.</span> <span id="s205">But there were also these who would be Zionists and at the same time, Leftists.</span> <span id="s206">And would go there and be like walking free, and trying to make up, and they were really the pioneers of Israel, of Palestine to that time, because all of them were workers, worker-type of Zionists.</span> <span id="s207">There were many, and in my town, they were in a small amount.</span> <span id="s208">There were an overwhelming majority of youngsters went actually for the left part of Zionism.</span> <span id="s209">Before the war, like many others, like I said, were Right Wings, and Middle Wings, and all kinds.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JF: Were you involved in one of these groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">AF: I was involved at that point, I think it was, I don't recall the name of it.</span> <span id="s212">What was it?</span> <span id="s213">Yes, I was involved, very little because I was small at that time, and then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s214">But I was involved for a while, not really understanding what I'm doing, because in all of them first you start, and then you really know what you are really at.</span> <span id="s215">But I know it was not a Communist, it was like a kind of middle-class type.</span> <span id="s216">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s217">But the funny thing is, that all the rich boys and girls, they wanted to make Gerechtigkeit, [justice] how do you say in English, Gerechtigkeit means to better the world.</span> <span id="s218">Just like now, they want to make the world better.</span> <span id="s219">OK, try it, you’ll like it.</span> <span id="s220">So all of them, they were running away from homes, from very rich homes.</span> <span id="s221">I mean, just like here, they do the same thing.</span> <span id="s222">They run away, and then they come back.</span> <span id="s223">But, until they really know exactly what's going on, they just go away, and I pulled with a stream of these different types of organizations, how to call them, what really bring them in that direction, until they really know what it is.</span> <span id="s224">Just like we have now, the Moonies and the Shmoonies, and we have the Lefties and we have the Righties, and oh, and the Jews for Jesus.</span> <span id="s225">These are all these youngsters who are like floating.</span> <span id="s226">They are not sure what direction they really want to go.</span> <span id="s227">And if something's nice, they give them a meal, or they give them something, they are attracted and they are caught in on the wrong track.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JF: Did this kind of association cause any kind of conflict with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">AF: You mean with the Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">JF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">AF: No.</span> <span id="s232">To the contrary, it was like modern.</span> <span id="s233">Everybody should do something.</span> <span id="s234">Many of my family, from my cousins, they were all Lefties.</span> <span id="s235">I mean, I had even a cousin, I'm jumping again, who was from my father's sister's side, his name was Avrom, Abraham.</span> <span id="s236">And he was really involved in Communism at that time, like really a fighter for it.</span> <span id="s237">And he was arrested, and he was in a town called Doftana, [phonetic] maybe it was like salt mines.</span> <span id="s238">All the Communists, when they were arrested, were sent there.</span> <span id="s239">He, in 1940, when the Russians occupied my town in Czernowitz, there was a kind of exchange of officers, or whatever, you give me this, and I'll get these Communists what you are holding and now you give them back to me.</span> <span id="s240">And they brought him back, but they never let him out.</span> <span id="s241">The Russians just kept him, and we have never heard from this cousin.</span> <span id="s242">I was told he was a fighter for Communism.</span> <span id="s243">Because, the Russians have a saying, and at that time I remember, “We don't need Communists in our country.</span> <span id="s244">We need Communists somewhere else where we are not.</span> <span id="s245">So we can spread the cancer,”--I mean this is what I say now, “So we can spread the cancer all over.</span> <span id="s246">We don't need this.”</span> <span id="s247">They were probably afraid that there might be, between all the others, a change could be sneaked in, also some who was really against Russia.</span> <span id="s248">So all the good people were actually dragged down with those, and we never heard of him.</span> <span id="s249">We knew only one time, in 1940, that Avrom is in Czernowitz, in prison, in the exchange, and they still kept him here as a prisoner in the-- And then, that was the last time we ever seen.</span> <span id="s250">All the other brothers and sisters, my cousins, live in Israel.</span> <span id="s251">We were all together, most of them, in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s252">But he, we never heard from him.</span> <span id="s253">And that’s his fight for Communism...</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Tape 1, Side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JF: This is tape 1, side 2, of an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman, on October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">AF: Yes, now the culture, like I said, Czernowitz was a very Jewish town.</span> <span id="s257">Cultural activities and everything were very, very advanced.</span> <span id="s258">You could get involved in simple things like just Yiddish Theater.</span> <span id="s259">It was like all over, they could be in the same time in our town, and my father and mother used to take us to the theater.</span> <span id="s260">Not like now, where you just leave the kids home and you go alone.</span> <span id="s261">Years ago, all the children were in the theater, listening to the show, enjoying it, whatever they could enjoy and understand.</span> <span id="s262">And so Yiddish Theater was like all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">JF: What kind of productions did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">AF: Oh, I seen like very modern productions, like, I mean, it’s not modern, it's classic.</span> <span id="s265">I could see, I seen classic things, like from Peretz [I.L. Peretz (1852-1915) Yiddish and Hebrew poet and author] I seen Bontsche Schweig [also transliterated as Boutzie Schvaig].</span> <span id="s266">It was a very famous.</span> <span id="s267">Bontsche Schweig is actually a story of a young man who was going through life without doing anything, any harm to anybody.</span> <span id="s268">I mean, he was, nothing would really do him anything to get angry.</span> <span id="s269">So he was like running through life, like nothing, no harm to anybody, he died and it comes to the war, and they say, “Oh, Bontsche,” and the whole thing is actually in heavens, the whole thing is in heavens.</span> <span id="s270">And this Bontsche Schweig, means Bontsche is a name, and Schweig mean he is quiet.</span> <span id="s271">You can hit him, you can do to him whatever, and he would never answer.</span> <span id="s272">So he came to heavens, and he was supposed to be somebody great, yes, so you know how it is in heaven, you have the good guys and the bad guys.</span> <span id="s273">So the bad guys try to convince the jury that he did one time something wrong, he killed a fly or something, you know.</span> <span id="s274">But anyway, that's not important.</span> <span id="s275">But he finally, the judgment is that he is a great guy, who’s supposed to get a wish.</span> <span id="s276">What is his biggest wish, what he would want, and that's the only way you could remember this guy who had the part of Bontsche.</span> <span id="s277">He was asked then, “Now you can ask.</span> <span id="s278">What is your wish?</span> <span id="s279">What would you like?”</span> <span id="s280">And he answers, “A bulke mit pitter.”</span> <span id="s281">It means, bulke means bread, a little white bread with a little butter on it.</span> <span id="s282">That was his greatest wish.</span> <span id="s283">So that was one of the modern, not modern, classics.</span> <span id="s284">And then I seen all the great shows there, which was very little at that time, but still I seen a lot of different productions, there were productions coming from Poland was the Vilna Troupe, who came through Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s285">Buloff, the actor Buloff is a part of that big company, the Vilna Troupe from Vilna.</span> <span id="s286">And then we seen everything.</span> <span id="s287">I mean, it's really hard for me to give you a background of what I seen.</span> <span id="s288">There used to be shows in the, it's called a Shnayders Saal.</span> <span id="s289">It means the hall of the tailors.</span> <span id="s290">And my father used to be a member.</span> <span id="s291">And at Rosh Hashone and Yom Kippur, that hall was for davening, for praying for the holidays.</span> <span id="s292">In a whole year, they were renting it out to the theater.</span> <span id="s293">And they were calling this theater the Knepl Theatre.</span> <span id="s294">Why Knepl?</span> <span id="s295">Knepl means a button; they said a theater that you could go in even with a button.</span> <span id="s296">That was the synonym for this, how cheap you could go in to see a show.</span> <span id="s297">But, being that my father used to be a member of this here, I could go in the balcony for free.</span> <span id="s298">So whenever a show was there, I was somewhere in the balcony.</span> <span id="s299">In the balcony you could see backstage also.</span> <span id="s300">That was really my first encounter with theater.</span> <span id="s301">Like, I would be able to sit in balcony, watch the show, and then, open a door also on the balcony, because the balcony was going from the other side.</span> <span id="s302">When they built the stage, part of the balcony was going onto the stage.</span> <span id="s303">There was a door I used to go in, sneak in and look down what are they were working with, the scenery and the curtains and the drapes and everything.</span> <span id="s304">So that was my actual first experience.</span> <span id="s305">So there I see many, many-- In later years, I met those people, and I remember, wait a minute, all these people I remember when I was a kid and I was watching them, because they were much older than I.</span> <span id="s306">They are gone most of them that I seen, but, still, as a young man, I could still, later on, when I was part of the theater, I could talk to them and they was still-- One single, I remember, actress is still alive in Romania who I remember from that time, her name is Sevilla Pastore.</span> <span id="s307">[phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s308">JF: She's still in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">AF: Yes, she lives there.</span> <span id="s310">She is very old.</span> <span id="s311">Occasionally when we go to Romania I see her.</span> <span id="s312">I just seen her now recently.</span> <span id="s313">In August, I seen her.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">JF: Is there any theater left there?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">AF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s316">The state theater is still in Romania.</span> <span id="s317">It was what I was a part of, actually.</span> <span id="s318">OK, but we are jumping.</span> <span id="s319">We already are about, what, 40 years later.</span> <span id="s320">So that was culture, that was theater.</span> <span id="s321">And then was all kinds of lectures, like Monger [phonetic] used to come and lecture, and, I mean, recitals and all kinds.</span> <span id="s322">You have such a broad possibility because it was a big, big Jewish town I could say, because like it was such a big population of Jewish people, I think it was, in Romania, I could say, beside Jassy, I am not sure about Jassy and the other town, but Czernowitz was a cultured city.</span> <span id="s323">Everybody was like on a higher level of culture.</span> <span id="s324">I think there might have been towns where they had proportionately more Jews, but from the cultural standpoint, Czernowitz was on a higher pedestal than any other town.</span> <span id="s325">In the Jewish town, the difference is that everybody was speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s326">In Bucharest, for example, maybe they have more Jews in Bucharest, but they were more assimilated.</span> <span id="s327">They were more like a higher class of the [unclear].</span> <span id="s328">They felt ashamed maybe to talk Yiddish.</span> <span id="s329">Even some of them wouldn't recognize that they were Jews, because the antisemitism at that point was already starting to show its, its grabyes, how you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">JF: Claws?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">AF: No, how you say when you hold your fingers and you have these long nails, you know.</span> <span id="s332">I don't know the English word for it, but they start to show their ugliness.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">AF: Like I remember, first of all nationalism.</span> <span id="s335">You were not allowed to talk your language.</span> <span id="s336">All over there were signs saying you will talk only Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">JF: About when did these signs first appear?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">AF: I think in the upper 30's, in '37, '38, '39, around that time.</span> <span id="s339">Because I, there was already at that point, Kuza.</span> <span id="s340">There was, I remember, the leader, who was very nationalistic, and that's it.</span> <span id="s341">When you are nationalistic, you are automatically against anything else.</span> <span id="s342">That's what national socialism was actually, you know, because socialism and national socialism is that big difference, big gap between these two.</span> <span id="s343">But when we had, in my father's store, he was a tailor, he had a store, and a few guys working there and women.</span> <span id="s344">My sister was part of it, and we had to--my father never knew Romanian.</span> <span id="s345">My father and mother, they were speaking only Yiddish and German.</span> <span id="s346">They were the only two languages that they knew.</span> <span id="s347">But the sign had to be in his store saying “[unclear] Romanischke”.</span> <span id="s348">This is in Romanian--“You will speak only Romanian.”</span></p> <p><span id="s349">JF: What happened then with your parents?</span> <span id="s350">In terms of not being able to speak Romanian?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">AF: They weren't the only ones who didn't know it.</span> <span id="s352">There were thousands and thousands, but this was a kind of way of trying to force you on something that you never could accomplish anyway.</span> <span id="s353">They never could really pinpoint, or really harm people with that thing, but it was there and it started all kinds, like in the villages, the antisemitism was very big.</span> <span id="s354">The luck of what we had in Romania more than in other, like in Germany, Romania, at that time, was maybe, even now, I don't know, they were big on taking bribes.</span> <span id="s355">You could pay one, they were calling them gypsies, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s356">So they were really, you could really buy with a bribe, or they would harm you, they would close up places or do things.</span> <span id="s357">You could always go and pay somebody and they would let you continue.</span> <span id="s358">And in Romania, in Germany, you couldn't do that, you know.</span> <span id="s359">They did what they did.</span> <span id="s360">There was no way out, you know.</span> <span id="s361">Here, we had this kind of, the peasant and in general at that time, they were very simple people, and they were doing actually what they were pushed to do, by the government at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">JF: You don't feel that the people themselves had antisemitic feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">AF: No.</span> <span id="s364">They had, because of the Church, you know, what they were taught, certain things that Jews had to do this and do that, and they killed Jesus, and they did that.</span> <span id="s365">They weren't so advanced in their religion to really understand, their priest, or the popa, to Romanians the popa, not pope, popa means the priest, if he would tell them whatever, they believed in it.</span> <span id="s366">He said so, that before Passover they have to kill a child, and all this nonsense what was going around, and it was imprinted in their soul and mind.</span> <span id="s367">So, we automatically were in this mess.</span> <span id="s368">They had an expression.</span> <span id="s369">They would say, a Jew in Romanian is called Evreul [plural is evreilor] in a normal term, a nice way.</span> <span id="s370">But if you want to be antisemitic, he was called a Jew, Jidan.</span> <span id="s371">What is actually in Polish is Zyd.</span> <span id="s372">Jidan was a similar.</span> <span id="s373">But in Polish, Zyd is a Jew, and here it was like a slang word for a bad word to call a Jew.</span> <span id="s374">It was called Jidan to Palestina.</span> <span id="s375">It means they were screaming “Why are you living here?</span> <span id="s376">You better go to Palestine.”</span> <span id="s377">They were trying to do these kind of remarks and trying to get rid of you even verbally if they couldn't do it physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">JF: Did you run into any kind of experiences in your schooling with the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">AF: No, no.</span> <span id="s380">I was very little then, and children, to tell you, they're children.</span> <span id="s381">And basically, I think in my class where I went to school, I don't even recall very few non-Jewish children in the school.</span> <span id="s382">I was going in a school what was basically, most of the parents were sending their children there, I mean Jewish parents.</span> <span id="s383">They were like, it was licéu.</span> <span id="s384">In Romanian, a gymnasium is called, lyceum, licéu.</span> <span id="s385">So they had, I remember they were like Licéu No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.</span> <span id="s386">In No. 1, I think was only non-Jews, very few Jews.</span> <span id="s387">It was just like here--you have certain schools where if you have two black children, it is a big thing.</span> <span id="s388">That was the same thing there.</span> <span id="s389">You had like only Christian and very few Jews.</span> <span id="s390">And the L No. 2, Licéu No. 2, you had already a bigger mixture.</span> <span id="s391">And Licéu No. 3, where I was going, there was probably 99% Jews, and maybe 1% non-Jews.</span> <span id="s392">So I didn't have that encounter with them.</span> <span id="s393">I know when we used to play soccer with the other licéu, they were always teasing us, and things like that, you know, screaming out.</span> <span id="s394">Somebody would hit and shoot a goal, and they would after him, and beat him up, and things like that.</span> <span id="s395">It was like indirectly antisemitism in that period with school children.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">JF: Was your father's clientele in his shop primarily Jewish, or did he have a mixed population there?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">AF: I think he had a mixture, very small.</span> <span id="s398">Mainly were Jewish.</span> <span id="s399">But he had also, I remember when I was a boy, maybe I was 12, there was a time when you used to take home, like here, the groceries.</span> <span id="s400">Like when you used to finish a job, you would send somebody, one of the apprentices, and would send them to take it to a rich lady or something, because he was a women's tailor.</span> <span id="s401">You would go there and take it to her, and she would give you a tip, you know.</span> <span id="s402">So, sometimes when the other apprentice was very busy, my father used to send me to take one of this, and I used to get a tip.</span> <span id="s403">It was a big thing for me.</span> <span id="s404">It was like a [unclear] But, basically, I remember even here, I met one lady here in Philadelphia, and she says, “You know, I know your father.”</span> <span id="s405">I said, “How do you know him?”</span> <span id="s406">She said, "Oh, he made for me a costume [i.e. suit] years ago, and I am very angry at him.”</span> <span id="s407">I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s408">Didn't he do it right?”</span> <span id="s409">She says, “Yes, he did it so good that I am already 25 years after that, and I cannot tear it up.</span> <span id="s410">It's so good.”</span> <span id="s411">Because, you know, there, you were putting in everything at that time.</span> <span id="s412">Really, when you were making a piece of work there, the tailoring for this was high quality.</span> <span id="s413">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">JF: You started telling me about when you went into your trade training, when you were 14 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">AF: Yeah, ok.</span> <span id="s416">So, my father, like I said before, wanted me to have a trade, OK?</span> <span id="s417">And that was true, you know, because at that time, if you didn't have a trade, even now, if you don't have a trade, you have, you are nothing.</span> <span id="s418">But then, was even more so.</span> <span id="s419">So he wanted me to become a dental mechanic.</span> <span id="s420">So, to be an apprentice a dental mechanic, you didn't go in and they pay you--it was just the opposite.</span> <span id="s421">My father had to pay, every three months, he had to pay 3,000 lei.</span> <span id="s422">3,000 lei was a nice amount of money at that time.</span> <span id="s423">In ‘38, 3,000 lei was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s424">Even now, I know, 3,000 lei now in Romania, I don’t even think a worker makes now 3,000 lei a month.</span> <span id="s425">So it was a lot of money back in '38.</span> <span id="s426">But he had arranged with this dentist who was having a laboratory and he was also fixing teeth, and he has an office also.</span> <span id="s427">There were two of them--one was a mechanic dentist, and one was a doctor of dentistry.</span> <span id="s428">If you want a straight definition, a separation between those two--a dentist was one who had been first a master of making teeth, a master mechanic of teeth, and then he started in continuation to become a dentist, because a doctor in dentistry who had to go to regular college first, and a regular medical school, not like here, they have dentistry school.</span> <span id="s429">No there was different.</span> <span id="s430">If you wanted to become then a doctor in dentistry, how you call it, you had to go first to be a regular doctor, just like any other, go to all the four years of regular university or medical school.</span> <span id="s431">And then, you could choose what direction you want to take.</span> <span id="s432">If you want to be an internist, you want to be a surgeon, you want to be a dentist, you want to be whatever.</span> <span id="s433">After you had those years of practice, you could go in then and become a dentist, how we call it here, but he would be a higher qualification of dentistry.</span> <span id="s434">He would be a doctor who was able to make operations.</span> <span id="s435">Also, a dentist was allowed to pull teeth, and make plates, and make bridges and everything.</span> <span id="s436">So, usually what used to happen, you got associated, a doctor who knew nothing, and a dentist who knew everything.</span> <span id="s437">Because a doctor just out of school, without experience, out of college, you know, out of medical school, and then getting a course of a kind, you know, practice a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">I remember, when I went there, they engaged me, and my father used to pay this money every three months or six months, every six months, 3,000 lei.</span> <span id="s439">So, when this dentist, the one who, they were partners, OK, the dentist with this doctor who came out from medical school, a dentist after going through the whole thing, he didn't know nothing about dentistry, because he had four years.</span> <span id="s440">He had regular medicine, and then he became a dentist, a doctor in dentistry.</span> <span id="s441">For one year he had to make some course and he became a dentist.</span> <span id="s442">He had no practice whatsoever.</span> <span id="s443">And this other one, his name was Faust, just like the opera Faust, he is Samuel Faust, he was Jewish, and the other was also.</span> <span id="s444">It was a German name, like Henrich Brandmarker [phonetic], it’s kind of real fancy name.</span> <span id="s445">They got in partnership, and Faust was working, and Brandmarker was sitting and collecting the money.</span> <span id="s446">That's all what he was, sitting at the desk-- I remember like today he had an asthma.</span> <span id="s447">And at that time you didn't have these sprays, so whenever you used to come in that hall in the office, he had like a little room where when he start coughing, he went in and lit a kind of weed or something, and he used to breathe in that weed, and he was getting better and go back into there.</span> <span id="s448">So that whole place was smelling like about weed.</span> <span id="s449">So you know Dr. Brandmarker, and I was a boy of 14 then, 14, 15, so when it used to happen that Faust, once a year he had a cold.</span> <span id="s450">For the three years I worked for them, every year he had a cold.</span> <span id="s451">So, what do you do, you have so many patients.</span> <span id="s452">So he didn't know nothing.</span> <span id="s453">And I was assisting, like you were learning the trade, but you were assisting.</span> <span id="s454">Also Saturday, when you had the biggest bulk of patients, you had to assist him.</span> <span id="s455">Then we had this, you didn't have mortars--you turned with a paddle, you know, the machine, and so I was paddling for this, and making like fillings and things like this, for him.</span> <span id="s456">So I knew what was going on there for this year and a half I was there.</span> <span id="s457">So one day, Faust is sick, and this Brandmarker is supposed to see patients.</span> <span id="s458">First of all, if they heard that Faust isn’t there, they wouldn't show up, because they knew he doesn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s459">But some of the newer ones what didn't know, they came in, and I, being a boy of 14, knew more already about what to do then.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">He didn't even know how to clean out a tooth to put in a filling.</span> <span id="s461">And I used to know it already how to do it.</span> <span id="s462">And I used to tell him, and it was funny.</span> <span id="s463">He didn't mind because he knew.</span> <span id="s464">The only thing what he knew is theory.</span> <span id="s465">So the good thing about it was that like once in a while we would sit down, we were three boys, apprenticed at that place.</span> <span id="s466">They were like the first year apprentice, the second year apprentice, and the one who is finishing.</span> <span id="s467">You had to go three years through it.</span> <span id="s468">So, he would sit down with all of us and teach us theory.</span> <span id="s469">With a book, and I still remember to now, I bought a book, you had to bring it from Vienna.</span> <span id="s470">It was in German, because he went to German schools, you know.</span> <span id="s471">And this is how I remember this guy.</span> <span id="s472">In later years I met him, after the war I met him already.</span> <span id="s473">I think they are now living in Israel, if I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">JF: So both of these men were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">AF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s476">Yeah.</span> <span id="s477">They were Jewish, both of them.</span> <span id="s478">One was a doctor in medicine, and the other one was a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">JF: Now, in 1938, when you started on this course, what kind of news were you getting from Germany.</span> <span id="s480">What was your understanding of what was happening in the rest of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">AF: Nobody really understood too much, to tell you.</span> <span id="s482">I mean, being that I was only 14, for me it was really hard to understand what’s going on to begin with.</span> <span id="s483">Later, when I became 16, I understood a little more, but just before I go into that, I just want to put an interlude into it about the dentistry.</span> <span id="s484">While I was going during the day to work as a dental apprentice, nighttime I was going to night school.</span> <span id="s485">And this was a law.</span> <span id="s486">You had to further your education.</span> <span id="s487">In other words, during the day you were working, and at nighttime, you had to go every night, you were going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">JF: For what subjects were you going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">AF: Just like a regular school.</span> <span id="s490">But, what I did then, I registered in a school, a night school where you were learning also Yiddish.</span> <span id="s491">It was called the ORT school [organization for training of Jews in skilled trades and agriculture].</span> <span id="s492">It was probably related to the ORT now, somehow.</span> <span id="s493">Where during the day, that ORT school, you could learn a trade.</span> <span id="s494">Going to school and learning a trade, like seamstress and all kind of other trades.</span> <span id="s495">But the same school had also a night course, where we were learning regular public school subjects.</span> <span id="s496">OK, being that I was already advanced because I had already was in Gymnasium, it was very easy.</span> <span id="s497">I remember at that time I was the best student in the class, because I knew everything that was going on there.</span> <span id="s498">The only two languages what I really learned at that time, thoroughly I would say, is Yiddish.</span> <span id="s499">I knew to speak Yiddish, but I had no background in writing or reading or literature or anything else.</span> <span id="s500">And then, in that school, I learned Yiddish really.</span> <span id="s501">I met in New York, who is still a teacher who I met, and his name is Giddinger [phonetic], there is another one whose name is Schwartz, who calls himself now Kotter [phonetic].</span> <span id="s502">Kotter means in Russian, black.</span> <span id="s503">Schwartz is also black.</span> <span id="s504">So he is now dead, because there were three brothers, and they had to give themselves different names.</span> <span id="s505">One was Schwartz, and one was Kotter, and another one was another Schwartz.</span> <span id="s506">He was in Argentina, or something, somewhere there.</span> <span id="s507">But, I met this Giddinger, I met here recently in New York, he lives somewhere.</span> <span id="s508">And then another one was in Romania who died recently.</span> <span id="s509">As a matter of fact, we got a whole bunch of books today, yesterday I think, last Monday, no, on Friday, a bunch of books from Romania from this guy I'm telling you, who was my teacher, who we met later on.</span> <span id="s510">He is now a writer there in Romania.</span> <span id="s511">He writes Yiddish books.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">JF: Was it the State of Romania that required you to go to school at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">JF: Was it that you had to go to school until a certain age?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">AF: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s516">You could not, the law was you could not finish an apprenticeship until you didn't have at least four grades.</span> <span id="s517">OK?</span> <span id="s518">But those who have more even than that had to still go to that school, because there were there who came in and didn't know how to write and read.</span> <span id="s519">It didn't happen to Jewish people usually, because Jewish people always advanced in learning and in writing and in everything.</span> <span id="s520">But there were many of them who would go to this night school and wouldn't even know how to read, so it was like, they wouldn't take you even you didn't have four classes, they wouldn't take you to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s521">There was a must to have the four grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">JF: You had to go through it whether or not you had had previous education?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s524">But you should have at least four grades at that point.</span> <span id="s525">So, there where I learned thoroughly Yiddish in Yiddish classics, Yiddish literature and everything, and also learned German, because we had a German class and you attended, and I learned German also.</span> <span id="s526">I knew pretty good, but there was like an addition to what I knew up to that point.</span> <span id="s527">And funny enough, when I met this guy, at that point I was a boy of 14.</span> <span id="s528">1 remember those two--the German teacher and the Yiddish teacher, Giddinger, were somehow looking one to another with loving eyes.</span> <span id="s529">They were like this.</span> <span id="s530">And I forgot, Fruchter [phonetic], her name was Fruchter, I remember, or something.</span> <span id="s531">And when I met the guy, it was last year, I said, “Are you, have you heard about the German teacher what he had, Fruchter?”</span> <span id="s532">He says, “She is my wife!”</span> <span id="s533">It was so, and I was always remembering it, you know, like you see these things without even knowing what you see.</span> <span id="s534">But it was funny to ask and he said, "Yes, she's my wife.”</span> <span id="s535">In later years they got married.</span> <span id="s536">So that was what I wanted to bring in.</span> <span id="s537">You asked before something and I said--what was it really you were asking?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">JF: We were talking about the antisemitic experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">AF: So, again here, the ORT school was a particular Yiddish school; in other words, only Jews went to ORT school.</span> <span id="s540">No Christians.</span> <span id="s541">Jewish teachers and everything was Yiddish and Jewish, so, the Yiddish language and the Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s542">But, so, we couldn't--[unclear] straight in the night school.</span> <span id="s543">And being just like here the Cubans, in Florida, Miami.</span> <span id="s544">If you didn't know that you were in the United States, you could think that you are in some Latin country.</span> <span id="s545">Because wherever you go in Miami, you hear only Spanish, with the Cubans.</span> <span id="s546">Well, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s547">We were surrounded.</span> <span id="s548">And I 'm asking, you see I have patients--You probably don't know why I'm talking about patients...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Tape 2, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s550">AF: I can talk to you for three days and not finish my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">JF: This is tape 2, side 1, of an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman.</span> <span id="s552">October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">AF: I was mentioning a patient before, I don't know if it is on the other tape; probably it will be a repeat of what I said before.</span> <span id="s554">Just this first.</span> <span id="s555">Why I don't know all of a sudden about patients, we are talking about when I was a child.</span> <span id="s556">But we'll come to that later, if we still have time and you still have enough tapes.</span> <span id="s557">[laughter] But, I have a bunch of them.</span> <span id="s558">I just bought some.</span> <span id="s559">The reason why I am saying a patient, it was a Cuban patient, and she spoke so bad English, I mean impossible.</span> <span id="s560">I am like king.</span> <span id="s561">She knows a little bit, and I asked her, “How come Cuban people don't want to learn English?</span> <span id="s562">Maybe their children, but like our age, or even younger than I am, they don't want to speak it.”</span> <span id="s563">She says, “We have no need.</span> <span id="s564">We have our own community, go to our own affairs, we go to our own places, our own stores, and you know, it's one of these things.</span> <span id="s565">We don't need it.”</span> <span id="s566">So it’s just like my parents.</span> <span id="s567">They never needed the Romanian.</span> <span id="s568">German was good enough there, and Yiddish, especially, because many spoke it.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">JF: Let me ask you something, Mr. Fuhrman.</span> <span id="s570">Did any man in your family enter the national army during your growing up years, before the Second World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s572">They had.</span> <span id="s573">Not--close family, you mean?</span> <span id="s574">I was the only son, so I was too little to go to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">JF: Your father, or any of...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">AF: My father was not, I think, in the army.</span> <span id="s577">But there were some cousins who went to the army.</span> <span id="s578">They had to go to certain--Jews were afraid to ever go to the army, because there was antisemitic outbursts in the army and everything.</span> <span id="s579">So, usually , what would be, would pay their way to go to the army in an easier place, how to say, where they could eventually not have to go to the whole spiel of what’s going on, because it wasn’t-- In other words, I am saying something here, maybe I am not 100% sure, or because I was so small then, I was so little, to really know exactly how the whole thing with the army would be at that point.</span> <span id="s580">But I know it was very hard for Jews to be in the army.</span> <span id="s581">Very few were really, at that end of the thirties, really in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">JF: Can you tell me what your experience was when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s584">OK.</span> <span id="s585">When the war started, actually started, the way I remember, in 1939, when Hitler, I mean, they started, it wasn't really a war at first, because he just marched in, in all the places without any resistance.</span> <span id="s586">The first resistance, light resistance really, I don't know how much resistance there was at that point, was in Poland.</span> <span id="s587">At that time, all the, a lot of Polish people were running from there and they were--Czernowitz was very close to, in distance, very close to Poland.</span> <span id="s588">OK, so about-- What was the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">JF: You were talking about the Polish people who came to Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">AF: So, the closest place they could run was only Romania.</span> <span id="s591">Why, because west of them were the Germans.</span> <span id="s592">It was the border with Germany.</span> <span id="s593">East of them was Russia, where they wouldn't even dare go there, not that they wouldn't want to go, but Russia wouldn't let them in.</span> <span id="s594">So the only way they could go would be south, where was Romania, where was actually Czernowitz, Bukovina, Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">JF: What kind of experience did you have with the Poles who were coming into the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">AF: I really didn't have too much experience.</span> <span id="s597">I know there were a lot of Jews who were inquiring about the family of ours.</span> <span id="s598">We had family in Lvov, Lemberg, and there was, my father's brother.</span> <span id="s599">And we were really not sure what happened.</span> <span id="s600">Till nowadays, we never heard--they like faded out of this world.</span> <span id="s601">Without us.</span> <span id="s602">We just heard rumor they were here, they were there, and this, but we have never found them, and they probably must be between all the 6 millions who had perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">JF: Where did these Poles live who came to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">AF: They were all over.</span> <span id="s605">I mean, you could find places, and then they wouldn't stop-- the Polish Jews, for them it was like running, going further on.</span> <span id="s606">And for me, it was not that kind of a big experience really.</span> <span id="s607">I knew only that the war started, and they started marching.</span> <span id="s608">There was a little fight there with the Poles, and then they just came down to Romania, and probably went further down and just spread around.</span> <span id="s609">There were not so many, but many enough to really have aroused a little bit of the curiosity of the people there.</span> <span id="s610">And I really don't know how the rest was really, where they were placed, or where they went.</span> <span id="s611">It's not like here, you know.</span> <span id="s612">They make shelters and they put them in, and this and that.</span> <span id="s613">It was like a private thing.</span> <span id="s614">They ran away from something that [unclear].</span> <span id="s615">My imagination couldn't be brought up too much about it, because being that I was only 16--what was I, 16, 15.</span> <span id="s616">It was '39.</span> <span id="s617">I was 15, so I had my own thing then.</span> <span id="s618">I was a good gymnast at my gym.</span> <span id="s619">I used to run and play soccer, and you know, a boy of 15, besides going to night school and besides learning the trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">JF: Was there fear on the part of your family that the Nazis would also come into Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">AF: I would like to tell you something here about-- At that point, nobody was really sure what was going on 100%.</span> <span id="s622">It was not known his intentions.</span> <span id="s623">We knew about antisemitism.</span> <span id="s624">But Jews were used to this kind of thing all their lives.</span> <span id="s625">They were brought up with it, from generation to generation, from the Crusades, from way back--it's a thing--the Spanish Inquisition and this.</span> <span id="s626">It was something what the Jews lived all through their lives in that manner.</span> <span id="s627">So for us, it was just one another thing like then.</span> <span id="s628">It was like everybody was thinking the same way probably, like, if it's somewhere, it's not here.</span> <span id="s629">And until it doesn’t come to your door, it knocks on the door, you really don't realize that it really could happen to you.</span> <span id="s630">So it was really something what didn't really touch somehow, so you could really make out something out of it that it could really happen at that point, in '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">JF: What happened after that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">AF: After that, in 1940, the Russians occupied, occupied our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">JF: And what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">AF: It was like completely, I mean, insulation of the rest of the world, actually.</span> <span id="s635">When in ‘40, 1940, like nothing happens in the world.</span> <span id="s636">Nobody was talking about anything; everything was the normal way.</span> <span id="s637">The difference was only that we started to go to Ukrainian school at that point, and they started a mass emigration of Germans from Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s638">That was an experience for me, because they were selling everything out.</span> <span id="s639">There was a suburb of Czernowitz, it was Schwapps [phonetic].</span> <span id="s640">It was a special section of Germans were living, and they were selling everything.</span> <span id="s641">You know, when you emigrate you cannot get it with you.</span> <span id="s642">So my experience was that I seen them, and I couldn't figure out why are these people going, why are they going away, and it was this kind of exchange, probably what the Russians had with Germany, that they would give us our people or something, and they were just running away from there.</span> <span id="s643">They probably knew that something will probably later happen.</span> <span id="s644">I didn't really know.</span> <span id="s645">But a lot of them, hundreds and hundreds, I could say thousands of families left, the Germans, who fled to Germany.</span> <span id="s646">More like an exchange of a kind.</span> <span id="s647">The only thing what really happened in 1940 what really was an earthquake, which, it was for me, like in the middle of the night, we bought, the experience that we had, we bought there on the market, that they were selling, we bought a clock, one of these clocks what was sounding like the English tower--blink, blonk, blink, blonk (makes sound of chimes)--something like this.</span> <span id="s648">And we had it on the closet.</span> <span id="s649">There we didn't have closets like here.</span> <span id="s650">But we had really a wooden closet, you know.</span> <span id="s651">So we put that up, and then we had parrots, we bought parrots, green parrots.</span> <span id="s652">Little ones, like this size, and in the middle of the night, at four in the morning, I hear this clock.</span> <span id="s653">It was not an hour at it was supposed to do this song, but blink, blonk, blonk, (again makes sound of chimes) something, and before that, the parrots woke me up, they were making so much noise.</span> <span id="s654">And really, at that point, it was the earthquake.</span> <span id="s655">I didn't even realize it was an earthquake in Romania, in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s656">And there, one of the big hotels fell and killed everybody in that hotel.</span> <span id="s657">The only place what was before that was a preview to what happened now, because all the shattered houses, at that point in 1940, fell apart in this recent earthquake in Romania.</span> <span id="s658">This is the reason why this time was so many, because they patched the top a little bit there, you know, the crack was still there and everything.</span> <span id="s659">And now when this thing hit again, all those houses what had cracks and everything from before fell apart.</span> <span id="s660">The new houses didn't, because they were already built different.</span> <span id="s661">A very bad experience for everybody there.</span> <span id="s662">But all those houses in the center of the city, they all, the old city, basically from years ago, were with cracks and everything, all those houses fell in this earthquake, what was such a bad experience for the Romanian people at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">JF: Was your home affected in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">AF: No.</span> <span id="s665">It was just, we were so far way, the nucleus of the earthquake was about maybe, what, 5, 600 kilometers or more.</span> <span id="s666">We just could feel the impact of it.</span> <span id="s667">Everybody ran out, and this and that.</span> <span id="s668">But for us, it was just an experience as a boy what really happened.</span> <span id="s669">So, when the Russians-- Yeah, and I also bought then two pairs of skis.</span> <span id="s670">My dream was to go skiing.</span> <span id="s671">When the Russians came, everything seemed all of a sudden rosy.</span> <span id="s672">You know how it is.</span> <span id="s673">You thought that the antisemitism will go away, and this and that, you know?</span> <span id="s674">All these dreams of these guys who were Lefties and this, they thought when they came in, the parades with red flags they came and you know?</span> <span id="s675">OK, later on they experienced, and I experienced a funny thing, it's a joke, but it seemed to me so funny at that point.</span> <span id="s676">It was summertime, and I was, how you call it, to take sunbath.</span> <span id="s677">And here are these officers walking, you know.</span> <span id="s678">And we knew Ukrainian, Russian, so I asked a question and it’s not a joke.</span> <span id="s679">It became then eventually a joke, and maybe was already a joke then.</span> <span id="s680">We asked him, “Do you have in Russia this?”</span> <span id="s681">He says, “Yes, in Russia, we have a factory.”</span> <span id="s682">“Do you have in Russia this?”</span> <span id="s683">Everything they were asked, they said, “Yes, we have a factory.”</span> <span id="s684">And then they asked him, “Do you have lemons?”</span> <span id="s685">He says, “Yes, we have a factory.”</span> <span id="s686">You know?</span> <span id="s687">So it was one of these jokes what was going around there that they have everything in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">JF: You had mentioned before that the schooling changed?</span> <span id="s689">You were still in the 0RT program when the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">AF: No.</span> <span id="s691">When the Russians came, I started to go again to school, to public school for that year.</span> <span id="s692">I was still working as a dental mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">JF: But you went to public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">JF: The Jewish schools were closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">AF: No.</span> <span id="s697">The Jewish school was, I don't even know, no, I think the Jewish schools were definitely--you see, it was, these schools were very progressive schools, in other words progressive in a sense they were Left-inclined.</span> <span id="s698">So, at first, there was such a short time, you really didn't know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s699">The ORT school was probably still on.</span> <span id="s700">There was another that was called Morgenrot.</span> <span id="s701">It means "tomorrow will be red", you know?</span> <span id="s702">Tomorrow red.</span> <span id="s703">That was really a Left Wing-- I don't recall really what happened.</span> <span id="s704">I know only that the building what was belonging to the community, let's say how to the Federation how it’s here, it was, that building was taken over, and it was made to the Palace of the Pioneers.</span> <span id="s705">It became in other words, the Federation House.</span> <span id="s706">It was a big building where all the Jewish activities were going on for the town and everything.</span> <span id="s707">That was taken away, I remember, and it was made into a palace.</span> <span id="s708">They used to call it the Palace of the Pioneers.</span> <span id="s709">You know, the children were the Pioneers, [Russian Communist Youth Organization] like here, you have Pioneers?</span> <span id="s710">What do you have here?</span> <span id="s711">Also pioneers?</span> <span id="s712">Yeah, they have a similar youth program there.</span> <span id="s713">And they took away that building and made it into this youth thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">JF: Was the Jewish community organization still permitted to function under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">AF: Oh, I don't think so, no.</span> <span id="s716">Why?</span> <span id="s717">They wouldn't, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">JF: Were the synagogues affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">AF: The synagogue, it was too short a time, you know?</span> <span id="s720">We still went, like I remember, to synagogue.</span> <span id="s721">It was such a short time.</span> <span id="s722">They came in the war, in less than a year, I think like they came, I think, June the 28 of 1940, and the war broke out June 22 of ‘41, with the Russians and Germans.</span> <span id="s723">I might have mixed up the dates, but it was like, oh, this was the war.</span> <span id="s724">This, I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">JF: Was there any anti-Nazi propaganda that was given out during that year, when you were under Russian control?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">AF: No, nothing that I recall.</span> <span id="s727">There, you all of a sudden were cut off from everything that was going on in the world, you know.</span> <span id="s728">Unless you had a short-wave radio and could hear a little bit news from London and this, we were really cut off.</span> <span id="s729">And to tell you, being that I was going to school and to public school and everything, as a youngster, you were just grabbed into these activities and sports and all kind of a new culture--learn the language and this and that.</span> <span id="s730">We knew, I know my father used to always listen to the Voice of BBC, I remember, and like, hidden, you know, listen to it.</span> <span id="s731">Nobody can hear it, but they had to listen to it because everybody was afraid, and now you were not allowed.</span> <span id="s732">It’s a kind of break in what you had before to what you had now.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">JF: Was there anything particular about the treatment of the Russians towards the people of Czernowitz that you might want to remark on?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">AF: No, no I don't think so.</span> <span id="s735">You see, they came in as an occupier, and they didn't want to make probably, show their bad sides already, you know.</span> <span id="s736">It was like, it wasn't yet the whole thing with the killing the doctors, and the writers and this.</span> <span id="s737">It was still at that period when everything was still, how to say, "rosy".</span></p> <p><span id="s738">JF: What happened then in June of 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">AF: OK.</span> <span id="s740">In 1941, when started the war-- Just one thing what I would interlude here about the situation--all of a sudden, everything became so different, you know, at that point.</span> <span id="s741">I am just trying to reminisce a few, I think this was after the war or before the war.</span> <span id="s742">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s743">OK, forget it.</span> <span id="s744">I thought that this--I had a flashback of a kind, but the thing chronologically didn't happen then.</span> <span id="s745">OK, Yiddish theater came from Russia.</span> <span id="s746">At that point, it was blooming.</span> <span id="s747">They had shows that brought the big stars, all those stars what were, I remember from way back, got organized and formed a theater in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s748">It came from Kiev, came a Yiddish theater there, I remember.</span> <span id="s749">It was a change, and everybody, how to say, at that point was pretty happy.</span> <span id="s750">In the sense that they finally thought they were free, how to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">JF: Did you notice any ideological difference between the Yiddish theater from Russia and the Yiddish theater that you had experienced in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s753">Here, we have to give credit where credit is due.</span> <span id="s754">Due to the fact that all of a sudden all of the theater, the plays were of a higher quality, classic-type plays.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">JF: The plays that were brought in by the Russian troupes?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s757">In other words, their program, they were playing of the different plays, it was based on a higher culture, how to say, like it appeared in '38, and it was first of all a state theater.</span> <span id="s758">In other words, it was already supported by the state, and everything was done the way it was directed by what you were allowed by censorship, what you could play and what you couldn't.</span> <span id="s759">But classics were--you couldn't play a play what was written in the United States.</span> <span id="s760">And you had to go by whatever the line of the party, the Communist party, will lead you into what direction to go, and at that point, they had like classics, like Sholem Aleichem and Peretz and all the other classics, and what were actually all those classics, you believe it or not, were all, most of them, like socialistic-directed, without having even to do with, like, to better the life of the poor.</span> <span id="s761">Basically, if you look back to the classics, there was always something what had to do with the social being of that individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">JF: So these plays did not have to be changed then.</span> <span id="s763">The basic story was already...</span></p> <p><span id="s764">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s765">But they still, there was something that was a little better to one direction; what they didn't like, they just changed it.</span> <span id="s766">It happened to me later in years that I realized--at that point, I was too young to understand it but later on, when I was already a member of the State Theatre in Romania, in the ‘50s--I realized really what had happened there.</span> <span id="s767">At that point, for me it really was not that, it didn't strike my mind too much about the whole situation.</span> <span id="s768">So this is more or less what happened.</span> <span id="s769">OK, you can understand everything changed all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s770">You are told that you are free, and you are taught how you will be out of worries, and this and that, you know, and sport was on a high, and this is again a part of what the Russians are very good at.</span> <span id="s771">Of course, all of a sudden, you have to do all kinds of sport activities, and cultural activities--their basis of propaganda, the plays what they did.</span> <span id="s772">The theater, for example, is supported by the State, so they didn't care how much money you really made by coming to this.</span> <span id="s773">So they could afford to give small prices to people.</span> <span id="s774">Because this is actually a way of educating their people into the direction they want.</span> <span id="s775">I'm not talking about the Yiddish theater alone.</span> <span id="s776">The Ukrainian theater, the Russian theater, and other things what I used to go also.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">JF: In other words, as high as the cultural level was in Czernowitz before, you feel that the Russian influence made it even more so?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">AF: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s779">We are not just talking about culture.</span> <span id="s780">You see, here we have all of a sudden the culture what is aimed to propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">JF: It changed, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">AF: Yes, it changed.</span> <span id="s783">In other words, it was different than it was before, but not on a much higher level, how to say.</span> <span id="s784">They like, brought in, like in Yiddish, they brought that in all the Hebrew words from the Yiddish are eliminated, and they are written phonetically in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s785">It was like, you have these hundreds of Hebrew words what became a part of the Yiddish language, all of a sudden were thrown out.</span> <span id="s786">Like you would say "simcha".</span> <span id="s787">It's a word what was always simply spelled simcha in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s788">When they came, "simcha", they started to spell, and the books what came with it was the same thing, they modernized it, and all the Hebrew words were spelled phonetically in Yiddish the way you hear it.</span> <span id="s789">"Simcha", they would spell samech-yud-mem-chet and an “a”, or whatever, I'm just giving you.</span> <span id="s790">So it was not the word anymore in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s791">It was the same Hebrew word, but it was spelled different, because this is a way what they tried to eliminate.</span> <span id="s792">So all the Russian books, the Yiddish books at that time, they were spelling it, not anymore the way we were used to see that word.</span> <span id="s793">This is more or less a thing, I think we covered enough of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">JF: OK.</span> <span id="s795">So what happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s796">AF: So now the war started.</span> <span id="s797">War started, the first thing you could see is soldiers retracting, in other words, running away from the fronts.</span> <span id="s798">At that point, you had a choice.</span> <span id="s799">You had a choice or to get on a train and go back into Russia far away, or you could stay behind.</span> <span id="s800">The war--so, everybody started, you had this choice what I just mentioned.</span> <span id="s801">Now, you had very few days for that purpose, because the Germans were going so fast, that if you didn't make it fast enough, you were caught on the way anyway.</span> <span id="s802">So I remember that my father and my family decided to leave, to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s803">And we were informed that we should go to the train station, and pick up a certain train, and we will be gone.</span> <span id="s804">That was about, I think, 24 hours before the last possibility.</span> <span id="s805">They were telling you about this, but I don't know, because I was too little to know it, but I see it, the way it is, my father later on in years we were talking about it.</span> <span id="s806">What really happened is, we came there, we packed with our things, everything what you could grab, I mean you couldn't take too much, but whatever.</span> <span id="s807">We went, and we were already in the train, in the wagon, we were in it, and all of a sudden some officers came and said, "You have to get out of this train.</span> <span id="s808">This train is not going to Russia.</span> <span id="s809">This train goes to the front.</span> <span id="s810">It has to pick up wounded soldiers."</span> <span id="s811">So everybody got off the train, and they said at a later hour, there’d be another train going to the direction where you are supposed to Russia.</span> <span id="s812">So we went down.</span> <span id="s813">My father says, “OK.</span> <span id="s814">We cannot sit on the train station and wait," and he went like across from the station on the hill, because Czernowitz was on many hills, and found a place, like a Christian woman there who had a spare place to put us in to sleep overnight there.</span> <span id="s815">And we went there, and meanwhile the train formed down there, all the people who were in the station really got into the train and went that direction, to Russia, and we were left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">JF: Your father didn't think that they were telling you the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">AF: No, he was thinking, “OK.</span> <span id="s818">We'll go tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s819">You know, it’s a kind of--he didn't want us to be sitting on the station.</span> <span id="s820">He was the kind of guy who was very, I don't know how to explain, but he had his own way.</span> <span id="s821">So that's how it really happened that we didn't go to Russia, but we stayed behind and had to go--then all the hell.</span> <span id="s822">And then, so when we realized the next morning that the train is gone, he said, “OK.</span> <span id="s823">Let's go back home.”</span> <span id="s824">So we went back home, and all the neighbors who didn't go said, “Ah-ha, you see, you didn't...” In Yiddish they have a saying, “If you didn't say good-bye...” Tape 2, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s825">JF: This is tape 2, side 2, of an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman, on October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">AF: Yes, I just have to repeat what we had a half a tape there.</span> <span id="s827">Like, the sayings was like, “If you didn't say good-bye good enough, you have to return to repeat it.”</span> <span id="s828">So really this what happened to us.</span> <span id="s829">We came back into our home.</span> <span id="s830">OK?</span> <span id="s831">I think about 24 hours later, they occupied back our town, and the Russians were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">JF: The Germans occupied your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s834">And it was not really the Germans only alone, but I remember they were already with the Romanians, partners, like allies.</span> <span id="s835">And actually, the Romanians came back…</span></p> <p><span id="s836">JF: The Romanian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">AF: The Romanian army, what was already in Antonescu [Ion Antonescu came to power Sept. 6, 1940] that was the leader of the government there.</span> <span id="s838">But mainly… also Germans, it was normal that the Germans.</span> <span id="s839">But the biggest influence was the Romanian, and they were running so fast, the Russians and the Germans after them, that in no time, they were already occupying half of the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s840">And what really happened, the Germans gave to the Romanians Romania – Bukovina was always Romania, so this was like handed back to them, plus they gave them also a part of the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s841">But they named it Transnistria.</span> <span id="s842">“Trans” means on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">JF: So the part of the Ukraine that was given to Romania was called...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">AF: Was called Transnistria.</span> <span id="s845">In other words, what is “Transnistria”?</span> <span id="s846">It's like trans-Atlantic, if you say it, he is from the other side of the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s847">So Transnistria, because the border, the Romanian border originally was at the Dneister River.</span> <span id="s848">When they occupied it, they occupied Bukovina and Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s849">So they gave it back, Bessarabia, to the Romanians and Bukovina, and also a portion of the Ukraine, but it was Transnistria.</span> <span id="s850">It was a portion between the River Dneister and Bug, B-U-G.</span> <span id="s851">That's another river what is on the other side of that, it’s like a long piece of territory.</span> <span id="s852">On the other side of Bug was the Germans.</span> <span id="s853">And really, in the Transnistria, there were all the people who were deported by the Romanians, were actually placed at.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">So, I told you more geographically.</span> <span id="s855">I just was going to mention another thing.</span> <span id="s856">All the Jews… Transylvania, you know Transylvania is a part of Romania, who belonged years ago, just like Bukovina, belonged to Austria-Hungary, Transylvania Banat was part of Hungary, but was also part of the Empirium of Austria-Hungary.</span> <span id="s857">But this was the Hungarian part, it was the German--speaking part of that same Empirium, because they were like a kind of, I don't know, why it was Austria and Hungary, I don't know.</span> <span id="s858">But they were interconnected.</span> <span id="s859">So that part of what was years ago part of Hungary, the Hungarians took it back.</span> <span id="s860">All the Jews what were in Transylvania, in Banat, were deported by the Hungarians and Austrians to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s861">Therefore, there are a lot of Romanian Jews who were actually Hungarian Jews what were part of, because the Romanian Hungarian Jews were from Transylvania and from Banat – that's two provinces that were part of Hungary.</span> <span id="s862">All those were deported to Auschwitz, not by the Romanians, but by the Germans, and by the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s863">But, our section what I said, especially those from the occupied Russian territories like Bessarabia and Bukovina, all those were departed to Transnistria.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">JF: So you and your family were part of that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s866">Like the ones who were really from the Romanian Romania, like Bucharest is, like Montagne, and also Moldova, not Moldavia, Moldova, that's a part of Romania, because now they have provinces, and one of them, that was really Romanian part of Romania, those parts was a little bit leniency about deporting, because they had ties, even they were under Antonescu, and even like I told you before of that way the Romanians, you could bribe them, and with some bribes a lot of Jews saved themselves staying in Romania.</span> <span id="s867">All the bad things what they did, but Romania was still a little bit better than to be in Germany or be in Poland, and or being in Hungary.</span> <span id="s868">But, I always say, it makes no difference how you die.</span> <span id="s869">If you are dead, you are gone.</span> <span id="s870">So, if you are gassed, or you are just left to be die, you still are dead.</span> <span id="s871">Now, let me go back now to when the war started, and the Romanians occupied our territory.</span> <span id="s872">When they occupied back in Czernowitz, the Romanians, the first thing that they did, they took out the rabbi and the cantors and everybody, and they were killing people and this, I mean, the Germans, you know, it was really like a massacre...</span></p> <p><span id="s873">JF: So they killed the rabbi and the cantor?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s875">I think two rabbis.</span> <span id="s876">It was a whole--you see, I don't even know, it's just flashing back.</span> <span id="s877">I know only that there was shooting and killing and running by the Germans and they occupied, as far as they had their house there.</span> <span id="s878">And there where the Russians built a kind of palace, I don't know what it was, the Germans occupied that place, and then everything changed all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s879">Back to the way it was back, plus the German Nazis there, and plus everything, and the Antonescu’s troops, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">JF: Were the Romanian troops also doing the killing, or was it...</span></p> <p><span id="s881">AF: No, it was, probably also--you see, they had that saying, you are just as guilty if you do it, or you watch doing it, you know?</span> <span id="s882">And we was always saying, the difference between a good German and a bad German is actually no difference, because the good German, no, the bad German, the Nazi, was killing the Jews.</span> <span id="s883">But the “good German”, in quotations, was the one who was watching them do it.</span> <span id="s884">So they are just as guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">JF: When you say that there were massacres, were these organized massacres?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">AF: Yeah, they were lined up.</span> <span id="s887">They were brought in, arrested, brought in, and it was shooting and this, and deporting and killing and everything.</span> <span id="s888">I mean, it was like the first stamp when they came in, how to say?</span> <span id="s889">Later on, it started to become, you had to put in work, a kind of forced work, working in different places, working at the railroad station to fix up things.</span> <span id="s890">You didn't get paid for it.</span> <span id="s891">It was like a forced labor already like, it was like the beginning of a kind of trying to put you to work for nothing, because you were already somebody who they don't want or don't need, or supposed to be killed maybe at a later date.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">JF: Who organized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">AF: That was already, let me just remember.</span> <span id="s894">I know, it's so far away, it just flashes a little bit.</span> <span id="s895">So, you asked me a question.</span> <span id="s896">I know that they used to come and pick you up.</span> <span id="s897">The Romanians, I think it was, Romanian soldiers would pick you up and take you down to these different places where you had to put in work for them for free.</span> <span id="s898">And I remember I worked a few times at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s899">Not really on the station, but in somewhere else, in a place where we had to put together, clean the place, and carry things, and do all kinds of involuntary, voluntary work, you know.</span> <span id="s900">And you weren't paid for it.</span> <span id="s901">The only thing what you got is a bread, and that was already a big thing to get then.</span> <span id="s902">That was like the pre-concentration camp situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">JF: Was food rationed then?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">AF: Yeh.</span> <span id="s905">I mean, you couldn't get too much, it was war, and this.</span> <span id="s906">Bread was one of the biggest things to get, you know, you got a little bread, I remember, and already at that time, you already felt starved.</span> <span id="s907">Now, normally with wars, I didn't go into the details of bombing things, or how they really bombed this and that, not really in town, but like you could hear bombs exploding and airplanes flying, and this, and hiding in the basements and shelters, some things like that.</span> <span id="s908">And it was so fast, the whole thing passed through so fast that you didn't even have time to really realize what was going on.</span> <span id="s909">Before you knew it, everything was gone.</span> <span id="s910">You know, everything was--they were already on the other side of our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">JF: From June until the time when you were doing this work at the railroad station, about how much time had passed?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">AF: It was from June when the war started, about September, I think it was, when they made a ghetto.</span> <span id="s913">Czernowitz became like part of the town.</span> <span id="s914">In the propaganda then, about, no, in the ghetto was not yet.</span> <span id="s915">In the ghetto, we got the kind of propaganda what I'll bring up later.</span> <span id="s916">All of a sudden, a part of Czernowitz where the bulk of the Jewish people was living, was concentrated in one group, closed up with some wires around, and it formed a ghetto.</span> <span id="s917">Like our family, most of our family, who were out of that, because some of our family was living really in that part what became the ghetto, but some of us who were out of it, we came into this family to live with them, including my grandfather.</span> <span id="s918">I called him Grandfather, Zayde, my mother's uncle actually what brought them up.</span> <span id="s919">They never had children.</span> <span id="s920">So, the two sisters, my mother and her sister, who is 95 and lives in Israel, he was also with us.</span> <span id="s921">I remember he was an old man, he must have been 84, maybe more.</span> <span id="s922">I remember it was the first time in my life I seen him cry and talk to God.</span> <span id="s923">“What are you doing, God?</span> <span id="s924">What are you doing to us?”</span> <span id="s925">, like a protest.</span> <span id="s926">He was left behind, actually, in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s927">We didn't take him with us to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s928">And he died in one of these old people's homes, you know, one of these asylums, they called it, azil [phonetic].</span> <span id="s929">It's not asylum.</span> <span id="s930">Here asylum is when you are crazy.</span> <span id="s931">Azil [Romanian for asylum] there was like a, how do you call these homes, the old age homes?</span> <span id="s932">There where he died.</span> <span id="s933">We don't even know exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s934">I know that when we came back, he was gone already for many years.</span> <span id="s935">In Czernowitz, a lot of Jews had been able to buy themselves out, and not go into concentration camps from there.</span> <span id="s936">With money and all kinds of--you see, you became all of a sudden, some of the people became all of a sudden needed Jews, Wertvolle Juden in other words, Jews what they could not be without, because they were professionals, they were doctors and lawyers, not lawyers, I don’t know, but doctors and maybe merchants, all kind what had money.</span> <span id="s937">They became all of a sudden somebody what they need.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">JF: Were these people still living in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">AF: Yes, at that point, because the ghetto was then, after they deported everybody, they opened the ghetto, in other words, there was no more ghetto, because they deported so many thousands.</span> <span id="s940">And whatever is left was so few left, that they didn't need anymore ghetto, and they just opened the city, and everybody who was there went back to their own place.</span> <span id="s941">So when we came there, all of us were there.</span> <span id="s942">The propaganda of that, and all of a sudden this downtown, no, not downtown, the lower part of town, I said downtown, there it doesn’t exist a downtown like here, with all the businesses.</span> <span id="s943">In Czernowitz, in general in Europe, you don't have this kind of situation downtown where all the businesses are and everything.</span> <span id="s944">The town is town.</span> <span id="s945">It can mean the middle of town, or the outskirts of town.</span> <span id="s946">But it's still town.</span> <span id="s947">It makes no difference.</span> <span id="s948">OK, maybe you would say because here is the City Hall and it would be the center of the town.</span> <span id="s949">So, we were there in that lower part of town, and all of a sudden it became so crowded, and all of a sudden became we got rumors that the Germans, we are going to go to Transnistria; there they prepared for us so we would be able to work, and it came a kind of, that everybody was already inclined to believe it, that such a thing could really happen.</span> <span id="s950">The propaganda that was so great that you went almost alone because they tell you it’s so good.</span> <span id="s951">They are actually telling you they are sending you out of this misery here where you are to a nicer place, where everything will be fine, you will be able to work, and be able to do things, and this and that.</span> <span id="s952">Even people, I remember, from my family, who were able to stay because, like one of my cousins was a doctor, and he had an authorization to remain in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s953">He could arrange it for his father and mother and sisters and brothers to also remain.</span> <span id="s954">But my uncle, his father, my father's brother, they decided they want to go.</span> <span id="s955">Wherever the whole family goes, we want to be together.</span> <span id="s956">So, this kind of propaganda that it will be better than being here in a ghetto, there you will be free, and this and that, and the territory's nice, so people started to believe in it.</span> <span id="s957">It was so maneuvered somehow, and we were really stupid, to tell you.</span> <span id="s958">I didn't understand too much about it.</span> <span id="s959">I was 17 at that point.</span> <span id="s960">And, not even 17, yeh 17.</span> <span id="s961">OK, you go where your parents go, or where everybody-- So, let’s go.</span> <span id="s962">So, all of us, we were at that point about eighty of us, eighty of the family, cousins, brothers and sisters and everything and children, we went.</span> <span id="s963">The only one family who stayed in Czernowitz, funny enough, I don't know how they really, their father was a carpenter, maybe he worked or something.</span> <span id="s964">I really can't figure it out.</span> <span id="s965">I think they stayed, for no reason.</span> <span id="s966">I'm not sure really what was going on.</span> <span id="s967">But basically...</span></p> <p><span id="s968">JF: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">AF: That was in '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">JF: In what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">AF: In October.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">JF: The ghetto was formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">AF: No, the ghetto, I think was formed in September, I'm not sure 100%, the ghetto was somewhere in a different month.</span> <span id="s974">I know only that we went in October.</span> <span id="s975">We were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">JF: In October of 1941.</span> <span id="s977">And where in Transnistria?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">AF: OK, let me just explain to you the way to Transnistria.</span> <span id="s979">What really happened, you went voluntary.</span> <span id="s980">They came, like, three soldiers, three gendarmes, with this, not a gun, how’s this?</span> <span id="s981">with the rifle, they came.</span> <span id="s982">You knew that today goes this street, tomorrow goes this street.</span> <span id="s983">Some people who were smart enough, they were hiding, those were staying there.</span> <span id="s984">But everybody else, we go.</span> <span id="s985">So my father packed a sewing machine, and we had, we had packs.</span> <span id="s986">Our family alone, my one sister was in Russia.</span> <span id="s987">She ran away.</span> <span id="s988">But the other sister and I, and my father and mother, we had so much, [unclear] my sister’s, we had like a typewriter and materials my father bought, pieces of material for to make suits and make this and that.</span> <span id="s989">We filled up a whole wagon, like with a horse, and we went to the station.</span> <span id="s990">All of us.</span> <span id="s991">The other ones had things.</span> <span id="s992">We left everything, and all of us went in one wagon, in one, how you call it, not wagon, what is the train?</span> <span id="s993">A car, one of these cars, the trains.</span> <span id="s994">And it was trains for what you transport grain.</span> <span id="s995">With just a little window, it was like a door, a sliding door, and a little window from one side of the wagon, of the car, and one on the other side, like a little window like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">JF: You were able to take all of these possessions with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">AF: Yeah, you put them all on the train.</span> <span id="s998">Everything.</span> <span id="s999">And it was, I know it was fall.</span> <span id="s1000">And there fall is pretty cool and pretty nasty.</span> <span id="s1001">This weather is beautiful now.</span> <span id="s1002">But it was raining and miserable and kind of nasty, and here we are all on the train.</span> <span id="s1003">OK?</span> <span id="s1004">We going to a better thing, we thought so.</span> <span id="s1005">Then, all of a sudden, I think it took, I don't know how many hours.</span> <span id="s1006">We are locked in, they locked us up in.</span> <span id="s1007">We couldn't go out, the outside locked, and we had one stop, where they would open the door and let us go down to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1008">Because food everybody had taken with them.</span> <span id="s1009">And then again, and the ride, we arrived there in the evening.</span> <span id="s1010">OK.</span> <span id="s1011">They say to open the door, and this was only the Romanians.</span> <span id="s1012">There was nothing to do with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1013">They opened the door, “Everybody off!”</span> <span id="s1014">, so everybody comes down.</span> <span id="s1015">Now, luckily, my father was smart enough to--I had like three shirts on, it was cold enough I could bear it.</span> <span id="s1016">Three shirts, three underwears, one over another.</span> <span id="s1017">It was like everybody was like, if you would hit, it would be like a pillow.</span> <span id="s1018">And my father the same, and everybody-- Now, we arrived in a town called Otachi.</span> <span id="s1019">[also spelled Ataki, or Otaci]</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">JF: How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">AF: O-T-A-C-H-I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">JF: And these are Romanian guards who were taking you off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1024">We arrived there, they were there.</span> <span id="s1025">They open the door, “Down!”</span> <span id="s1026">Now, we are like on the border of the Dneister [also spelled Dnestr], of the River Dneister, and there is no bridge to get over the bridge, because the bridge wasn't present, because it was like… On the other side was really Russia, was the Ukraine, and we was still in the Romanian territory.</span> <span id="s1027">Otachi was part of, on the other side was Mogilëv.</span> <span id="s1028">You heard about it--you know how to spell it.</span> <span id="s1029">So, we were on this side, and supposed to be shipped over to Transnistria, on the other side of the Dneister.</span> <span id="s1030">It was evening, and there was no bridge, and you just got with a pontoon thing, and you would have like, on one side of the river would be like a little thing where you can get off, and a wire stretched over the river, with two boats, and they make a kind of platform, and then I don't know how it was working, pulling it or something, pulling us over to the other side, because there was no bridge.</span> <span id="s1031">Later they built a bridge.</span> <span id="s1032">So, we arrived in town, in this Otachi, they say, “Go down, everybody go down, and take down all your possessions.”</span> <span id="s1033">So everything was here.</span> <span id="s1034">Now the train stopped on the rail here, and here was like a hill up.</span> <span id="s1035">The train was maybe about 5, 6, 7 yards up.</span> <span id="s1036">It’s a kind of a slight hill.</span> <span id="s1037">And now, all of a sudden, the soldiers there, with sticks, started to beat everybody, and raced us up this hill.</span> <span id="s1038">OK?</span> <span id="s1039">Up there were other soldiers with sticks to beat us from there that we should run down.</span> <span id="s1040">And this was about 10, 15 times we had to run up and down this hill.</span> <span id="s1041">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">JF: Still Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1044">It was still Romanian soldiers, it was the Romanian army.</span> <span id="s1045">It was already in a war.</span> <span id="s1046">With all the population looking into, because there were no Jews anymore in Otachi.</span> <span id="s1047">The little towns were immediately--they was the first to be shipped away.</span> <span id="s1048">Only from the big towns because they have to deal with thousands.</span> <span id="s1049">Here there were a handful.</span> <span id="s1050">How big Otachi, it was a little town, it maybe had 20 Jews.</span> <span id="s1051">It was a little hamlet.</span> <span id="s1052">So all these peasants and all the people there, they were watching the soldiers do that.</span> <span id="s1053">There was a reason for it.</span> <span id="s1054">So we are up and down, up and down, and my father was always a sick man.</span> <span id="s1055">He had, at that point, he had a hernia, I remember, a double hernia, and he was afraid to operate it.</span> <span id="s1056">So he was going with this thing what you hold it, you know, I remember when I was a boy I seen him wear this.</span> <span id="s1057">You know, at that time, people were really afraid of operations.</span> <span id="s1058">He was a weak man.</span> <span id="s1059">So he couldn't go up so this guy started to beat him up, really beat him up.</span> <span id="s1060">So what was his luck, that he was full of these clothes, so when he hit him, and I started to laugh, because he was hitting him over the back, and that would make a noise like you hit a pillow, and a lot of dust was coming out of there.</span> <span id="s1061">There was humor in that situation.</span> <span id="s1062">So, the reason why they did this, I learned it later why, to get you tired.</span> <span id="s1063">So, when you were tired, you couldn't carry anything.</span> <span id="s1064">So everything what he brought with us, he had to leave there.</span> <span id="s1065">My father could never carry.</span> <span id="s1066">He had just a rucksack on his back.</span> <span id="s1067">My mother had a breadsack because she was very weak always she couldn’t carry.</span> <span id="s1068">I was the hero--I was the athletic type and my sister, she was also always so weak, but I was carrying two valises, and she was carrying something else, and now they say, “Let's go!”</span> <span id="s1069">And everybody walks.</span> <span id="s1070">And instead of taking us through the street normally, they started to take us through the street, and then they led us down to the river.</span> <span id="s1071">And there was in 1941 was a flood.</span> <span id="s1072">The river overflowed the whole town, Mogilëv and Otachi.</span> <span id="s1073">So there was mud all over, and they pushed us down to go through the mud.</span> <span id="s1074">But until we reached the mud, I already dropped one valise, and the other valise, and the only thing what I was left with was the rucksack, and the other things what I had on me.</span> <span id="s1075">And so everybody.</span> <span id="s1076">And until you reached the point where they took us to sleep overnight in a burned-up synagogue there, with all the windows burned and everything, it was like blowing the wind through the middle, you know, excuse the expression, everything you were doing there, you know?</span> <span id="s1077">No bathrooms, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1078">So everybody was smelling, you can imagine, and it was awful.</span> <span id="s1079">And in that thing, a woman gave birth, in those surroundings.</span> <span id="s1080">You know, you could hear screams and this, and a child all of a sudden was born, and everything.</span> <span id="s1081">Can you imagine, somebody born in that.</span> <span id="s1082">So, when we had--we dropped everything.</span> <span id="s1083">I remember my father, this I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1084">He comes up to this guy standing there, to this peasant watching.</span> <span id="s1085">You know, they were like, you were the weirdos, and it was like a parade, and at the side are standing peasants and looking, what can they grab, you know?</span> <span id="s1086">And as soon as you dropped something, somebody grabbed it and ran away with it if a soldier wouldn't see if, because they were collecting it for them.</span> <span id="s1087">So my father comes to this guy and says, “Do you want a piece of material for a suit?”</span> <span id="s1088">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1089">So he took out, because it was too heavy for him to carry, and gave it away.</span> <span id="s1090">He almost emptied out his whole thing, because it was too heavy for him to carry.</span> <span id="s1091">So, now we are in this synagogue, we slept over the whole night...</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">JF: About how many people do you think were on the transport with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">AF: Oh, it must have been about 40, 50 cars.</span> <span id="s1094">And we came evening, in that evening they couldn't ship us all to the other side.</span> <span id="s1095">So this is why we had to stay here overnight in this hell, you know?</span> <span id="s1096">Windy, tried to cover each other, one was in the corner, on the ground, just to rest through all that.</span> <span id="s1097">And the next morning they came again, and we had to go to a, it’s called in Romanian it's called a deparisitate [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1098">What means, parasites, you know, to check if you are clean enough, you don't have parasites, you could be very clean after sleeping over in one of these places like I said.</span> <span id="s1099">So, here we are, now they come out, and they say, “Let's go to this place, so they can check you if you are clean enough.”</span> <span id="s1100">So, when you walked in, you had to put everything on a, you know, all your belongings, you had to put there, and you went in and a doctor looked here and looked here at your collar to see if you are clean enough, and then they could go out from the other side.</span> <span id="s1101">Now whatever you had gold, pieces or whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Tape 3, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">JF: This is tape 3, side 1, of an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman, on October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">AF: October, that's exactly the month when I--And funny enough that I came to the United States, it was also in October.</span> <span id="s1105">So here we are, the gold taken away, everything taken away, and we came out on the other side, who was lucky could find his baggage, who was not lucky he was left without it.</span> <span id="s1106">And now we are all led again through the river, to that mud, where you would go in like you go in, like sinking in, in that mud, to go.</span> <span id="s1107">They couldn't take us straight on the road, they had to take us through the mud.</span> <span id="s1108">So you dropped some more, or you fall down maybe alone and remain there.</span> <span id="s1109">I remember a cousin of mine, and whenever I am in Israel, they live in Israel, were part of this group of our family, he was, he always reminds me.</span> <span id="s1110">They had a baby then and they came with a carriage.</span> <span id="s1111">And I was very athletic.</span> <span id="s1112">So we went--so, “How can you carry, go with wheels, with a carriage through the mud?”</span> <span id="s1113">So they called me, and I was so strong that I took the whole carriage and I took it to that place where we were shipped over to the other side.</span> <span id="s1114">He always reminds me about it: “Do you remember you did this in ‘41, when we went together over from Otachi to Mogilëv?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">JF: And that family survived that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">AF: Yeah, yeah, all of them survived that.</span> <span id="s1117">But from the 85 or 80 how many were there, around 80, 80-something, I think we were left--my family, thank God, came, my father, mother, sister and I, came back in one piece how to say, and then a few cousins; most of them live in Israel but the rest is--I think we came back about maybe twelve from the whole amount.</span> <span id="s1118">And they didn't die, none of them died from any like poisons or how you call it, killed actually.</span> <span id="s1119">They just died.</span> <span id="s1120">From hunger, from disease, from dirt, from--name it, you know?</span> <span id="s1121">So, here we are, they took us over to the other side, and here comes, now we are already in Mogilëv.</span> <span id="s1122">There again, gendarmes waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1123">It’s about--they took all, probably we were about 50 people, maybe less, in this thing to be able to go over with that wire, and how they moved it, some people were turning something, and it moved forth and back on that one wire what holds it from the--you know to go, not go with the stream of the Dneister.</span> <span id="s1124">On the other side, again gendarmes, about four, I think, with these rifles, and we formed in a group, and now we have to walk to town.</span> <span id="s1125">They were supposed to take us to a place where they have to sort us, where we should go and what to do.</span> <span id="s1126">And these four, now, if you didn't have any luggage, you could run away, and just stay in Mogilëv.</span> <span id="s1127">If you had luggage, they recognized you that you are a newcomer, and they would grab you.</span> <span id="s1128">We didn't know that, OK?</span> <span id="s1129">So, while we were walking, people were Jews, a lot of Jews that were there from before, they came up and told us what is happening now.</span> <span id="s1130">Now, everyone of our family somehow did a kind of crazy thing.</span> <span id="s1131">One of my aunts, all of a sudden, made believe she fainted in the middle of the street, and start to scream, and the soldiers see her lie, "Ah, go to hell", and she left there.</span> <span id="s1132">And then she got up and ran away.</span> <span id="s1133">And a young man is coming to me, my age, and says, “You know, what you can do, I can help you to run away from here, at least to stay here in Mogilëv.”</span> <span id="s1134">Because, we learned later that all the people were going there in that sorting place, like it was a burned-down Kasern [barracks], where soldiers used to be years ago.</span> <span id="s1135">All those people are sent on the other side of the brook to the Germans, and from there there was no return.</span> <span id="s1136">That was the end.</span> <span id="s1137">If you were caught to be in that Kasern, and then they ship you over, and then you never come back.</span> <span id="s1138">So this guy came, and he says, “You want to run away?”</span> <span id="s1139">I said, “How, I have this thing?”</span> <span id="s1140">“Look, I’ll grab--you’ll give me this, your rucksack, I'll run away and you run after me, and it will be fine.”</span> <span id="s1141">OK.</span> <span id="s1142">He maybe thought that he’ll be, outrun me, and he would run away with my things--because you became an animal actually, very fast, you know, in the situation like that.</span> <span id="s1143">So he was running, and I after him, and I caught him.</span> <span id="s1144">OK.</span> <span id="s1145">He wasn’t really--he was very nice, how to say it.</span> <span id="s1146">He said, I should give him something, and I gave him two shirts, and he was very thankful.</span> <span id="s1147">He was a Jewish boy, but he came who they wouldn’t let, they wouldn’t bring with them anything.</span> <span id="s1148">They were there also, but they came just as they were, with no baggage, with no nothing.</span> <span id="s1149">He was already there he says for a month, and he didn't even have anything to change, a shirt, so this was for him--I never met the guy later on.</span> <span id="s1150">It was like a one-time encounter.</span> <span id="s1151">And everybody in my family, my mother, my father, my sister and her fiancé, in some other place, was able to get out before.</span> <span id="s1152">And my mother was the last to get out.</span> <span id="s1153">And she says, to her it was like, she was very religious, you know, and she says it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s1154">And she told us how it was.</span> <span id="s1155">She felt that some angels came and saved her.</span> <span id="s1156">It was her way of interpret.</span> <span id="s1157">Some three men came after her and says, “Follow us,” and somehow she followed them.</span> <span id="s1158">It was about maybe 100 yards before, it was like the last moment, and somehow she was saved.</span> <span id="s1159">And the next day, there was like a marketplace, and every one was in the market looking for each other, and then we somehow met there.</span> <span id="s1160">Now, the whole town of Mogilëv, at that time, the lower part, near the Dneister, was, has been for three, four days, under water.</span> <span id="s1161">But under water like to the half of this house.</span> <span id="s1162">So all the houses we were being in were wet.</span> <span id="s1163">The walls, you touched the wall, your hand would just go into the wetness, and we had to stay in these kind of houses to run away, not to be deported further on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">JF: There was no checking in the town of people who had run away from the line?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">AF: It was impossible, because there were so many there.</span> <span id="s1166">They really didn't care.</span> <span id="s1167">They knew that we are in their hands anyway.</span> <span id="s1168">Sooner or later they'll get us.</span> <span id="s1169">And really what happened, in later months, was that they formed a kind of police, a kind of Jewish police, that had to deliver so many Jews each day to be sent to Vaknyarka [phonetic] that was on the other side of the Bug.</span> <span id="s1170">And those people, they never came back.</span> <span id="s1171">Once out--so they knew that they had us.</span> <span id="s1172">Unless you had an authorization from the mayor, not the mayor, the major of the town, the Romanian mayor, because they were Germans also.</span> <span id="s1173">But the Germans didn’t have to do with us anything, only the Romanians.</span> <span id="s1174">We were just under the jurisdiction of the Romanian army.</span> <span id="s1175">So, when we had--the only thing what you could stay was if you had an authorization that you are a useful Jew, and they need you in this town, they could not pick you up.</span> <span id="s1176">So the other ones who did not have that were slowly, slowly deported.</span> <span id="s1177">I was a youngster, and I wasn't--I liked to do things, to work in this.</span> <span id="s1178">Being that I had this background of dentistry, and all this what I learned, I got somehow--it's a whole story how I got in to work for the sanitary service of the city.</span> <span id="s1179">I became a disinfector.</span> <span id="s1180">In other words, I was baking lice.</span> <span id="s1181">And I was somehow, it's a whole story.</span> <span id="s1182">And then I became sick.</span> <span id="s1183">I started to work, and I was lucky enough I had typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">JF: When you say you boiled lice, you mean you were cleaning the clothes of the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1186">In other words, if you would, you imagine the situation, living one with another in these places, the lice were like crawling all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">JF: If you were working, that means that you were, your name was on a list.</span> <span id="s1188">You were known to be in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">AF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">JF: Was it considered a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">JF: They made a ghetto of Mogilëv.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">JF: And this is where this occurred then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1196">And there were hundreds and hundreds died, every day, hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s1197">And the clothes had to be disinfected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">JF: You're talking about from the people who had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1200">And this is what I was doing, baking lice, until I got sick also, myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">JF: You said you got typhus at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1203">And somehow, being that I was that strong and young and with whole energy, I survived it, almost with no medicine.</span> <span id="s1204">I remember an episode in that hospital, when I was delirious and this, and there were other kids and youngsters and people, there was a young girl nearby saying, screaming to her mother that she had a si shtecht mir, how you say in English?</span> <span id="s1205">She has a kind of pinching sensation on her body, and she was screaming all the time, it pinches, it hurts, or somewhere.</span> <span id="s1206">So I said, “Take a knife and pinch back!”</span> <span id="s1207">So later, her mother came, she tells her mother, “Mother, give me a knife.”</span> <span id="s1208">She said, “Why do you want it?”</span> <span id="s1209">“I want to pinch back.”</span> <span id="s1210">She was already almost, you know, it was like a delirium type of-- She died later on, this young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">JF: Mogilëv became a ghetto when?</span> <span id="s1212">After you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">AF: Yes, after we arrived.</span> <span id="s1214">A little bit later.</span> <span id="s1215">They made it smaller, because they had to have the Ukrainian part.</span> <span id="s1216">So they made like a concentration in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">JF: And the Romanians were in charge of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1219">We had to build, by voluntary work, how to say, we had to build that kind of, you couldn't go over to the other side.</span> <span id="s1220">Because, at the checkpoint you had to show if you are allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s1221">If you are needed there, then you could get out.</span> <span id="s1222">But at night you were never allowed to be out of there.</span> <span id="s1223">You had to be inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">JF: You were working within the walls of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">AF: At first.</span> <span id="s1226">Later on they sent me to a Ukrainian hospital to work there.</span> <span id="s1227">And I was working, I was everything there.</span> <span id="s1228">You name it and I was there.</span> <span id="s1229">Now, in the, like when we found ourselves, there were already a lot of our family who died.</span> <span id="s1230">In the first month--don't forget, people who had no desire of living, people who no--they thought that that was the end anyway, they gave up hope.</span> <span id="s1231">Those people were the first to die.</span> <span id="s1232">And who were those people?</span> <span id="s1233">Mainly intellectuals.</span> <span id="s1234">The simple people survived more than the intellectuals because they weren't thinking that far.</span> <span id="s1235">They were struggling for survival.</span> <span id="s1236">That was their aim.</span> <span id="s1237">We have to survive, there is no other way.</span> <span id="s1238">Those who didn't have that drive of wanting to survive died the first few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">JF: You and your immediate family were then able to live together in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1241">And I was actually, being I was then what?</span> <span id="s1242">18, 17, 18, I was the one who had this authorization obtained that I’m a useful Jew, and they shouldn't touch me.</span> <span id="s1243">And in that way it was for the family also, automatically.</span> <span id="s1244">Now we immediately then tried to form all kind of cultural activities to help out the morale.</span> <span id="s1245">And I remember, he's still alive, there was an actor, his name was Publicker [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1246">He's still in Romania.</span> <span id="s1247">He was an actor from way back, and he organized a theater.</span> <span id="s1248">And I, OK, I didn't mention that I was, in the '40s, when the Russians came, I used to play an instrument before, like a mandolin and violin, and then I started to play the flute in 1940.</span> <span id="s1249">I went to school especially for it.</span> <span id="s1250">And in concentration camp, I was a part of this group by playing the flute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">JF: You're talking now about the ghetto in Mogilëv?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">JF: They formed an orchestra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">AF: No, they formed a theater.</span> <span id="s1255">And they needed a part where I, of a peasant playing the flute.</span> <span id="s1256">And I had been a part of that.</span> <span id="s1257">OK, we have never been able to really perform because it came then an ordinance that we were not allowed to do it, because all these things were actually for bringing up the morale of the people, you know, giving them hope, giving them what to live for in the future.</span> <span id="s1258">And, basically, like I said before, if you die by being gassed, or you die just because you have no food.</span> <span id="s1259">Sometimes you would prefer to die just--and that's the end, instead of going through this whole hell of dying slowly.</span> <span id="s1260">By hunger, there were hundreds and hundreds who died, just fell in the street, blown up like a balloon, from no food.</span> <span id="s1261">There were, if you imagine, the lice, where you could see lice walking on the streets, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s1262">And the typhus eczematous, what was called an eczema, in other words, it was enough that one louse was biting a sick person, and then somehow walk over to a healthy person, and he'll bite him also, the person will get sick.</span> <span id="s1263">And this was millions.</span> <span id="s1264">Only those who became then later, if they had the sickness, they were immune already, so they could not get it again.</span> <span id="s1265">You can have it once in your lifetime.</span> <span id="s1266">So those are actually really the survivors, who had it.</span> <span id="s1267">All these other ones, who did not become immune, they really died.</span> <span id="s1268">There was no way of return.</span> <span id="s1269">There was no medicine, very little.</span> <span id="s1270">Later on, I remember, like in '43, the Joint [American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, an aid organization] came already, and clothes and things, like, it was already like everybody already knew that something is happening.</span> <span id="s1271">The armies were advancing, and this and that.</span> <span id="s1272">It started to become a little easier, how to say, because you had already a kind of little light somewhere what you see in the darkness.</span> <span id="s1273">But until that point, the misery was enormous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">JF: You said that you were not permitted to put on the play that you had practiced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1276">We practiced a long time.</span> <span id="s1277">Everything was set.</span> <span id="s1278">The day of the performance came an ordinance, you know, like a thing from the major of the City.</span> <span id="s1279">Major, is major, I think.</span> <span id="s1280">Yes, it's like before colonel, is major, yes?</span> <span id="s1281">He was the leader of the town, the military leader.</span> <span id="s1282">And an ordinance came, they locked up, and they wouldn't let us perform.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">JF: Was there also some effort towards education for any of the children in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">AF: I don't really know, because they didn't have any at that point.</span> <span id="s1285">I know that there were no schools, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s1286">You observed all the holidays.</span> <span id="s1287">Funny enough is, that you didn't have what to eat, but when it came Yom Kippur, you didn't really eat, and you really kept all.</span> <span id="s1288">When we had this Passover, usually Passover you are not allowed to eat cornmeal.</span> <span id="s1289">So you can imagine, there were rabbis, and everything you had in the camp, because you had doctors, Jewish doctors, and there were plenty of them deported.</span> <span id="s1290">So they gave out a decree that you were allowed to eat cornmeal, because we didn't have any--all the breads and everything was mixed with cornmeal.</span> <span id="s1291">You didn't get wheat or this.</span> <span id="s1292">The bread was like, if you put a finger, it didn't bounce back.</span> <span id="s1293">It would go in, and it stayed in.</span> <span id="s1294">So, because it was mixed with all kinds of other meals, so he gave a decree that you were allowed at Passover to eat this, so you can, actually it is pikuach nefesh, in other words, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1295">I just remembered, I'm going back now into '41, before we were deported.</span> <span id="s1296">OK, when the whole thing it happened, it fell exactly when we had the High Holidays, in Czernowitz before we were deported.</span> <span id="s1297">So, we didn't have any more synagogues.</span> <span id="s1298">It was already the German and Romanian Nazis there.</span> <span id="s1299">So what happened?</span> <span id="s1300">We had it in houses.</span> <span id="s1301">But you were not allowed to concentrate big amounts of people, you know, it was one of the ordinances that came out.</span> <span id="s1302">So we had to take our heart in our hands to form all kinds of little places where you could concentrate 40, 50 people and pray, and have like little synagogues.</span> <span id="s1303">So remember, my uncle, one of the uncles who actually died in concentration camp, the husband of my aunt what is 95 now in Israel.</span> <span id="s1304">In their home we formed a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1305">And it was Yom Kippur, and my dear grandfather was there, the Zayde, was there, and all the family.</span> <span id="s1306">It was only for close people.</span> <span id="s1307">It wasn't for outsiders.</span> <span id="s1308">So we were praying, and it comes to Neilah when you have to blow the shofar, and the guy who was supposed to blow the shofar never, wasn't able to blow it.</span> <span id="s1309">And if you don't blow the shofar, you cannot go eat.</span> <span id="s1310">And he was struggling, trying to blow that shofar, and he couldn't.</span> <span id="s1311">So I said, “Give me, I'll try it.”</span> <span id="s1312">And I blew the shofar, because I knew a little bit about playing the flute.</span> <span id="s1313">So I was able to--And this was, how to say, the last happiness actually, the last joy of my Zayde, who later on, I told you before, died, and we never seen him-- This is another.</span> <span id="s1314">There are flashbacks of all kinds of episodes that I remember, and it's probably already so many tapes you have here.</span> <span id="s1315">OK, so, where have we been now.</span> <span id="s1316">I was talking about Passover.</span> <span id="s1317">So this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1318">There were all kind of ways of trying to survive.</span> <span id="s1319">I forgot, another episode what was really the main, how you say it, the strong, how is that, the basis, the backstone?</span> <span id="s1320">No, no.</span> <span id="s1321">There’s a word what you say.</span> <span id="s1322">The backbone.</span> <span id="s1323">Ah, the backbone, the backbone of our being able to really start to stay there.</span> <span id="s1324">You had no money, there was like Marks, but it was like these Marks you couldn't use anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1325">It was made especially for Transnistria, they had special money for that.</span> <span id="s1326">And to be able to survive, you had to do something at first, until you really started to know where you are.</span> <span id="s1327">So, my mother, she had always to take care of food.</span> <span id="s1328">That was her-- So what was she carrying?</span> <span id="s1329">Now gold, you are not allowed to have because I told you they took it away already in Otachi–you had to drop it into that bucket, and they took off with it.</span> <span id="s1330">If you didn't take it off, they found it.</span> <span id="s1331">So now she has this side sack, like a sack, what did she carry in there?</span> <span id="s1332">She carries marmalades and bread and things to have to nourish her family so to be able to survive.</span> <span id="s1333">So the guy there looks in at what she has, and, “Oh, fine.”</span> <span id="s1334">But when we arrived in Mogilëv, and we started to sell from us everything.</span> <span id="s1335">I mean, you had all these peasants from the surroundings used to come and buy.</span> <span id="s1336">So you take off a shirt and you sell it to buy food.</span> <span id="s1337">And in all other things, you start slowly, slowly, until you are almost naked.</span> <span id="s1338">But my mother had, in this jar of marmalade, she had a big gold watch with a chain hidden.</span> <span id="s1339">She really took her-- She had really courage.</span> <span id="s1340">She didn't say--if my father would have known, he was always so afraid of everything, if he would have known that she has that, he would have taken it out and give it away.</span> <span id="s1341">But she was smart enough not to tell anybody about it.</span> <span id="s1342">And when we arrived there, that was really the lifesaver.</span> <span id="s1343">Because we immediately could get a big amount of money for that, and we could find a place where we could stay for awhile where to live there, and the first thing that we started out to do was to sell latkes, potato latkes.</span> <span id="s1344">With the money what we had here, my mother ran out and bought potatoes on the market, and rubbed them [makes grating sound] and this and we had a niece of ours who was with us, who, and I, we were going out and sell the latkes for this, and then we started to make already, and people were hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s1345">So this was how we really started to be able to survive in that.</span> <span id="s1346">Later on, was already being that I was able to obtain this kind of--nobody wanted this kind of job, because they were afraid if you got caught by one of those lice, that would be the end of it.</span> <span id="s1347">But I didn't care, I mean I watched out, but at a certain point I became immune, being that I was already sick anyway.</span> <span id="s1348">So for me it was nothing, and it was for me like a lifesaver, how to say, because on this basis, we were able all of us to survive when nobody-- You know, they have this saying, if you have enough years to live, you survive.</span> <span id="s1349">This is really how it-- Later in years, like I said, we were there for 3 ½ years.</span> <span id="s1350">We started in October '41, and we were there until March '44.</span> <span id="s1351">And then we were freed by the Russian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">JF: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">AF: Now that's an episode for itself.</span> <span id="s1354">Now we knew, you know, we had, some people had radios or they heard, there was the Underground, the partisans and everything.</span> <span id="s1355">So rumors, we knew exactly about what is happening.</span> <span id="s1356">We knew about, I'm talking about now general happenings, that the Russian army is advancing, that they invaded Europe, that the American army landed, and this.</span> <span id="s1357">And you already heard that it was going to better, OK?</span> <span id="s1358">The difference only between those who were in a station like we were, in a camp like that, there were two types--there were Vernichtungslager and the Konzentrationslager.</span> <span id="s1359">It means, Vernichtung means "destruction, extermination", and that was just you would die alone.</span> <span id="s1360">The only chance what we had was that we had at least a chance to survive, and the other ones who were really, didn't have no chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">JF: You had a fairly clear idea then of what was happening in the extermination camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">JF: When you were in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">AF: No, no.</span> <span id="s1365">In later years.</span> <span id="s1366">We still did not realize exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s1367">Because it was so, the secret of it was so kept so strongly, I mean they really kept it so that they could convince the people to go even, not to-- Everybody thought they were going somewhere that would be better for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">JF: The contact that some of the people had with the underground and the partisans, as you pointed out before, did this mean that anybody from your group try to escape, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">AF: At the certain moment, when the Joint came in already, like in '43, I think, there were already in Unterhandlung, you know how you say Unterhandlung, there were already talks between the leaders of the Jewish people, because immediately they formed the Federation and this, you know, always like that, where the Jews are, they immediately form.</span> <span id="s1370">And they already had a kind of connection somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Tape 3, side 2:</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">JF: This is tape 3, side 2, of an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman, on October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">AF: So, when the episode of being freed, I was talking about the children, about the things that were going on.</span> <span id="s1374">They already tried, at that point, they started to try, and all the children what were left, yesoymim without parents, the orphans, they should be somehow taken out from there.</span> <span id="s1375">There were some doing, and I don't recall 100%, but I think a group had been--Because I told you, with the Romanians we had at least that one choice, that you could bribe them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">JF: Who was trying to get the orphans out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">AF: The Jews from Romania got in touch with the Jews from here, and even the delegates, a guy from Bucharest came to see the situation in Transnistria, because they were also kept in the dark.</span> <span id="s1378">They didn’t know what was really going on even here.</span> <span id="s1379">So, they came, and it was a kind of discussion occurred with the government and this, and they seen already, you know, at that point, it is already like tse nileh [end approaching ; last service on Yom Kippur] like the last card that they play, the Romanians, and the Germans for that matter, also, because it was already, it was after Stalingrad, it was after the Moscow siege, and it was already the Normandy thing, and already they could see that there will be no more, no too long.</span> <span id="s1380">Now, it was only a question of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">JF: Who from Bucharest was able to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">AF: From the Federation, from the Jewish Federation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">JF: How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">AF: With bribes.</span> <span id="s1385">How did they permit to let in the Joint bring clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">JF: Again it was through bribes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">AF: Of course, how else?</span> <span id="s1388">I remember they had, in Mogilëv, they had, how you say, like piles of things that were just thrown in there, in these big storage places, and whoever knew somebody, whoever this they would bring them in there, and clothe them from the top to the bottom, with shoes and things, because I am sure that here in the United States they collected things and this, and to get it it there wasn't that easy, it was meant to be given really to everybody, but you know, until it really comes to the needy, half of it is lost some on the way, and even then, when it comes to wherever you were in the camp that you could get something, you have to know somebody who gave you a kind of idea how to get in there and get something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">JF: Was there a Jewish Council in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">AF: It wasn't a council, it was a Jewish group, yes, a kind of type of Federation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">JF: And they were responsible for making these connections with the Jews outside of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">AF: More or less.</span> <span id="s1393">First of all was the police, what I told you before, who was put there to put together people.</span> <span id="s1394">And even they, it's not good to tell you about your own people that they were bad, but they were.</span> <span id="s1395">Because they were able to maneuver whoever, you would bribe them also.</span> <span id="s1396">But they had to give the number.</span> <span id="s1397">You see, you couldn't get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">JF: There were transports, regular transports, then, that were picked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1400">So you had to, I mean the first years.</span> <span id="s1401">Later on it eased up.</span> <span id="s1402">But at first it was like permanent, permanent transporting groups.</span> <span id="s1403">And they had to give so many a day.</span> <span id="s1404">And what they used to give, the sick ones and who couldn't walk and who couldn't talk, and everyone who couldn't resist, couldn't put any resistance.</span> <span id="s1405">Like, my cousin here, what he lives here, his family, his father, mother, sister and brother died.</span> <span id="s1406">Now, the father and mother died immediately, but the sister and the older brother, both were older than him, they had typhus, and they were already almost out of it, like they were still convalescing in the home, because it was like the end of it.</span> <span id="s1407">So they needed people, so they walked in there, picked him up, his name was Philip Feku [phonetic], and his sister Betty, who was also there, and the only sister, the smaller sister, Sedie [phonetic] was with us already, living with us, because she didn't have parents, and she was 16 years old, 15 years, a little girl yet, a youngster, so those two were picked up as a part of a group to be deported.</span> <span id="s1408">So, he, when they came in, they say they are taking him for a checkup to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1409">So he says yes; he didn't even put on his shoes.</span> <span id="s1410">He went in, how you say it, his slippers, winter.</span> <span id="s1411">And she also, and the only thing you heard later on, because he had, I remember, he used to have a very heavy coat, and somebody has then told us that they took away this coat from him, and that was the end.</span> <span id="s1412">He never returned, he went away, actually, and that was the end of him.</span> <span id="s1413">There was horrible stories about different things what even Jewish people used to do.</span> <span id="s1414">I mean, your own people sometimes, all these Kapos, Kapos they are called, were similar.</span> <span id="s1415">OK.</span> <span id="s1416">That was more horrifying than ours, but even here you send innocent people because you needed, and maybe you cannot blame even these people doing it because they knew that if you don't give the amount, you’ll be taken.</span> <span id="s1417">It's like a knife with two ends will pinch you both sides.</span> <span id="s1418">So you had to work hard to be able to put together that-- Now, with freeing us, it was very funny.</span> <span id="s1419">We knew already now that the Russian army was very close.</span> <span id="s1420">We didn't know exactly how close, but we knew that they are close.</span> <span id="s1421">So really what happened is, all of a sudden, we get this shooting.</span> <span id="s1422">Being that we were on the border of the Dneister, the Dneister was actually a point where they can hold back.</span> <span id="s1423">So, on this side is Otachi, where the town we are in, and here is Mogilëv.</span> <span id="s1424">In the middle is the Dneister.</span> <span id="s1425">We heard that night they break the bridge.</span> <span id="s1426">When you break up a bridge, a railroad bridge, it means that it’s very close something.</span> <span id="s1427">So the first thing what they did was cut that bridge in half.</span> <span id="s1428">And we were very close.</span> <span id="s1429">The whole house almost fell apart from that.</span> <span id="s1430">We were about maybe 300 yards from that bridge.</span> <span id="s1431">Now, all of a sudden, the main what we really understood that really something is going on, that there were columns and columns of motorized soldiers and tanks and everything going to that one bridge left, that was not a railroad bridge, but a regular bridge, what we built actually, the Jews there for them.</span> <span id="s1432">So, they were tracking there, and they were coming from three or four directions, from north, from south and from east, going all the way to this bridge.</span> <span id="s1433">And this bridge could take just so much.</span> <span id="s1434">So what really happened is, one tank, and they told us later on what really happened, these partisans, captured the German tank, got into German clothes, and went in this column with all the people, you know, going towards the bridge.</span> <span id="s1435">And then when they came to the bridge, they all stopped, and they ran out, and screamed out, "The Ivan is here."</span> <span id="s1436">[Russian pronunciation].</span> <span id="s1437">Ivan there was a synonym for the Russian.</span> <span id="s1438">Ivan, you know, Ivan is another, [English pronunciation] Ivan, Ivan is here.</span> <span id="s1439">So they heard Ivan is here, they started to fight, like the Germans would fight with the Romanians that they should be first to cross, and not the Romanians.</span> <span id="s1440">And can you imagine, here you have a tank, and this has a--and they started shooting, and when we heard shooting, the people who had the bridge, to blow up the bridge in the last second, thought that the people already fighting there, that they really are dead.</span> <span id="s1441">So they blew up the bridge, and everything was left on this side.</span> <span id="s1442">And everybody jumped, all these officers and everything, changed clothes into civilians, and they run into the water and swim over the Dneister.</span> <span id="s1443">It was a whole [unclear].</span> <span id="s1444">And for 24 hours, there was nobody in the town.</span> <span id="s1445">There was no Germans, and no Russians, because it was still far away.</span> <span id="s1446">The only law in town was like one tank of partisans.</span> <span id="s1447">And I was then, what, 20, I think or so.</span> <span id="s1448">So I was interested to see how a partisan looks.</span> <span id="s1449">I had never seen it.</span> <span id="s1450">So I decided to walk out to see the partisan.</span> <span id="s1451">And we knew where it is.</span> <span id="s1452">Saw some torn-up clothes.</span> <span id="s1453">You know how a partisan can look.</span> <span id="s1454">You think he is a hero.</span> <span id="s1455">He is a human being, and has nothing to eat just like you don't have, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1456">And here we see him with a rifle in the hand, with a tank, with a red flag on it, and they are, nobody's there.</span> <span id="s1457">No Romanians, no Germans, no Russians.</span> <span id="s1458">Can you imagine, everybody was already hungry, and this, so everybody ran, from these cars, on all sides cars, but nobody there, the cars alone.</span> <span id="s1459">So you opened them and went into the cars and grabbed blankets what you didn't have, and food and chocolate.</span> <span id="s1460">I hadn't seen chocolate for 3 ½ years.</span> <span id="s1461">And Germans had, when they wanted to bribe you with something, like be nice to you, they would give you a piece of chocolate.</span> <span id="s1462">So when we came to these cars, the first thing what I was looking for chocolate.</span> <span id="s1463">Because I knew that everybody had in these cars chocolate.</span> <span id="s1464">So I picked up chocolate, I picked up a few blankets.</span> <span id="s1465">And people were really, I mean, they found cars of sugar, because they were trying to get away.</span> <span id="s1466">And everybody took whatever he could, to just make a little bit easier their life, because they never had it.</span> <span id="s1467">The only thing what I picked up, there was a factory, an oil factory, not too far from us, and I always wanted, we didn't have enough wood, you know, wintertime.</span> <span id="s1468">And it was nasty and cold, and we didn't have what to really burn.</span> <span id="s1469">So what we did, the house where we were living in was half broken.</span> <span id="s1470">So if it would held on a long war, the whole house would have collapsed over us, because every day I was going out and pull a piece of wood from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1471">So my dream was to have enough of that.</span> <span id="s1472">So when you make oil, they leave, when they press out the oil it's called makuha in Russian, [to grind, mill] it's kind of a brick, big round brick, what they press out from the machine, and that is good for burning.</span> <span id="s1473">So what I did, I went in there and brought about five sacks of that oil in the house to have some combustible thing to be able to heat up the house.</span> <span id="s1474">And like I said, for 24 hours, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1475">The only thing what was going on, the Russians even didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1476">There was still shooting going on over us.</span> <span id="s1477">They were shooting from the other side, was Otachi, they were shooting the other side over to them, and they from up there, from the Ukrainian side, the Russians were shooting there.</span> <span id="s1478">And then, finally, we see a little airplane coming down there, and somebody looking up really was going on, and later on the army marched in, and they freed really the town up.</span> <span id="s1479">At that point we knew that really we are finally free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">JF: Where did you go once the Russians came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">AF: OK, once the Russians came, it took awhile.</span> <span id="s1482">Most of them were concentrated to the army.</span> <span id="s1483">In other words, not concentrated, mobilized to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1484">And were sent to fight.</span> <span id="s1485">And a lot of them really were killed after concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1486">Like my sister's fiancé had come to the army, and the day of the 9th of May, I think was the last day of war, if I remember, he was killed the 9th of May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">JF: You were not taken for the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">AF: No, I was lucky in a sense that one day, one night, I had this habit to play flute.</span> <span id="s1489">So one night I was playing the flute in the middle of the night, when I used to come.</span> <span id="s1490">I was still working in that hospital, because now the war, you can imagine, was a little different already.</span> <span id="s1491">They were giving us already things, because before when I worked in the hospital I didn't get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">JF: Then your family was still living in Mogilëv.</span> <span id="s1493">You were working now in the Ukrainian hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">AF: Now, just a few days.</span> <span id="s1495">Being that I was working in that hospital, they wouldn't pay us.</span> <span id="s1496">Money no question.</span> <span id="s1497">But what they were giving me there, bread, a little piece of soap, because soap was one of the hardest things to get.</span> <span id="s1498">Because soap, my God, like gold, to clean yourself.</span> <span id="s1499">Because like, without soap--here you were cleaning your clothes, you didn't have boiling water, so you just washed them the way you could, and the next day you were full with lice again, because they had nests of the eggs of the lice that were forming from the warm body.</span> <span id="s1500">They immediately would form.</span> <span id="s1501">You had to burn, really to get rid of everything you had to burn everything.</span> <span id="s1502">And even then, you had to shave really to get rid of it, all the hair had to be shaven, even from all the parts of the body, because there were nests there, and as soon as you put on new clothes, they were there.</span> <span id="s1503">But coming back to how I went out of there--so it was night, I was sitting home, and practicing the flute.</span> <span id="s1504">So one night I hear a knock on the window, and he walks in, this officer, a captain, a Russian captain, with another guy, and starts talking to me, and he says, “Oh, you play the flute?”</span> <span id="s1505">And I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1506">He says, "Oh, I'm a leader of a band, of a military band.</span> <span id="s1507">And we don't have a flutist.</span> <span id="s1508">Do you want to come?”</span> <span id="s1509">I said, “Wait a minute, we just are freed.”</span> <span id="s1510">And he says, “Look, you'll have it very good with us, don't worry about anything.</span> <span id="s1511">We need you.”</span> <span id="s1512">So my father, he convinced me I should go, and I went with them.</span> <span id="s1513">And we crossed immediately, and we were following, what we were really doing, we were following the military.</span> <span id="s1514">Whoever occupied a town, we were after them, we were marching with the marching band, you know.</span> <span id="s1515">We were marching until we came to a town, a Romanian town, I forgot the name of it, Mogosan, [phonetic], I think, yeah.</span> <span id="s1516">And there we stopped, and I was there a short while, because then came a kind of decree that all the people from concentration camps should go first to their home where they were from.</span> <span id="s1517">They had no right really to take us immediately.</span> <span id="s1518">But at first we were housed in this, you know, and then they gave me a piece of paper that I should go home, and then go to the place where you register as a military service, ready to go to service, how you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">JF: That you were drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">AF: To the drafting place.</span> <span id="s1521">There was a place to go to, the drafting place, and they would register you and then decide if they need you or not.</span> <span id="s1522">So, this how I got out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">JF: This is under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">AF: Yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s1525">Under the Russians.</span> <span id="s1526">And they sent me back to Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s1527">And I came to Czernowitz, my parents were already in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s1528">My sister, who was in Russia, was the first to march in.</span> <span id="s1529">She marched in, she wasn't the military, but she marched in together, she was in Russia and she was looking for us.</span> <span id="s1530">So she marched in with the first column of when they freed Czernowitz, she came in with them.</span> <span id="s1531">She was the first one there.</span> <span id="s1532">And then finally, she met on the street a friend of ours who knew already that we were there.</span> <span id="s1533">Now, I was very slow in going to the draft.</span> <span id="s1534">I had enough already.</span> <span id="s1535">So what I did, I found this guy, a friend of mine, he is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s1536">He is a drummer.</span> <span id="s1537">And I meet him on the street, and I say, “Look, I have this and this, what can I do, I don't want to go.”</span> <span id="s1538">He said, “I didn't want to go either.</span> <span id="s1539">Come, I show you what you’ll do.”</span> <span id="s1540">He was working for the fire department as a drummer.</span> <span id="s1541">He says, "We just formed an orchestra.</span> <span id="s1542">We found one of the commanders of the, how you call it, of the fire department, who is a lover of music.</span> <span id="s1543">And he formed an orchestra, and we need one more guy, and we somehow will be kept here, because the fire departments in Russia is military, actually, so it's like being in the military, but in the town to go after fires.”</span> <span id="s1544">So, we went there, and for two months I was a musician there, and I was singing also, Russian songs.</span> <span id="s1545">Now, but, what really happened, he didn't have no jurisdiction to really keep us there as musicians.</span> <span id="s1546">I mean, it was his own.</span> <span id="s1547">Everybody was on his own at that point, because nobody was really, there were heroes that marched in, and he is the captain of the fire department and he wants an orchestra.</span> <span id="s1548">So we had to become, all of us had to become first firemen.</span> <span id="s1549">So, I was for two months I was a fire fighter.</span> <span id="s1550">And later on, they needed drivers.</span> <span id="s1551">So where did we get drivers?</span> <span id="s1552">We had one machine, one car.</span> <span id="s1553">The whole town of 200,000, had one car, really a fire car, and the rest was we found an old fashioned pump somewhere in the fire department that was left over from the beginning of the '30s probably, one of these what you see like in the movies, a pump, like in the middle like a balloon, like a thing, and on the sides a handle, and you go up and down like you see in the movies sometimes way back.</span> <span id="s1554">We found one of these.</span> <span id="s1555">So we fixed that up and we put it on a truck, with hoses, and we had a hose attached to the hydrant, and then the water would go in the balloon, and then we would pump it and go.</span> <span id="s1556">They had one time a fire, I remember, in a building, in a tall building, it was about six stories or seven stories high.</span> <span id="s1557">It was a movie, it was the German movie, and I used to live years ago across from there.</span> <span id="s1558">It was called the, I forgot the name of it.</span> <span id="s1559">But it was a German movie.</span> <span id="s1560">So there was a fire on the roof, and it start burning, and now we are starting to pump here, and there was a guy up there on the sixth floor, and the thing was like on the steps.</span> <span id="s1561">And we are pumping, pumping, no, we didn't pump.</span> <span id="s1562">They brought prisoners to pump.</span> <span id="s1563">There were about eight German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1564">They were putting them to pump there, and they pumped and pumped, and the hydrant doesn't work.</span> <span id="s1565">So they rigged big buckets, very big, and now they had a pipe going from that bucket and this pumper that has to go from the hydrant.</span> <span id="s1566">It was such a joke, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1567">And they are pumping, and the water doesn't come.</span> <span id="s1568">And the guy, the chief, he is up there, and he screams, "Vater", and vater means water.</span> <span id="s1569">And here's the fire, and he holds this, and the water doesn't come up.</span> <span id="s1570">Can you imagine, with a pump like this, to go up on the sixth floor?</span> <span id="s1571">But we were lucky at that point that there was a fire department at the railroad station, who had a car.</span> <span id="s1572">They had really a regular fire car, and they came and helped us in that fire.</span> <span id="s1573">The whole building was a movie house, and it was burning, the roof was burning.</span> <span id="s1574">So, at that point, we had to, they needed drivers, because we had to get cars.</span> <span id="s1575">So I said I want to become a driver.</span> <span id="s1576">And there in '44 I became a driver for the fire department.</span> <span id="s1577">And I was a driver for two years.</span> <span id="s1578">It was a little easier, because as a driver, almost two years, it was easier because you could sleep at night, at least.</span> <span id="s1579">When you worked nights, you had to be rested as a driver.</span> <span id="s1580">The other ones they really don't care.</span> <span id="s1581">So I used to sleep.</span> <span id="s1582">Only when there was an alarm, then we had to get up and run.</span> <span id="s1583">So you be alert to drive a car.</span> <span id="s1584">And, then, came this exchange of--the orchestra was still--we still were playing music.</span> <span id="s1585">I mean, there was a musician Halm, a Max Halm, [phonetic], I know there were two brothers.</span> <span id="s1586">One was playing the saxophone, and one was playing the violin.</span> <span id="s1587">And this was a drummer, and I played the flute.</span> <span id="s1588">We had a nice little orchestra.</span> <span id="s1589">And we had a pianist, very good, he was a concert pianist, Wagner, his name was Wagner.</span> <span id="s1590">So, but he was no relation.</span> <span id="s1591">I met him here, I think, in Philadelphia, one time.</span> <span id="s1592">He came to look for me, years and years ago.</span> <span id="s1593">I don't know what happened to him now.</span> <span id="s1594">So, we were still doing that, and then came a kind of agreement between Romania and Russia, that all the ones who were born in Romania can be exchanged, get an authorization, you have to give up the citizen--the Russian citizenship, and go back to Romania.</span> <span id="s1595">Now, somehow, my parents were, I don't know what they did, by bribing or whatever, they get papers that they are from Poland.</span> <span id="s1596">And there was also an exchange from Russia to Poland.</span> <span id="s1597">So they went to Poland, and I went to Romania.</span> <span id="s1598">And, it probably had to do also with my sister, my oldest sister, had a husband who was from Poland.</span> <span id="s1599">So he somehow connected the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1600">But that's not really important.</span> <span id="s1601">And then they came out of there, and Poland was at that point, in '44, I think it was, a kind of antisemitic thing there going on...</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">JF: They went to Poland in 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">AF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">JF: And you were still, at that point...</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">AF: Yes, I was going at that point to, in '46, to Romania.</span> <span id="s1606">They came in '44 back, and they left in '45, actually.</span> <span id="s1607">And I left a few months later.</span> <span id="s1608">Like they left end of ‘45, and I left beginning of '46.</span> <span id="s1609">So they then, from Poland, being that it was some pogroms there, and this, they went to Austria.</span> <span id="s1610">And they were in Austria in a DP camp until they came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">JF: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">AF: And I went to Romania, and I was still 13 years in Romania because they wouldn't let me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">JF: Where were you in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">AF: In TimiÕoar--TimiÕoara.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">JF: Can you spell that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">AF: T-I-M-I-Ô-0-A-R-A.</span> <span id="s1617">And do you remember I told you, at first, an episode of my father's cousin who came back from Chile to Romania, and then they went through the hell, and then they went back?</span> <span id="s1618">Now, one of their sons was in Russia.</span> <span id="s1619">So he came back to Czernowitz, and from Czernowitz he went to Romania, his parents used to live in Timi?oara, and this is why I went, to Timi?oara.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">JF: You elected to go there, to that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1622">Because his parents were living there.</span> <span id="s1623">We didn't have anybody in Romania, because when he came back, he was completely--you could see lice running over his--So my father took him, took all his clothes, dropped it into fire, burned it up, shaved everything off of him, gave him a whole good bath, and put new clothes on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">JF: So you and the cousin went together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1626">He was a part, and there was another cousin, we were together.</span> <span id="s1627">I wasn't alone there.</span> <span id="s1628">I stayed with this cousin because he was a dentist, and I used to, after the war, I started working.</span> <span id="s1629">Besides being a fireman, I worked in dentistry with him, a dental mechanic.</span> <span id="s1630">And this is the reason why my parents would accept for me to stay, because I was with him very close because he was a doctor in dentistry, and I was working with him together.</span> <span id="s1631">And then, when we came to Romania, we had this cousin also, the one what came from Russia what has his parents in Timi?oara, who were waiting for him to leave to go to South America, because he was, they were already here after concentration camp, and the son wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">JF: So you left for Timi?oara in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1634">And there I stayed until '51, and registered to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1635">I didn't know about my parents, where they were or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">JF: You had no idea where your parents were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">AF: No.</span> <span id="s1638">In ‘49, after three years, they found me.</span> <span id="s1639">They were in Austria.</span> <span id="s1640">They were in Salzburg.</span> <span id="s1641">And they found me somehow, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1642">And they started to send me gifts and money to be able to survive, because I was just like ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">JF: What kind of work were you doing in Timi?oara?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">AF: Dentistry.</span> <span id="s1645">And now, I also, at that point, in Timi?oara, I started to go to a college there, to learn to become a dentist.</span> <span id="s1646">I didn't need, to become a dentist you didn't need to go four years to school.</span> <span id="s1647">I told you the difference between a dentist and a doctor.</span> <span id="s1648">So after one year, I got approval that I can become a dentist, if I work under a doctor.</span> <span id="s1649">Like, the way I was at first when I learned the profession.</span> <span id="s1650">So you had to have only a name there that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Tape 4, side 1:</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">JF: This is tape 4, side 1, of an interview with Mr. Ari Fuhrman, on October 26, 1981, with Josey Fisher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">AF: So, here I was a dentist, and I was ready to leave for Israel.</span> <span id="s1654">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">JF: You finished then your training as a dentist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1657">I was working with him as a dental mechanic.</span> <span id="s1658">Meanwhile, I went to this course for dentistry in the college, in Timi?oara there, and I became a dentist, with the right to work only for the next eight years, to work only in villages, under a dentist.</span> <span id="s1659">So, this is what I used to do.</span> <span id="s1660">I used to travel, I had three little villages, and bring back work, and then make the work, and go back.</span> <span id="s1661">We were partners, how to say, he used to get 60%, and I used to get 40%.</span> <span id="s1662">Anyway, but that's not important.</span> <span id="s1663">But then, what the nice thing about it, that I developed a method of making artificial eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">JF: How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">AF: Dentistry had the same materials.</span> <span id="s1666">Dentistry had materials what are used in making artificial eyes.</span> <span id="s1667">So, by coincidence, somebody had broken an eye, a glass eye, and gave me these pieces to glue together and fix it up.</span> <span id="s1668">So that was my first eye.</span> <span id="s1669">I took dental material, white material, and embedded the glass color into that, and that was my first eye.</span> <span id="s1670">And then later on, I developed, you know that is what I do now here, most of my time is devoted to artificial eye making.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">JF: This was still in Timi?oara, when you did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1673">In the same time, in '46, I was registered to go to Israel, it was Palestine yet, it wasn't Israel, and I became a member of the Zionist organization, Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s1674">And it became actually, I couldn’t be Hashomer Hatzair it was Mishmar, it's an organization.</span> <span id="s1675">The adults of Hashomer Hatzair were Mishmar.</span> <span id="s1676">And, I was very active there, how, because I became an amateur of Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s1677">All of a sudden it burst out somehow.</span> <span id="s1678">I don't know why, because before that, I had very little besides music, and being that I had the background of music and I was writing music for that group, and I became to act, I became one of the leaders here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">JF: This is in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">AF: That was in '46, '47, '48, '49, around that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">JF: As soon as you got back into Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">AF: Yeah, to Timi?oara.</span> <span id="s1683">I met a few friends there who we started to talk about it, at the organization.</span> <span id="s1684">The first thing what I really did there, I formed a choir.</span> <span id="s1685">I had that background.</span> <span id="s1686">I formed a choir in the organization, and we used to make concerts for the people from the Mishmar.</span> <span id="s1687">And then slowly from that, we started to make skits and musical parts and this, and then we became a kind of amateur theater, and we used to play in big theaters, really.</span> <span id="s1688">Twice we played even in the opera hall.</span> <span id="s1689">I was leading.</span> <span id="s1690">Funny enough.</span> <span id="s1691">I had about one, two, three, and I was with the flute, and leading.</span> <span id="s1692">I had about a five piece orchestra there, I used to like come down, lead the orchestra, and after I do this, then I had to go through the thing and come up there to perform.</span> <span id="s1693">And when it was really important, then again, I went down, because these people didn't know too good Yiddish to really know when to start.</span> <span id="s1694">They were Jewish, but they were Hungarian Jews, and Hungarian Jews again, they were just so assimilated with, Hungarian was for them tops.</span> <span id="s1695">Other things wasn't important.</span> <span id="s1696">Just like the Romanian Jews in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1697">They knew very little.</span> <span id="s1698">Some knew, but basically everybody tried to get assimilated.</span> <span id="s1699">Same was with the Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1700">The same is here with American Jews.</span> <span id="s1701">More and more, less and less--More and more get assimilated and less and less know Yiddish, and you lose that, and you become just like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1702">You become not a Jew anymore at a certain point.</span> <span id="s1703">It seems very similar to what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s1704">They were thinking that they are first Germans, and then Jews.</span> <span id="s1705">And then Hitler came and told them, wait a minute, it's not so.</span> <span id="s1706">It's just the opposite.</span> <span id="s1707">And I'm repeating myself, I think what everybody knows, but it's worthwhile to repeat that it was enough that you were Jewish, even those who had become non-Jews have gone over to, Hitler fished out that his grand-grand-grandfather was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1708">He wasn't not any more clean enough for the race, for the clean German race.</span> <span id="s1709">So, it was not enough, you cannot hide.</span> <span id="s1710">If you are born that way, sooner or later he got you.</span> <span id="s1711">So if somebody thinks that by just getting over to another religion will really help him get assimilated, that they will not know and change even the name, change whatever, you have always that thing that you are a Jew, and they will always find out.</span> <span id="s1712">Somebody thinks otherwise, he is probably not smart enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">JF: During this time, then, you were on the list to emigrate to I--to Palestine?</span> <span id="s1714">You had your name on the list early?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">AF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1716">Until '48, when Israel was formed, '48 it was, I think, emigration was clandestine, and at that point, Romania was yet like shaky, you didn’t really know what direction they were going to go.</span> <span id="s1717">You knew more or less, but it was not established everything.</span> <span id="s1718">There was not declared any independence or whatever, it was nothing yet.</span> <span id="s1719">So you could still emigrate through a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1720">At that point, everybody was registered.</span> <span id="s1721">My lot was that being, the same story, I was a useful Jew now at this situation, because we had these shows going on, and I was leading the choir and this, so they had time for me; first, let's send the other ones.</span> <span id="s1722">And as a matter of fact, I don't know if you remember, I think you do, when I had told you when we were going up the side in the dirt by the Dneister, and I picked up one of these little things with a baby and tried--this cousin was also a part of our group.</span> <span id="s1723">His name is Itzak.</span> <span id="s1724">He lives in Israel as a matter of fact, due to the fact that he was a member of this Zionist organization, the Mishmar, and he was lucky enough to be on a list to emigrate to Israel before anybody else.</span> <span id="s1725">And he really was, in the first years, even before Israel was established, he was already in Israel.</span> <span id="s1726">So he had even the choice being there, to go to Israel, and he was lucky.</span> <span id="s1727">Other ones were not.</span> <span id="s1728">So later on, he had to register at the police.</span> <span id="s1729">This was already a completely different situation, because here he was sent by the Zionist organization, and they would send you the way they felt when they had the possibility to do.</span> <span id="s1730">But now, when you were registered at the police, you had to register who you are, what you are, what you are doing, and so on.</span> <span id="s1731">And here came my misfortune.</span> <span id="s1732">I mean, it was fortunate and unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1733">I was a dentist, and also eye maker, and at this point, when you registered, you had to give your profession.</span> <span id="s1734">And they pointed out, professionals they wouldn't let go.</span> <span id="s1735">So, at a certain point, I had to give up dentistry and everything else, and I started to work in a hat factory.</span> <span id="s1736">At a work I have never known, or never--what did I do there?</span> <span id="s1737">I think it's unbelievable what you do for a certain belief that you want to do something.</span> <span id="s1738">I was--hats are made out of wool.</span> <span id="s1739">Now, when you make that wool, when you form the wool, it has impurities.</span> <span id="s1740">Those impurities are threads of cotton.</span> <span id="s1741">And cotton should not be in the wool, to have a good hat, to have a good quality hat.</span> <span id="s1742">So, how do you take out those little threads what are in?</span> <span id="s1743">You put it in sulfuric acid, to burn.</span> <span id="s1744">It will not burn, I think it's sulfuric acid, OK, but anyway, a kind of acid what burns out the cotton, but doesn't burn the wool.</span> <span id="s1745">So they have big buckets, not buckets, how you call, as big as this table here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">JF: Like a vat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">AF: Yes, big.</span> <span id="s1748">And they were in a certain percentage, I think about 4% concentration of that acid with water mixed, and they would stay there for so many hours, until that burns out, and then you had to put it on a centrifuge to draw out the water.</span> <span id="s1749">And here I found myself again like in a concentration camp that you do this kind of dirty work.</span> <span id="s1750">Like you would take after, first of all, you couldn't work with your hands, because it burns your hands, so we worked with gloves.</span> <span id="s1751">But the gloves were so unconvenient to work with, you couldn't work--they were heavy and this.</span> <span id="s1752">So you had to burn your hands.</span> <span id="s1753">I was working with the hands free, and then putting them in this centrifuge, a lot of hats.</span> <span id="s1754">You had to know how to, just like a washing machine, you know, what spins, you had to really know how to rinse so it wouldn't start shaking the whole room.</span> <span id="s1755">And after that was spinning, can you imagine what kind of air, and the air was full of vapors of this acid.</span> <span id="s1756">And at the point when that was really spinning strong, we had to go out, there were two of us, had to go out there and wait until this settles, and then go in, start the machine, and run out again until the vapor will be pulled out by the fan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">JF: How long were you doing this kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">AF: I think I was there about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">JF: This is in 19... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">AF: That was let's say in 1948.</span> <span id="s1761">Till '48 I was there, and then, it was after ‘48.</span> <span id="s1762">It was when the Zionists could not, it was already Israel, and in '48 they declared independence of Romania, I think, the 23rd of August, I think, was, or 30th of December, something.</span> <span id="s1763">I can't remember the date.</span> <span id="s1764">I think when it became a republic, Romania became a republic, a socialist, kind of socialist republic, whatever.</span> <span id="s1765">And then, everything was already taken on.</span> <span id="s1766">Until then, you couldn't even go away without--if you were smart enough, or knew your way, you could have just come to, I saw a lot of people, a lot of actors, big actors, pass by our town.</span> <span id="s1767">You were still able to go to Hungary, and then from Hungary to Austria, and just go away.</span> <span id="s1768">Like a big Mansdorf, [phonetic], a big actor, I remember, passed by Romania.</span> <span id="s1769">A lot of them passed by, but him I remember because he gave a play.</span> <span id="s1770">He played in a play.</span> <span id="s1771">It was I Live, Ich leb, and he was, I remember there, in the town, he played, and we seen this show at that point.</span> <span id="s1772">So, then, you couldn't go, just walk over there, because it was borders already established and everything.</span> <span id="s1773">It was hard.</span> <span id="s1774">So you went here.</span> <span id="s1775">And when I registered there, and they found out, like I said, so they wouldn't let me go.</span> <span id="s1776">And how did I know?</span> <span id="s1777">Because like, we registered the whole group, the whole theater group registered.</span> <span id="s1778">We were very close, all of us.</span> <span id="s1779">We registered in the same time, the choir, and the group and everything.</span> <span id="s1780">Like, I was in the middle of two of my friends.</span> <span id="s1781">The top and the bottom went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1782">They got approval to got out.</span> <span id="s1783">And I was not, you know?</span> <span id="s1784">So, I knew something is wrong, and then I understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s1785">But this didn't help me too much, because for the next three years, until '51, I still could not get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">JF: And you were working in this hat factory all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1788">I worked in the factory.</span> <span id="s1789">In the same time I was working also in dentistry, but clandestine.</span> <span id="s1790">And also in eye making, also clandestine, because officially nobody should know.</span> <span id="s1791">I worked with this cousin of mine, and I had to work also hoping that I would be getting out.</span> <span id="s1792">But then, seeing that I could not get out, and my cousin moved to Bucharest, so I decided to become an actor in the Yiddish theater.</span> <span id="s1793">They were after me already a long time, in the Bucharest State Theater.</span> <span id="s1794">So, one day, they visited the theater, they visited our town, they had a play there, and so I approached the chief, the director of the theater, the manager, actually.</span> <span id="s1795">The director means the manager, and Regisseur means the one who directs the show.</span> <span id="s1796">It was another word we used.</span> <span id="s1797">And he was the manager, the leader of the theater, and I told him I was willing to come, and he said, “Why not?</span> <span id="s1798">Oh come on.”</span> <span id="s1799">So I went to Bucharest and gave an exam for the theater, and became a member of the State Theater.</span> <span id="s1800">They gave me immediately a house to stay, but my aim was still, even in Bucharest, I thought maybe I'll be able easier to get out.</span> <span id="s1801">So when I registered, I was a few years there, I tried to register first, nobody knew, but then they found out when there was registration.</span> <span id="s1802">That was already after I was 12 years haven’t seen my parents or sisters.</span> <span id="s1803">They had again a registration, and I registered.</span> <span id="s1804">At that point, all of us who registered then had to quit the theater.</span> <span id="s1805">They said, “You cannot be with us if you want to leave.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">JF: Can you tell me a little bit about what the theater was like at that point in Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">AF: You know, we were very fortunate in a regime who is paying for everything, and it costs you nothing.</span> <span id="s1808">In other words, the theater is supported 100% by the government.</span> <span id="s1809">It's a, how to say, propaganda instrument.</span> <span id="s1810">In other words, to show the world that it's really better here than anywhere else, like in the other satellites, the other Communist countries, and people come, it is really so now better than in my time, let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s1811">But, there was never a question of getting costumes or plays or scenery or whatever.</span> <span id="s1812">You are a State Theater, you get your salary, as big or small it is, you couldn't live on it at that time.</span> <span id="s1813">I still used to work dentistry and in eye-making, but this was like a cover for my other activities, because I could not work officially there.</span> <span id="s1814">I didn't want them to even know about it.</span> <span id="s1815">So, I used to work nights.</span> <span id="s1816">I used to have a little room upstairs where I used to get in and do the work.</span> <span id="s1817">Then, in 1948, I think it was, I registered there again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">JF: 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">AF: ‘58, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">JF: What kind of plays were you putting on during those years?</span> <span id="s1821">A different kind of repertoire before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">AF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1823">It was similar to what I told you before, about the Russians.</span> <span id="s1824">OK, the Russians later on, everything was like in Russia, the theater was closed, and Mikhoels was killed, and the whole thing what was going on, I don't want to make a history of what was going on in Russia.</span> <span id="s1825">You know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1826">And writers, the Yiddish writers, I mean, it was just ridiculous what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1827">The plays were similar to those from the ‘40s.</span> <span id="s1828">They had modern translations, they had from folklore, we had from classics, not only Yiddish classics, not only Jewish classics.</span> <span id="s1829">We had Gogol, we had modern writers now, we had Yiddish, Jewish writers now, after we had a guy, we had two plays about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1830">One was about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1831">They showed the broad of the whole horror what was going on in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1832">And this guy who wrote it was actually a survivor of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1833">All kinds, I mean, they used to bring in, even now I think, from Poland there used to come a director to direct some plays, like from Romanian repertoire they had translations.</span> <span id="s1834">The thing is, the audience became less and less an amount, and now, for example, the theater is still there, it’s supported by the government.</span> <span id="s1835">It’s still some colleagues there what I visit occasionally.</span> <span id="s1836">The thing is, what they really have different from other places is what they have it like in the UN.</span> <span id="s1837">They have it like you can hear the play Yiddish from stage, and translated into Romanian in an earphone, earset.</span> <span id="s1838">You have certain chairs, certain rows have that set, and you can get it.</span> <span id="s1839">When you walk into the theater and you want that, I don't know if you pay, I don't think that you even pay for it.</span> <span id="s1840">Maybe a few pennies.</span> <span id="s1841">But you use it, you hear there is an actor who knows Romanian very good, they are in a certain booth, and while the thing is progressing, he is translating it simultaneously into Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">JF: How big was this troop that you were working with in the '50s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">AF: Ah, that was a tremendous, I mean, it was really, I have somewhere a picture of it in a magazine what appeared years much later, where I am in one picture where I seen myself.</span> <span id="s1844">I think at that point, actors only and musicians, and this was very big, about 40, 50 people, besides backstage people and all kinds, there was a whole administration of the theater.</span> <span id="s1845">I think now it's a little less, because not many left, and it's not so easy to get somebody in now, because there is very little audience left.</span> <span id="s1846">The only audience they have is a few there what are still coming, and then mainly it is the tourists what come from the United States or from Israel, and they convince them to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">JF: At the time, what kind of audiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">AF: At the time rose was blooming.</span> <span id="s1849">I mean, we used to make tours of two, three months all over Romania.</span> <span id="s1850">And I remember the first time there, it was in ‘51, the first few months when I came to Bucharest, and that was a tour, a very long tour.</span> <span id="s1851">We were in little and big towns like, but later on this became lesser and lesser amount of Jews, because they were leaving, more and more, and the tours what they have now, I understand, are very short, because there are only big hamlets where they go now, big towns where they have bigger amount of people.</span> <span id="s1852">And, that's about it, how it looks now.</span> <span id="s1853">Of course, they still have, you come into the theater and see sitting 20 people to watch a show is really heartbreaking.</span> <span id="s1854">But still the Romanian government somehow keeps it up, and like I say, it's to show the world that they have something else that anybody else has.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">JF: How was it living in Romania during those years, other than the theater itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">AF: Living, for me, you see, the differences between me and somebody else is that I had the possibility to make an extra buck, as they say here, because I had all those other things what I was doing.</span> <span id="s1857">I am always like that, but at that time, I really did many things, and I was better off than other people.</span> <span id="s1858">Everybody was envious and this, but, you know how it is.</span> <span id="s1859">You make the best of it in a way, until finally, after 13 years, I got my approval.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">JF: That was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">AF: In '59.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">JF: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">AF: In '59 I went to, you see, there, at that time, it was no good to have family in the United States.</span> <span id="s1864">It was still the other leader, not Ceauçescu, it was still Gheorghiu-Dej, his name, and he was like a Stalinist type.</span> <span id="s1865">I think so.</span> <span id="s1866">And it was not kosher to have relatives, in Israel, yes, but not in the United States.</span> <span id="s1867">And I used to get my letters from my parents and sister who lived already here for many years.</span> <span id="s1868">I used to get them through Israel.</span> <span id="s1869">We were corresponding, they were writing to Israel, and I was getting it.</span> <span id="s1870">So everybody there knew I have parents and a sister in Israel.</span> <span id="s1871">So when I was--there, when I went out, I had to send everything to Israel.</span> <span id="s1872">So I went from there to Israel, and then was waiting for me already an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1873">And I was there for a year something, until everything was cleared.</span> <span id="s1874">In Israel, I think, I was a year and three, four months, and then I came to the United States in 1960.</span> <span id="s1875">There, when I came to Israel, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1876">Until I really started to work on my field, because now I already started to work only on eyes, artificial eyes, and nothing anymore in dentistry.</span> <span id="s1877">And, I have started to work in the theater, the first, to make the first money was made in the theater, until I prepared myself for my artificial eyes.</span> <span id="s1878">So I went, this theater was called the Theater of the Newcomers, Teatron Ha-olim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">JF: This was in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">AF: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">JF: In what town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">AF: Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1883">Everything was in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1884">There, if you go on a tour, you are back, you come always back to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1885">It wasn't Tel Aviv, it was Bat Yam, but that's actually a part of Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1886">But we were going from Tel Aviv every day.</span> <span id="s1887">And I was always the last, I was in the maabara, [temporary immigrant camp in Israel] you know, one of these pre-settling things, until I got a bigger place.</span> <span id="s1888">I mean, a place, not a bigger place, a place to begin with.</span> <span id="s1889">So, then I played the theater, and then I came to the United States, and then, like I said, you probably have the rest...</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">JF: You married your wife here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">AF: Yes.</span> <span id="s1892">And we seen there was no theater; she came here after a tour, and no theater, so we started, she gave you already probably the background of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">JF: You can tell me a little bit about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">AF: It was very, you've seen there was nothing going on with Yiddish theater in Philadelphia, especially at that period.</span> <span id="s1895">Even now there is nothing besides us.</span> <span id="s1896">We organized this group with my cousin, and the pianist, and then we slowly, slowly built up a reputation, and now people know us and call us, and it's just like a side job, how to say, of spreading actually culture.</span> <span id="s1897">The main aim is the old generation to remind in the new generation, to introduce to our heritage of Yiddish culture in theater.</span> <span id="s1898">This is more or less-- There are so many things what can be spoken about, discussed, reminiscing, but I think I have....</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">JF: Mr. Fuhrman, I thank you very much for all you have told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">AF: Thank you, and I hope you'll send me a tape.</span></p></body></html>
