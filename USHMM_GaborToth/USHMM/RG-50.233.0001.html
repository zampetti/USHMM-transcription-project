by -- if you can tell me your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s6">My name is Miru Alcana.</span> <span id="s7">I was born in the island of Rhodes in 1915 and I was deported in 1944, July 23, 1944.</span> <span id="s8">From Rhodes, we spent three days in one building and after they took us to different couple of boats to take us to Pireo and from Pireo we went to Athens.</span> <span id="s9">In Athens was a camp of concentration and the name was Haidari.</span> <span id="s10">We spent over there three days in Haidari and three of our family, relative, they pass away because was thirsty and they couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s11">The name of this people who pass away was Moselton Hasson, is cousin of my mother.</span> <span id="s12">Also Allegra Buroff and her mother.</span> <span id="s13">I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s14">After three days we was in Athens, in Haidari, they put us in wagon like animals with no water, no food.</span> <span id="s15">Only they put some bread, very, very hard.</span> <span id="s16">They put boxes of little onion, white onions.</span> <span id="s17">Also boxes of honey and also something else.</span> <span id="s18">We couldn’t eat because the bread was very hard, we can’t chew and besides that no water; how can we eat the honey?</span> <span id="s19">How can we eat the onions without water?</span> <span id="s20">How we would dump the bread with no water?</span> <span id="s21">So we arrive in Auschwitz after three weeks, traveling through the night.</span> <span id="s22">Daytime we was hiding different places but we didn’t know where it was.</span> <span id="s23">Finally we arrive in Auschwitz but during the trip, three men, they pass away in Serbia.</span> <span id="s24">One was Rahamim Galanti, another Alchadef, Yomtov and the other was Yehuda Notrica.</span> <span id="s25">Those three mens, they died because they was thirsty.</span> <span id="s26">Without water, they couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s27">Finally we arrive Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s28">In Auschwitz, they separated from our parents.</span> <span id="s29">They told us we would see every night but you young people, you will go to work.</span> <span id="s30">Then every night, you will meet your parents.</span> <span id="s31">So -- was not like that.</span> <span id="s32">The only thing, when we arrive, they choose us for work and they put us in line.</span> <span id="s33">In the meantime, we was hungry and thirsty and finally we smelled the meat.</span> <span id="s34">Smelled the meat and we said I hope those SS they should choke because they having barbecue, They having broiled steak with music but we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s35">The only thing the other people, the French people who was in line with us, they said, when did you arrive?</span> <span id="s36">We say a few hours ago.</span> <span id="s37">So there are your parents, are cremated.</span> <span id="s38">Cremated, what mean?</span> <span id="s39">We don’t know that word, cremated.</span> <span id="s40">In our country, we never heard that.</span> <span id="s41">They say those people who doesn’t -- that are not too strong to work, they put in the ovens.</span> <span id="s42">You can imagine how we feel to hear that.</span> <span id="s43">To smell they are burning our parents with the music.</span> <span id="s44">Because not to hear the screaming.</span> <span id="s45">We start to cry, screaming, nothing we can do.</span> <span id="s46">After they start to count and they send us to take shower.</span> <span id="s47">After they put in our block, in every -- number 20 the first time.</span> <span id="s48">Four o’clock or before, they start to call “sel appel, sel appel” That means they have to count.</span> <span id="s49">That is the story of Auschwitz and our life.</span> <span id="s50">I don’t know what to say else.</span> <span id="s51">The only thing when we was working, they choose us to work in the factory.</span> <span id="s52">I was working in gleeov but I don’t know how to explain what means gleeov.</span> <span id="s53">The only thing was big trunk to put pieces of material to make machine gun; to some electricity to make very, very hard.</span> <span id="s54">Just like in one little room where there are 500 kilowatts for twenty minutes.</span> <span id="s55">Then after, we have to take out and bring to the other girls to work.</span> <span id="s56">Then put the other box over there.</span> <span id="s57">That was all the work in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s58">In the meantime, we didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s59">On Sunday, “kein arbeit kein brot”.</span> <span id="s60">They don’t give us anything to eat.</span> <span id="s61">But every 12 hours, we was working.</span> <span id="s62">They used to give a little soup and one tiny piece of bread.</span> <span id="s63">We have to keep for the next day to work.</span> <span id="s64">In the meantime, there was people who they steal your bread and nothing you can talk because we couldn’t talk German and we can’t defend ourselves in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s65">Really, we have very, very hard life.</span> <span id="s66">That is the history of our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Can you tell me what you remember about when the war first broke out?</span> <span id="s68">Do you have any recollections about what was happening at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: When I was working?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Yeah, what were you doing then when you first heard that the war had broken out?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: In Auschwitz I used to go to bring bricks or – in Auschwitz also the barracks, the food for us.</span> <span id="s72">But in Auschwitz we have bitter experience.</span> <span id="s73">We used to accept three slice of tiny bread to buy a panty, a brief, a panty.</span> <span id="s74">When we washed and we was waiting for a little bit sun.</span> <span id="s75">Sun, we never saw in Auschwitz and we tried to put -- to be in the air.</span> <span id="s76">The Polish, the grabbed the panty and they go to the blockkova to say, look the Italian, they stole my panty.</span> <span id="s77">Was not true, we can’t talk and then the blockkova came.</span> <span id="s78">They punish us and they beat us without no reason because we didn’t know the language.</span> <span id="s79">We didn’t know Yiddish and we suffered worst than the Hitler.</span> <span id="s80">In Germany when I was in Buchenwald, working in the factory, I used to help the other girls.</span> <span id="s81">Because they couldn’t do their own job so when I have 20 minutes to rest until the trunk was in the oven; so I used to help some girls to do their own job.</span> <span id="s82">I tried to save the girls.</span> <span id="s83">Otherwise, they will be killed, they will be cremated.</span> <span id="s84">So thank God, they are alive.</span> <span id="s85">When I was liberated in Theresienstadt I went to Prague.</span> <span id="s86">From Prague, I took the train.</span> <span id="s87">I went to Budapest to look for medicines for the girls because they have dysentery.</span> <span id="s88">They gave me but before I had problem with -- in the office because they don’t want to give me anything.</span> <span id="s89">They say bring your sister here and we will help.</span> <span id="s90">I say they are in the hospital.</span> <span id="s91">The Russian, they don’t have nothing to help them.</span> <span id="s92">I saved them and I want to take home back with me.</span> <span id="s93">I spoke with the manager and I say, listen, I came from Prague.</span> <span id="s94">I spent three nights and two days and a half in the trains.</span> <span id="s95">Now I need help from you.</span> <span id="s96">I want to save my sister.</span> <span id="s97">I say here is my names.</span> <span id="s98">My name is Miru Alcana and they say, what is this.</span> <span id="s99">Deanna Galanti, the other.</span> <span id="s100">I say they are my sister, my father passed away, my mother got married.</span> <span id="s101">So they are Galanti, the other sister, half-sisters.</span> <span id="s102">Finally they gave me medicine and also gave me 1,200 merango (130) for each one.</span> <span id="s103">I came back to Prague, not to Prague.</span> <span id="s104">I find they was in Rattot.</span> <span id="s105">I came back.</span> <span id="s106">I looked where the Rattot to see where is the camp to meet them again.</span> <span id="s107">Finally I have hard time.</span> <span id="s108">I don’t know how many kilometers I walk and finally we was together until we came back to Bologna, Italy altogether.</span> <span id="s109">I accomplished something in my life.</span> <span id="s110">They recognized what I did for them and we are in touch with them.</span> <span id="s111">They call me often, one, she live in Vancouver, Washington.</span> <span id="s112">The other live in Miami.</span> <span id="s113">The other live between -- the other sister she live between Switzerland and France.</span> <span id="s114">But when they come to see the sister, we meet each other.</span> <span id="s115">What else?</span> <span id="s116">Another girl, she live in Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s117">She write me and once in a while, she send something, present.</span> <span id="s118">At least they recognize what I did for them.</span> <span id="s119">I’m satisfied, not what they send me but at least they recognize and they never forget of me.</span> <span id="s120">That is all my life.</span> <span id="s121">Maybe I got something else but right now I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s122">Don’t forget, I’m old lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Let’s go back now to before you went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: At the very beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s126">You can tell me what you remember about that time and what you were doing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: In that time, I was at the hospital study to be midwife but I couldn’t because with the situation of the Jews.</span> <span id="s128">They were not allowed to continue to study so I was nurse.</span> <span id="s129">Nurse, I used to do shots for so many people and I used to do tests of the urine for diabetes and albumin.</span> <span id="s130">Also I had store one of the best of Rhodes.</span> <span id="s131">Perfumeria Rosa di Rodi they used to call.</span> <span id="s132">Was a store of classic perfume.</span> <span id="s133">For many years, I was very pleased to manage that store But until the Germans -- first of all, when I was -- before that I was working with the government, the manu foreste.</span> <span id="s134">But I couldn’t work over there, they say, because I was Jewish so I lost the job.</span> <span id="s135">After I went to work in that store where they sell the perfumery.</span> <span id="s136">From there I used to go to the hospital to finish the course.</span> <span id="s137">In the meantime, I used to make good money for the shots I used to give to people.</span> <span id="s138">Also with --.</span> <span id="s139">I used to make good money.</span> <span id="s140">One of the best worker or salelady or employee you can tell was myself because I used to make good, good, good money.</span> <span id="s141">After we start with the problem of the Germans so until we finish to be in the hands of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s142">Now when I hear still the Nazis is growing up, really I’m getting nervous.</span> <span id="s143">I’m sick.</span> <span id="s144">But nothing you can do.</span> <span id="s145">People, they are cruel, people they don’t know what they want.</span> <span id="s146">It is just that they are envy and mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Sharon told me that before the war, you were involved in Ort, O-R-T?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: I wrote down O-R-T.</span> <span id="s150">ORT.</span> <span id="s151">Is that -- she said before the war, can you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I don’t remember what you --.</span> <span id="s153">Let me see.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Can you talk about that a little bit, into the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I hope she will change something.</span> <span id="s156">She will not copy everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s160">They’ll summarize.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Because so many things --.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: After -- did you open?</span> <span id="s164">After I came back from concentration camp, I used to work.</span> <span id="s165">I used to be in the Jewish community in Bologna, Via Gombruti Nove, nine.</span> <span id="s166">I used to help all those girls to cook and to be together because I thought it was my duty to help them because they was orphans, no parents.</span> <span id="s167">But I was also without parents but I tried to help them.</span> <span id="s168">In the meantime, I used to go to the hospital to see the people who came back from concentration camp was in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s169">I used to bring something to them every single day.</span> <span id="s170">I used to go to Instituto Rizzoli and also to Santa Orsoladi to hospital to help them.</span> <span id="s171">In the meantime, we used to have La Wizo like Hadassah over here, Wizo.</span> <span id="s172">We used to -- I was very active, I was member and I used to make cookies to have tea, to give tea and then to make money to send to Eretz Israel.</span> <span id="s173">Because Israel -- I was very Zionist in my country because my brother was president of the Macabee.</span> <span id="s174">My grandparents -- my grandfather died in Jerusalem; my grandmother, also.</span> <span id="s175">They were very, very Zionist.</span> <span id="s176">Also I continued to be Zionist and I was revisionist in my country in Rhodes.</span> <span id="s177">So when I was after the concentration camp, I used to be running from one place to the other to bring cassette, how do you say it?</span> <span id="s178">I used to go from one house to the other to bring the keren ami box, the blue box to receive some, to get some money to send to Eretz Israel.</span> <span id="s179">Also in this country, I do the same thing.</span> <span id="s180">Twice yearly, I have to bring the cassette, the boxes of -- the blue box to the Jewish Fund for Israel.</span> <span id="s181">I think for today, I don’t have else what to say.</span> <span id="s182">Maybe --.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Okay, let’s talk a little bit about what it was like to grow up in Rhodes.</span> <span id="s184">When you were a child --?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: In Rhodes?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Yeah, can you tell me like about -- like the neighborhood where you lived and what life was like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: The life in Rhodes was beautiful, beautiful.</span> <span id="s188">We had wonderful life.</span> <span id="s189">First of all, we went to school.</span> <span id="s190">Our parents they was very religious and they was --.</span> <span id="s191">They gave lots of advice.</span> <span id="s192">They teach us how to be human being, to be generous, to be unselfish.</span> <span id="s193">At the school, I used to do good work and after the school I used to work.</span> <span id="s194">After the school, I used to work.</span> <span id="s195">After I finish the school, I went to the hospital to learn midwife but unfortunately, like I will repeat, I didn’t have luck to finish because on account of the religion -- of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s196">From there I started to work, to make living, to help our parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Can you talk about what it was like at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: The school -- we used to have --.</span> <span id="s199">This school was Jewish school.</span> <span id="s200">We have part Italian, they have teachers in Italian, teacher in Hebrew and also teacher in French.</span> <span id="s201">But most important, the more classes we had, was Italian subject.</span> <span id="s202">Then French, and after Hebrew.</span> <span id="s203">Hebrew we have three times weekly for one hour.</span> <span id="s204">In fact when I go to Israel, I have no problem with my language because when I studied the dikduk in Hebrew, the only thing I learned with point.</span> <span id="s205">I didn’t learn without.</span> <span id="s206">But they teach us for little island of Rhodes, no matter how many they used to before teach the boys.</span> <span id="s207">The boys they used to send to the chabra or to college, Hebrew college, but the girls, they were not allowed.</span> <span id="s208">Only the boys they should.</span> <span id="s209">But later they start to teach us, the girls, three hours weekly.</span> <span id="s210">Was not so bad.</span> <span id="s211">At least we learned something.</span> <span id="s212">The most important what we learned, to respect the people, to respect our parents and to know the Ten Commandments, what is very, very important.</span> <span id="s213">At the school, they used to teach us Hebrew history and so we continue to keep that in our mind.</span> <span id="s214">No matter what we went through in our life, still we keep what we learn from our parents and from the school.</span> <span id="s215">That was wonderful experience in our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s217">As a child growing up, also, can you talk about what other sorts of things you did?</span> <span id="s218">Like did you learn any music or did you have any hobbies?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Not hobbies, no hobbies.</span> <span id="s220">The only thing is to study and to be --to work in the house, to help the parents.</span> <span id="s221">To my mother, to help in the family, in the house.</span> <span id="s222">But no hobby, only we had gymnastic, we have exercise with the school, you know, like boy scout.</span> <span id="s223">That is all, we didn’t have too much like over here.</span> <span id="s224">We was more conservative.</span> <span id="s225">We didn’t have too much liberty, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Can you describe what the neighborhood was like, what it looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Oh, wonderful neighborhood we have.</span> <span id="s228">Everyone very friendly like one family.</span> <span id="s229">No matter how many neighbors we have, everyone is just like family.</span> <span id="s230">.</span> <span id="s231">In fact, we used to say Auntie Rosa, Auntie Straya, Auntie Rebecca, but we didn’t know if they were relative or not.</span> <span id="s232">Because our parents they say, say hello to Auntie Rebecca or say hello to Auntie Rifka.</span> <span id="s233">To everyone we have to say Auntie.</span> <span id="s234">So for us all the neighbors was family.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So the neighborhood was all Jewish then, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes, everyone.</span> <span id="s237">We didn’t have no strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s239">Can you talk about your brothers and your sister some?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Can you talk about your brothers and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: My brother was good, good shoemaker.</span> <span id="s243">He make boots, boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Which brother are we --?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Josef, Josef.</span> <span id="s246">He -- very expensive.</span> <span id="s247">Also Nissim was mechanic.</span> <span id="s248">He used to work with engineer, Lanarie.</span> <span id="s249">Italian fellow.</span> <span id="s250">He was with him.</span> <span id="s251">My sister, Miriam, she had three children.</span> <span id="s252">Two girls and one boy, beautiful children, very smart.</span> <span id="s253">Unfortunately they weren’t in -- they was killed by the Nazis, they put in the ovens.</span> <span id="s254">My brother-in-law was wonderful, wonderful fellow.</span> <span id="s255">He respected everyone of us.</span> <span id="s256">Really we was in good harmony, the whole family.</span> <span id="s257">I had -- my father had another two brothers, another sister.</span> <span id="s258">The brothers was very, very wealthy.</span> <span id="s259">One, he had ten children, five boys and five girls.</span> <span id="s260">Everyone, they was married except two young boys.</span> <span id="s261">They escaped during the capitulation of Mussolini.</span> <span id="s262">He went with Abe Lindberg in Turkey and they are saved in Israel.</span> <span id="s263">But the others, the big family, everyone was killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s264">My aunt, wonderful, she had five children.</span> <span id="s265">The girl was married with one baby.</span> <span id="s266">My brother Nissim, he was married and he had little girl a year and a half.</span> <span id="s267">No one they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Just one more thing about growing up.</span> <span id="s269">Can you just -- what language did you speak, like at home?</span> <span id="s270">You’ve mentioned so many languages --.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yeah, but the most important is the Spanish, Ladino, you know, because it is my mother tongue -- lingua, language.</span> <span id="s272">Because in the house, we speak Spanish, Ladino.</span> <span id="s273">Also at this school, Italian and French.</span> <span id="s274">Hebrew we learn at this school and also Greek with some French and a little bit Turkish.</span> <span id="s275">We did -- milkman who is to bring us every day milk and yoghurt so we learned Turkish.</span> <span id="s276">The woman who come to help for the washing the clothes, she used to speak Turkish.</span> <span id="s277">You know, when you are young, is easy to catch the language.</span> <span id="s278">.</span> <span id="s279">But the most important what I talk is Italian, Ladino, and French.</span> <span id="s280">That is it -- I think is enough.</span> <span id="s281">And also now Hebrew, I can manage very good and Greek also.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: That’s a lot of languages.</span> <span id="s283">Can you talk about what it was like being a Greek Jew growing up --.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Very important, the best.</span> <span id="s285">No matter, after my experience traveling all over the world, I find out is no religion better than ours, the religion, the Jews because I used to live in Italy with the Italians.</span> <span id="s286">Wonderful, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s287">Very nice, I respect them but it is not like us.</span> <span id="s288">Now here with the Mexicans who hate the Jews and the Protestant, so many people who I met over here, when I find out how they are mean and they hate the Jews, I find out the best is ours.</span> <span id="s289">Because we don’t hate no one.</span> <span id="s290">Only we respect and so that is the most important.</span> <span id="s291">We try to help everyone with no interest but the other religion is just --.</span> <span id="s292">They do for interest.</span> <span id="s293">Otherwise they don’t do nothing for nothing.</span> <span id="s294">I respect my religion and I will die the way I am, this was the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Can you describe what it was like being Jewish when -- before the war though, in Rhodes?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: We was very religious.</span> <span id="s297">We used to light the candles on Shabbat and we never warm up on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s298">We didn’t open gas, we didn’t --.</span> <span id="s299">We had, we used to keep warm the food from Friday night for Saturday.</span> <span id="s300">We used to read, stay in the house.</span> <span id="s301">In the morning, they used to go to the temple.</span> <span id="s302">Then when they used to come, we had breakfast and lunchtime.</span> <span id="s303">They used to go in the morning tefilla; and lunch, they used to say the berakhot.</span> <span id="s304">Saturday, for instance, the Havdalah, every Saturday night, the Havdalah and when was Shabbat, we used to light the candle and say the Kiddush.</span> <span id="s305">But in our house, in every house in Rhodes, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s306">Four o’clock, 5 o’clock, no lights, no nothing.</span> <span id="s307">Everything was ready for Shabbat.</span> <span id="s308">We waited for the guys, the men who

whatever we say.</span> <span id="s358">When they came to the Jewish quarter, they say we have to bring the men; they have to come with the licenses of their job and then they have to work for us.</span> <span id="s359">Every night they will come back.</span> <span id="s360">So everyone they took the license of their job.</span> <span id="s361">They went there to that building and they didn’t came out.</span> <span id="s362">After three days they spoke out again.</span> <span id="s363">They came, they say, the womens and the children, they have to come -- they have to go to that

everything what we had and we gave it to them.</span> <span id="s372">So many people, they didn’t want to give the money so they put it in the bathroom and they flushed the waters.</span> <span id="s373">The building where we went was a commando, how you say, a building for the pilots, the officer, pilots, officers.</span> <span id="s374">You can imagine how many toilets they have.</span> <span id="s375">Everything was full of money, full of gold.</span> <span id="s376">From there, the Germans, they took everything what we had and they used to beat us if they don’t give whatever they had.</span> <span id="s377">After the, like I say, they put us in -- they gave the alarm and we start to walk to the port, you know, to the -- to take the boat.</span> <span id="s378">Like that they took us to Pireo, took three days or five days to take to Pireo.</span> <span id="s379">You can imagine, was the, the 23 of July; we arrived the August 16.</span> <span id="s380">The 12th was from

happened that you would be able to talk about that might stand out in your mind?</span> <span id="s392">Something that you -- things that maybe you saw that had a very strong impact?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: The only thing I saw the three women who pass away in Haidari.</span> <span id="s394">Really was a --.</span> <span id="s395">I saw the Nazis how they beat the big shots in Athens without they --.</span> <span id="s396">They call the mens downstairs, down from the building.</span> <span id="s397">Before they start to walk to the wagons, they have stones in the floor like point.</span> <span id="s398">Every time they took out the shoes and they led them to walk in the stones who was tall, how did you say?</span> <span id="s399">like pieces of stone, like marble,

of us?</span> <span id="s407">What will be when we will be in their hands?</span> <span id="s408">In fact what happened was like that.</span> <span id="s409">We suffered more from the Polish.</span> <span id="s410">The Jews, the women of Poland and from Hungarian.</span> <span id="s411">They used to beat us, they used to steal our blanket, they used to steal our clothes, our panty, our bread.</span> <span id="s412">Those people they do very hard to us.</span> <span id="s413">Even if they want to save their own life, but they shouldn’t do that what they did it to us.</span> <span id="s414">Then not only that, they steal and they should go to the blockova, the head of the block to say, the Italian they stole us.</span> <span id="s415">They stole this, the Italian, they do that, the Italian.</span> <span id="s416">We didn’t know the language, we didn’t know Yiddish, we didn’t know German.</span> <span id="s417">We didn’t know how to defend ourselves so that was very bad.</span> <span id="s418">In fact, one Magda, she get me one punch in my teeth and she broke four teeth to me.</span> <span id="s419">But I’m glad she died in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span

I was working; one lady, her name was Margot from Berlin.</span> <span id="s491">She moved where she was, she jumped in the river and she disappeared.</span> <span id="s492">The oberau _____ the chief of the soldiers, they say if she not coming back, ten of you, they will be killed.</span> <span id="s493">For one, ten.</span> <span id="s494">She pick up so many and one of us, Matilda Israel, was one with them.</span> <span id="s495">[More conversation with other person – not in English].</span> <span id="s496">That was very important.</span> <span id="s497">For 24 hours, we was trembling, shaking, what would be from us.</span> <span id="s498">Why they would kill them, the ten for one.</span> <span id="s499">Finally they put the reflectors, the lights, boats, airplanes, they find her.</span> <span id="s500">They brought and then they put in – on the floor and everyone, they have to step on her.</span> <span id="s501">They have to kick her.</span> <span id="s502">We have to do

I did it.</span> <span id="s518">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s519">Maybe she will change and she will put different way?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Oh, Sharon?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: You mean Sharon?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I say because when I start, for instance, my name is Miru and so, I was in the island of Rhodes and they pick me up from the Nazis and I spoke over here how many days I was in that building.</span> <span id="s524">But I should do before -- when I start in the beginning, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Well we went a little bit out of order because when you started, I didn’t want to interrupt you.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s527">Was not the

go over briefly the order in which things happened to make it easier so that --.</span> <span id="s531">You know what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Because when I start the beginning, I should tell about the building where we was for three days and before they called the mens and after the womens.</span> <span id="s533">We brought all the money, everything, we should start, step by step.</span> <span id="s534">I don’t know why I didn’t.</span> <span id="s535">The last time, I did it but today I don’t know what happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I should do.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: That’s partly my fault too.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s540">Because the beginning I should --.</span> <span id="s541">When I start to say I’m from the island of Rhodes, Greece now.</span> <span id="s542">In 194 _, since July, 1913, they called the Germans camp to the Jewish quarter and they ask the men they should come with their license to be present in that building.</span> <span id="s543">That building was the headquarter of the pilots, the officer, the aviation.</span> <span id="s544">I should do that before.</span> <span id="s545">Then the men they went there for three days.</span> <span id="s546">After three days, they start to ask all the women and the children, they should come too and to bring all the possession they had, the silver, the money, the gold to bring in together.</span> <span id="s547">Then they would stay all day long there, they would stay long in -- they would be in one building, in one village.</span> <span id="s548">Your money, you will support yourselves.</span> <span id="s549">I should start like this.</span> <span id="s550">From there they took us after three days, they gave the alarm and we went to walking like a caravan like you see in the movie, they walking with all the belonging together like blankets, pillows, all the clothes, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s551">Luggage, together and we went to the boat and after five days we arrive in Pireo and from Pireo they took us to Athens where the camp was there waiting for the train, for the wagons.</span> <span id="s552">We stayed in that place, that camp they call Haidari.</span> <span id="s553">We stayed three days there in the Haidari and after they put us in the wagons.</span> <span id="s554">In the wagons, during the three days in Athens, three women they pass away because they was thirsty.</span> <span id="s555">After we went to in the wagons.</span> <span id="s556">When we reach in Serbia, three mens pass away.</span> <span id="s557">Manos S______.</span> <span id="s558">The three men pass away because was thirsty and they died.</span> <span id="s559">They throw in one hole over there.</span> <span id="s560">After we start -- they hided us for many days.</span> <span id="s561">During the day, we was hiding.</span> <span id="s562">At night time, we was in the train walking.</span> <span id="s563">We didn’t know what was the destiny of us.</span> <span id="s564">Finally we arrive in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s565">Auschwitz was the end of the life of our parents.</span> <span id="s566">I should start like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s568">So now you did.</span> <span id="s569">Your brothers and sisters as well, were they with you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes, in the train we was with all my family; my father, my mother.</span> <span id="s571">My father, he used to read the perck, not the perck, the -- some part of the tehillin (psalms).</span> <span id="s572">He used to read continuously, continuously, continuously until we arrived.</span> <span id="s573">My mother, she was sitting there.</span> <span id="s574">We didn’t have room to move.</span> <span id="s575">We didn’t have no toilets.</span> <span id="s576">We didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s577">My brothers, my sister, my brother-in-law, even we want to make our necessity and we say, turn your face.</span> <span id="s578">In the same train, in the same people, in the same where we were sitting because they didn’t have no room.</span> <span id="s579">My three nephews, my sister-in-law, she was very young, twenty-five years old.</span> <span id="s580">Her little girl was a year and a half.</span> <span id="s581">My brother at that time was 28 years, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s582">My father was 71, my mother 60, 61 when they arrive in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s583">They promise us we will see every night.</span> <span id="s584">During the day, they will go to work.</span> <span id="s585">But was not like that.</span> <span id="s586">Only we heard by the French when we smell the meat, barbecue.</span> <span id="s587">They used to look like they have steak in the -- steak barbecue.</span> <span id="s588">We say, look they eating barbecue with the music and the French people what was over there before us, they say no.</span> <span id="s589">They are your parents, they are cremated.</span> <span id="s590">At that time, we didn’t know what mean cremated.</span> <span id="s591">Because in our country, in our little island, we was very naïve.</span> <span id="s592">We knew what means cremation because in our Bible they say cremated, cremation is against the law We never thought they would cremated those people.</span> <span id="s593">My brother, they took my brothers and my brother-in-law, they choose to work and also myself.</span> <span id="s594">But my brother Josef went to Mauthausen, Nissim was in Dachau, my brother-in-law was in Rideltow and those things I find out because I wrote to Red Cross.</span> <span id="s595">They answered me and they told me where they was dead.</span> <span id="s596">That is the reason I know where I lost my brothers.</span> <span id="s597">Myself, I was working in Villestadt before for two months, years.</span> <span id="s598">I was working in Auschwitz bringing barrels of food to the kitchen or bring water to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s599">After breaks, after they send us to Villestadt.</span> <span id="s600">Was factory of munition.</span> <span id="s601">My job was gleeov.</span> <span id="s602">I can’t translate what mean gleeov.</span> <span id="s603">The only thing I know was a big trunk.</span> <span id="s604">I put pieces of metal.</span> <span id="s605">The machine gun I don’t know.</span> <span id="s606">Put it there and then put it in the – in one place, 500 mil kilowatt to make hard.</span> <span id="s607">Every 20 minute, I have to change the trunk and put the other.</span> <span id="s608">In the meantime, the 20 minute until they would be cool off.</span> <span id="s609">I used to help the other girls who they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s610">We worked 12 hours daily for one week.</span> <span id="s611">One night, 12 hours.</span> <span id="s612">Tachi and Nachi they used to call.</span> <span id="s613">But we never saw when was daytime.</span> <span id="s614">When was nighttime because we was working under tunnel.</span> <span id="s615">We never saw sunshine.</span> <span id="s616">We never saw the time, what time, what day.</span> <span id="s617">We didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s618">We was working like slave until the Russian they start to come and they move us in other place to work in pieces of assembly of airplane.</span> <span id="s619">We stayed there three, four days or one week.</span> <span id="s620">From there they took us another place.</span> <span id="s621">They put in the wagons, almost the end I think.</span> <span id="s622">They left us in wagons, closed of Villestadt, no Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s623">They closed the wagons for five days.</span> <span id="s624">How many girls was dead and we didn’t have no toilet, no air, only they was lucky with chan.</span> <span id="s625">After five days over there, you should see the cholera they have, the cholera.</span> <span id="s626">The Russian camp, they liberated us.</span> <span id="s627">They

one knife, knife, one fork and one time I stole a little cushion.</span> <span id="s635">Until they sent us to Prague.</span> <span id="s636">From Prague I escaped twice.</span> <span id="s637">I went

id="s646">For a little bit, I don’t know for how long.</span> <span id="s647">After they sent us to Prague.</span> <span id="s648">From Prague we went to the Italian consul.</span> <span id="s649">The Italian to help -- they help us.</span> <span id="s650">They gave nice, nice place to live like --how do you say -- like a academy school.</span> <span id="s651">A school because the kids was on vacation and they gave us the bed.</span> <span id="s652">Then they gave us money and we can go for shopping or to see.</span> <span id="s653">We didn’t pay the carfare because when we showed the number of our arm, they didn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s654">We used to run from one bus to the other, free.</span> <span id="s655">Free rides we had.</span> <span id="s656">Then after --.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: How long --?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I don’t know how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: You don’t know how long you were there?</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s662">Sha____ for the girls who had dysentery, yeah.</span> <span id="s663">Also they gave me, 1,200 merangos, money.</span> <span id="s664">I bought apples, sugar, something to give nutrition to the girls.</span> <span id="s665">When I came back after three days and a half and two nights, by train because the station was tall, I arrived and I couldn’t find them.</span> <span id="s666">After they told me where they are.</span> <span id="s667">I walked so many kilometers and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s668">I can’t describe how I arrive.</span> <span id="s669">Finally I met them.</span> <span id="s670">I gave the medicines.</span> <span id="s671">I gave what I brought so like that I did my best to save human being.</span> <span id="s672">But those girls they remember

days ago I met somebody.</span> <span id="s688">You think it’s enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Yeah, I’m just looking.</span> <span id="s690">Okay.</span> <span id="s691">Can you tell, after

Milan, they didn’t have room for us.</span> <span id="s696">Modena they didn’t have room for us.</span> <span id="s697">I say the only place we should go to Bologna to see if we will find any place to stay there.</span> <span id="s698">Was -- the building was destroyed but they didn’t have no windows; they didn’t have doors.</span> <span id="s699">We used to sleep in the hallway, we was 52 between boys and girls sleeping in the floor.</span> <span id="s700">The Jewish community, they gave us blankets and also they gave few mattresses and they used to give us three liras to go to eat once -- to hot kitchen.</span> <span id="s701">They call hot kitchen and we used to cook ourselves.</span> <span id="s702">They used to give few dollars, few liras to cook in our place, in our community.</span> <span id="s703">Like that until everyone they start to be settled.</span> <span id="s704">Some they went to South Africa and some they went to Congo Belgium, some they went to United States and some

id="s714">In the meantime, I wrote to Italy to send me money to friend of mine until I will find job.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Do you remember what year it was when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Here I came in 1950; July 18, 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: What type of work did you plan on______?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: From New York -- First of all I was, before to come to the United States I supposed to come with DP, displaced person from Germany.</span> <span id="s719">Because only I was Italian but Rhodes, the island of Rhodes. . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s720">[End of Tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s722">You were saying displaced persons --?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I had Italian passport but Rhodes passed to the Greece in 1948.</span> <span id="s724">I didn’t want to be Greek.</span> <span id="s725">I pick up, I choose to be DP, displaced person to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s726">I have to go to Bremen in Germany because the American, they used to send soldiers to Germany and the boats empty.</span> <span id="s727">The boats, the navy, they used to come back and bring refugees from Germany.</span> <span id="s728">I was in Germany again for three weeks to see those lousy face of Germans.</span> <span id="s729">But I never came out from there, from my room.</span> <span id="s730">I never going to eat out because I don’t want to hear the steps of the Germans and I don’t want to hear their voice.</span> <span id="s731">I came -- when the time came we went to the boat, to the navy and so I came to United States, to New York.</span> <span id="s732">From New York, I came to Los Angeles, three nights and two days by train.</span> <span id="s733">I came to Chicago, the train -- I missed the train.</span> <span id="s734">I have to stay another 24 hours there with no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s735">Because I didn’t know the language.</span> <span id="s736">I didn’t know what to ask to say give me tuna sandwich or cheese sandwich; I didn’t know until I arrived to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s737">When I arrived to Los Angeles, my aunt she say, you know, I was in the depot.</span> <span id="s738">She came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s739">She say, the first thing, you know, now you are in America.</span> <span

<span id="s743">If you don’t like Miru, call Mary.</span> <span id="s744">First of all I say, Aunt, I got your mother’s name.</span> <span id="s745">I’m the only survive who got your mother’s name.</span> <span id="s746">We had four Mirus in the family.</span> <span id="s747">I’m the only survive, why you don’t like?</span> <span id="s748">I say okay, you call me anything you want and I did like this because I was exhausted from the trains with no food.</span> <span id="s749">I came and you start to give me lecture, to say not Miru, Mary!</span> <span id="s750">I stay a few months over there, seven months with my aunt.</span> <span id="s751">I didn’t get along.</span> <span id="s752">I went -- I took one room with somebody.</span> <span id="s753">In the meantime, I didn’t have no money.</span> <span id="s754">I brought with me $500 but was easy to spend.</span> <span id="s755">I wrote to Italy.</span> <span id="s756">I say when I will work, I will pay you.</span> <span id="s757">They send me every month $100.</span> <span id="s758">Like that.</span> <span id="s759">I can pay $40 and the $60 I can eat and take the carfare.</span> <span id="s760">I had more hard time in United States than in Germany.</span> <span id="s761">Because in Germany I know I was obligated, with no choice.</span> <span id="s762">But over here, I couldn’t speak the language, I couldn’t find job and I didn’t have no place to stay.</span> <span id="s763">I had very bad life.</span> <span id="s764">For one year I was desperate until I decide to go back to Italy.</span> <span id="s765">I say I wish to find a job to make my ticket and to go back.</span> <span id="s766">A friend of mine, my cousin who I saved from Auschwitz, who got diarrhea, she say come to Seattle and I will find job for you.</span> <span id="s767">I went to Seattle; I start to work but I had hard time because I didn’t know the language.</span> <span id="s768">I was working in _______but very hard to explain to me.</span> <span id="s769">I took time from the other people to teach me, to tell me what to do and my time also.</span> <span id="s770">They fire me.</span> <span id="s771">Finally I look in the telephone book, Italian family, Italian place and I find Euro-city store and I start to work in Euro-city store.</span> <span id="s772">After five years, I became American citizen.</span> <span id="s773">I say, goodbye everyone.</span> <span id="s774">I’m going to Europe to see where will be my destiny.</span> <span id="s775">I was going to Israel and in Israel they have war after war.</span> <span id="s776">I say not for me.</span> <span id="s777">When I went to Italy, I find out the life was very hard to find job.</span> <span id="s778">I say, I will come back to United States.</span> <span id="s779">I will work more.</span> <span id="s780">When I will have more money, I’ll go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s781">That is what I did.</span> <span id="s782">Now in the meantime, my health is no good.</span> <span id="s783">My health is very deteriorated.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Is there anything else you can think of that you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Is there anything else that you can think of that you would like to add before we finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: I don’t know what
