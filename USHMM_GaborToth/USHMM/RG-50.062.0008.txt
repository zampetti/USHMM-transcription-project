-CONTENTS- At the Sabbath Service, the Rabbi announced that camp survivors and those who fled Germany and Austria during the thirties together with members of the 522 Battalion who witnessed Dachau would discuss their experiences on Crystal Night. He also said 50 hours of videotapes were made. We have 5 people who lived in Germany and Austria either before, during or after Crystal Night and they will share their experiences with you.
What were your first recollections of the Holocaust the the Nazis.
I would say 1937 because there was a Nazi Party in Austria. There were 15 or 16 different parties and the Nazi Party was one of Them.
It was a small party.
I was born in Berlin in 1930. I was a small boy during the period you are taking about. I was the only Jewish student in my school.
The Germans beat me up and chased me. When I lived in Louisiana I was part of segregation from another view.
I lived in Frankfurt. On April 1, 1932, there was a boycott against Jewish stores. We never discussed anything in the house, we took long walks when we wanted to discuss anything.
In 1929 there was a parade of storm troopers in our small town.
One of my high school teachers was in storm trooper uniform
marching.
In 1933 I worked in Berlin. There was a torchlight parade in Under Der Linden where 100,000 storm troopers marched singing. I knew at that time my world was over. I was working in a business organization. Any firm employing Jews could not do business with the city of Berlin. I was dismissed and worked in my father's business and then I emigrated. It was not clear at that time how and where I would live.
Why didn't you get out?
The Nazis were very clever. If you had $5,000 you could come to this country or if you could get someone to sign that they would
vouch for you.
We had well off relatives but they were not interested. A converted Christian Professor of Princeton who was a distant relative signed for us. We could not do it without the help of gentiles.
You had to have the money or have relatives who would vouch for
you?
We had relatives who helped us. If you had a business that employed 120 employees you could not leave until you found employees to take your place and that took time. It took years and we could not get
our visas renewed.
A friend in Spain came across some Jews at a cure in 1932 and told them to leave for Czwechoslovakia. These people did not believe anything would happen and thought they would be safe and we know what their fate was.
I lived in Austria in 1938. We lived in our apartment for 17 years They chased us out of our apartment and took all our belongings and put us up in a small cellar some distance away. My grandmother had an apartment and we moved in with her. On Crystal Night the Nazis went looking for my father and the landlord told him where he was and they took him to the police. Meanwhile they came to our apartment and took me with them to the police. They took us in trucks past the burning synagogue. The Austrian storm troopers were replaced and when we got to the police station after interragation they released me because I was a 17 year old student. The rest of them ended up in Mauthausen. On Dec. 28, 1938 I went to Cologne where we tried to cross the border illegaly. The Belgians let us stay there but after a while the Belgians interned us as we had German passports. Finally at the end of 1940- my American visa was issued. I went to Antwerp, Paris and went in a French Line to New York. I arrived April 4, 1940, a month later the Germans were in Belgium. My parents had gone to Norway. My brother was in London and made it to America and the whole family was reunited.
We left Berlin illegally, my mother, sister, grandmother and mother. The last group the Nazis bothered were Jewish veterand of WW1. My father came to America to look for work. John Hopkins gave him a job. He returned to Sudetenland and we all left August 31. I was 10 years old.
In Austria in 1938 German Jews had been living under Hitler. When Hitler marched in we were told "get the children out." My family wrote to relatives in America and theyt sent me to cousins in America. There was the quota system and of course you needed to have money and someone to vouch for you. People could go to Cuba if someone put up a bond. By the time they got someone to put up the bond, they could not get out and so I live in guilt of being a
survivor.
Do you have any thoughts about what the American Jewish Community and American Gentile community could learn from this experience so that it will not happen again.
My emphasize would be to be aware of what is happening. Jews should be ready to help South Africans as well as our own people.
Not enough American Jews were interested in helping us. Their help could have been more.
We have to be alert as to what is going on. If we feel our country is doing wrong we must speak out. Our country right or wrong is evil. Fight injustice wherever you find it.
I learned one lesson. Polish Jews were sent back to Germany. I did not know what had happened. The Polish Jews had been rounded up and taken out of their beds into cattlecars and brought to the camps.
Living in Frankfurt I had no idea what was going on. We should be alert and help before it takes that dimension.
The rabbi dedicated the memorial to the 6 million.
