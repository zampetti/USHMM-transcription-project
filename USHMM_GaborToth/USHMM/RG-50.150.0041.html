you go to school in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">A: Yes, I went to school in Frankfurt, first to grade school and then to a so called Lyceum.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: While you were in school what did you hope to become?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I must preface the answer by saying while I was in school I was under fourteen which is part of the whole story, so one’s hopes for the future are not clearly focused at that time.</span> <span id="s8">So at one time I wanted to become an X – ray nurse and another time I wanted to become a fashion artist, so much for...I was very interested in languages.</span> <span id="s9">I certainly wanted to get further into that, in whatever area.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: What did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My father was a businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What type of business?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Wholesale parts of motorcycles and bicycles.</span> <span id="s14">I knew very, very little about the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: When you were in school did you have many non – Jewish friends as well as Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Many non – Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s17">It went immediately when one went beyond the point of playing hopscotch in the street (illegible) that every relationship was colored by what was going on, because when I was I guess twelve, it was 1933, which is when things started to change your friends’ parents or you didn’t go to this one’s house anymore.</span> <span id="s18">Day by day your whole relationship with the friends changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: How did it change?</span> <span id="s20">What things were you noticing?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Well things that I remember vividly were that, I lived in a very well to do neighborhood, and therefore after school one went to each others’ houses or whatever, to play in the garden or to do some homework or whatever, and there were some girls whose houses we all loved to go to because they were so terribly elegant or the beautiful gardens or the maid used to serve us lunch and all this, impressing young kids, and those were the girls who immediately didn’t invite me anymore.</span> <span id="s22">Obviously the father or someone (word missing in original transcript) told those girls to cut the relationship with the Jewish girls in the class.</span> <span id="s23">The other thing was that the relationship with boys changed, which at that age in life is important.</span> <span id="s24">There was a boys, I went to a girls, you are probably aware that junior high and high was the same thing, and a few blocks away was the same thing, a gymnasium for the guys.</span> <span id="s25">The boys who were very eager to join the Hitler Youth didn’t look at you any more.</span> <span id="s26">Up until than they were just as friendly or as good friends as anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: How did you explain this to yourself?</span> <span id="s28">Did you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, it was quite self - understood.</span> <span id="s30">I grew, I think the first thing changing, due to my father’s business being part, a business that dealt with metal parts, and the manufacturers very, very early in the game when I guess the population was not as much aware of the preparation of war and the buildup for war, but the manufacturers who delivered to my father said very, very early in the game we do not deliver to Jews any more.</span> <span id="s31">So when the conversation around the dinner table always revolves around how worse business is getting there were no more things that my father could sell.</span> <span id="s32">Little did I care about, they turned out to be ball bearings, I wasn’t interested in whatever he was telling at that point.</span> <span id="s33">Then of course you grow up, things are getting worse, something is happening, things are getting worse.</span> <span id="s34">You see uniforms, you see parades and you are told go away from that.</span> <span id="s35">Walk the other way.</span> <span id="s36">Then it becomes part of your daily life that there is something that you are somehow not afraid of, it was (word missing in original transcript) to be afraid of, but there is something to stay away from, to avoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you ever enter into any conversations with these friends that you had been to their houses or played?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: No.</span> <span id="s39">No.</span> <span id="s40">On purpose because nobody wanted to be told I don’t want to be with Jews any more.</span> <span id="s41">On the other hand there were vivid conversations of a peculiar relationship I had with what was called a next – door best girl friend, right, the one you hung on the phone with, but at that time you didn’t hang on the phone, you were running back and forth.</span> <span id="s42">You didn’t brush your teeth without asking.</span> <span id="s43">She was my age and this is a particularly illustrative case.</span> <span id="s44">She had a younger brother.</span> <span id="s45">She had a mother who immediately became a big shot in the woman’s Nazi movement.</span> <span id="s46">Now this girl spent as much time at my house as I at hers with the mother debating for hours, how am I going to (word missing in original transcript) I don’t know, that this was the most fabulous thing that ever happened to the country, and that they were praying for these kind of things to happen and that of course that what (word missing in original transcript) to my family was not as terrible as what was in the newspapers every day, but that certainly all, most of the other Jews did all those terrible things whatever the paper said and even at that stage or age I was vividly debating that, but you also know my mother’s sisters and you know my mother and you’ve been to our house, and my mother’s friend said well this has nothing to do with you, it has to do with the Jews who exploit and make too much money, they will be taken care of.</span> <span id="s47">She became a bigger and bigger big shot and my girl friend started to go therefore with guys who were SA or SS and that made me hate her, which was a good word at that age so much that I wouldn’t speak to her any more.</span> <span id="s48">She would still speak to me.</span> <span id="s49">Her name was Inga.</span> <span id="s50">I remember the whole family because they were a great part of my life, and strangely enough the kid brother who normally you would consider the brat, was the one who was different.</span> <span id="s51">He also was different the husband in this family and he kept quite in the background.</span> <span id="s52">He wanted nothing to do with his wife’s party and activities.</span> <span id="s53">He eventually walked out on the wife and her party activities and was never heard from again.</span> <span id="s54">If for other reasons I don’t know; who cares about older people at that point, what might have been wrong with their marriage I don’t know.</span> <span id="s55">But the kid brother used to come to me and say those terrible things that his sister Inga who now went with this SS man was telling us and used to say tell your parents to get out.</span> <span id="s56">It’s just no good that’s coming up or if you need anything call me ( words missing in original transcript) the next building.</span> <span id="s57">I think he was four years younger than I and eventually Inga married very early, while we were still in Frankfurt and moved out of the neighborhood and I then only saw her coming, at that point you couldn’t come anymore by car cause it was already war and there was no gas, so she used to come by bicycle with her husband.</span> <span id="s58">She married one of those guys.</span> <span id="s59">I think it was SA, but some kind of a party functionary and he had to be a big shot because he was limping, a young guy, but otherwise they were very fussy about deformities, he had to be somebody already, and we went in ’42 to Theresienstadt so I was twenty one.</span> <span id="s60">Long before that whenever I would see Inga or this guy showing up, it was a rather small street so, apartment houses that had five or six stories, narrower probably than this street so you kind of could notice who walked in or out next door.</span> <span id="s61">We wouldn’t even look at each other, whereas Ralph the brother, when he was already in the Hitler Youth uniform, his mother made him join, would cross the street and say “Hay, how are you.</span> <span id="s62">What gives.</span> <span id="s63">Etc.”</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: When Hitler came to power you were twelve.</span> <span id="s65">Let’s say twelve, thirteen and fourteen and you saw all these non – Jewish girls and fellows joining the SS or whatever, did you ever have a sense of isolation or wanting to belong?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well no, but that might be in my case a physical matter.</span> <span id="s67">I am handicapped walking and to me therefore outings and camps was something awful because it made me feel handicapped more, so therefore I had no desire to go into that.</span> <span id="s68">It wasn’t my thing.</span> <span id="s69">Where I felt isolated and left out was in school activities, in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: How did this show itself in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: It showed itself in school because you had a club for this and a club for that and first you belonged and then they told you this year we can’t take you.</span> <span id="s72">We’re filled up.</span> <span id="s73">That’s the part that hurt.</span> <span id="s74">The part in school that hurt the most, I went to a rather fancy school.</span> <span id="s75">I was aware of...it happened to be the neighborhood high school, but it happened to be a rather fancy school.</span> <span id="s76">You had all kinds of limousines pulling up in the mornings bringing girls and picking up girls in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s77">It was a very good school.</span> <span id="s78">It still is rather famous and I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s79">In 1935 I was called (word missing in original transcript), I can still see the principal’s office.</span> <span id="s80">I was told don’t come here anymore.</span> <span id="s81">I didn’t know what the guy was saying.</span> <span id="s82">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s83">I mean where am I supposed to go?</span> <span id="s84">Did you open a branch?</span> <span id="s85">Before I understood what he was telling me, that you couldn’t go to school anymore, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: When you heard this, did you go home and tell your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s88">I think I cried every day.</span> <span id="s89">I don’t think there was anybody in my class at the time.</span> <span id="s90">The reason that I remember is that at that time don’t forget that in ’35 quite a few people, my parents were very stupid about the whole thing now in retrospect.</span> <span id="s91">Boy were they dumb.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Because it can’t happen.</span> <span id="s94">Nothing can happen my father said with him and all the decorations.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: He served in the first world war?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: How did he think of himself in terms of the German...?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: He was a really proud German.</span> <span id="s99">He still had his uniform in the closet.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: When business started falling off because of what you mentioned before, that he wasn’t sold the metal parts, how did he react to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: As I said before, I wasn’t all that perceptive about it.</span> <span id="s102">I guess kids are cruel.</span> <span id="s103">It’s your only daily program that you care about and my parents were in a way in another world.</span> <span id="s104">As a girl and being at home I know how depressed my mother was.</span> <span id="s105">I guess my father wasn’t home enough for me to be all that interested about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What did you notice about your mother that made you think that she was depressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: One of the first things that happened was that she started to discuss money to members of her family which up to then I had never heard.</span> <span id="s108">Her brothers like my mother, that there were discussions about income.</span> <span id="s109">Bills that had to be paid, and bills that were owed from the past in business, payments for advances or loans or whatever, and there were continuous discussions about that and how that would affect us and then I heard, and then the discussions became more immediate.</span> <span id="s110">As I said, we lived in Frankfurt, and if you know enough about it was kind of a center city.</span> <span id="s111">It was the middle of a lot of railroad connections.</span> <span id="s112">So a lot of our relatives used to come to discuss things in front, at our house.</span> <span id="s113">The biggest change at that point was that somebody from the family was forever showing up for discussion about moving, which until then nobody moved.</span> <span id="s114">I mean people just didn’t move.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: I was going to ask you if there was any discussion about emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s117">There was discussion about before emigration discussions about moving.</span> <span id="s118">Whoever from the family lived in small towns even before 1938, before November 1938, talked about moving into the next larger city because they didn’t feel safe.</span> <span id="s119">And then came the discussions about emigration.</span> <span id="s120">None of that ever affected my parents to the point where they said alright let’s talk about us.</span> <span id="s121">Much, much later I was the one who started it.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Why do you think they didn’t react in terms of thinking of themselves emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: It’s hard for me to figure that out, because in later years she used to blame it on my father.</span> <span id="s124">She grew up in an age where women didn’t work.</span> <span id="s125">I mean by the time my father left she couldn’t balance a check book.</span> <span id="s126">It was the generation of women who were marvelous housewives and baked and cooked and otherwise didn’t open their mouths.</span> <span id="s127">She always said that he didn’t have the get up and go to start anything.</span> <span id="s128">Maybe she was right.</span> <span id="s129">I can’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: In any case you weren’t discussing emigration until...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Until after my father came back from the camp from November ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Just let me backtrack for a minute, back to when you were in school.</span> <span id="s133">After you were told you couldn’t come to school, did you feel in your mind endangered?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No.</span> <span id="s135">Rejected.</span> <span id="s136">That’s when I felt I don’t belong anywheres anymore.</span> <span id="s137">Also at the time, at the age of fourteen I guess, the thought of now being at home with your mother, a girl of that age you have more arguments with your mother than conversations.</span> <span id="s138">Now I’m going to have to stay home with her all day kind of thing.</span> <span id="s139">What do I do when I get up in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Did you have many Jewish friends at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Was there a camaraderie developed?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes, of course, but strangely enough or not so strangely emigration at that time had a great deal to do with money.</span> <span id="s144">A great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: In what sense do you mean that?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: The more money you had, the more money your family had, the easier it was to emigrate.</span> <span id="s147">I mean you had to go somewheres and live, right?</span> <span id="s148">So you had to either have money outside of Germany or you had to have a family who was willing to give you money to live.</span> <span id="s149">So that split a great many relationships, and at that point we were decidedly in the have – not category.</span> <span id="s150">In terms of relatives, the ones who had were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: When you saw these friends leaving how did you feel about the exiting you were witnessing?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well a great sense of losing friends and kids I was close with.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did your father feel at this time that it wouldn’t last?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: My father felt it was going to stop any day.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: How about yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I honestly don’t know.</span> <span id="s157">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s158">Nobody had any idea about what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s159">Nobody.</span> <span id="s160">And if they did they pushed it far back in their minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did you ever see any signs at that time of Juden Unensh or Juden Forbodden?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s163">We saw them all over.</span> <span id="s164">You didn’t see them outwardly as much as, when did start the sterm?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: That was after 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh it was.</span> <span id="s167">Well the Juden Un(word missing in original transcript) and traveling the back of the railroad or the strassenbon for the matter or the bus became a matter of course.</span> <span id="s168">I had Hebrew class was at the temple not at the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Had it been in school prior to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No.</span> <span id="s171">No it never was in school.</span> <span id="s172">In Germany it never was in school.</span> <span id="s173">It wasn’t part of the school at all.</span> <span id="s174">Whatever you did for religion you did wherever you did it.</span> <span id="s175">In the building wherever it was.</span> <span id="s176">So Hebrew classes were in the other part of town to which I had to take two strassenbons and I remember for quite a few years, I still must have been in school, to go there on Thursday afternoons and liking it because it was an occasion to be there with other Jewish boys and girls.</span> <span id="s177">Despite the fact that I had to go on the back of the strassenbon second car.</span> <span id="s178">Second car, first platform.</span> <span id="s179">I remember that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Was there any chance of you continuing school in a Jewish school after...?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes there was.</span> <span id="s182">I never quite understood why my parents didn’t want, it was a private school.</span> <span id="s183">They may just not have had the money at the time.</span> <span id="s184">It was a very famous school, you might have heard the name.</span> <span id="s185">It was called the Flentopeen and it was very far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s186">They said at the time at that point two things, they didn’t want me to be on that strassenbon for so many hours a day, and number two, what was the use for a girl at that point to go beyond the education I had.</span> <span id="s187">Now in the kind of school I went to because it was a very good school we were heavy into French, English, Chemistry and Math.</span> <span id="s188">So was the Flentopeen.</span> <span id="s189">It was an equally good school.</span> <span id="s190">So my father and mother said what’s the use of your going on with that now.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: When you went to this Hebrew school which I take it you continued even after that did you belong to that congregation?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes we belonged to that congregation and we were very active, my parents were always active in the congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: When you went to services or meetings or whatever it was did you ever hear the rabbi either from the pulpit or in private situations, speak of the situation in Germany or what should be done or should we emigrate or any such thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Public servants such as the Rabbi or the Cantor who taught the classes had to be terribly careful in what they said, could not imply that something awful was going to happen.</span> <span id="s195">You couldn’t say that anywheres from the pulpit.</span> <span id="s196">You could say that it might be beneficial or members of the congregation who are now living there and there are reporting, yes that happened all the time, but they were very, very careful about what they said that you should go or you should do.</span> <span id="s197">It would have had immediate repercussions.</span> <span id="s198">The Germans were so schizophrenic about that whole situation that nobody said go.</span> <span id="s199">Nowhere but in these very, very harsh newspapers, such as the Stermer, you’ve probably heard about it, did they ever say get out of here.</span> <span id="s200">In the contrary, if it came to red tape they made it exceedingly difficult.</span> <span id="s201">Taxes on top of taxes on top of taxes and we signed and you had to get the papers.</span> <span id="s202">That’s what’s so schizophrenic about the whole thing, so at the same time nobody ever said here’s what you should do.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: As a young girl were you ever restricted from going to movies or concerts or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Oh yes, sure.</span> <span id="s205">And it had the opposite affect that when I came to New York and I said now I’m going to go.</span> <span id="s206">I also said I’m not going to get married.</span> <span id="s207">I’m going to go.</span> <span id="s208">I had from 1936 when I was fifteen, I got a job and met a girl that I liked who was half Jewish from a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s209">Her mother was Jewish her father was not, her father kept his job for quite a while despite the Jewish wife, and we and some other boys went to the movies religiously every Saturday night until I think there came the thing with the star.</span> <span id="s210">I don’t think we could go anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Did the movie houses display signs Juden Forbodden?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Before?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s215">But as long as we didn’t have to wear a star we went anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You mentioned just before that you got a job.</span> <span id="s217">What kind of a job did you get.</span> <span id="s218">You were only fifteen, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I got a job through a friend of my father in an office as a go – for.</span> <span id="s220">You know go – for.</span> <span id="s221">There it was called leiling, which was kind of nice because they teach you anything and everything you have to know in an office.</span> <span id="s222">And then I went which you had to do if you had (word missing in original transcript) in an office, you went to a trade school and learned typing, which the boss had to send you to the Jewish firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Oh it was a Jewish firm in 1936.</span> <span id="s224">How did you feel about working?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Oh I started to have a good time.</span> <span id="s226">The year in between when I was really at home between being kicked out of school and getting this job, I remember as being one of the worst years of my life.</span> <span id="s227">My mother hired a young man as a tutor so to speak to go over some English with me and to keep up reading and some math.</span> <span id="s228">Him I remember very well because he was blind and he had all his books in braille.</span> <span id="s229">I guess that’s why I remember him so well.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: A Jewish fellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: A Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s232">Yes.</span> <span id="s233">And then when I got the job I started to have a good time again.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: How did things on the job from 1936 until Crystal Night, how did things go for you on the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Well due to the fact that I met this girl and had suddenly a whole circle of friends who were exactly in the same circumstances, who had to leave school, and were working because they wanted something to do, certainly not for the money we were making which was ridiculous in terms of the value of money.</span> <span id="s236">We had at least somebody to go for walks with and discuss this and all this was very, I think we shut out what was going on in the outside world, because by then the letters were coming in from my uncles and aunt who had come here or from some people in my father’s family who had gone to Israel very early in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What kind of letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well that it was rough or that it was hard to find jobs or that so and so who they hoped to be in contact wouldn’t see them or wasn’t alive anymore, or that the aunt who promised to give all of us the affidavit wasn’t giving anymore.</span> <span id="s239">That is one place where money played such a big part, you know that you have to have an affidavit to come here, and lots of people bought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: When your father read these letters, or should I say your parents, what was their reaction to hearing about these hardships in America or Israel or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Well I suppose to them those were all abstractions anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Did it help to put it even further in the back of their minds?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s244">Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Was this business that you were in you mentioned it was a Jewish business.</span> <span id="s246">Was it aryseered after Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: After Crystal Night, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: What happened to you or to your family on Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: It was 1938.</span> <span id="s250">I was at work and my father was trying to make a living selling cigars.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: In other words he was not in his business anymore.</span> <span id="s252">When did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I don’t know exactly when it stopped.</span> <span id="s254">When these deliveries stopped from this wholesaler and then he tried some smaller companies and they wouldn’t either so, I don’t know what year that was.</span> <span id="s255">So anyway I don’t remember that day exactly, but I remember that I don’t know if it was Saturday or Sunday, I was home on that day in November and that my mother was bothered because my father had gone out on his daily rounds trying to sell the cigars, and that he hadn’t come home, and then I went downstairs, or had I already come home from the office, that I don’t remember, and then I went to look around the neighborhood to see if somebody had seen or heard something about my father and then I stopped at some Jewish neighbor’s houses that lived around the street, and had heard that people had been apprehended in the streets.</span> <span id="s256">Up until then we hadn’t been aware of that.</span> <span id="s257">As I said people were very, very careful about what you said on the phone.</span> <span id="s258">Everybody spoke in a code anyway on the phone, discussing emigration and things like that.</span> <span id="s259">I don’t even remember if we had a phone come to think of it on Crystal Night.</span> <span id="s260">Jews were not permitted phones anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: When you found out...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well in the evening when he didn’t come home I went to the neighborhood precinct and got no answer, not much of an answer.</span> <span id="s263">Only got the answer that all Jews have been apprehended, go away don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s264">Nobody looked up your name or anything like that.</span> <span id="s265">So if he didn’t come home, then he’s been apprehended.</span> <span id="s266">That meant we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s267">At the same time arrived by cab a cousin of mine from a neighboring town saying they were apprehending Jews in Weisbaden I think he came from and I had to get out of there.</span> <span id="s268">And my mother said what do you want here we have the same thing here.</span> <span id="s269">He said I’ve got to hide from what’s happening in Weisbaden.</span> <span id="s270">Then my mother said go upstairs to where the maids rooms were, which was like the floor below the roof.</span> <span id="s271">He went up there to the empty maid’s room and stayed there.</span> <span id="s272">He never went anywheres.</span> <span id="s273">So by late in the evening we assumed my father was amongst those who went</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Were you aware that the synagogues were burned or that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Only towards the evening.</span> <span id="s276">There were no Jewish stores where we lived so we didn’t notice anything, any of that going on.</span> <span id="s277">And I think the full brunt of it we really didn’t, and the synagogues were far away from us physically from where we lived.</span> <span id="s278">We lived in a very residential area.</span> <span id="s279">I mentioned that I had a very long trip to get to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s280">So I think it was really until the next day that we heard the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: When you became aware of what happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Then it became frightening.</span> <span id="s283">Then everybody was scared out of their wits because then you immediately knew whoever let the house may never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: How did you know that they may never come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Because we heard that they were taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s286">We didn’t know what that word meant, but you knew that the word meant something awful.</span> <span id="s287">Nobody knew about extermination or gas or beatings.</span> <span id="s288">I mean those words you just didn’t believe there was such a thing.</span> <span id="s289">I suppose it had to do with the fact particularly in Germany you lived up to that point a very, very middle class orderly bourgeois kind of an existence where these things didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s290">I guess from then on I remember I went to sleep with my mother.</span> <span id="s291">I always remember that my aunt lived, my mother’s sister lived in the neighborhood came and sleep with us.</span> <span id="s292">Her husband also didn’t come home.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: How did you go about finding out what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I don’t remember and the strange thing is that we must have been so shocked that some of this we really don’t remember.</span> <span id="s295">Until my mother was alive we were talking about that still.</span> <span id="s296">She died in 1971.</span> <span id="s297">She didn’t remember either, we also don’t remember, it was at least two weeks until he got home, and those are things one blocks, he was one of the first group because of his World War 1 decorations, so did the husband of my mother’s sister, the brother – in – law.</span> <span id="s298">He was (word missing in original transcript) by sheer coincidence.</span> <span id="s299">I only remember the shock of seeing him come home and crying and my mother putting him to bed and he would not stop crying.</span> <span id="s300">I think it was the first time I ever saw my father cry and I was seventeen years old at that time after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: During those two weeks when he was away were you aware at any time where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yes we were and I think we were through the police.</span> <span id="s303">Somebody came and gave us a slip of paper.</span> <span id="s304">We knew immediately that he was in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Would you have dared at the time to ask next door, Inga’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No.</span> <span id="s307">Wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s308">You just assumed which I guess was part of the problem with the whole German side of this happening.</span> <span id="s309">Nobody questioned anything.</span> <span id="s310">It was just assumed that there was nothing you could do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Were you notified at any time of how he might be released or when he might be released?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s313">The only thing was that it was publicized that they were releasing people who had served the German state in one way or another.</span> <span id="s314">That was publicized somewhere, probably in the newspapers, although there was hardly anything in general about this whole thing in the newspapers as you probably know.</span> <span id="s315">Officially it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s316">I also remember going to that neighborhood precinct every couple of days and getting nowheres.</span> <span id="s317">And then my mother used to send me rather than go herself trying to find out what they know.</span> <span id="s318">They knew from nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Why would she send you rather than go herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: When your father did come home you mentioned that he was shaken from the experience.</span> <span id="s322">Did he ever discuss after that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Only about the beatings.</span> <span id="s324">That was about the only thing he discussed.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: In observing your father then how was he able to take, how was he able to absorb all of this having felt that it couldn’t happen and that it would go away?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well I think his ego was already at that point, even before that, very much deflated, though the fact that he couldn’t make the money anymore that he was used to making, that he couldn’t support his family anymore the way he always had.</span> <span id="s327">It crushed him very, very much.</span> <span id="s328">I don’t think he was ever afterwards, he became a meek little man.</span> <span id="s329">And the two things happening together he was probably never a very powerful force or go getting person.</span> <span id="s330">My mother was always the stronger one, but those happenings accumulating, by the time that we got to Theresienstadt, he didn’t care one way or the other.</span> <span id="s331">I mean he just lived day to day and therefore adapted beautifully to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s332">He had give up fighting this completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: After he came home did things change for you after Crystal Night?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: They changed number one that the company I was working for got taken over the next day.</span> <span id="s337">I was told not to come back and my girlfriend who I had gotten very friendly with, the one who was half and half, she could stay.</span> <span id="s338">She wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s339">It always what religion or what congregation do you belong to, so my life started to change again.</span> <span id="s340">By that point I was old enough to say I’ve got to get myself out of here, I’ve got to do something.</span> <span id="s341">I started to correspond, I know we couldn’t make it, we tried to make it, yes, something happened in the meantime that I had gotten an affidavit from somebody in my mother’s family, but only for me, through an uncle who was here in the meantime.</span> <span id="s342">And I got turned down at the consulate because of my disability.</span> <span id="s343">I wasn’t high enough and the relationship was too distant.</span> <span id="s344">I didn’t have anybody any closer than my uncle who was in no position yet at that time to give a affidavit</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: It must have been very difficult when you were in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s346">How were you able to walk away from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes (words missing in original transcript) I even remember when I got there that they were so proud of it that I spoke English.</span> <span id="s348">I also know and you heard it over and over again that that whole Stuttgart consulate setup was awful.</span> <span id="s349">These people were not to be believed.</span> <span id="s350">They were partly and partly civil service stupid.</span> <span id="s351">They couldn’t have cared less.</span> <span id="s352">They made it as difficult as could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: All Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s355">How it was set up, every file, every communication, every letter was like getting something out of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s356">Before you ever got an answer I can still see some f those mineograph things.</span> <span id="s357">Come at this hour, don’t come.</span> <span id="s358">Come at this hour, don’t come.</span> <span id="s359">They, we didn’t think it was that peculiar, we thought every authority was that way.</span> <span id="s360">Then we found out later on the mistakes that were made, and that they were playing the same game.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: When you left Stuttgart did you feel threatened in terms of physically threatened?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: No I never felt physically threatened.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: How did you think that you were going to get out of Germany at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Well at that point I started to correspond with people in England that my father knew, and we knew that you could go and be a maid in England and then somebody else wrote that somebody they knew had a factory in Scotland making knitwear and did I want to work there, so I said fine, so I started that and they started to get me working papers.</span> <span id="s365">To make a long story short all this correspondence took months because the mail was censored.</span> <span id="s366">We had to be very careful as to what you wrote, and I got the papers to go to Scotland on September 1, 1939, the day I listened to the declaration of war with England.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: When you got the papers...?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I wasn’t elated.</span> <span id="s369">I was scared to leave home at that point.</span> <span id="s370">It was anti – climax after writing for almost a year at that point, from right after that.</span> <span id="s371">The interesting thing is that whatever happened to me always had to do with work.</span> <span id="s372">It still does.</span> <span id="s373">I’m just that kind of a workaholic.</span> <span id="s374">I immediately got a job working for jude (word missing in original transcript) Frankfurt, which I don’t know if you knew that it was a federation of different congregations and with it an official kind of organization that really belonged to the city.</span> <span id="s375">It had nothing to do with as it is here now that congregations are private.</span> <span id="s376">They weren’t.</span> <span id="s377">They had to belong to this kultusgemeinde for which you had to pay taxes and all.</span> <span id="s378">And I knew how to type and they needed help in the office.</span> <span id="s379">I had been secretly with people there just because we had been active in the cula in one way or another, so I started to work there I think right after I had to leave that office in a department called kindertransporter.</span> <span id="s380">There was a very famous woman socialist who stopped working for the University of Frankfurt because she was Jewish, and had taken over that department, and I worked for her and she was very, very stimulating woman.</span> <span id="s381">They organized the kinder transports, it was an arm of the government.</span> <span id="s382">Alone they couldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s383">They organized and they transported to Switzerland and to Holland and to England.</span> <span id="s384">So that became a very satisfying experience to get into that, something very positive.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Were conditions in Frankfurt getting worse between Crystal Night and the ensuing year or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: They were getting worse, sure.</span> <span id="s387">It started with less food.</span> <span id="s388">There was no official war going on until, the war in Poland was going on.</span> <span id="s389">It really started getting bad during the air raids.</span> <span id="s390">When they started, about that time.</span> <span id="s391">September ’39 started the war with England so from the winter of ’39 and we used to go in the cellar every night with a suitcase and say hooray let them come.</span> <span id="s392">Yippee there they are, we hope they come more often.</span> <span id="s393">Nobody at that point thought you could get it from whatever comes, they said let it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: What were you thinking when you said let it come?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: That we couldn’t save because we were sitting with the other people in the house.</span> <span id="s396">There was another kind of lucky, so work wise at that point I was satisfied with what I was doing for awhile, but on the other side was the apartment question.</span> <span id="s397">It was an awful time to know that you’ve got to move.</span> <span id="s398">We don’t want to.</span> <span id="s399">You’ve got to.</span> <span id="s400">Jews were not permitted more than a room and a half for three, no what was the edict?</span> <span id="s401">Two people could have three rooms tops.</span> <span id="s402">Now we were three and we had I think five.</span> <span id="s403">Yes, so we had to take boarders.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: The landlord I take it was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: The landlord was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s406">So we took boarders and the boarders made for a whole lot of excitement whatever their own problems were with children or emigration or family.</span> <span id="s407">Then came one day, I forget the year when a guy in an SS uniform rang the bell and said my name is Dr. Gastner, I’m taking over your apartment, you are leaving in two weeks and that was then in a good neighborhood, par for the course.</span> <span id="s408">Then the jud (word missing in original transcript) gameinde had to get your (word missing in original transcript) department of apartments because this was happening all the time.</span> <span id="s409">Had to find you an apartment and so the only thing they had was what the Germans didn’t want which were big old fashioned apartments and since you weren’t supposed to have this, a catch – 22 kind of thing, you had to have these apartments with many other families, share the kitchen.</span> <span id="s410">So we moved to completely the other part of town which by sheer coincidence was a very nice part of town because it had these huge old West Avenue type of houses with these huge apartments and we had this apartment with I think two other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: That must have been very difficult for your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Four other families.</span> <span id="s413">Less difficult for my mother because the first thing she said to her sister and her husband then you are going to move with us there because they were in an apartment which was part of a Jewish one family home where there was an apartment in it for rent upstairs and these people were very rich people with a beautiful big one family home.</span> <span id="s414">The minute that they went to Switzerland they knew they couldn’t stay in that house anymore, because somebody was taking over that home.</span> <span id="s415">People had to walk away from it and they knew they had to get out of there so that shelter was so tricky and that was one of the worst experiences at that time.</span> <span id="s416">To literally didn’t know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Did everybody know to go to the kultusgemeinde?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s419">Everybody knew.</span> <span id="s420">It was the only place you could go.</span> <span id="s421">I then worked in the mornings at the kultusgemeinde.</span> <span id="s422">I also worked, as the kultusgemeinde got bigger and bigger it became a bureaucracy by virtue of what was happening.</span> <span id="s423">The kindertransports stopped because the Germans said no more and the guy from the Gestapo was there as the head of the kultusgemeinde it was all in government control.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Speaking of that did the Gestapo or any other ministerium give you any problems as far as the Kultusgemeinde activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No.</span> <span id="s426">They wanted the least to do with the Germans and you people wanted, and had the one guy sitting there that you people had to ask, was a very famous SS man and there was once a long New Yorker profile on this guy that I think I still have, so what was (word missing in original transcript) for so long.</span> <span id="s427">It was like talking to God to go to this guy to get any decisions or get anything signed.</span> <span id="s428">He had to sign everything.</span> <span id="s429">I still have my (word missing in original transcript), my ident, signed by this guy in order to come and go at odd hours with curfews all over the lot.</span> <span id="s430">The curfews were forever, I mean they kept on changing, having to do with air attacks and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: When did you first have to start wearing a star, were you working for the Kultusgemeinde?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s433">I can look it up.</span> <span id="s434">It was on the (word missing in original transcript) card.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Do you remember working for the Kultusgemeinde at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: When that law first came out, which obviously was for identification purposes, how did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: It was just another drop on the Chinese water torture.</span> <span id="s439">At that point it was already everything, as I said one of the worst things to affect your daily life was your shelter.</span> <span id="s440">You gotta move, where you going to go, where you going to sleep, it was far worse than not being able to buy half the groceries, because that was affecting everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: When you say where would you go, you finally did get an apartment with your aunt and uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes and with three other families.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: At that point were you all wearing the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s445">Everybody was wearing the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: How did people from the numbers of people you were with, you were able to observe, how did people deal with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Well I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s448">It was quite simple.</span> <span id="s449">If you didn’t look Jewish it changed your life completely.</span> <span id="s450">If you looked as Jewish as I did or everybody else in my family did it didn’t matter because you were used to being looked at funny in the street anyway.</span> <span id="s451">I mean to have a dark complexion or my father had a fairly long nose, whether you had this official sealer or not mattered little.</span> <span id="s452">You couldn’t get on a street car other than the back car anyway, you could only go in certain stores, you couldn’t go into a movie anymore with or without that, so only the blonds were affected.</span> <span id="s453">It was as simple as all that.</span> <span id="s454">People like my mother.</span> <span id="s455">She used to go in every store.</span> <span id="s456">She was a redhead, and that was her worst thing.</span> <span id="s457">She couldn’t go in a grocery store after she, food shopping went anywheres, went out to the countryside to get food and so on, because she didn’t look Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: How did she feel about having to wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: As I said, beyond practical considerations it didn’t matter, because by that time physical, my family and I never in anywhere said we are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s460">I mean we were so consciously Jewish, my father’s family was very orthodox, my grandmother on my mother’s side, so we were always so very aware of being Jewish, so I think to have that thing on you was just another addition.</span> <span id="s461">I think it was much more shocking to the many people who didn’t really want to be Jewish and there were many in Germany.</span> <span id="s462">They were very emancipated, especially in the intelligentsia that wanted as little to do with this as possible.</span> <span id="s463">To them that was a rocker, to us you couldn’t do this you couldn’t do that so whether you had this hanging on you or not you didn’t want to talk to anybody in the street anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: By this time was there any, obviously nobody foresaw what would happen, but by the time they went to issuing stars and kencarsa?</span> <span id="s465">, identification...</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: And the middle name Sarah and Israel, you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Yes, was there a feeling of doom, especially you were working with...?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Doom is not the word.</span> <span id="s469">There was a feeling of hopelessness, but then unfortunately in a way for the Jews there was also a war.</span> <span id="s470">And the Germans were doing so well at that time.</span> <span id="s471">That was in a way as bad as what was happening to us because your sense of justice left you completely.</span> <span id="s472">On top of it they were winning already yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Speaking of that there brings an interesting point, when the western powers, the English, the French didn’t come to the aid of Czechoslovakia or...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: That’s what I mean, the complete hopelessness.</span> <span id="s475">The idea that we had no more way of getting out.</span> <span id="s476">Whatever is going to go happening here is going to happen to us first.</span> <span id="s477">What we didn’t know was whether it was air attacks or incendiary bombs, or whatever.</span> <span id="s478">This was this complete feeling of abandonment.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Speaking of not being able to go anywhere, I asked you before different ways you considered emigrating, but did you consider South America, or Shanghai or any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: No my parents didn’t because that involved large amounts of cash.</span> <span id="s481">I don’t think I would have ever thought of it, that I would be independent enough in my thinking to have thought of it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s483">During this time you continued to work for the Kultusgemeinde until 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: During this time in this large apartment with all these other parties, this refers to the fact that people who weren’t consciously Jews or practice Judaism were much harder affected by these things because that brought something up that was completely different in their backgrounds psychologically that they also had to cope with.</span> <span id="s485">There was a high level judge.</span> <span id="s486">I don’t know whether he was single or he was a widower.</span> <span id="s487">He was a rather famous man with many titles.</span> <span id="s488">He was the original owner of this vast apartment which was very, very beautiful, carpets and paintings and whatnot.</span> <span id="s489">From month to month came new edicts and laws and declarations.</span> <span id="s490">Now you couldn’t do this and now your taxes were this and now your jewelry had to go here.</span> <span id="s491">I don’t know what came out during what week.</span> <span id="s492">Then you couldn’t have (word missing in original transcript) women.</span> <span id="s493">I don’t know what came out on a given day, but we were having supper in our one room, but we heard a noise, something like that, and my father said that was a gunshot and it sounds like it came from Judge so and so’s room and he just killed himself.</span> <span id="s494">I don’t remember what the law was at that point that my father immediately associated with him, so he said to my mother and me, you stay here, don’t go in I’ll go, so he went in and came out and said yes he shot himself.</span> <span id="s495">We called the other two parties who were in this apartment, my aunt and uncle and the other couple, and said the judge killed himself.</span> <span id="s496">Now the point was you had to go to the police.</span> <span id="s497">Not to send a man to the police.</span> <span id="s498">Which one of the women ought to go to the police and report it?</span> <span id="s499">So I don’t know why I said I’ll go.</span> <span id="s500">Walked to the nearest precinct and said I just want to report that Judge what’s his name killed himself and would they come and do something about it.</span> <span id="s501">And one sergeant said to the other sergeant, good, one of them less.</span> <span id="s502">That reaction I remember distinctly and a little bit later they came and they carried him out.</span> <span id="s503">It didn’t affect us personally that this guy shot himself because proud Jews kind of looked down on people who didn’t want to be Jews anyway.</span> <span id="s504">And my father knew that whatever would happen this man’s reaction was that he didn’t want to cope with what’s ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: By this time what did the people in your apartment think was ahead?</span> <span id="s506">What were you anticipating?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: We didn’t anticipate anything because it came so rapidly fast.</span> <span id="s508">There were so many things that we didn’t anticipate anything.</span> <span id="s509">What came next was that people got a knock on the door at 5 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s510">Nobody anticipated that.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: What happened when they got the knock?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: When they got the knock they said pack a suitcase and come with us.</span> <span id="s513">Those were the first transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I believe early in 1941.</span> <span id="s516">Amongst them my aunt and uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: How was it determined that it was your aunt and uncle and not...?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: It was determined at Gestapo headquarters by who knows how.</span> <span id="s519">We later on got postal cards from all of them from a camp in Poland.</span> <span id="s520">Much later.</span> <span id="s521">At that point there I was at the Kultusgemeinde.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: At that point when the knock came everyone was home at five o’clock in the morning, right?</span> <span id="s523">I mean you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes, but there were many knocks before for no reason.</span> <span id="s525">Does so and so live here?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: When the knocks came was there a tremendous sense of fear and hysteria?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s528">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s529">Not hysteria.</span> <span id="s530">Fear always, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: When your aunt and uncle were taken it must have been....</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s533">I didn’t know how to cope with it.</span> <span id="s534">That you barely said good – bye.</span> <span id="s535">That you just help somebody pack.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: What were they told?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s538">Just come with us.</span> <span id="s539">Nobody was told anything.</span> <span id="s540">They were just called terrible names.</span> <span id="s541">That was the...then came shortly, then came the kultusgemeinde protesting.</span> <span id="s542">I don’t know what made them do that the fools.</span> <span id="s543">I suppose the whole Gestapo were laughing in their beers.</span> <span id="s544">But then the kultusgemeinde was permitted to set up a transport department and that made us think immediately, there are going to be more of those.</span> <span id="s545">Immediately a list of the apartments that were emptied out.</span> <span id="s546">Yes now I remember.</span> <span id="s547">My aunt and uncle were not in our apartment.</span> <span id="s548">They were in some tiny apartment of their own and we assumed that they were picked because they wanted apartments at that time.</span> <span id="s549">They also picked people who were very, they were well to do and we couldn’t understand why they were there.</span> <span id="s550">We really couldn’t understand it ourselves.</span> <span id="s551">If we had that much money that you didn’t finagle it out that somehow you could move.</span> <span id="s552">I had a very good friend whose father was a famous court psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s553">They took him away very, very early in the game because as a court psychiatrist he was known, he was called in in insurance fraud cases when people make up diseases and stuff like that and he had unmasked a couple of big fakes and so he was done away with very early in the game and on that first night of the knock on the door in 1941 his one surviving daughter was picked up because there was somebody who still knew that her father, why was that father taken away.</span> <span id="s554">There were many cases like that and she was in an apartment by herself.</span> <span id="s555">So then the transport department in the kultusgemeinde started to type lists.</span> <span id="s556">Lists of people who left apartments emptied out that were now available to the Germans.</span> <span id="s557">A couple of houses got bombed and shattered, not many.</span> <span id="s558">The English didn’t do very well, the Americans weren’t there yet.</span> <span id="s559">And to become a member of the transport department suddenly became a big deal and those transports, the other transports to Poland went on, every couple of months.</span> <span id="s560">We later found out that those people didn’t necessarily stay there where they were transported, they worked on all kinds of sites, camp sites.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Was the kultusgemeinde questioning where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, but you got no answers.</span> <span id="s563">To relocation sites it was called.</span> <span id="s564">They were being relocated.</span> <span id="s565">Some transports were distinctly old people, told they were coming to some old age home.</span> <span id="s566">Needless to say there was a big Jewish hospital that was emptied out in one transport.</span> <span id="s567">Kultusgemeinde, it was emptied out because they were going to another hospital.</span> <span id="s568">They needed the hospital.</span> <span id="s569">Innocuous answers.</span> <span id="s570">And then due to the fact that this kultusgemeinde transport department became a central filing system for them, what went on there for money or apartments, property, all kinds of things, the people who we worked there were important.</span> <span id="s571">There were only two...</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Did you realize this was a central filing system for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s574">I knew three days ahead of everybody else’s notice of doom.</span> <span id="s575">Then I saw suddenly so and so was going in two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Was there any way of forewarning people?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s578">Yes.</span> <span id="s579">I knew in the position I was in I probably was followed.</span> <span id="s580">I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s581">I also couldn’t use the phone.</span> <span id="s582">But my father went and told the people that we knew.</span> <span id="s583">The payoff, in quotes, was that I was put, or my father was put on a list to go to Theresienstadt rather than to Poland, and I was put on that same list because I was one of the crew working for the kultusgemeinde.</span> <span id="s584">That was one of, the transport before the last out of Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: When you saw your name and your father’s name...</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Well we knew that we were all going and there was very little left after that.</span> <span id="s587">The last nucleus that was left after that was mixed marriages, people who were half – Jewish, some almost immovable patients in hospitals...</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: In other words you knew you had to go somewheres?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: You knew that you had to go somewheres.</span> <span id="s590">It was made quite clear that this was some kind of a privileged group, and that we were called before, and we had to be the next morning with suitcases and as much as you could carry, which was already the privileged thing, somewheres on some rail depot in the suburb.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Was there ever a question when you saw your name, when you realized that everyone was going, of living underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, because we wouldn’t know how to handle it or where to go.</span> <span id="s593">Physically, or who to contact.</span> <span id="s594">At that point we had a few gentile friends bringing us mostly foodstuff, vegetables and fruit that you could get in the countryside if you could travel, but we couldn’t because of the star.</span> <span id="s595">We had also given the gentile side of mixed marriages, my mother had given some belongings, some small carpets, I think this one, no not this one, I have it on the outside, and some small fur pieces ( word missing in original transcript), and some silver she had put in a suitcase, that is in my papers.</span> <span id="s596">All contact then stopped.</span> <span id="s597">The cleaning woman kept on coming with the foodstuff, and she came at night.</span> <span id="s598">Decidedly all under cover of darkness.</span> <span id="s599">You couldn’t move even anywheres to us anytime in the daytime hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Was it possible at this time to shop at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s602">In certain stores at certain hours.</span> <span id="s603">There was a sign.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Were you abused, not physically, but verbally?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s606">All over, and in the street too.</span> <span id="s607">Usually by young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: By this time you mentioned not only the sense of abandonment, but your father had just given up, when your father or your mother or yourself, when you saw all these things, you couldn’t move anymore anywhere, what hope did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: That the war would be over.</span> <span id="s610">That they would lose.</span> <span id="s611">That was the only hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: But at that point the war was going well for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yes, it was going extremely well for Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: How did you keep going?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Who knows.</span> <span id="s616">I mean I personally kept going by being young and stupid.</span> <span id="s617">I mean whatever was the thing of the day at that age.</span> <span id="s618">What do you do about clothes?</span> <span id="s619">What do you do about having a period when there is a war and you don’t get any tampax?</span> <span id="s620">No lipstick.</span> <span id="s621">Oh God, you could get a lipstick somewhere.</span> <span id="s622">What about stupid things like that.</span> <span id="s623">About what do you do from potatoes seventeen ways in the way of recipes.</span> <span id="s624">About everyday things.</span> <span id="s625">My mother did fabulously in Germany by way of washing and mending socks for guys who worked extremely hard in gardens where there was foodstuff.</span> <span id="s626">She became a real eager beaver.</span> <span id="s627">.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Hoe did she make those contacts?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Jewish people we were in the barracks with.</span> <span id="s630">That we lived with.</span> <span id="s631">There was a whole lot of black market going on in Germany, but those people were just too afraid to approach us.</span> <span id="s632">So it had to be from people who really loved you, such as servants or business friends or neighbors who didn’t mind the danger and just wanted to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Were there such friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s635">The people that my mother gave the suitcases to or the people who brought fruit or occasionally a chicken or something like that that they had gone to the country to buy in the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: When you saw your name on the transports and you prepared to go did you have any idea what Theresienstadt was?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No.</span> <span id="s638">It was broadly advertised by the Gestapo as an old age camp, as an old age home and that this was a wholly different privileged kind of group.</span> <span id="s639">We bought it, or we wanted to.</span> <span id="s640">However, the realization came very quick that all wasn’t what it was cracked up to be because on the train, first of all we went on passenger trains sitting down in compartments, but in the building in the floor below in one of the other huge apartments lived an old couple that we had gotten friendly with, and on the train we were in the same compartment and he keeled over and my father took one look and said my Mr. Landau is dead, and then we called one of the guards on the train who didn’t react at all.</span> <span id="s641">And then somewheres on the route, I have no idea where, the train stopped and somebody came and pulled him out by the feet.</span> <span id="s642">Meanwhile she was a very old lady, she was completely hysterical.</span> <span id="s643">So that was the first inkling that this was no normal trip.</span> <span id="s644">I guess he had a heart attack and nobody checked whether he was dead or not either.</span> <span id="s645">My father said he was sure.</span> <span id="s646">That was the first body I ever saw.</span> <span id="s647">There were many more to come.</span> <span id="s648">But in getting to the camp, which was at night there were many Czechs that were Jews and there were Czechs that were guards and not all too many that were Germans.</span> <span id="s649">That was the advantage of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s650">Not too many Germans that you had direct contact with, that you got hit by, or screamed at by or whatever.</span> <span id="s651">That they said immediately what did you do, what work did you do, but in great detail, so I told them in great detail what I was doing at the kultusgemeinde and that turned out to be my salvation and that of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: I got immediately into the central administration of the camp.</span> <span id="s654">I hate typewriters to this very day I think because of all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: It was the Czechs that questioned you?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Germans and Czechs.</span> <span id="s657">Then we were very surprised.</span> <span id="s658">We all had flashlights and we all had tea in our luggage, and I remember how surprised we were that they took things from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: This was still on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, this was arriving in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: When you first arrived in Theresienstadt did you still have to go through a baggage check as you just mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s663">And they took what they wanted.</span> <span id="s664">That shocked us.</span> <span id="s665">Shocked us no end.</span> <span id="s666">How can they take this when it’s ours?</span> <span id="s667">That’s how stupid or believing or whatever.</span> <span id="s668">We then came to mass barracks which were old military barracks where everybody slept on the floor and mattresses and we thought that this was a matter of course.</span> <span id="s669">This wasn’t very shocking.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: When you say, Theresienstadt was set up in 1942...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No it was set up before.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: I mean the first deportations were in spring, 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: No.</span> <span id="s674">Rosh Hashanah 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: So you were among the first to come to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No.</span> <span id="s677">There were many Czechs there before.</span> <span id="s678">I don’t know when my transport got there in the fall of 1942, but there were many Czechs there from the beginning of the war on.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: But the German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: German Jews, there were some there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: When you came into these barracks what were your impressions of Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I know that we rationalized it.</span> <span id="s683">You had so much to cope with.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: That’s really what I’m after.</span> <span id="s685">What kind of things to cope with?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Cope with real things like where do I go to the john now.</span> <span id="s687">So impressions, it made little difference, you had to find a modus operandi and you had to find where your mattress is and where your food came from and where you could wash yourself and that’s you were probably busy with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: You were assigned a barracks and you were given a ticket to go for food which I’ve still got somewhere, and you were told where to report for work.</span> <span id="s690">So it was click click, like in the army.</span> <span id="s691">Every hour on the hour you had to be somewheres, you had to go somewheres, and it became a tremendously busy place.</span> <span id="s692">And if you stopped yourself to think about that or if you were too sick or too weak to follow this tremendous curriculum that you had, that’s when you died from sheer sickness and illness and exhaustion.</span> <span id="s693">As long as you were physically able to stay with this terribly strenuous getting out, go get this black stuff coffee, and some kind of (word missing in original transcription) and some kind of bread, if you were well enough to get up at five and to go for it and to go to where you go for your work assignment and to go back to do, there was a lunch break, a big one, and see that you could go to and stand in line long enough to get the soup and then maybe get back and you walked far enough to get you to the barracks and rest for an hour.</span> <span id="s694">The rest of your two hour noon break, and then be ready again for your afternoon work assignment and the see like that my mother that she had something done or had found something or had hustled up something that we could eat at night and then find an hour that you could wash yourself and your clothes, and by eight o’clock it was always dark in the barracks at night and yak where did you come from and where did you come from what (word missing in original transcription).</span> <span id="s695">As long as you could stand that pace and take part in it, you were fine, until the transports went from there, but many people and of course older people, couldn’t cope with that.</span> <span id="s696">They were too weak and got sick and then infection and sheer dirt and the viruses that come with diarrhea and exhaustion and dehydration and no medication, that’s what killed all the old people.</span> <span id="s697">They all died a natural death by leaning back.</span> <span id="s698">And one sister of my mother we met there from another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: By accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: By accident.</span> <span id="s701">I mean they had moved to the next larger city and the transport had gotten them there because he was decorated in the first world war and he got sick, and many of these barracks had attics.</span> <span id="s702">Huge attics.</span> <span id="s703">Attics like you might see in a huge school building and there were floors there for the mattresses.</span> <span id="s704">The last transport got in the attic because it was the worst.</span> <span id="s705">It rained and it snowed and you had to go down to go to the johns.</span> <span id="s706">They were on one of these attic floors and he caught a cold.</span> <span id="s707">He was dead in three days and she said I don’t want anymore.</span> <span id="s708">She died two days later.</span> <span id="s709">When I asked you what made you interested, those two children, my cousins, didn’t ever want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s710">They felt so bad, they felt so guilty about having been there with the parents being there</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: They got out on children’s transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, they got out, the daughter got out, her husband was very well off financially, and the son was a very young guy and got out to England shortly before.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: I mean they weren’t young children any more.</span> <span id="s714">They were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: A son my age, a daughter considerably older and they just don’t want to hear anything.</span> <span id="s716">I mean they don’t know how it happened, why it happened, where it happened.</span> <span id="s717">We brought, when we came here after the war we brought a death certificate because you need it for financial arrangements as you probably know by nowadays for the gutmacher and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s718">They didn’t even want that.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Just going back to Theresienstadt’s conditions.</span> <span id="s720">What were the sanitary conditions like?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Not bad.</span> <span id="s722">It was a barracks built by Maria Theresa.</span> <span id="s723">Now think of it, eighteenth century army barracks as crude as it was we lived like people lived in the eighteenth century.</span> <span id="s724">The outdoor johns that were like a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s725">I don’t know how the sewer system went.</span> <span id="s726">Some had johns, the smaller building, on every floor.</span> <span id="s727">Typhoid only came when transports came back from other camps and brought it with them.</span> <span id="s728">The worse thing we had were lice and vermin and those things that come with not washing and not enough water.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: So there was not enough water.</span> <span id="s730">How did people wash?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Pumps, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Theresienstadt is cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Not as cold as here.</span> <span id="s734">You get winter with snow and you got, there were some stoves.</span> <span id="s735">Now I forget where we got the coal, to heat some water at times.</span> <span id="s736">That’s what I mean with being busy.</span> <span id="s737">You had to organize this.</span> <span id="s738">You had to be a hustler.</span> <span id="s739">You had to be a black marketeer.</span> <span id="s740">I got terribly upset at orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s741">It colored my whole outlook.</span> <span id="s742">Those were the biggest hustlers and the biggest dealers.</span> <span id="s743">Oh my God.</span> <span id="s744">There was one in our barracks.</span> <span id="s745">I’ll never forget this Mister Katz.</span> <span id="s746">He was a shoemaker by trade.</span> <span id="s747">He was very, very orthodox, and fixing shoes was as important as anything.</span> <span id="s748">So he worked for the guards and he had forever some canned meat, and we forever could see him opening these cans and eating meat out of these cans.</span> <span id="s749">And with a little old lady so sick.</span> <span id="s750">Too sick to go out and get something to eat because you had to stand in line for it in the rain or the snow or whatever, and this guy wouldn’t offer anybody anything.</span> <span id="s751">We had many books written by the Czech young people about the characters and it brought out the worst and the best in people.</span> <span id="s752">In many ways you can equate the situation, let’s say with what happens in a blackout.</span> <span id="s753">It absolutely brought out the worst and the best.</span> <span id="s754">It did tremendous things to marriages.</span> <span id="s755">They were cracked.</span> <span id="s756">I mean people were sleeping with each other.</span> <span id="s757">That was the end of their mate, left and right.</span> <span id="s758">The only...</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: There was no privacy I take it.</span> <span id="s760">Were the barracks men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No separate.</span> <span id="s762">And the ones where you could get privacy.</span> <span id="s763">It was blankets or something.</span> <span id="s764">Or there was a room.</span> <span id="s765">People used to rent out that room for that purpose.</span> <span id="s766">Now singles fooled around much less, because you knew getting pregnant was the absolute living end.</span> <span id="s767">I mean that could get you shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s768">Your fear was the best detriment.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Why did that only apply to singles?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Well that’s what we could never figure out.</span> <span id="s771">I guess maybe being young and not old we figured the married people knew better, but that was the only detriment.</span> <span id="s772">But at least if oldest would be so and best marriages were cracking up because all those guys fooled around.</span> <span id="s773">I mean this barracks room full of women and lets say this, it was like four guys walking in the dormitory in another building.</span> <span id="s774">It was the only sport or entertainment.</span> <span id="s775">No it wasn’t in Theresienstadt, I don’t know if you know there was this huge whole movie set up there was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s776">There are many books written on that and concerts set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Concerts I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: There was this famous movie that even channel 13 had on it about a movie director by the name of Mr. Gasson was talked into by the Germans into making a fake movie out of this paradise Theresienstadt, where children played and it was.........</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: What I was going to ask, was there any hierarchy that developed in terms of one could do better if one...?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Oh very much.</span> <span id="s781">Oh very much.</span> <span id="s782">Amongst the Jews you mean.</span> <span id="s783">There was already a hierarchy that was brought in by the Germans as such.</span> <span id="s784">They were called prominenta and they were actors or scientists and they lived a little different, our rabbi arrived as such a privileged person.</span> <span id="s785">We resented it very much because he was just another rabbi, with his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Who was your rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: (word missing in original transcription) ‘s father.</span> <span id="s788">(word missing in original transcription) who has that congregation over there, and people say you know, what makes him different.</span> <span id="s789">We accepted it if it was famous physicians or scientists, writers, or even stage people or movie actors.</span> <span id="s790">That was quite accepted that they had rooms with their wives by themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Did you understand the rationale as to why they were treated differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s793">The rationale was that these people had contacts that possibly they could get through to in the outside world, and that the Germans wanted to give them some kind of modicum of normalcy there, of that they were really just being in a different location.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: When Theresienstadt got more and more crowded......</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: As soon as it got overcrowded the transports started to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: That’s what I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s797">When that first transport went were people aware of what it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: No.</span> <span id="s799">Nobody was aware of what it meant until the very end.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: What did they think?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: It’s going to another camp.</span> <span id="s802">There were people who volunteered for that reason.</span> <span id="s803">Then the opposite happened.</span> <span id="s804">I don’t know if you heard about it, but there was a very famous transport going to Switzerland, and it went there and it was bought and the Germans made an enormous amount of money.</span> <span id="s805">This was one of those fabulous deals.</span> <span id="s806">I don’t know how much money they asked per head.</span> <span id="s807">Nobody volunteered because we didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Not only that, but how would one have paid for that from Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Oh it was a matter of the family somewheres else.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay, so then the choice would have been made on that basis.</span> <span id="s811">When the Red Cross came, Theresienstadt was always used for kind of a model for the Red Cross, were the people in Theresienstadt aware of the Red Cross being there as visitors?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: To a degree, yes, but it was first of all when the SS walked around, one stayed away physically as far as one possibly could, and so when you saw those cars coming through or a couple of those SS people walking with somebody else you went to the other side of the road if you could, because normally meant to encounter these people if nothing else terrible verbal abuse, so you didn’t know if they were Red Cross or anything.</span> <span id="s813">The only time we were aware of the Red Cross was when the Russians took over the camp at the end.</span> <span id="s814">There was talk at the end about extermination when we knew what was happening at the other camps, about an extermination area being built at Theresienstadt and that the Red Cross offered the commander a passport out through the Russians if he would stop it, and even some of the literature said that they could prove it that he bought and he got out and that they never found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: You mentioned that your father adapted very well to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s816">Can you explain that a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Both of them did.</span> <span id="s818">Both of my parents did.</span> <span id="s819">He became like the superintendent of this, now this was a small building we were in.</span> <span id="s820">He became like the superintendent.</span> <span id="s821">He also worked in a place that gave out uniforms to people who worked in factories like overalls.</span> <span id="s822">Some kind of fumigation or laundry process.</span> <span id="s823">There were several war essential industries around it where people would march to and fro for people to work in their factories.</span> <span id="s824">And I think he suddenly got a sense of that he liked to have something to do all day.</span> <span id="s825">It gave him some of his values back, not certainly in money, but the frustration of not being able to do anything anymore, and there he had a busy day.</span> <span id="s826">He also, anything that was done religiously had to be done on the sly, so to speak, services.</span> <span id="s827">He organized some of those.</span> <span id="s828">He had a good voice.</span> <span id="s829">When there were only ten men he could be cantor for the evening.</span> <span id="s830">My mother was very good in black market deals.</span> <span id="s831">She organized food therefore with the laundry and mending things.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: What do you mean laundry?</span> <span id="s833">You talked about mending things.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: She laundered things for guys who were by themselves because being clean was terribly important.</span> <span id="s835">The Czechs got packages all the time.</span> <span id="s836">Czech guards let in their packages so the Czechs had all this stuff that we didn’t even have in Germany before the camps such as soap, cosmetics or Kotex or whatever some of those things.</span> <span id="s837">They came in from Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: You mean the Czech guards let the Czech Jews have packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">There were deals made.</span> <span id="s841">The Czech Jews were very nationalistic Czechs.</span> <span id="s842">We don’t understand how they can all turn into Communists by now, but anyway very chauvinistic, and they were not very friendly to the German Jews.</span> <span id="s843">A big, big division in the camp.</span> <span id="s844">The other division was a generation gap.</span> <span id="s845">This camp was full of young Czech people.</span> <span id="s846">Suddenly there came all these old German people, veterans of the first world war and their families, so there was a whole culture clash there amongst the inmates.</span> <span id="s847">That built another hierarchy, the Czechs who had gotten there first, who had reorganized and made that place livable with a Jewish administration calling the shots and giving out (word missing in original transcript) jobs and cushiony jobs and who worked in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: When the Germans, how did they feel about the Czechs being in control...?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: They couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s850">They got out of that camp whatever they were supposed to get out of it which was mostly labor for those factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: I mean how did the Germans who came...?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Oh you mean the German Jews.</span> <span id="s853">We were flabbergasted.</span> <span id="s854">The young Czechs had the attitude you let it happen.</span> <span id="s855">You know, just another bunch of Germans.</span> <span id="s856">We were very, we had, then of course there was a language barrier, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s857">And anybody who was anybody spoke Czech only.</span> <span id="s858">They made a point of speaking Czech only, except in the administration building, where the Germans being German, they had to speak German.</span> <span id="s859">So I was in a group, again I was in the transport department and there was a group of about fourteen typewriters around a huge round table on a three shift going day and night, would you believe.</span> <span id="s860">Typing lists of both people who had arrived and making lists of people who went, alphabetically, by nationality, I mean statistics, whichever way you can imagine.</span> <span id="s861">At that point grouped by ages, we had already Dutch people in the camp at that point.</span> <span id="s862">There were several statistics that I hid at that time, breakdowns and totals of come and gone that the Beck Institute wanted soon after I arrived.</span> <span id="s863">I gave it to them.</span> <span id="s864">They have a great deal by the way of this, I don’t know if you...</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Yes I know the archivist there, especially since Leo Beck was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: He was one of those prominenta that got the special treatment and the special rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: That’s why I asked who the rabbi was, but I forgot it was from Frankfurt, he was from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: He was a nobody.</span> <span id="s869">That’s why we resented him being on one of those over privileged people, but at the administration there was a Juden (word missing from original transcript), who after all, I mean 30,000 people, that’s quite a job.</span> <span id="s870">They had to report too to the commandant every day about illness and deaths, natural deaths, and about people who were called to the commander and appeared again and naturally got trucked (word missing from original transcript) somewheres else or killed on the spot, whatever.</span> <span id="s871">And systematically every one of those Jude (word missing from original transcript), Jewish heads got killed.</span> <span id="s872">There was one famous guy, one fabulous guy from Berlin, Dr. Epstein.</span> <span id="s873">I guess it was the daily contact, I guess the Germans felt this guy knows it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Let me ask you, you mentioned before, lice was a big problem.</span> <span id="s875">How did you manage to keep some kind of cleanliness under these conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I mean by working hard at it.</span> <span id="s877">You got up early enough in the morning to get some water, and you had to wash your hair and you had you had to organize yourself some curlers or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: What did you do for shampoo or soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: We got it on the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did the Germans or Czechs realize such a black market went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I’m sure they did because they were part of it.</span> <span id="s882">They took.</span> <span id="s883">The Czechs had many friends in the neighborhood, it was very close to Prague and Czechs being Czechs they had the hate of the Germans in common.</span> <span id="s884">Also some of those girls slept with the guards whenever they could.</span> <span id="s885">I had one girl I was friendly with, boy was she an operator.</span> <span id="s886">Very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s887">We went one night, one of the guards told her she slept with, potatoes were coming at night, so she said to the guard get her some and he said I can’t do that, they see me take they know damn well who I take for, you got to come and get it yourself, so when he said come and get it I let some fall all over the truck, so we were there some four in the morning in the back of some barracks, then you had to organize something.</span> <span id="s888">You didn’t have any shopping bags of any kind, so you had to organize something that you could make a sack of.</span> <span id="s889">This became big adventures.</span> <span id="s890">We had a ball.</span> <span id="s891">I learned some Czech.</span> <span id="s892">It was essential.</span> <span id="s893">I still speak some Czech because of that and to be part of that group, you didn’t have any fun or you couldn’t go to the concerts or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Let me ask you, did you know anybody who did become pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: No, but I’m pretty sure that there were enough doctors there to abort.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Did the doctors in the barracks in Theresienstadt, I realize that they didn’t have much to work with...</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: No, but there was a building there for them where they could work with whatever they had.</span> <span id="s898">There was some stuff, the worst thing that there wasn’t was any medications, but there were instruments and I remember having horrible luck, you got infections that got pussy for a long time because of lack of vitamins, lack of antibiotics and I had you know a horrible thing opened up under my foot and they had it taken care of they said they couldn’t treat teeth.</span> <span id="s899">There was nothing you could do, you had to have them pulled.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: There were dentists?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s902">It was the entire community and it was a very bright, smart, well to do community.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: How did they if you had to go to a dentist, did they have such a thing as novocaine or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: I forget.</span> <span id="s905">I forget.</span> <span id="s906">I only remember I had pyorrhea and lost my teeth because of the two teeth that I had out and later on I couldn’t get those two teeth replaced.</span> <span id="s907">They got loose and the gums started to go and it wasn’t recognized here until I was already here for five years.</span> <span id="s908">It’s irreversible once it really starts.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Let me ask you, if you didn’t have anything to trade in Theresienstadt...?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: You died I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: What types of things, you mentioned laundry, you mentioned young women in terms of sex, what types of things could you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Well for instance, my mother was kosher and she used to kosher at that point and she wouldn’t eat the meat and I didn’t care much for the meat and I really didn’t care so we said I’ve got this meat I got yesterday, what are you going to give me.</span> <span id="s913">I’d rather have bread and margarine instead of meat, and there were these packages that the Czechs got.</span> <span id="s914">Then there were things that you could get at times.</span> <span id="s915">You could get I don’t know how often you could get a blouse or a dress against stamps like food stamps.</span> <span id="s916">Like rations, right.</span> <span id="s917">Or you brought your woolen socks because obviously stockings wouldn’t last so we tried to get heavy stockings and then somebody arrived with six pairs of new socks in their luggage from an incoming transport or you had, as I said some of these cultural activities.</span> <span id="s918">I was always in a position to get tickets because of the jobs.</span> <span id="s919">I sold many of those tickets.</span> <span id="s920">My father got sick once with one of those bouts of diarrhea.</span> <span id="s921">They were deadly, because you got dehydrated and you didn’t have anything that was good enough soup that the body would keep, so you knew had to keep feeding people, or one, two, three, it went that fast.</span> <span id="s922">The weight loss anyway was one of the main problems.</span> <span id="s923">And there was, we are still very friendly, a woman who worked in the kitchen who stole and brought it to my father and when she was through with her turn of duty, whatever hours it was, just because she worked in that kitchen and her husband was an invalid and my mother saw to it that the husband ate whatever she left and prepared for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Was there contact then between the men’s barracks and the women’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s926">Also there were smaller buildings such as ours where it was just separate rooms.</span> <span id="s927">Or in the case of our building it was a private home originally.</span> <span id="s928">The rooms were just door to door.</span> <span id="s929">Like here was one room where there were twelve men and this was the room where there were the twelve corresponding women and daughters, you know that way.</span> <span id="s930">And my father was in (word missing from original transcript) when he was so ill and he was in the next room on the same floor and without our friend Claire in the kitchen bringing something every day and she always said don’t worry about Mr. Wertheimer, we’ll get him through.</span> <span id="s931">I’ll see what I can get, and she simply stole the kind of thing we normally wouldn’t have gotten near it.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Did the guards close an eye?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yes the guards closed an eye or also in many instances due to this huge amount of people there were many, many Jewish guards that closed both eyes.</span> <span id="s934">Some of them as in many situations were pure finks, you know people making brownie points, making profits out of those situations.</span> <span id="s935">There were Jewish cops all over.</span> <span id="s936">They had to be tough because Jews are crooks the way other people are crooks, and there was stealing going on and beatings and what not.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: When, you mentioned that you saw the first body on the train going to Theresienstadt, that there were many more to come, how were you able to deal with all this death?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: The bodies going by, I guess by being very young and those people are old that died.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: How about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Well it affected them much more because the people who died were their age, and in retrospect when you think about it now, they weren’t old.</span> <span id="s941">Think about it.</span> <span id="s942">My mother was born ’95 and say, she wasn’t fifty, but at that time for me those were old people.</span> <span id="s943">That’s what I mean by generation gap.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Speaking of generation gap were most of the young people you were with were they mostly German or mostly Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: There were 95% Czech.</span> <span id="s946">There were no German young people unless they were in some kind of funny position like I was in.</span> <span id="s947">So all my friends from the camp are Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: How did you make sure, or could anyone make sure that you weren’t on a list to be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: There was no such list.</span> <span id="s950">It was made up on the spot.</span> <span id="s951">Whenever the call came.</span> <span id="s952">The call to the German commanders must have come from someplace far away, wherever the next higher up Gestapo set up was.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: When did you become aware where these transports were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Only when they came back.</span> <span id="s955">There was a point near the end when the Germans were already retreating and had to evacuate camps less they be found out which they didn’t want at the time.</span> <span id="s956">They brought people from Auschwitz and from Ravensbruck back in trains to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s957">That was the (word missing from original transcript), people who left Theresienstadt shortly before the end.</span> <span id="s958">There must have been, in the winter I guess, from ’44 to ’45 and that was the shocking thing.</span> <span id="s959">Up till then I was, well just to backtrack quickly, I was in two transports, no my parents were in two transports, on the list twice, from Theresienstadt away to another camp, you didn’t know where, and twice I volunteered to go with my parents, what’s the use of my sitting here, I didn’t know where I was going and they were going.</span> <span id="s960">Twice, in front of the train, did the Germans say, anyone here from administration, out, back to work now, and my parents with us, and their group, and we took whatever we had, packages and bundles, and went back to work.</span> <span id="s961">Looked at each other, back to work, screaming back.</span> <span id="s962">No idea that the train would have left without us twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: When you had to go back to the living quarters were all your things still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Untouched.</span> <span id="s965">It was much too fast.</span> <span id="s966">They didn’t why they sent us back, and the irony of this beautifully organized system, there were rooms full of filing cards as I said from every angle.</span> <span id="s967">Who died, family relationships, where they had come from, I mean demographics of all the people who had passed through that which were thousands and thousands.</span> <span id="s968">And they blew it all up.</span> <span id="s969">In the end they took it all to the commandanture building.</span> <span id="s970">I had to be carted there by people because there weren’t any trucks or horses, in carts, boxes and boxes and filing cabinets and whatever, and then they blew it up.</span> <span id="s971">Enough of us had something to pull it together, so that’s why, the main files of people who had been there and all their statistics are in Prague</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: What kept you going all that time, It was a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Three years.</span> <span id="s974">Well for many, one thing was certain, a great deal of good camaraderie, I mean you are all in this together, and you make the most of that, and as I said to you when we started the story, the best part of it is Lewis.</span> <span id="s975">That if you have people that you are together with that you love and you have, the food was terrible, but it was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Did you ever get meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes and we got a lot of horse meat too.</span> <span id="s978">One day by the time I had finally got my mother to eat meat, one of our friends sent over, she was in the kitchen too, as a supervisor.</span> <span id="s979">She sent over and was active in noon break.</span> <span id="s980">I’ll never forget that, and said tell your mother not to eat the meat today, they were also very kosher, it’s horse, so I come flying there from this office, and said mother did you eat, Theresa said you shouldn’t eat it it’s horse, and with that my mother threw up.</span> <span id="s981">She ate it.</span> <span id="s982">It would have been stupid to tell her, but there were many good times and then there was this relationships with a whole lot of single guys there and I guess the thing that kept you going was this relentless time pact that you knew that if you just sat on that mattress and you just went to work and back, you didn’t get anything to eat, you didn’t get your clothes clean, you didn’t get your socks washed and you saw, talking about the many bodies, they just died on their mattress, and then they were carted out, and there were a group of people who had to take care of bodies, and they put them in all these (word missing from original transcript) and they put them in a corner and there were four there and three there.</span> <span id="s983">It all went so fast.</span> <span id="s984">You realized how thin people were because one person could carry out a body like nothing, and sometimes they would let a regular funeral take place, mass funerals, and the coffins were this shape, only about this wide and this was plenty big because people only weighed about one hundred pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Was it usual to have coffins?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: In Theresienstadt I think it was usual, but coffins were like plywood.</span> <span id="s987">It wasn’t what wood you might have seen as a coffin.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Who made them” Who supplied them?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: There was a shop in the camp.</span> <span id="s990">Prisoners.</span> <span id="s991">I don’t know whether it went on till the end.</span> <span id="s992">I know that when they buried my uncle and aunt and I know we went when they buried, then you got an escort, there was nothing, but fields around the camp, there were no religious right near by, so that when you walked out with the guard, maybe if you had started running you would have been shot in the, there was no use to run.</span> <span id="s993">Some young people with the Czechs did escape.</span> <span id="s994">There were some who made deals with the guards to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: How many, what the percentage of German SS, I don’t mean necessarily SS guards there as opposed to Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: I don’t remember, but there were very few.</span> <span id="s997">That was in essence the difference of Theresienstadt amongst other things that had to do with (word missing from original transcript).</span> <span id="s998">There was a camp nearby which was the horror of all horrors.</span> <span id="s999">A prison, and you only knew whichever one got taken from our cap to a prison called Die Kleine Festung that they wouldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1000">Nobody ever came back and that you found that all these things afterwards.</span> <span id="s1001">You knew that the outside world.</span> <span id="s1002">Somehow you knew that whatever was out there was worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: When these people came back from transports from Auschwitz or people who had been in Theresienstadt, what was the mood like when you found out what was going on in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Oh that was awful.</span> <span id="s1005">Furthermore the way they looked, that was the first eye opener.</span> <span id="s1006">In most of the camps they had their hair shorn, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1007">We only did if people couldn’t get rid of the lice again and again, but then other than that having your hair done right was a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">(new tape) about the American who came to look for his mother and I helped him to look through the material that we still had and he came to the conclusion that his mother had, not that she had been sent somewheres else, but that she had never been in the camp, and he came back with food and after a couple of days with the offer to write for me to my family in America, which he did, and after a couple of days I got from the Red Cross a telegram which I still have.</span> <span id="s1009">Don’t worry, say what you want, we’ll get you out, let us know what we can send.</span> <span id="s1010">Well what America didn’t realize and what we realized very much was that we were hermetically sealed to anything.</span> <span id="s1011">There was no mail.</span> <span id="s1012">There were never mind Russians, it didn’t matter, there were no Russians, no Americans, there were no cars.</span> <span id="s1013">The Red Cross was the only link to the world.</span> <span id="s1014">But the Red Cross did send immediately food parcels and clothing, so that when my family got the telegram that we didn’t want anything and that we would let them know where we would go to next, they couldn’t understand why we didn’t want anything.</span> <span id="s1015">It must be very strange, in retrospect one of the strangest things to realize that money is everything.</span> <span id="s1016">That money even under those circumstances was everything.</span> <span id="s1017">I forgot a strange story in the middle of it all.</span> <span id="s1018">In the middle of an evening in the barracks talking about our trip to Theresienstadt amongst the women before you went to sleep for you could only talk for entertainment, and everybody said what they had smuggled in and what they had brought or what the guards had taken, and my mother was explaining, my mother wore very proper corsets, with these bones, stays, and my had to explain how she in Frankfurt had sat down and carefully wrapped 100 marks, bills behind the stays and how her daughter who was the over conscientious employee of this Jewish kultusgemeinde had take them out, because I had heard of people getting shot on the spot from being searched and found and here out.</span> <span id="s1019">That’s what kept on coming back to us in the office all the time.</span> <span id="s1020">I didn’t tell that to my mother.</span> <span id="s1021">I just told my mother you’re going to go on the trip to the camp with that, I’m not going with you.</span> <span id="s1022">Just take it out.</span> <span id="s1023">So she said as she showed the lady on the next mattress.</span> <span id="s1024">I had done such a beautiful job of sewing I have to show it to you and as she was showing she had forgotten to take out two so she had two hundred marks were in for a long time for all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1025">You never heard the end of that from my mother that stupid me made her take the rest out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Well let me ask you how did you take the two hundred marks and use it?</span> <span id="s1027">How did you convert it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Convert it.</span> <span id="s1029">By Czech young people.</span> <span id="s1030">We never asked.</span> <span id="s1031">It went for whatever was the most important.</span> <span id="s1032">It could have been aspirins.</span> <span id="s1033">It could have been toilet paper a terribly important item.</span> <span id="s1034">It could have been jam which was very important because it contained sugar and went with a lot of different things.</span> <span id="s1035">You could put it on potatoes if you were sick and tired of the daily routine of potatoes, and a jar of jam is a compact something that you can get in and out of the camp easily enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: But if you have say a hundred mark bill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: I don’t know how long it went or what we did with it, but the guy, whoever the Czech was that my mother made the deal with broke it down, so obviously it was through the guards, but money made a great many things possible.</span> <span id="s1038">Money made it possible that you could live in Germany in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: When you were in Theresienstadt waiting to leave, did you still have any money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yes we had then money from the UNRRA whatever they gave us which was, they asked us where you wanted to go and they gave us, I think it was the American occupation money, because there was no German currency, and we said we didn’t want to stay in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Was there ever a question as to where you would go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Well yes there was a question.</span> <span id="s1043">The question was one of two places.</span> <span id="s1044">UNRRA opened a camp, really a rest camp in Bavaria called Dechsendorf, I don’t know if you heard about it.</span> <span id="s1045">I’m sure you will.</span> <span id="s1046">Dechsendorf, It was an American Jewish camp to make people recuperate in the mountains in a very pretty part, just to feed people up and make you sit down and catch your breath and see what you wanted to do, or to go to the city where you had come from where they said the authorities were responsible for what would happen to you.</span> <span id="s1047">So we said what are we going to do, sit in Bavaria in another camp to catch our breath?</span> <span id="s1048">We were physically in fairly good shape.</span> <span id="s1049">We were ninety pounds each, the three of us, but other than that we were in good shape and looking forward to what was happening next.</span> <span id="s1050">And so we said we had made the connect to my uncle here.</span> <span id="s1051">He had made it quite clear in very terse communications that he was now in the money.</span> <span id="s1052">He just kept telegrammimg, don’t worry about anything anymore.</span> <span id="s1053">We’ll take care of everything.</span> <span id="s1054">Also there were seven brothers and sisters, my mother was the only one who came out.</span> <span id="s1055">That was the other side of the coin for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: He and your mother then were the only two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: The only survivors.</span> <span id="s1058">And the other thing was my father said what if I can claim any insurance or whatever it’s where I’m on the tax rolls, and I said if I want to have any papers, if there is ever going to be an American consulate anywheres or anything, we heard that the Americans were all over Frankfurt, then I want to be in Frankfurt, then I’m going to be right there.</span> <span id="s1059">I knew there were people who would put us up.</span> <span id="s1060">I didn’t feel now like going from one camp, Theresienstadt had become that rest camp at that point.</span> <span id="s1061">You got clean mattresses, you got clothes, you even got a cardboard suitcase from the UNRRA and the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1062">You had medical supervision.</span> <span id="s1063">You had all kinds of shots and you got food, so we figured out are we going to sit in Bavaria, we might as well stay here until and when the roads were cleared, to have those buses go.</span> <span id="s1064">And trips by themselves were adventures at that time so (word missing in original transcription) just relax.</span> <span id="s1065">They were horrendous.</span> <span id="s1066">There was no gas and what was normally an eight hour bus ride turned into two days or longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Could you laugh about it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1069">It was hilarious.</span> <span id="s1070">We slept with farmers on these big eiderdown bed things.</span> <span id="s1071">We laughed because they looked, they had never seen Jews or prisoners.</span> <span id="s1072">We slept in these big farmhouses with the cows and the chickens outside.</span> <span id="s1073">The bus had to stop and these American I suppose had made these arrangements before us, for money you can get......</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">(new tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: I’ve come across in reading, they talk about building Theresienstadt to make it into a “model” camp so that when they had visitors it was presentable.</span> <span id="s1076">When they were building this up was there anticipation of visits by the Red Cross or foreigners coming in to see what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s1078">I mentioned in one of our previous discussions, I think I mentioned A European movie director who worked himself in a dream of glory to his death by filming these mock up model set ups.</span> <span id="s1079">But it wasn’t really, the word building is exaggerated in that context.</span> <span id="s1080">They fixed up places so blatantly phony and so quickly under such strict orders that they had to be finished that night and this project had to be finished that night, and the things that were erected were so ludicrous that we all knew that somebody must be coming, that it could not possibly be the real thing.</span> <span id="s1081">For instance there would be an open space and suddenly small merry – go – rounds would be set up there.</span> <span id="s1082">Talking about ridiculous things in the camp.</span> <span id="s1083">My mother was part of a cleaning brigade.</span> <span id="s1084">That was part of her activity during the whole time in the camp, scrub woman.</span> <span id="s1085">They had to mop the sidewalks in front of these old barracks dating back from Maria Theresa in Theresienstadt, so it became a very laughable kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: When these visitors did come, were you aware of their visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes, but the areas were cordoned off, so far.</span> <span id="s1088">And there was so much SS around, it was quite besides the point whether you were aware or not.</span> <span id="s1089">It made little difference.</span> <span id="s1090">There were performances in quotes for those visitors, usually by children’s groups.</span> <span id="s1091">Children were kept separate in a so called children’s home which normally was a barracks ran by, not all children, but most, ran by Jewish prisoners, and at that time all the children would get new dresses and they would play ring – around – a – rosy or march across to the merry – go – round.</span> <span id="s1092">There was also I remember at one time all of this movie director quick got on film while this was in progress this set up.</span> <span id="s1093">There was an outdoor cafe and some people were commandeered to sit in the outdoor cafe and chat while these visitors were walking through.</span> <span id="s1094">Visiting government dignitaries that you might see anywhere smack left and right by police and SS, so yes of course we were aware.</span> <span id="s1095">It didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1096">We just thought, we were hoping that these people would see through these ridiculously freshly painted setup with flowers and there were flags, maypoles, and that kind of silliness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: What did they do with all the people?</span> <span id="s1098">The barracks were built for what 9,000 people or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: They took them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a transit camp.</span> <span id="s1101">That was the idea.</span> <span id="s1102">That was the idea that we didn’t know then.</span> <span id="s1103">I told you that we were in the trains or ready to go in the trains.</span> <span id="s1104">It was a transit camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: I meant in preparation for this visit specifically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Oh it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1107">I mean the real thing was never seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did they put people in attics especially for this visit or crowd them even more than normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: No.</span> <span id="s1110">They just utilized the areas that were usually cordoned off and we were not permitted to enter.</span> <span id="s1111">They belonged to the German commandant fuhrer administration buildings.</span> <span id="s1112">They were vegetable gardens that the Germans had.</span> <span id="s1113">There was a church there that was always closed and cordoned off.</span> <span id="s1114">An old, old church, around that side there were flower pots and people were permitted to go there, so it didn’t make a bit of difference to life in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1115">The one or two things that everybody enjoyed were outdoor concerts.</span> <span id="s1116">People could go outside and hear that while there, there was a Czech symphony, you might have heard about it, a very famous conductor, and they were asked to play for these people.</span> <span id="s1117">They got all the instruments they ever wanted for this occasion, a month of rehearsals before, and there were some fabulous concerts.</span> <span id="s1118">Of course everybody enjoyed just going outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: After these visitors left was there a feeling of abandonment, or it must have been very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Feeling of nothing.</span> <span id="s1121">It didn’t make one bit of difference.</span> <span id="s1122">Nobody said who is it, why are they here, as long as, the highest building was the commanding officers, the commander’s main administration, it used to be the old city hall and school in this little town and there was this swastika flag flying, above everything, and as long as that flag was there and everybody could see it, the difference it made.</span> <span id="s1123">That was I guess the main thought behind it, the difference it made.</span> <span id="s1124">We are here, the SS are all around us, whoever they were talking to, we didn’t know who these people were, there was no way of knowing who these visitors were.</span> <span id="s1125">It could have been a bunch of other Germans.</span> <span id="s1126">We didn’t know, neither did we care.</span> <span id="s1127">It was so outside of our realm, as if now in one’s daily life discusses whether you buy a Jaguar or Rolls Royce, what do you care.</span> <span id="s1128">It didn’t affect you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Towards the end of the war as Auschwitz was liberated by the Russians, as Belsen was liberated, more and more people came to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1131">That’s when we got typhoid and the truth together.</span> <span id="s1132">That was one of the worst times despite the fact that we heard that liberation was close, but we had heard what went on, in the meantime we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: When you say they brought typhoid and the truth, these people who had come in from marches from those places?</span> <span id="s1134">How did you begin to hear the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: There were for a time.</span> <span id="s1136">Before they were in separate barracks, and we heard there was a quarantine started.</span> <span id="s1137">The rumor mill was tremendous in places like this, when there is no other news rumors are (word missing in original transcription) and you could visit, and there were Czech guards and they let you in to that part of the camp until they quarantined off for good when more and more people got sick and you found people that you knew.</span> <span id="s1138">That you wanted to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: You mentioned that people who were coming back from Auschwitz or wherever they were coming from were in separate barracks.</span> <span id="s1140">What made you think you knew somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: As I said, the grapevine told immediately that these people who were there were some people who had been in the camp before.</span> <span id="s1142">In Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1143">And then we heard that there were Czech people there from this city, in that, usually transports had something to do with locality, and the minute that that got known people from Prague went to these barracks and asked who was here.</span> <span id="s1144">Also conversely the people in those barracks asked is my brother here, I’m so and so, ask around is my brother here, is my mother here, or is my boyfriend here.</span> <span id="s1145">So that immediately became a dialogue.</span> <span id="s1146">Then the guards got stricter as more people had typhoid and you were not permitted to talk to those returning prisoners anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: When you first did talk to them, I’m not specifically referring to you going, but whoever did, was the the, it must have been a terrific shock throughout the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1149">It was like, how shall I say.</span> <span id="s1150">We all knew in our subconscious that something horrendous was going on, but as in most unpleasant situations you push it away.</span> <span id="s1151">As I mentioned to you, survival depended on the daily routine of being busy and hustling and organizing, and so you pushed aside this (word missing in original transcription) and all of a sudden it came crashing down on you.</span> <span id="s1152">That was the one side.</span> <span id="s1153">On the other side was, don’t forget that most of us at that point weighed about 100 pounds and had about three years of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s1154">With it goes a certain dullness.</span> <span id="s1155">You come and everybody was so (word missing in original transcription) at this point and so tired, that if there was no way of knowing, when you hear something like that you relate it directly of course to those who belong to one’s family, and except for a few cases, yes a few people heard there that there husbands and wives had gotten separated were no more, but this Auschwitz was so huge in comparison to Theresienstadt that these people who had been there couldn’t know when you asked did you know if my mother or my brother or this person is still left.</span> <span id="s1156">How could you know?</span> <span id="s1157">You knew less than if you had been in a big city.</span> <span id="s1158">So you related this immediately to a personal level.</span> <span id="s1159">And if you did not know that somebody died there or was killed you kept on hoping because you also heard that certain people went from there to Ravensbruck or to other camps.</span> <span id="s1160">I don’t think anybody ever gave up hoping and if you did as some people that was the point you if you were too old, too (word missing in original transcription) , too whatever to organize to say well let’s see what we can do about it tomorrow, lying back, then that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: When these people came from Auschwitz, Auschwitz had been liquidated at that point.</span> <span id="s1162">There were no more transports after that, were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: No, I don’t think so, no there were no more transports after that.</span> <span id="s1164">That was an in – transport.</span> <span id="s1165">I think there was more than one of those incoming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: But I mean all transports stopped then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Did the fact that there were no more transports cause any concern, or any...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: How could we know that there were no more transports.</span> <span id="s1170">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1171">Transports didn’t go all the time.</span> <span id="s1172">Transports came months apart.</span> <span id="s1173">Nobody expected that there would be no more transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1175">I wasn’t aware of the fact that they came months apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Months.</span> <span id="s1177">Some times six months apart.</span> <span id="s1178">That did not mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: When the Soviets liberated Theresienstadt, you mentioned that they declared a 48 hour holiday.</span> <span id="s1180">You mentioned that you had gone off to a town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Afterwards to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: When they first came in did they try to feed everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1184">They didn’t first come in.</span> <span id="s1185">I think I mentioned the Red Cross came in first and the Red Cross stayed, and the Russians didn’t make any appearances at all except for a few guards around the commandanturer building.</span> <span id="s1186">They were preserving for themselves what ever was inside or they thought was inside.</span> <span id="s1187">I think they were very much afraid of the typhoid.</span> <span id="s1188">They, some girls tried to talk to the guys because Czechs and Russians can understand each other and so there was some banter going on with these guys.</span> <span id="s1189">We saw that they gave us immediately, they dispensed, I’ll never forget it, lard, and some smoked ham which was all fat, and tremendous amounts of rice and tea.</span> <span id="s1190">Now the lard and the ham was an absolute no no.</span> <span id="s1191">Never mind kosher, but nobody had had any fat.</span> <span id="s1192">Whoever tasted it got deathly ill right away, because you can’t absorb that, even if you, what are you going to do with it.</span> <span id="s1193">But we cooked a tremendous amount of rice and tea which was marvelous, which was two commodities none of us had seen since before camp time, because there was a war time command against imports in Germany and that just didn’t exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: What, did people realize not to eat the lard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1196">They ate it and they got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: We were talking about the people eating the lard and the rice.</span> <span id="s1198">When you say people got very sick, what do you mean by sick?</span> <span id="s1199">How did it affect them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: The sickness that was most prevalent there was diarrhea, and it meant dehydration, and it meant you couldn’t really have anything to counteract that which</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Was the Red Cross able to combat that once they were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yes, they gave us, they immediately distributed large amounts of charcoal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: And the rice probably helped too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: After the Red Cross entered were you at all restricted in terms of staying in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1207">We were completely restricted.</span> <span id="s1208">We were told that there was combat area around.</span> <span id="s1209">We didn’t know if that was true or not, but that there were troop movements around, that there was typhoid around, and that there was nothing to eat, so that it was in our own interest to stay in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Had the SS disappeared before.</span> <span id="s1211">.</span> <span id="s1212">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Disappeared overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Before the Red Cross came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: They had disappeared while the Red Cross was there before the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: You mentioned that you went to Prague.</span> <span id="s1217">How soon after this liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1219">I was, between the liberation and our leaving were two event filed months.</span> <span id="s1220">I don’t remember at what point in those two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: But little by little you were allowed to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yes, little by little all the chicks left, because the greatest handicap to leaving was transportation.</span> <span id="s1223">There was no civilian transportation period.</span> <span id="s1224">It was a war ravaged world and there were no trains, there were no trucks.</span> <span id="s1225">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1226">So you had to get yourself on some kind of more or less official vehicle before you could come to somewheres where there was some kind of public transportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: You mentioned that the UNRRA came in, and they came after the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: Yes, and after the Russians.</span> <span id="s1229">I don’t even know anymore if the Russians other than some kind of administrative person, whether they were there all the time.</span> <span id="s1230">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1231">I didn’t see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: But you in other words dealt with the officials of the UNRRA?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: And the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Just as a matter of, during those years you were in Theresienstadt was there much dissention between the different nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1236">I think I mentioned that.</span> <span id="s1237">Also the different nationalities due to the German way of shipping people around, made for a generation gap.</span> <span id="s1238">The Czechs were all young and Theresienstadt only had German old people.</span> <span id="s1239">Not only, but 95% and the Czechs considered us Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: When you say they considered you Germans...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Goddamn Germans coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: You as a young person must have had a lot of just by virtue of age, must have had a lot of contact with the Czechs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yes, and worked with only Czechs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Were you able to gain acceptance even though they...”</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Very difficult, and I had to learn Czech in order to do it.</span> <span id="s1246">They didn’t want to speak German.</span> <span id="s1247">That was one of the barriers.</span> <span id="s1248">They made a point of, while under normal circumstances, especially people from Prague speak German well at that point they didn’t want to speak German.</span> <span id="s1249">The Germans were the beginning and the end of all their misfortune.</span> <span id="s1250">You know, we allowed this to happen so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: They did...</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Yes, in fact there were such right wing Czechs that didn’t speak to me, people I worked with and or their husbands barely spoke to me.</span> <span id="s1253">There was one particular couple who overlooked and the husband, no the husband died I think in Auschwitz, anyway I lost track of her.</span> <span id="s1254">I met her again here.</span> <span id="s1255">She was alone.</span> <span id="s1256">I met her in the subway up here, and anyway years ago she wanted very much social contact.</span> <span id="s1257">I didn’t make any move because I didn’t forget those years.</span> <span id="s1258">The stupid kind of prejudice of hardly being spoken to.</span> <span id="s1259">I didn’t want to explain this to her.</span> <span id="s1260">There was no point explaining this to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: The isolation, I forget the year you were born in, but in terms that you were a young girl when you were in Theresienstadt, but the isolation within Germany as a Jew and then to be isolated in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: That’s why it hurt twice as much, but I don’t know if you ever heard from your parents that in Europe people were terribly prejudiced against each other anyway.</span> <span id="s1263">I’m sure you heard that the Viennese couldn’t stand the northern Germans and vice versa, and it came out there I guess for want of something real, that we looked down on Viennese Jews who came there as nobody, and they couldn’t work and they wouldn’t work and didn’t want to work which meant keeping the place clean as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: As well as the Czechs doing the same, your parents, were your parents kind of spared from that feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yes, because there were not many, the Czech older people if they didn’t speak German or if they didn’t want to speak German moved amongst their own barracks and they had no...</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Were the barracks separated in this sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yes, very much because all those incoming transports were kept together pretty well and those transports came from a certain town so it was localized.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Were the outgoing transports also localized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: No they came across the board.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Once you were under UNRRA control, you mentioned that it was just a matter of transportation to get out of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1271">When did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: In July of ’45.</span> <span id="s1273">Till they said they had buses to Frankfurt which is where we had come from.</span> <span id="s1274">They also offered us, I think I mentioned this in a previous discussion, they also there was a camp, a transit camp being opened near Munich and that anybody who didn’t want to go back to where they came from could go to this camp in Dechsendorf in Bavaria, and many people opted for that .</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Why did you not go back to Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Because all that was in my head was the American consulate and of course we were without any money and without any way of spending money for that matter.</span> <span id="s1277">If it came to money and ways of buying things, that where we had come from possibly there would be some friends left to lend us money.</span> <span id="s1278">My father knew business people that he thought could lend us money so that we could, the only thing we had on our minds was getting out, not staying, and so we thought we could operate best from where we knew our way around.</span> <span id="s1279">We didn’t know that Frankfurt was leveled.</span> <span id="s1280">We had no idea.</span> <span id="s1281">It was the greatest satisfaction of my life to see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Well you did go into Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: It was completely leveled, the (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1284">And we had never seen.</span> <span id="s1285">We were in the countryside, and traveled on buses supplied by UNRRA through the countryside and then suddenly saw these cities in rubble.</span> <span id="s1286">That was the (word missing in original transcript).</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: You were with many other people on this bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: On a very stinking gasoline bus.</span> <span id="s1289">The stench, wood burning oil, for many days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Where did you sleep during this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s1292">They must have made previous arrangements at farmhouses in the countryside and they looked at us like something out of a zoo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: These were German farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: German or Austrian.</span> <span id="s1295">This was through Austria.</span> <span id="s1296">Farmers in old big farmhouses, and everybody got some blankets or some feather bedding on the floor and a lot of soup and food, but they didn’t smile, they hardly spoke to us.</span> <span id="s1297">They were probably scared to death of us and we must have looked something terrible despite the fact that we got regular clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: I was going to ask you, you got regular clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: We got regular clothes long before that.</span> <span id="s1300">That happened almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1301">That was the easiest thing to distribute.</span> <span id="s1302">That and anti - biotics.</span> <span id="s1303">There wasn’t a real anti – biotic in 1945, but we got something against infections.</span> <span id="s1304">We kept marveling at the feather pillows and at the soup, and the people looked at us like we came from out of a cage.</span> <span id="s1305">I guess we didn’t realize yet what we looked like.</span> <span id="s1306">And these people had not seen war refugees, probably, before.</span> <span id="s1307">I think it was one or two nights that we stayed over in places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: It brings up twp points.</span> <span id="s1309">First of all, how did you feel about these Germans you were beginning to see, either staying in farmhouses or any contact that you had with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Zero.</span> <span id="s1311">We were completely self – centered.</span> <span id="s1312">We didn’t care anything about these Germans.</span> <span id="s1313">Now my age has something to do with that, now became a great adventure.</span> <span id="s1314">That some young people had gotten together on the bus and every step for us we were looking forward to, and I didn’t care what my parents felt and I didn’t ask.</span> <span id="s1315">Only that’s egotism of youth.</span> <span id="s1316">They were probably very scared about what they were driving into, but they also knew it couldn’t possibly be worse than what we had come from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: You mentioned very early on that because of the fact that your father took it so hard in the beginning, that was the reason he could adjust to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1318">I just want to go back to that a bit.</span> <span id="s1319">How did your father manage to keep up his morale in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Well with my father it had to do with being very, very religious.</span> <span id="s1321">There were many people who said this is God’s will and if God wills it, and the rest of us kept saying in German and very clearly, bullshit.</span> <span id="s1322">My mother never kept a kosher house again anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Had she believed in keeping a kosher house, she was religious before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1325">Very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: How did that affect your father.</span> <span id="s1327">I mean was his belief shaken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: I think in retrospect my father was rather henpecked anyway.</span> <span id="s1329">My mother, so what she wanted to do she did anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: But was his religion enough to carry him through, I mean...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: A great deal carried through.</span> <span id="s1332">It was the first thing he picked up here, and the first thing he looked for here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: He became religious here as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Right away, whatever was in Hebrew he looked very much forward to coming to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: In Theresienstadt did he participate in services?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1337">As long as it wasn’t dangerous he went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: On the other hand your mother became....</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: My mother became completely cynical.</span> <span id="s1340">I became completely turned off.</span> <span id="s1341">I turned back on long, long after all that.</span> <span id="s1342">Also I mentioned on another tape that we were together with some very, very orthodox Jews, super orthodox, and they were such crooks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1345">Out and out crooks.</span> <span id="s1346">That was another thing that turned me off.</span> <span id="s1347">I never knew Jews could be so crooked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: How did they show they were crooks in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: One was a shoemaker and that was a vital thing, and he would charge tremendous prices in food to get the shoes fixed up, and if an old or sick person couldn’t pay that, he wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1350">And what he was doing, he and his wife were older people themselves.</span> <span id="s1351">Nobody knew what he was doing with all this food, and he went after canned stuff so that he could sell it for other things.</span> <span id="s1352">The Czechs they brought some canned stuff, sardines and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: When you say the Czechs you mean the Czech Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Yes, had brought some canned stuff that didn’t get taken away.</span> <span id="s1355">There was canned stuff around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: How did you open canned stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: I forget.</span> <span id="s1358">There was also one kind of canned meat that we got, every once in awhile, officially, so there must have been some kind of can opener.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: When you came to Frankfurt and you saw this rubble, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: All organized by the UNRRA together with the army.</span> <span id="s1361">In the rubble of course there were buildings, I mean there were still many people in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1362">We were put up in what was a former Jewish old age home which was a building that was functioning.</span> <span id="s1363">Run by that point by the army with the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1364">They wanted to reopen, Frankfurt had a famous Jewish (word missing in original transcript) gartenstrasser.</span> <span id="s1365">It was not in shape to be opened at that time.</span> <span id="s1366">That’s where we were first going to work and then we said it was too (word missing in original transcript) the water wasn’t working, the lights weren’t working, so they took us to this old age home which was functioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Did you renew any contacts with former Germans or did you meet any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Some neighbors.</span> <span id="s1369">To go back to the girl next door who was my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s1370">She wasn’t around.</span> <span id="s1371">Somebody from her family, I forget who, was it an aunt who lived with them, or some kind of unmarried cousin, who said oh hello, I thought you were dead, to my mother and me in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">QL: Had you gone to that street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: No we wound up in that street by nice friends.</span> <span id="s1374">We met, I told you that place where we stayed was army run.</span> <span id="s1375">It also became the center of a lot of Jewish boys or descendents of German Jews who looked for relatives.</span> <span id="s1376">They all came there, and some other girl and I met this fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: When you say Jewish boys are you talking about American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Army boys, and a lot of strange coincidences started to happen because everybody found names of relatives and mutual friends.</span> <span id="s1379">All these boys wouldn’t have come to us (words missing in original transcript), so they kept asking questions, and we were told that we could stay there indefinitely or they would slowly get us apartments, and I don’t know how we got to old neighbors on the building where we had lived for a long time.</span> <span id="s1380">I forgot whether my mother or my father went to see them, probably about money or what had happened to some of the stuff we hid in the neighborhood, but anyway they were told that the Nazi doctor who had made us walk out some five years prior was still in our apartment.</span> <span id="s1381">The building was still standing.</span> <span id="s1382">The street was standing.</span> <span id="s1383">It was pock marked and there were plaster chips loose all over and windows cracked, but this doctor, whatever his name was was still in what was called the Wertheimer apartment, and I told one of these army guys my girlfriend and I became very friendly with because he wanted to organize things for this.</span> <span id="s1384">He was a great guy.</span> <span id="s1385">He organized mail to the United States to relatives right away.</span> <span id="s1386">He organized fresh fruit.</span> <span id="s1387">He organized other guys to come and write letters for people who at that point didn’t know who to contact.</span> <span id="s1388">He’s just one of those guys who said okay I’m here, now I can do something.</span> <span id="s1389">And we told him that we had heard that our apartment was available.</span> <span id="s1390">People said that our furniture wasn’t in it anymore.</span> <span id="s1391">They didn’t know what had happened to it.</span> <span id="s1392">The neighbors had looked in and the apartment was there and standing.</span> <span id="s1393">He said oh wait.</span> <span id="s1394">It will take time, but he will get out.</span> <span id="s1395">You are going to get back in.</span> <span id="s1396">It took about three months and a lot of pulling of strings and we were back in the old apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: It must have been for your parents as well as yourself to go back to that apartment...</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Well it wasn’t the same apartment.</span> <span id="s1399">First of all we had been evicted from that apartment because the place was too big, and then in the meantime we heard now my mother had lost so many sisters and my father had lost brothers and all we were trying to do was to keep up the contact to come here.</span> <span id="s1400">That was all very temporary to us.</span> <span id="s1401">And then there wasn’t a chair in there anymore that meant us, so it was a bunch of furniture and a roof over our head versus this house with a lot of rather old and sick people.</span> <span id="s1402">My mother at that point was about fifty or so.</span> <span id="s1403">She didn’t want to be there either.</span> <span id="s1404">And the whole state in Frankfurt you couldn’t walk very far.</span> <span id="s1405">There was no public transportation.</span> <span id="s1406">You couldn’t walk very far because of rubble and because of American and German muggings.</span> <span id="s1407">And then you had rubble and no lights and a black market that all the crooks in the world congregate.</span> <span id="s1408">You couldn’t go out after dark.</span> <span id="s1409">It became one in – between stop.</span> <span id="s1410">Let’s see what we do here and feed us and make ourselves comfortable.</span> <span id="s1411">And this girlfriend of mine, (words missing in original transcript) and I started to talk to these boys about working.</span> <span id="s1412">Meaning right away there was no consulate, no mail, there were no planes.</span> <span id="s1413">It was going to be awhile.</span> <span id="s1414">And he said no sweat.</span> <span id="s1415">You can speak English, you can start working.</span> <span id="s1416">You want to start working, you can start working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: How did you speak English at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: German schools teach English from the time you are ten years old on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: But was that good enough...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Good enough to be understood.</span> <span id="s1421">So then we started to work for the army, office work.</span> <span id="s1422">Then came the emotional shock.</span> <span id="s1423">Then we found out that most of the guys that we worked with had German girlfriends.</span> <span id="s1424">They had been there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1425">Let’s say we had come there in July and started to work there not right away, in September or August.</span> <span id="s1426">Frankfurt had been out of the war since the beginning of (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1427">They were well entrenched.</span> <span id="s1428">They had gotten themselves somebody to stay with, sleep with, live with.</span> <span id="s1429">There was a non fraternization law, remember we said hooray this is the way it should be and then we saw that nobody gave a hoot.</span> <span id="s1430">That was very hard.</span> <span id="s1431">We found another thing.</span> <span id="s1432">We found anti – Semitism in the army amongst officers.</span> <span id="s1433">We recognized it right away.</span> <span id="s1434">Everybody else took it for granted.</span> <span id="s1435">There were a bunch of Irish or Basque, very high colonels, that wouldn’t talk to any of us or to the Jewish lower ranks just because that wasn’t part of their club, but we were so naive that this just didn’t exist amongst Americans.</span> <span id="s1436">It was twice as (word missing in original transcript).</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: When you mentioned that the American soldiers had German girlfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: They all had German girlfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Including Jewish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Including Jewish soldiers, some, I remember hearing for the first time in this army office, one soldier being interviewed by this major that I worked for behind closed doors all the time.</span> <span id="s1441">I was sent out, and I found out by a round about route he was called to the boss all the time because he had V.D. I think this was my first official encounter.</span> <span id="s1442">I knew where this guy lived in the neighborhood with a girl in Frankfurt and all I kept thinking was a well one finally got it, thank God.</span> <span id="s1443">So that was one of those (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1444">For the rest of the time we had a very good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: In what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: In what sense, well to give you a small for instance.</span> <span id="s1447">I had a birthday and somebody one of the guys in the office knew about it and told the other guys and they had been and this boy Eddie had been we were back in the old apartment, had met my parents before and brought my mother all these buttons to sew on and the laundry to do and stuff like that, and he said tell your mother we’re going to make a party.</span> <span id="s1448">The colonel and I decided we are going to have a party at your house because we couldn’t come to any of the army barracks area, we are not permitted and he came with ten chickens and cakes, and wine and every commanding officer in the unit.</span> <span id="s1449">And then my mother had the first experience with American men in the kitchen, wanting to do the dishes, for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: That was a surprise for your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1452">We had many things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Was it a surprise for your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1455">But he got very much used to it.</span> <span id="s1456">He did what he wanted, now he liked to do that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1457">But my father was still so German that all these officers showing up in his house was a big honor for him.</span> <span id="s1458">We had a Jewish chaplain that I worked for who started to answer inquiries about people who wrote, if there was somebody in this old age home and would he stay in this old age home, and other than this army chap I started to help the chaplain to answer these inquiries, and we met very many nice people, I mean army personnel running to take things to where they heard somebody came back to a small town.</span> <span id="s1459">I can get a jeep and take it there.</span> <span id="s1460">So it was also in a way and also when the movies opened and I got packages from here, cigarettes (word missing in original transcript) here.</span> <span id="s1461">I didn’t smoke at the time, so we started to go hear the movies, and black market opened up.</span> <span id="s1462">Clothes of course was this big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: How did you get the clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: I don’t know where the stuff came from in Germany, but there was fabric around.</span> <span id="s1465">I had it made, payments I guess, which came from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: All this time your contact was mainly with American army personnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Only.</span> <span id="s1468">There was no other German mail.</span> <span id="s1469">The guy I had met in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1470">I told you I met a soldier, had kept up the contact through his army post office number.</span> <span id="s1471">He also sent other friends of his, Jewish officers that he heard were going to Frankfurt, to pick up mail from me, and then Eddie the guy who really started to run the first Jewish (word missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1472">in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1473">I don’t know you might have met him.</span> <span id="s1474">His name was Eddie Rosenbaum and they lived here.</span> <span id="s1475">They were brothers.</span> <span id="s1476">One, the older brother, one was (word missing in original transcript), I think it was the older one, he was in the army.</span> <span id="s1477">He was somewhat younger than I am.</span> <span id="s1478">He’s not in New York anymore.</span> <span id="s1479">He was quite fantastic in organizing.</span> <span id="s1480">I mean he got every Jewish body together whether they had to do with Germans or not to get food, to get medication, whoever didn’t have a family here to just write to somebody.</span> <span id="s1481">Give me an address and I’ll forward it to (word missing in original transcript) here in Washington Heights, that somebody would send him packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: At that point did you have someone to contact in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: We had all the time.</span> <span id="s1484">That’s why all of this out of Theresienstadt was such an in – between period.</span> <span id="s1485">We had still in Theresienstat word and cables from my mother’s brother and in these cables he had, it all went though military channels and UNRRA in Theresienstadt and he implied don’t worry about anything.</span> <span id="s1486">That implied that he had money, which he didn’t have, but there were many years in between when there was no contact.</span> <span id="s1487">Stay well, take care of yourself, just write where I can cable money.</span> <span id="s1488">Can I cable money?</span> <span id="s1489">He couldn’t for the longest time, but the fact that this came was well there is somebody waiting for us, which there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: When you got to Frankfurt you proceeded to make arrangements to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Well we couldn’t for almost a year.</span> <span id="s1492">There was no consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: And that was the only channel to do it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: So you had to wait for the establishment...</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: No.</span> <span id="s1497">But we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1498">The Joint and HIAS opened up their own channels, but it took them time.</span> <span id="s1499">We then in the end didn’t have to wait, for the consulate, but we had to wait for Joint and HIAS to get themselves organized, and they took anybody and everybody whether they had contact here or not.</span> <span id="s1500">We were on the first boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Now, while you were in your own apartment in Germany, you started to talk about your meeting this former friend, neighbor, who said to you and your mother that she thought you weren’t alive.</span> <span id="s1502">What was your feeling towards these Germans you had known before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: Utter disgust.</span> <span id="s1504">We didn’t want to talk to them, we didn’t want to be talked to.</span> <span id="s1505">We didn’t even want to talk to the people in the building, with the exception of that one, there was one couple, through who we had gotten the word that we should get this, the guy was still there and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1507">Did they approach you at all?</span> <span id="s1508">Any of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1510">Approach is the wrong word.</span> <span id="s1511">It was a small apartment house with only one party on each floor, so you couldn’t, and they were all walkups, so you couldn’t help meeting, and it was rather cold.</span> <span id="s1512">You spoke to each other, but you didn’t want to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Did they offer help, or did they offer excuses or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Oh everybody offered excuses.</span> <span id="s1515">Everybody offered excuses.</span> <span id="s1516">Nobody offered help.</span> <span id="s1517">I mean the real help always came with an ulterior motive as I guess in any place in life.</span> <span id="s1518">I worked for the army there were a lot of other Germans working and it was a quartermaster, big office building, and I remember the super of the building and his wife hearing who I was saying how terrible and they had no idea.</span> <span id="s1519">How could they help?</span> <span id="s1520">And I said where can I get fruit and vegetables?</span> <span id="s1521">And they said immediately, for two cigarettes I can get you apples and potatoes, and etc., So they were obviously asking for a deal with them.</span> <span id="s1522">I gladly would have given to, it was not easy to organize these things.</span> <span id="s1523">I had my source and I used it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: When you say it wasn’t easy to organize, you mean the army didn’t provide?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: No the army couldn’t provide.</span> <span id="s1526">The UNRRA provided, but the UNRRA provided money and you had to go back in the mainstream and your life was, it was all over Europe and England and (word missing in original transcript), that was the worst kind of starvation.</span> <span id="s1527">There wasn’t anything.</span> <span id="s1528">I mean the ground was leveled, the fields were not worked on and the army had trouble just feeding their own.</span> <span id="s1529">There just wasn’t anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: How did you get the cigarettes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: In the packages here from my uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: So they were trading stamps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: They were money.</span> <span id="s1534">Money nobody wanted.</span> <span id="s1535">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1536">They were money.</span> <span id="s1537">We also got what we asked for.</span> <span id="s1538">We needed soap and stockings and cigarettes and coffee.</span> <span id="s1539">With this then we could buy nearly everything else.</span> <span id="s1540">I had lots of other family here.</span> <span id="s1541">I had lots of cousins here, so my uncle got in touch with them and said send cigarettes and coffee and some kind of fat for cooking in the can.</span> <span id="s1542">I forget what it was.</span> <span id="s1543">But you couldn’t send oleo.</span> <span id="s1544">You didn’t want to send oleo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: So in other words when you talk about black market, black market was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Black market was with the Germans and with the Americans.</span> <span id="s1547">Many Americans got rich.</span> <span id="s1548">I mean you could buy diamonds or anything through the black market.</span> <span id="s1549">It was all over Europe.</span> <span id="s1550">Tremendous amount of black market activity and it encompassed everything.</span> <span id="s1551">The movies, the line was around the block.</span> <span id="s1552">You paid three cigarettes you went to the head of the line.</span> <span id="s1553">Any books you read from the postwar periods, but then we were in our twenties and there were all these guys around and this was all just fabulous.</span> <span id="s1554">It was all very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: In terms of your parents.</span> <span id="s1556">When your parents moved back into this apartment and they started getting news of other relatives, was this a very difficult time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Very difficult and that shows in the pictures that we took during that time.</span> <span id="s1558">That my mother had suddenly lost three sisters.</span> <span id="s1559">My father wasn’t as close with his brothers, but people had died here that he was close with.</span> <span id="s1560">Yes it was a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1561">We looked like the walking dead.</span> <span id="s1562">I mean not I so much because when you are twenty something you get yourself some makeup and some nice clothes, but my parents were the ones who looked awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: How were they able to pull the pieces together to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: Well probably.</span> <span id="s1565">We were very fortunate, because everybody made it very clear that they were waiting for us with open arms here, and only felt bad that it was just us and that no one else had come out of it, and that of course made the transition much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: When you got word that you were leaving from Frankfurt, that must have been a difficult day when you got on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Difficult?</span> <span id="s1568">No.</span> <span id="s1569">Exciting.</span> <span id="s1570">They were army boats and I was always helping on the water and I knew I was going to throw up (words missing in original transcription).</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: It was an army boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: It was UNRRA and Joint distribution committee organizing.</span> <span id="s1573">It went through another camp.</span> <span id="s1574">We went by train as a group to Bremerhaven and stayed there till one of those liberty ships showed up which was hired for the purpose from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: What boat did you come on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: The Marine Flasher I think.</span> <span id="s1577">I remember that goodbye for the second time around from that apartment.</span> <span id="s1578">Goodbye with very close friends.</span> <span id="s1579">One with my very close girlfriend, half Jewish, who was there all the time, during the war in Frankfurt, all along in Frankfurt, and another very close friend.</span> <span id="s1580">A gentile woman who was married to a Jew.</span> <span id="s1581">Her husband had been with us and had then come back and she had stayed in Frankfurt, and I had worked as I said for the army.</span> <span id="s1582">In these army quarters that (words missing in original transcription), there was a German woman who ran clothing factories for the army, because she was married, had been married to a Jew, she had risen very (word missing in original transcription) in the army.</span> <span id="s1583">She had, picture this, she had the use of a beige open Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s1584">A huge one.</span> <span id="s1585">She had hired herself a chauffeur and had to make in this clothing factory, talking about crookedness, beige uniform.</span> <span id="s1586">She sent the car to get us to the train.</span> <span id="s1587">We had no suitcases other than things with strings and cardboard boxes and not very much, because what was the use.</span> <span id="s1588">So we went from the apartment.</span> <span id="s1589">There was this car standing there with this chauffeur and my girlfriend and my mother’s gentile good old friend and with arms full of lilac bushes as going away flowers because you couldn’t get any other real flowers, and these cardboard suitcases and these awful clothes.</span> <span id="s1590">The guy drove us to the meeting center.</span> <span id="s1591">There was no big train station.</span> <span id="s1592">The train station was completely bombed out.</span> <span id="s1593">It was some suburban station that worked at that point as the Frankfurt railroad station, and from there the trains left to go to Bremerhaven to this Joint Distribution Committee camp, but none of us forgot this sight because of the way we left in splendor and we did nothing but laugh.</span> <span id="s1594">It was all one big adventure.</span> <span id="s1595">Then we came to this Joint center in Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s1596">They had to wait for these ships.</span> <span id="s1597">They settled these ships to expect, but they didn’t know what was coming first.</span> <span id="s1598">Then we met again people from other cities and then we realized that Frankfurt was such a big army center that we had had such an easy time, that people in other cities didn’t.</span> <span id="s1599">It was Eisenhower headquarters for so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: When you arrived here the Marine Flasher was the first liberty ship to land.</span> <span id="s1601">Were there a lot of newsman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1603">I can give you.</span> <span id="s1604">I can show you some newspaper articles.</span> <span id="s1605">There was complete craziness.</span> <span id="s1606">It was completely cordoned off.</span> <span id="s1607">There was newsreels and of course there was no television at that time.</span> <span id="s1608">There were radio people and nobody, and before we had been through immigration and health department, nobody was permitted to talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1609">There was only United States lines docks, wide areas cordoned off where nobody was permitted to go near and it was much later, hours and hours before people were permitted to meet anybody, and so behind all those wires and things you saw everybody waiting there in masses and we had gotten in the night before, on a Sunday, and standing there and seeing all those lights, and then somebody said we’re not really In New York we’re in Brooklyn and then somebody said Brooklyn belongs to New York and then why can’t we get out, because you can’t get out here on Sundays, disembark, there was no docking facilities or customs or health department, you had to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: On Monday when you did disembark, was your uncle waiting for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: My uncle and seventeen cousins and (words missing in original transcription).</span> <span id="s1612">That was a very emotional thing.</span> <span id="s1613">What was also waiting for us was New York May weather and hot.</span> <span id="s1614">Completely unprepared for that.</span> <span id="s1615">Haze and humid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: When you say completely unprepared for that...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: We had gotten on for the occasion our newly made tailored suits, travel outfits and raincoats, and it was boiling hot in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: When your uncle and cousins met you, where did you go that first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: My uncle was very well to do by that time.</span> <span id="s1620">He had hired a big hotel apartment for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Broadway and 67th.</span> <span id="s1623">.</span> <span id="s1624">It doesn’t exist anymore, that block.</span> <span id="s1625">In fact we are going to look there now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Did you go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Yes we went there right away, and the place was full of flowers and cake and we were aghast.</span> <span id="s1628">My mother and I, we were eleven days on that boat and my mother and I were eleven days seasick.</span> <span id="s1629">My father was the only one who ate everything.</span> <span id="s1630">One interesting psychological point of that trip.</span> <span id="s1631">People stole in that ship whatever wasn’t nailed down.</span> <span id="s1632">Towels.</span> <span id="s1633">The dining room was no dining room it was a mess hall.</span> <span id="s1634">Alright.</span> <span id="s1635">Sugar, jam pots, salt shakers, forks, spoons, it disappeared from one meal to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Everybody explained that and everybody excused that by saying we’ve all been in terrible spots where we’ve had nothing.</span> <span id="s1638">I don’t care how I do it, but I never want to be in that spot again.</span> <span id="s1639">This had nothing to do necessarily with being in a camp.</span> <span id="s1640">It was being in a war, and then we found out that Frankfurt was a better place to be than many other places where people then didn’t have anything to eat either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: That’s true.</span> <span id="s1642">How did your parents start to earn a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A; They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1644">They didn’t have (words missing in original transcription), but we knew right away that we couldn’t stay in this hotel.</span> <span id="s1645">I mean we didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1646">We found out right away how much that was.</span> <span id="s1647">And in 1946 you might have heard, New York was an impossible place to find an apartment, so the first thing we went, we thought 181st street was heaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: How did you ever see 181st street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Because we right away this one lives there and that one lives here, so we met them there and discovered here they are on St. Nicholas or whatever it was called and all the shopping was there and all the people lived there, so.</span> <span id="s1650">We went on the subway pretty (words missing in original transcription).</span> <span id="s1651">We were city people and on buses right away.</span> <span id="s1652">I was told by my uncle that I ought to make up my mind what I wanted to do about having had fashion drawing experience in school and didn’t I want to use it and I ought to pursue it and I ought to find out about school.</span> <span id="s1653">And in the course of finding out about schools I started to talk to people and that’s how I got the first job, on Vogue magazine no less, but through a connection, somebody said I know somebody who works on Vogue magazine and why don’t you see her about schools and she said you’re terrible and why don’t you work awhile before you make up your mind what you want to do with, you’re not good enough professional (words missing in original transcription), but maybe you want to do something else in that regard in graphic arts and work here first.</span> <span id="s1654">The schools here are very expensive and they are not for free and it’s not that simple.</span> <span id="s1655">Wait awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: So she directed you?</span> <span id="s1657">And she also directed you toward Vogue magazine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: She was at Vogue.</span> <span id="s1659">She was a brilliant German Jewish woman who somebody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: And your parents?</span> <span id="s1661">Did they...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: My parents didn’t do much.</span> <span id="s1663">They had some temporary work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: In the beginning when you started to work for Vogue, these were mainly American people you worked with.</span> <span id="s1665">American born.</span> <span id="s1666">All?</span> <span id="s1667">How did you adjust in the beginning to American work ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: It was really very exciting.</span> <span id="s1669">I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Did they ever question you as to your past experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: No.</span> <span id="s1672">It wasn’t that kind of a place.</span> <span id="s1673">It was all very low – key.</span> <span id="s1674">There were very, very few Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: In your social life when you first came here, did you make friends with mostly German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1677">Almost all German Jews.</span> <span id="s1678">First of all I got to know my family again.</span> <span id="s1679">I got to know family that I never knew and whoever left between 1932 and 1934 and then it was 1946, so that was most of the social life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: A long time had gone by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: And then the second group we socialized with were all people from the camp that had gotten together here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: You mentioned two things, when you were with the American boys, this Eddie or the other American boys, were you more comfortable with the German – Jewish crowd or equally as comfortable with the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: I think I was always more comfortable with the German – Jewish crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Is that still true today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: Yes, to a degree.</span> <span id="s1686">I don’t have an American – Jewish social life.</span> <span id="s1687">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1688">I know very many Americans.</span> <span id="s1689">It matters little whether they are Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s1690">I think the background or whatever, I think most of my friends feel the same way, by the way, They married within, well my husband’s Hungarian, but let’s say they married within the European areas.</span> <span id="s1691">They looked for it and they still move in those circles.</span> <span id="s1692">They are still most comfortable in those circles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: If you had to choose a reason, how could you account for that?</span> <span id="s1694">You’ve met many Americans over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: I don’t think I met many American Jews and was conscious well these are Jews.</span> <span id="s1696">It had to do with that old prejudice that Germans have against Polish and Russian born Jews.</span> <span id="s1697">There’s no denying that.</span> <span id="s1698">There was a tremendous gulf.</span> <span id="s1699">They never even crossed paths until New York.</span> <span id="s1700">It crossed paths in Berlin for instance where there were Polish Jews, they were completely separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: But you feel it crossed paths in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yes in New York it crossed openly for the first time.</span> <span id="s1703">And those people were rather well to do which made for some resentment.</span> <span id="s1704">Many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Do you, you are not with Vogue anymore, did you switch to Simplicity a long time ago</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: A long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: In your job now, as opposed to your American counterparts in the same job, do you feel there are any holdovers from your European background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: No because all of New York has become so much more cosmopolitan or broad minded and everyone speaks some Jewish even though they are black or Puerto Rican.</span> <span id="s1709">You know.</span> <span id="s1710">I think the world has very much changed.</span> <span id="s1711">When people became conscious that they could travel and that it was fun to travel many points of view that were very parochial before completely changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Very true.</span> <span id="s1713">Did you meet your husband in any of these organizations, Haboneem or New World Club?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: From your parents, from watching your parents, what was the most difficult thing for them to adjust to?</span> <span id="s1716">What was the most difficult adjustment they had to make in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: Well my father (words missing in original transcript) he became very ill in ’49 (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1718">They had a fabulous time.</span> <span id="s1719">They moved to Yonkers because my uncle had an interest in an apartment house there, so that was the place to find an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: You moved with them to Yonkers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1722">And so then they went to look for a (words missing in original transcript) and then there was a Jewish Center that had another bunch of refugees and they had language lessons, my father had English in school and went back to it very quickly and liked it.</span> <span id="s1723">My mother never had any English in her life, but she enjoyed it, and they played cards and they went shopping.</span> <span id="s1724">It was all grand.</span> <span id="s1725">The only thing was in my mother’s life.</span> <span id="s1726">I wish my sisters were alive, my father his favorite brother M(name missing in original transcript) had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1727">He died just before we got here.</span> <span id="s1728">He missed him terribly.</span> <span id="s1729">But I don’t think, but the fact they had no money worries.</span> <span id="s1730">They had and everybody said please take care of yourself and now you go to the Catskills and now you stay there for four weeks and I had the wide open world suddenly at my command, including a subway and a very exciting work area, even though it paid peanuts.</span> <span id="s1731">Only after a couple of years (words missing in original transcript), I can’t just let my uncle worry about my parents.</span> <span id="s1732">Now it’s my turn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: So then you began to take over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Right, and then my father died and then we moved when my father died.</span> <span id="s1735">I wanted to get out more and my mother didn’t want to be in the apartment any more where he had been so sick and then we moved to Bennett Avenue into what at that point was that new building over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: From your point of view what was the most difficult adjustment that you had to make here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: I don’t know if there were any difficult adjustments, because there were no point of comparisons.</span> <span id="s1738">The only thing that I think I was sorry for which was my own fault was that I missed it that I didn’t go back into a normal school situation.</span> <span id="s1739">I was in my middle twenties at that time.</span> <span id="s1740">I was much more concerned with making some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: It would have bee difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: It could have been done, but maybe I was just too complacent then, or was having too much fun or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Do you feel that America has afforded you opportunities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1745">But there is no point of comparison.</span> <span id="s1746">I don’t know why my father didn’t do so well over there from what I know, and I didn’t have to give up a job or a career over there so there was no (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s1747">From the day I came over here, it was something I was dying to do, I was waiting for long before the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Do you mean your particular field?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yes and to come to the States.</span> <span id="s1750">I then didn’t want to stay there growing up in the Nazi time before I even knew there was going to be a x camp.</span> <span id="s1751">It was a very joyful experience to come here.</span> <span id="s1752">I remember my mother and I standing on 72nd street in front of a bakery store saying what do they have all these cakes for.</span> <span id="s1753">Who eats all this stuff?</span> <span id="s1754">Who cooks all this?</span> <span id="s1755">This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1756">And then we walked in and we were asking, asking we were strange looking and even with English we didn’t know what all these things were called.</span> <span id="s1757">It was for the birds.</span> <span id="s1758">And then we noticed that people talked about vacation all the time.</span> <span id="s1759">What’s the big deal about vacation?</span> <span id="s1760">What did you do this summer and one more year we were doing the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: So little by little you adjusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: We adjusted very quickly.</span> <span id="s1763">Coming from a big city helped.</span> <span id="s1764">Speaking the language helped, and my mother was a very gregarious housewife.</span> <span id="s1765">She didn’t speak English very well, but she loved to cook and invite everybody and that got her (words missing in original transcript), between speaking Yiddish and store English and Yonkers helped because there were classes and as I said my parents loved those classes and they became a club and they had outings and trips.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Speaking of Yonkers.</span> <span id="s1767">Yonkers was less German Jewish than Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s1768">Did that disturb them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: That bothered them tremendously in the (words missing in original transcript), they thought it was outrageous what they had to listen to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">Q: In the congregation that was not particularly German Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1772">I mean there were some there, but it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1773">It was all (words missing in original transcript) sounding stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: So that when you moved from Yonkers to Bennett Avenue did you feel that they were happier within their....?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: My mother was.</span> <span id="s1776">That’s why she wanted to move.</span> <span id="s1777">My father wasn’t alive anymore.</span> <span id="s1778">I met my husband in Yonkers through Viennese neighbors of ours.</span> <span id="s1779">So that made it easy for my parents too, there was this we were wall to wall with this Viennese couple and they enjoyed showing my mother around by where’s there a good butcher and they had a car and they said come along there were relatives and my husband that’s how I met him.</span> <span id="s1780">That made, my father loved it in Yonkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Did you ever go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Yes, frequently.</span> <span id="s1783">I’ll be going now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: On vacation or business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Only family.</span> <span id="s1786">Ingber has a son through who we met, and that’s a whole nother story for which we don’t have time.</span> <span id="s1787">The story of rather a romantic life, but anyway he grew up in England, he’s not Jewish, and he went with the army in, no he went to Europe on a trip.</span> <span id="s1788">He met through Jewish friends of my husband a German girl and he married her while he was over in the army in the sixties.</span> <span id="s1789">He is an American journalist and he lives in Germany with the family.</span> <span id="s1790">So one year they come here and one year we go there.</span> <span id="s1791">He’s just been transferred to Bonn and they just rented a house and this is our turn so we will be going to Bonn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Now how do you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Terrible the both of us.</span> <span id="s1794">They were there two years.</span> <span id="s1795">We don’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1796">We just talk to the kids.</span> <span id="s1797">My husband’s mother was killed in Auschwitz, other than that he is very un – Jewish and wasn’t as far as religion is concerned, but we’ve gone and whenever we are (words missing in original transcript) we go to the opera and then we look at the strange people who sit next to us, our, that’s my generation or his and they are extremely well dressed and in (words missing in original transcript) everybody dresses up to go to the opera and they wear a lot of dirndls, evening dirndls, so the ladies with their terribly expensive brocade or taffeta dirndls.</span> <span id="s1798">The (words missing in original transcript) sitting up there and the very properly dressed guys in dinner jackets and we say those are them.</span> <span id="s1799">These people start talking to us because of a program that drops on the floor or whatever you talk to, and intermission everybody goes for drinks there and we don’t answer.</span> <span id="s1800">And same thing we’ve been together in hotels with the kids.</span> <span id="s1801">We usually go somewheres in the countryside, and people stop and make conversation, you are from New York and blah, blah, blah and how come you speak German.</span> <span id="s1802">They catch on who we are.</span> <span id="s1803">If they don’t catch on we don’t say.</span> <span id="s1804">And I get my hair done and they say oh you speak German so well, you must have been in school here once.</span> <span id="s1805">I say yes.</span> <span id="s1806">I don’t want to explain or anything.</span> <span id="s1807">I remember one very typical statement in (words missing in original transcript) the kids lived in a big modern apartment and they had some friends there and as we came from the airport with the suitcases we meet the neighbor woman in the elevator and she said to me oh I heard you were arriving today.</span> <span id="s1808">Doesn’t it feel good to be back in the old (illegible).</span> <span id="s1809">There’s no English word for that, do you know the word?</span> <span id="s1810">You’ve got to write your name around that.</span> <span id="s1811">And I stared at her and I said something, it’s nice to be here.</span> <span id="s1812">Never once would I have felt in those many years we had been in Germany those other times, because of that close girlfriend that I had there, that at least when our kids lived in London I stopped over in Frankfurt and got together with this girlfriend for a few days, but never once in all those years that I was there did this occur that this was my old home.</span> <span id="s1813">I was there to be with somebody that I wanted to be with, not whether this was nice to be in the old home.</span> <span id="s1814">Never once was this the old home in all those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: In relation to that how do you broach that subject with your daughter – in – law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: My son won’t ever understand it.</span> <span id="s1817">He said the generation is dead, it doesn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s1818">My daughter – in – law was born long after all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Have you met her parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: I met her mother once and I feel what’s the use of talking about it.</span> <span id="s1821">To expect her to understand me.</span> <span id="s1822">I don’t.</span> <span id="s1823">My daughter – in – law knows nothing of it.</span> <span id="s1824">She was born before the war ended.</span> <span id="s1825">She was in 1944.</span> <span id="s1826">What does she know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Does it bother you that she doesn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: She knows and she’s heard.</span> <span id="s1829">It bothered us tremendously that he got married over there.</span> <span id="s1830">And he said why do you do this thing I don’t want.</span> <span id="s1831">But this is all colored by the fact that no doubt that they were extremely well off and that they lead a beautiful life and that there is nothing here that can compare to the way they live.</span> <span id="s1832">So you can never say why don’t you do this.</span> <span id="s1833">They couldn’t do that unless he would be making three times as much.</span> <span id="s1834">She is extremely well educated.</span> <span id="s1835">They have fantastic friends.</span> <span id="s1836">They travel all over the world, and whenever they are here they say Eeh God, New York.</span> <span id="s1837">How do you stand it?</span> <span id="s1838">So it is a very bad point of comparison, because it is, when you are over there and you see how much easier people live, and how much cleaner it is, and how much better the schools are, and that the medical system works differently and that the social security system works better, then you have very little argument left for something that happened to you forty years ago.</span> <span id="s1839">Why should they care?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: You mentioned that when you went back to Frankfurt one of your greatest pleasures was that it was in rubble.</span> <span id="s1841">Well today that is very different all over Germany.</span> <span id="s1842">How do you feel about the fact that they have done so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Lousy.</span> <span id="s1844">Always did.</span> <span id="s1845">Lousy, that’ (words missing in original transcript) there’s no justice in this world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Same thought that is running through my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: I can’t hold that against (words missing in original transcript) and I never do and we have a great thing going together and beautiful kids, and to her and her mother, they don’t even know even know any Jews.</span> <span id="s1848">They know so little about Jews.</span> <span id="s1849">They thought that interestingly enough that the U.S. is run to (words missing in original transcript) the Jews and in the many years before coming here she found out about that (words missing in original transcript) insurance agencies and government and with all her education and all her degrees she didn’t know any of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: But the interesting part is her mother.</span> <span id="s1851">Her mother must have known Jews in Germany before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Her mother was a seamstress for a lot of Jews, but then quite on purpose we didn’t look for any contact with her mother.</span> <span id="s1853">We felt the two weeks we were there every two years we want to see the kids.</span> <span id="s1854">And the mother was there so we didn’t say where is your mother.</span> <span id="s1855">Once we sacrificed for three days with her mother, she happened to be really a lovely, capable bright and sparkling older lady, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: You never brought up the discussion in terms of some people catch on and some people don’t, where people have caught on...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: Then they ask incessant questions.</span> <span id="s1858">Who do I owe an answer to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: So you’ve avoided...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1861">Am I going to sit in a hotel restaurant with somebody at the same table and ask them questions, you know, why are you here, where...?</span> <span id="s1862">If I were to have a choice I wouldn’t be there.</span> <span id="s1863">I went to Frankfurt to see my girlfriend, She was here frequently, her parents were here.</span> <span id="s1864">As I said half – Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s1865">She was married there.</span> <span id="s1866">Also married a newspaper man.</span> <span id="s1867">They met and she wrote and they made scads of money and they built a fabulous house, and visiting there was a great deal of fun.</span> <span id="s1868">I usually did it for three or four days to go shopping and we had a ball like old girlfriends can get together for three or four days of shopping and doing great restaurants, and my husband usually came back here because he didn’t know them much and it was boring for him, and living in that beautiful house and she died at a very early age, and so did her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: Have you ever gone to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Okay, I was just curious.</span> <span id="s1872">By the way just in relation to Germany, how do you feel about the vitagutmacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: I feel good about it because I am affected by it.</span> <span id="s1874">They do a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">PAGE 18</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">PAGE</span></p>
