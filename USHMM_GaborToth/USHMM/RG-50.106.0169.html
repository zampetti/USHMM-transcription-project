camp.</span> <span id="s300">It was called Lienzingen.</span> <span id="s301">It’s a -- the Auschwitz of Poznan, it’s a well-known city.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: H-How did you know that you had to leave the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Well, they announced kids from 14 to 18 have to -- have to assemble in a certain place.</span> <span id="s304">We have to go to work, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s305">They have to do what they tell you to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Boys and girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No, boys, boys.</span> <span

<span id="s318">They went there and they took us to this camp, and that’s where I was, in Lienzingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So this is you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No, I was separate.</span> <span id="s321">I was going -- I was go different times, different age.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: How old was your bro -- na -- 1940 sa --</span></p> <p><span

the other 14 to 18 year old boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: And what was the feeling then, when you were all together in that gathering place?</span> <span id="s335">What were the boys saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: It wasn’t very pleasant, we knew something bad is going to happen, but what can you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: What did you bring with you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Nothing very much, just a little -- little bag with some clothes, that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What did your parents say to you when you said goodbye?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Oh, we’ll see you soon back.</span> <span id="s341">Don’t worry, and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Were you -- do you remember being particularly frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, frightened, yeah, I was frightened because I thought never return again home.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: How did you know that at a young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well, I could see what’s -- what’s developing, you know, is get worse by the day, so I knew that something bad is going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: So then you -- they gathered you and they took you to this other place.</span> <span id="s347">How did you get to the next -- to the work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: They took us with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: In trucks, or how?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No, military truck, they got benches on both sides and [indecipherable] out the -- make the [indecipherable] of it, and they -- they took us to that place, Lienzingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: And please describe Lienzingen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Lienzingen was the first camp, and we worked, they took us several kil-kilomers, we had to walk to a place, a zoological garden.</span> <span id="s353">There was no animals, we were the animals actually, and we dug ditches.</span> <span id="s354">They measured up so many -- so many feet th-the lengths, so many feet the widths, and so many feet the depth.</span> <span id="s355">And you have to do it through -- through the day.</span> <span id="s356">Day in and day out, the same thing, may -- we dug those di-ditches.</span> <span id="s357">And it was terrible, very, very bad.</span> <span id="s358">And they told us, this is the last week, and we going to go to another place, going to be much nicer, the food will be better, everything will be better, and the -- we’re going to go -- they’re going to ship us to Germany.</span> <span id="s359">And I didn’t like it, to go Germany, I didn’t like it at all.</span> <span id="s360">So I didn’t tell anybody in the camp, my friends, that I made up my mind I’m not going to go, I going to escape.</span> <span id="s361">Well, I mean -- and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Um, before we get to that, let’s talk a little bit more about the conditions in -- in Lienzingen.</span> <span id="s363">Did you sleep in a barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Yeah, there was -- there wasn’t a barracks yet, and it was like a -- like a -- like herrings, one on top, next to each other, th-the bunks, like, you know?</span> <span id="s365">And the -- and I mean, it was -- was very bad.</span> <span id="s366">And that’s frightened, more than anything else, to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s367">I figure, well I was born in Poland, I might as well die there, I don’t want to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s368">And th-they told us, this is the last week, and we’re going to go away to Germany.</span> <span id="s369">I did make up my mind, I’m not going to go.</span> <span id="s370">And I did escape from the -- from the place I was working, and they knew right away that I escape, because you have to line up for a roll call, and they were looking for me, I no -- I knew that.</span> <span id="s371">And I took a chance, a big chance.</span> <span id="s372">I think my mind didn't work right, if anybody with -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape.</span> <span id="s373">And the reason for that is, some of them did escape, but they caught them in no time.</span> <span id="s374">And th -- when they caught them in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thursday, or whatever day was, they put them -- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped, and Sunday they brought them out on roll call, everybody was there lined up.</span> <span id="s375">They brought them up, they brought a portable gallow, and he was hanged.</span> <span id="s376">So I knew what’s going to happen when -- when they catch me.</span> <span id="s377">But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I didn’t think about that, and I was lucky, very extremely lucky they didn’t catch me.</span> <span id="s378">So I went from pillar to post, like the saying goes, knock on the door, beg for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s379">Some -- some women, some people offered to give me a piece of bread, others slammed the door in my face.</span> <span id="s380">Get -- get the hell out of here, dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s381">They knew right -- right away I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s382">So after awhile, if I had somebody with me, I would probably wind out in the -- in the forest, but by myself didn’t know where to go, how to go.</span> <span id="s383">So, I was -- and I knew at the college, there was -- there were Jews there, and there was a ghetto there, I knew that.</span> <span id="s384">So took me days, weeks, maybe several months, little by little I got into the city, to college, and little kids were playing [indecipherable] ball there, and I went and talked to them, and I said, I understand the Jews live here, they call it the ghetto or something, can you show me where it is?</span> <span id="s385">So one boy is pulling on the other, don’t talk to him, th-the -- it’s prohibit and you can’t go there.</span> <span id="s386">You cannot go there, and the only -- the one of them said come, I’ll show you.</span> <span id="s387">He went with me and from a distance I saw already th-th-the fence, you know.</span> <span id="s388">And -- and I went there, and -- and I was walking close by.</span> <span id="s389">And there was a gate there, the gate was open, the chain was hanging down, and the Germans, the Nazis were going back and forth.</span> <span id="s390">One was going this way, the other one was going this way, and they meet.</span> <span id="s391">And the -- and the gate was open [indecipherable] down, when there’s s -- when they start talking, I crossed over and I smuggle myself in.</span> <span id="s392">They luckily didn’t notice me.</span> <span id="s393">But who noticed me?</span> <span id="s394">The Jewish police.</span> <span id="s395">Wh-What th -- they have a black uniform with the nightstick, and armband, dai politsi, police, and that’s all they had.</span> <span id="s396">So they grabbed me, and they start talking in Polish to me, what right do you have to -- to smuggle yourself into the ghetto, in Polish.</span> <span id="s397">I says -- and I talk back in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s398">And they couldn’t believe, because oh, the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there, th-the -- ye -- you know, with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live, and he picked up some Jewish, he is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s399">And I tried to talk to him, I’m Jewish, I’m Jewish, no, no.</span> <span id="s400">They took me in a room there and I said, I can tell you I’m Jewish because there come a transport from Kalish and there were some -- a couple of doctors there.</span> <span id="s401">Dr. Cohen was one of them.</span> <span id="s402">Then another one, but I couldn’t -- I couldn’t remember the other one, and they said to me [indecipherable] saying the other, well the kid is talking sense because they shipped out some people with the Dr. Cohen, somebody else, anyway.</span> <span id="s403">So they said, okay, what is your name?</span> <span id="s404">They wrote down the letters Fievish Nicinski and then they wrote in big letters too, your name is Bahardian Elias, born [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s405">And I was the age -- they make the age like 27 years old.</span> <span id="s406">So -- so we g -- we going to check with you.</span> <span id="s407">We not tell you when, tomorrow, next day, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s408">You’re not going to take out a piece of paper, you have to memorize the name in where was you -- where was you born.</span> <span id="s409">So I recognized that [indecipherable] that I had tried to memorize all this, and they took me in next day, what is your name?</span> <span id="s410">So I have to tell them Bahardian [indecipherable] this and that.</span> <span id="s411">And then I learned from the others, that the guy like this escaped.</span> <span id="s412">They didn’t notify the -- the German authority, so they got a special ration of whatever the -- you know, bread and milk, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s413">They didn’t -- they didn’t tell the German that he escaped.</span> <span id="s414">So I took his name.</span> <span id="s415">And so from there, one fine night they circled the ghetto, raus, raus, raus, out, out, out.</span> <span id="s416">And they took us to another ghetto, Lódz.</span> <span id="s417">Lithmanstadt.</span> <span id="s418">They call it Lódz, Lódz ghetto.</span> <span id="s419">There I was, and I worked there, I worked there hard.</span> <span id="s420">There was a -- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, SS, Gestapo uniforms.</span> <span id="s421">And they told me, you have to be extremely, extremely careful.</span> <span id="s422">Don’t let any spot come out and make holes in it, because that’s very dangerous.</span> <span id="s423">You -- you pay a big penalty for that.</span> <span id="s424">The irons weren’t like it is here, electric.</span> <span id="s425">They were born -- burn -- burn wood, like, used to be, you know?</span> <span id="s426">And heated up the irons.</span> <span id="s427">And that’s how it was.</span> <span id="s428">And from there they took me to a camp near Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span> <span id="s429">That was the biggest Polish ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span

coffee.</span> <span id="s482">It was black, but we -- we don’t know what it -- what it was in it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And what about lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Lunch

<span id="s510">They caught them [indecipherable] th-they looked obvious, with the dogs, they had the -- they sniffed them out.</span> <span id="s511">I was just extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s512">And then, what’s happened is that when they brought them in, like I told you, they -- they -- they -- on Sunday they brought them up and they -- they hanged them -- not only this, we were watching it, standing there in the roll call, you have to watch exactly, not look away one way or the other, left or right.</span> <span id="s513">They point out, if you look away, you’ll be next.</span> <span id="s514">If you look one way or the other way, left or right.</span> <span id="s515">You had to look straight ahead, and they have a speech there.</span> <span id="s516">This is -- this is the -- th-the verdict for -- for e-escaping.</span> <span id="s517">That’s how far you can go.</span> <span id="s518">This is it.</span> <span id="s519">You try to escape and that’s what -- that what’s going to happen to you.</span> <span id="s520">Then they put the fear o-over you, you know.</span> <span id="s521">But I did it, I -- I don’t know, it -- it was difficult, but I da -- I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s522">Once I did I regret anyway because -- because I -- I -- I was talking to myself I shou -- maybe I should go back.</span> <span id="s523">And if I do go back, I’ll be lucky enough to get in, they know I -- they knew already I was missing, so this certain death, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s524">So I couldn’t go back in.</span></p> <p><span

lot.</span> <span id="s534">I didn't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: What do you attribute your strength to, to deciding to take this incredible chance?</span> <span id="s536">I mean, that took a lot of inner strength.</span> <span id="s537">H-Ho -- wh-what do you attribute that to?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I can’t exactly explain that.</span> <span id="s539">I don’t think I had a brain, if I did have, it’s all blocked.</span> <span id="s540">I bra -- I didn’t -- I didn’t see the danger, somehow.</span> <span id="s541">I just was thinking I didn’t want to go to Germany, and that was it.</span> <span id="s542">I didn’t see the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Did you tell anybody you were going to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Never said a word to anybody because I’m afraid if they opened their mouth, where are you going and this and that, somebody will listen to it.</span> <span id="s545">I -- it’s going to be very bad for me.</span> <span id="s546">No, I didn’t tell anybody, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What were you wearing when you -- and what time of day was it when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: It was a -- in the beginning we start working, they measure out how many feet, how ma -- this and that, so I didn’t do anything, I had mo-moved r-right away, in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And you

this time, this is -- these are the clothes you brought from home?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yeah, but you could -- you could change there, you could get something different.</span> <span

that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Well, that didn’t feel -- not too good, but we have no choice, what can you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Were you angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Very angry, yes, but you couldn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s812">You just do what they tell you to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: How did you live with that anger?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Well, with the hope that tomorrow would be better, that’s all.</span> <span id="s815">Always hope and hope and hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And did

with two horses, he was riding with that horse.</span> <span id="s826">He was -- he was allowed to go out in the ghetto, too, and come back.</span> <span id="s827">But didn’t do me any good anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So you didn’t -- di-did you have a feeling that people were very frightened, or just going -- living from day to day, which -- which mood were they in?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, they were very frightened, very frightened, yes.</span> <span id="s830">It got worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s831">You have to stand in line

<p><span id="s865">A: Like I mention before, they took us to Skarzysko-Kamienna, which is the most -- the biggest ammunition factory in Poland.</span> <span id="s866">There were three -- three camps there, A, B and C, but anyway -- and I was there for a few months.</span> <span id="s867">Then they send me --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Ho-Ho-How -- how -- how many people left the Lódz ghetto

Wartawerk, also three camps there, and that well -- I was working on ammunition, I was producing bullets, if you will, for guns o-or pistols.</span> <span id="s880">And that was hard work, because their machine, they have to t-teach us if the machine stops to know how to fix it and took a long time to learn it, and if -- and if you don’t, how dumb you are, [indecipherable] they curse you, they kick you.</span> <span id="s881">And we had to learn, and I did.</span> <span id="s882">And that was the last camp, those three camps in Poland.</span> <span id="s883">Then they shipped us to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: All right, before we get to Germany, you said you were in Wartawerk, that wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Wartawerk --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q:

walking by myself for weeks and several months.</span> <span id="s1005">And at least we’re going together with -- with other Jewish boys, I figure well, whatever would happen to them, it’ll happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: So you then arrive in -- in Dora.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: And -- and what will you do, what were you working at there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: In Dora it was -- that was the forest -- the forest camp already.</span> <span id="s1010">And that was -- happened to be the worst one of all, so far.</span> <span id="s1011">I was working outside, loading the ready material what came out from the bunker, and also unloading the raw material what came in.</span> <span id="s1012">And the sirens start blowing the [indecipherable] the siren, and they said no matter what you’re doing, drop everything, and if you hear that, run into the bunker as fast as you possibly can.</span> <span id="s1013">So it happen, you know, we hear the siren blowing, and we run into i -- into the bunker and in groups, the Polish groups here, Hungarian groups a different place, Romanian, Czechs and so on.</span> <span id="s1014">And we talk quiet in the Polish so wouldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1015">And we could hear a little bit that they bomb above us.</span> <span id="s1016">And was all over, raus, raus, out, out, out, went out, and we were disappointed.</span> <span id="s1017">Were so disappointed maybe next time God will help, it’ll penetrate and -- and we’ll all get killed, because it was miserable, we couldn’t take it no more.</span> <span id="s1018">Well, another time came and was the same thing, and we were disappointed.</span> <span id="s1019">And finally they say, well, this is the last week you’re going to work here, they’re going to go to another place, it’s going to be much better.</span> <span id="s1020">So we say, well, you see, he said [indecipherable] he said there’s no God, oh there’s God, oh glory halleluiah, there’s a God after all, we hug each other.</span> <span id="s1021">The name didn’t mean anything, really.</span> <span id="s1022">So from Dora, we went to a place named Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Before -- yeah, w-we’ll talk about Buchen-Buchenwald in a minute.</span> <span id="s1024">Yo-You were willing to get killed in Dora in the bombing raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yeah, we were hoping that that -- that will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Because get out the misery, you know, it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: W-Was this -- were they starting to make the V2 bombers at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Well, they produce the V2 rockets, which they sent to England, they bombed England, London, that was the V2 rockets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Now, when you said you were into the bunkers, was that the tunnels that they had at Dora?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: It’s exactly the tunnel, where the machinery were and they were all working there inside.</span> <span id="s1032">That was in the tunnel.</span> <span id="s1033">We have to go in there when they ha -- when we heard the siren blowing, you know, we have to go in there.</span> <span id="s1034">That’s where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: But your work was always outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Mine was always outside, happened to be, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Because I understand that the people who worked inside couldn’t get outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: No, no, they have to be inside, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And did they give you enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No, very little food.</span> <span id="s1041">Food wasn’t very much at all.</span> <span id="s1042">Lot of people think because it was a labor camp they gave you more.</span> <span id="s1043">If they did, I didn’t noticed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And again, was it just coffee and soup and bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Yeah, the same thing, yeah.</span> <span id="s1046">Didn’t change much from one camp to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Ho -- were you very, very thin by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Yes, I lost weight continuously, all the time, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: [indecipherable] your health at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: The health wasn’t too bad, just weak, hungry all the time, dirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: S-So, when you were in Dora, did you have any hope left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Very little, we were disappointed.</span> <span id="s1053">We were disappointed that, you know, they don’t do anything -- a better job than that, than -- they have a heavier bomb, a better bomb to penetrate.</span> <span id="s1054">They didn’t have it at that time.</span> <span id="s1055">We were disappointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Did you know where the V2 rockets were going to be sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: No, no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1059">So you -- you stayed in d -- in Dora for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Oh, quite a few months, I don’t know exactly how long, but quite a few months.</span> <span id="s1061">Then we went to, of course, the Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Did you know what Buchenwald was before you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: No, just the name.</span> <span id="s1064">The same like Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1065">Was a city, nobody knew anything about Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: And how many were in your group when you left from Dora to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: I have no idea, whole bunch of us, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1068">I don’t know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And wher -- and where did you think, or -- where did you think you would be going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: They didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s1071">They just move me -- or moved us, we were leaving, and the place was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1072">It wasn’t too far from Dora.</span> <span id="s1073">The outskirts of Dora, not too far, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And when you got there, what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: In Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s1076">We saw misery.</span> <span id="s1077">In Buchenwald it was -- it was a big camp, it was over 80,000 people there.</span> <span id="s1078">There were boys and girls there, in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1079">That was a huge camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: And where did they put you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: In barracks, like those -- those bunks, you know, like -- like sardines, one next to another.</span> <span id="s1082">And it was -- it wasn’t very pleasant at all.</span> <span id="s1083">The worst of all was the lice.</span> <span id="s1084">You have so much lice they eat you up alive.</span> <span id="s1085">You scratch and they nest there, and you scratch more.</span> <span id="s1086">You couldn’t ask -- you couldn’t tell a doctor or anybody like this that you got hurt, or hurt you or something.</span> <span id="s1087">You di -- can’t open your mouth and saying anything like that.</span> <span id="s1088">Once you say you si -- you sick, you’re going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Did you -- wa -- wer-were there lice in the other places that you had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: All of them, plenty.</span> <span id="s1091">Sunday we took out the blanket, put them in the snow, wintertime.</span> <span id="s1092">You picked them out, there was a perfect square, all dark, with hundreds and thousands pounds of lice.</span> <span id="s1093">But the couple, two or three days after, they come back, because they -- they -- there -- there was some eggs still there, and they -- you know, they -- they want a body, they come back.</span> <span id="s1094">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: So you never went to s -- a so-called infirmary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: A-And you said you had lice on your body?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes,

id="s1101">Q: What kind of work did you do in Buchenwald, or did you do any work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: In Buchenwald didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1103">I don’t remember doing anything in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: So you just sat, during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Do -- doing nothing, just sit there and do nothing.</span> <span id="s1106">I didn’t do anything, I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: And again, what were your thoughts when you would see German soldiers?</span> <span id="s1108">What thoughts would be going through your mind when you would see German soldiers, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: You was terrified.</span> <span id="s1110">You see a new uniform, that -- it was very, very upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Did they ever talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: They talk, not a nice way.</span> <span id="s1113">They curse you.</span> <span id="s1114">They damn you all the time, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1115">You never do anything right.</span> <span id="s1116">No matter what you do, it’s still not right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Did you try to make any attempts to escape from Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s1118">A: No, not in Germany, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Well, it was a foreign land.</span> <span id="s1121">I just wanted to stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s1122">Didn’t work, so -- oh no, I wasn’t going to do that, no.</span> <span id="s1123">Not in -- not in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: And again, when you -- were there any people with you, any young men with you who had come all of the -- i-in the different camps with you, the same person whether -- were -- were there a group of people that stayed with you through all the different camps, or was it every time you went to a different camp there were new people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Very few.</span> <span id="s1126">Some of them did, but not that many, but they moved you around, they split you up, you know.</span> <span id="s1127">You never knew -- no-not too many from my city.</span> <span id="s1128">I can count the -- you know, they were with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Were you an especially close group, those of you from your city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: A close group, sure, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: W-Were you a support to each other, do you feel that that helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Well we were talking maybe tomorrow we were better, we hope we’ll be liberated.</span> <span id="s1133">We knew it -- it’s not good, but we hoped tomorrow will be better, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: And so you were in Buchenwald for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1136">I don’t know, six months, eight, something like that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1137">And then we went to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: So for six months you just sat around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I don’t remember doing anything in Buchenwald, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: And then they told you you’d be leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Well, they didn’t tell us, th-they took us one da -- one fine day to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: That was the last camp, the third camp in Germany, that was Bergen-Belsen, and that’s where we were -- we were liberated by the British at that -- the British liberated Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1144">And three days prior to the liberation, they almost killed me.</span> <span id="s1145">It was very close.</span> <span id="s1146">It happened on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1147">I went down the basement, there we take -- you know, splash up the face with a little water sometime.</span> <span id="s1148">And I come up with the -- with a can that -- a rusty can that I had -- I find there, and -- it’s water.</span> <span id="s1149">Sure enough a German standing above, and I’m coming up the steps.</span> <span id="s1150">[speaks German here] Wh-Where were you?</span> <span id="s1151">Like he couldn’t see, he wasn’t blind.</span> <span id="s1152">I said, well I -- I went downstairs to get mi -- water.</span> <span id="s1153">My hands were shaking and I was spilling the water a little bit, and I knew it’s going to be a lot of trouble there.</span> <span id="s1154">And sure enough, I c -- I get up closer, closer up.</span> <span id="s1155">He took out the -- the baton, th-the one he had the -- on the side there, the stick.</span> <span id="s1156">But that was different one, they made it with lead inside it, it’s -- every time he hits you, it break your bone.</span> <span id="s1157">And [indecipherable] it over the head, and split my head there, and I falls, luckily, I fall forward and not back, because back is further you fell, you -- you wouldn’t be here to tell the story.</span> <span id="s1158">But I fell forward and I hit the edge and I -- and I couldn’t get up, of course, I was bleeding all over.</span> <span id="s1159">And I was told that the -- the f -- the -- the -- the -- the friends, the one I was sl -- they were sleeping next to each other, they -- they saw me there and they -- they dragged me into my -- into -- into the barrack, in the bunk there, and -- and I was unconscious.</span> <span id="s1160">I was un -- three -- three days I didn’t go to pick up my bread there, nothing like that, I couldn’t, I couldn’t, I was all black and blue and the nose was broken.</span> <span id="s1161">So anyway they -- when they come there, the British liberated Bergen-Belsen, they took me the portable ambulance, if you will.</span> <span id="s1162">And they did the best they could, they fix my nose.</span> <span id="s1163">But they didn’t put it right back, it’s a little bit off [indecipherable] straight, it’s a little bit off.</span> <span id="s1164">And it can be seen or felt if someone touches.</span> <span id="s1165">And that was -- that was the closest one I ever come to -- to die.</span> <span id="s1166">And -- an-and -- and that was it.</span> <span id="s1167">So I was liberated, and then -- then I have a couple of cousins, I da -- wasn’t with them in same camp.</span> <span id="s1168">They were liberated by the Americans, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Were -- you s -- you said that your cousins were in your -- in the same camp?</span> <span id="s1170">Did you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: No, no, I -- in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Oh, in a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: They were liberated by the Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: -- different camp.</span> <span id="s1175">B-Before we get to the lib -- the liberation, again, let’s just talk a little more about Bergen-Belsen, did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: No.</span> <span id="s1177">No, not in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: So again, you just sat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1180">I sat there, yes, that’s all, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: And I know you had described very movingly, in detail about, in the very beginning of your story, about the young man who tried to escape and was taken to the gallows.</span> <span id="s1182">You obviously had seen a lot of people, dead people in those years since then.</span> <span id="s1183">Wha -- wha -- how did you -- did you ever get accustomed to seeing dead people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: You never get accustomed, you see there was every single night people die there.</span> <span id="s1185">Every single -- never miss one single night and nobody would die, some people died.</span> <span id="s1186">There were 10 - 15 - 20, even in -- in Buchenwald, it was recorded in 24 hours, 72 death.</span> <span id="s1187">So had to take the -- the clothes off, drag them out there, put them -- put them outside, and then they come with the wagon, which we have to pull it, and others will put -- put them on the wagons like -- like sticks, you know, they look like sticks, and move them away.</span> <span id="s1188">Every single day, every single day, never miss a day.</span> <span id="s1189">There was none on -- any corpses outside.</span> <span id="s1190">You have to put them outside.</span> <span id="s1191">Take the clothes off, and put them outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: What does that do to a 18 - 19 - 20 year old to have to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: It doesn’t look good at all, we don’t feel good.</span> <span id="s1194">We feel well, today is them, tomorrow i -- it would be me, maybe.</span> <span id="s1195">That’s how they feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Was there a feeling of sadness that you had, or was it fear?</span> <span id="s1197">What -- what do you think your emotions are when you were forced to see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Well, it was fear and sadness, both.</span> <span id="s1199">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: And was there any intermingling with women in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: No, there was th -- chicken wire was dividing up, that was the women with the men.</span> <span id="s1202">There were nothing common, there’s nothing to talk.</span> <span id="s1203">They were -- they walked in their misery, we have our misery [indecipherable] no.</span> <span id="s1204">There was nothing to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: So in all of those years, once you went -- started going to the labor camps and then to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: -- an-an-and Bergen-Belsen, you -- you really had no contact with girls or women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No, I never did, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: And for a young man at that age, that must have been difficult.</span> <span id="s1210">Or was it not on your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: No, that wasn’t on my mind at all, because we have problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: You didn’t have the luxury of thinking about that.</span> <span id="s1213">When the -- tell me about the liberation, what -- what was it like?</span> <span id="s1214">I know you were sick, you said, but did you understand what was happening when the British soldiers came?</span> <span id="s1215">Did you know what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I understood what’s happened because they -- they took all the wires down, and -- and th -- and they buried the corpses in -- in -- in the right place the way it should be buried, no-not mass graves.</span> <span id="s1217">And it was -- it -- it was different ball game altogether.</span> <span id="s1218">And even after the war -- after the liberation, that is, a lot of -- lot of people died there, by the hundreds and thousands because they’re not used to eat.</span> <span id="s1219">The stomach -- there wasn’t much of a stomach, it’s all shrunk, then they tried to expand, and they with all kinds of diseases and sicknesses, you know, and they couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1220">So a lot of them died.</span> <span id="s1221">They have all kind diarrheas, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1222">You couldn’t go to the bathroom because there’s only one bathroom an-and 50 or 100 - 200 people wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1223">So the-they built something the outside, li-like a -- a -- you know, and people go there, outside.</span> <span id="s1224">Like -- like trenches with -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1225">Anyway, it wasn't very nice, and so after that, like I mentioned, I had the couple of cousins there who were liberated by the -- by the Americans.</span> <span id="s1226">They couldn’t go to every camp, but in the gip -- in the big camps they did go and looked up names.</span> <span id="s1227">But after the war you -- you can get your own name, you didn’t have any more a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: What -- what was your -- you were given a number?</span> <span id="s1229">What was your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I can’t remember now, but I got there about six, seven numbers there.</span> <span id="s1231">I don’t remember that, I don’t look at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: I-In what camp were you given the number?</span> <span id="s1233">Was it in Germany or in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: That was in Germany, I think.</span> <span id="s1235">Yes, anyway, so i -- th -- my -- my two cousins, my mitha -- my mother and their father were sister brother, so that makes it -- make us first cousins.</span> <span id="s1236">So they come and -- and a f-few of th -- few of those big camps like Buchenwald and they come to Bergen-Belsen, look up my name, oh they saw me there [indecipherable] you know and he said, well, what do you have to lose here, let’s go in the medical zone.</span> <span id="s1237">And I already find mine Aunt Rifka.</span> <span id="s1238">Nothing do with -- with me, she not relati -- she not related to me at all.</span> <span id="s1239">Rifka is my cousin’s mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s1240">So nothing to me.</span> <span id="s1241">She’s already there, but I knew her from -- from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1242">So we went to -- in the American zone, and we stayed there in a place named Bamberg, not too far from Nuremberg where those -- those criminals were jud -- you know, judged.</span> <span id="s1243">And we stayed there and then they wanted to come to America, and I didn’t feel like I wanted to come to America.</span> <span id="s1244">It’s -- something was bothering me.</span> <span id="s1245">What it was is, I want to go as far as I possibly can, I don’t have no -- no borders.</span> <span id="s1246">Although it’s a friendly border here with Canada, but th-the borders upset me in Poland.</span> <span id="s1247">There was Russians, there were the Germans, none of them were good for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1248">So they went to America and I went a different direction altogether.</span> <span id="s1249">I went to Australia.</span> <span id="s1250">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1252">We’ll talk about Australia in a minute.</span> <span id="s1253">Di -- whe-when the British came to you in -- in Bergen-Belsen for -- at liberation, di-did you feel a sense of freedom at that point?</span> <span id="s1254">What -- what -- what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: I felt a sense of freedom cause I knew I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1256">And th-the loudspeaker loudly was speaking every language there.</span> <span id="s1257">You could understand that the food is on the way, and the help is on the way.</span> <span id="s1258">And -- and we feel good, because the wires came down.</span> <span id="s1259">Oh, that’s okay.</span> <span id="s1260">Th-The wire -- the wires came down and -- and we --we knew we were liberated, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: What were your feel -- I mean, in all these years of being a prisoner, and now you’re liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: You had a good feeling when you were liberated, then the -- the -- another thing was hope that my mother and father will be still alive, and the -- the rest of the family, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Did you consider going back to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Because?</span> <span id="s1266">A: I didn’t want to go back because I had the [indecipherable] a gut feeling I had that I’ll -- I’ll find nobody there.</span> <span id="s1267">I di -- I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1268">But my cousins did.</span> <span id="s1269">They -- they -- they encourage me to go and I said no, I don’t want to go to Poland back there, no.</span> <span id="s1270">So they went and they went to their city, nobody there.</span> <span id="s1271">They went to my little city where I was born, and there was nobody left there either.</span> <span id="s1272">See, what they did is they took the people out, the men, to the cemetery, and they dug a -- a trench there, didn’t know what for.</span> <span id="s1273">And then after they finish, they took all the rest of th -- of the people out there and shoot them and bulldozed them down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: And do you think that’s what happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: I guess.</span> <span id="s1276">That’s all I can guess, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Felix Nicinski.</span> <span id="s1279">This is tape number two, side B. And you were saying before that after liberation you did not want to go back to your town, but your cousins did, and there was no one there, and you heard what had happened to your family.</span> <span id="s1280">So then your f -- and then your -- you said also before that you didn’t want to go to a place where there were borders, and that’s why you decided to go to Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yeah, that’s true, I didn’t want to have -- if that’s what you call civilization, Europe, that’s -- I have enough of that.</span> <span id="s1282">So I wanted to go away as far as I possibly can.</span> <span id="s1283">That’s how I wind up in Australia.</span> <span id="s1284">I was there for some 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Okay, but where -- where were you
