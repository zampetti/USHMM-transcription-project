<html><body><p><span id="s1">Eva Feist 5/20/78 Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s2">On September 13th, 1920 in Eisenach, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Did you grow up in Eisenach?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">I grew up in Eisenach as long as I stayed in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q. Can you tell me a little bit about your education there?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s7">I went four years to elementary school as everybody did in those days, and then went to the lyceum (higher academic education) and then after a quarter, I think, I said to my parents, “I think it would be better if I would go to the handelschuler (business school).</span> <span id="s8">I would get some more practical education besides the strictly lyceum education because the way things look it might be more advantageous for me for later years.</span> <span id="s9">And they agreed to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q.</span> <span id="s11">You said, “The way things look.”</span> <span id="s12">How early was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A.</span> <span id="s14">That was about ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q.</span> <span id="s16">How did it look in ’33 for your…</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A. From my angle it was Eisenach was…Turin was a stronghold of the Nazis from the word “go” and, of course, it manifested itself very rapidly then.</span> <span id="s18">I had always been friends with Jewish as well as non-Jewish girls and boys, as far as that’s concerned.</span> <span id="s19">We were kids together: same neighborhood and the ones with whom I really got close, the ones who really lived close to me and with whom I got together daily on the basis of the elementary school being in the area, they were 90% non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s20">On girl, in particular, grew up more in our house and my nursemaid at the time took her for walks as well as me.</span> <span id="s21">She was always in our house.</span> <span id="s22">Her father worked for the government and almost within 3 – 4 months of Hitler come in, she drifted away completely and I got the signal very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q. To a 12 year old girl to lose a best friend like that, it was very hard to</span></p> <p><span id="s24">understand…</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A. Yes, very traumatic and very upsetting and this to me gave me the first “What’s the matter?</span> <span id="s26">Why am I different all of a sudden?”</span> <span id="s27">I can also say that I had another girlfriend who, to the last day said to me “Well you are no different.”</span> <span id="s28">That was just before my immigration and I said, “Look, you cannot walk down the street with me.”</span> <span id="s29">“What do you mean I cannot walk down the street with you?”</span> <span id="s30">You also had some, but not many, of these in Eisenach.</span> <span id="s31">But the majority of those in Eisenach was pretty anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Did you ever remember going home and telling your parents like when this first friend you mentioned wouldn’t talk to you anymore…how did they try and protect you or how did they try and explain to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A. Well, they said it’s a political thing.</span> <span id="s34">Her father works for the government and she probably cannot.</span> <span id="s35">Their livelihood was more important than children’s friendships.</span> <span id="s36">And of course I drifted more with Jewish and stayed with the Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q. Were you ever prevented from going back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A.</span> <span id="s39">When I changed schools to the handelschule I soon afterwards I find tickets on my desk.</span> <span id="s40">“This is a ticket to Palestine.</span> <span id="s41">One way.</span> <span id="s42">No return….”</span> <span id="s43">We were maybe 4 or 5 Jewish children altogether in this school and one after the other resigned.</span> <span id="s44">Some graduated, some resigned and I was strictly by myself finally.</span> <span id="s45">None of the others really wanted to have anything to do with me and I was called Jew and dirty Jew and and all the favorite expressions.</span> <span id="s46">One day, the handschule did not have a big gymnasium for various functions, we used the lyceum gymnasium and the principal said to me, “you go ahead and sit in the last row by yourself.”</span> <span id="s47">So I went.</span> <span id="s48">I went home and from that day I said I’m not going to school anymore.</span> <span id="s49">My parents, as much as they hated me to leave without having gotten the einyager, could see my point.</span> <span id="s50">I went to the school and said that I wanted to resign.</span> <span id="s51">The principal happened to pass me and said “What are YOU doing here?”</span> <span id="s52">I said I want to resign.</span> <span id="s53">He said, “Thank God, now we are rid of the last Jew!”</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q. Again, for me, the most difficult thing is for a 13 - 14 year old girl…</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. I was a little older.</span> <span id="s56">It was very upsetting.</span> <span id="s57">The whole surrounding at Eisenach had this kind of an atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q.</span> <span id="s59">Did you ever see signs?</span> <span id="s60">…or you were verboden (forbidden) or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A. Yes, yes, Der Sturmer was…visible page by page in showcases.</span> <span id="s62">Every new edition was displayed in various parts of Eisenach.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q.</span> <span id="s64">You mentioned that…did your father’s business suffer beginning after Hitler came into power?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s66">My father’s business suffered drastically.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q.</span> <span id="s68">What kind of business did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A.</span> <span id="s70">We manufactured high-priced furniture frames, hand-carved, etc.</span> <span id="s71">Manufactured, not imported.</span> <span id="s72">Nation-wide, not international.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q.</span> <span id="s74">About how many people did your father employ?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A. I can’t give you an honest figure, but I would say, between 30 and 50 people but this is so far back that…</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q. Were his salesmen Jewish or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A. My father and my uncle, who were co-owners, traveled nation-wide.</span> <span id="s78">They were the salesmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q. Do you remember any discussions when they came home in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A. No, I do not.</span> <span id="s81">Because I was young and, like many German families, anything of importance was not discussed in front of the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q. Do you remember any discussions of immigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A. Most vivid discussion I remember is between my father and my brother…my father feeling so very German, having fought during the World War, having got the Iron Cross…that anything could ever happen to anybody who was…uh, that all German Jews in one way or the other had…that this could last any length of time…that this was a passing phase and that it would straighten out very rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q.</span> <span id="s85">But you mentioned that your brother was of different opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A. My brother, being older than I.</span> <span id="s87">He graduated school, he went to a trade school wanting to be an interior architect and eventually coming into the company.</span> <span id="s88">My father also had insisted on him getting a business training in a company so that he would know it from all angles…</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q. By business training you mean like a laeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s91">Right.</span> <span id="s92">He was an apprentice in a Jewish firm who were selling houseware, ironware, items like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q. From your point of view, as a teenager, did you notice and difference in your own standard of living as business began to fall off?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A. No, I cannot say that I noticed a different standard of living.</span> <span id="s95">My parents didn’t travel as much anymore outside the country.</span> <span id="s96">But I didn’t really…I was a child.</span> <span id="s97">I was never taken along on these travels anyway.</span> <span id="s98">I was sent to my grandmother’s…but the fear my grandparents lived in Trier, which was in Hessen, which was also very strong territory of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s99">They moved into Eisenach.</span> <span id="s100">They sold their business because that was a retail business and they, their business went down completely.</span> <span id="s101">Anti-Semitism was very great there.</span> <span id="s102">My mother’s brother left Germany, who was in the business.</span> <span id="s103">My parents didn’t go to outside home parties anymore like they used to do… They did not go to the theater anymore.</span> <span id="s104">That also came bit by bit.</span> <span id="s105">They went out to friends’ houses and the social life took place in the houses rather than anywhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q. Were you ever stopped from going to a movie, stopped from shopping in a particular place?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A.</span> <span id="s108">There were signs on…in later years, after I was…After I refused to go back to school I went to werfreithausen which was called a training school, was called a frauschule for…I originally wanted to become a domestic science teacher and this was the school to train you for this.</span> <span id="s109">This school also had a housheracher connected with it.</span> <span id="s110">It was Jewish.</span> <span id="s111">It was run by the logea, by the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s112">I was there for a year and a half and then I went to Frankfurt and took a course in sewing…all to prepare myself to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s113">And when it came to the point of buying things to leave Germany and to so on…by then the signs had appeared in the stores udenavernsh.</span> <span id="s114">I very vividly remember one day that I wanted to go into a store and I come to the door and I see the sign and the owner had known me since I was born and I turned around and she came running after and and she said, “But that’s not meant for you.”</span> <span id="s115">So I told her, “Whether it’s meant for me or not, I’m a Jew and I’m not welcome here.”</span> <span id="s116">There are other stores will still welcome me.</span> <span id="s117">But—we have to do it.</span> <span id="s118">There are still some other stores, maybe not right around here but I will go and travel to a store which does not have it on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q. I would suspect just knowing from the last few years that you didn’t look very Jewish at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A. Definitely not.</span> <span id="s121">As a matter of fact, when we were in elementary school, no it was lyceum, in the schools you were examined by a doctor once a year and the doctor put me in front of the class and said, “Now look at her.</span> <span id="s122">This is how a good German girls should look.”</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q. This—was before the Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A. No, it was at the beginning.</span> <span id="s125">His face turned red, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q.</span> <span id="s127">The reason I asked you that was that in terms of not going into various stores or being restricted in any way, did you find that you were able to go simply because you didn’t look Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A. I could’ve gone in, but I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s129">I mean I also walked around with a Mogen Dovid (Star of David or Jewish Star).</span> <span id="s130">I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s131">I am a Jew and always have been a Jew.</span> <span id="s132">I wasn’t going to hide it and wherever I wasn’t wanted, I certainly wasn’t going to spend my money there.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q. Speaking of your feelings of being Jewish, did you come from an Orthodox or a liberal home?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A. I came…my grandparents, especially my mother’s parents, were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s135">We had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s136">We were, I would say, conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q.</span> <span id="s138">How did the Nazis coming to power affect your feeling of being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A.</span> <span id="s140">It certainly did not diminish it…not make me feel “Gee, why was I born a Jew?”</span> <span id="s141">I was born a Jew.</span> <span id="s142">It’s a fact.</span> <span id="s143">I’m proud of it.</span> <span id="s144">We fought for Judaism all through our history, but at the same time I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q.</span> <span id="s146">You mentioned before the idea of this terror constantly being there.</span> <span id="s147">In what ways did you feel that kind of terror?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A.</span> <span id="s149">The insecurity.</span> <span id="s150">You are insecure as a teenager, as a young child anyway.</span> <span id="s151">You don’t know, am I doing the right, am I doing the wrong thing?</span> <span id="s152">On top of it you see the Sturmer showcases all over.</span> <span id="s153">You see the SS are all over.</span> <span id="s154">You hear it on the radio.</span> <span id="s155">You hear it all over.</span> <span id="s156">You hear continuously what terrible people the Jews are, you hear your peers talking of the miserable Jews.</span> <span id="s157">It doesn’t help a young person to grow up and to be secure.</span> <span id="s158">It’s a lot of fear in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q.</span> <span id="s160">You mentioned that your brother talked about emigrating.</span> <span id="s161">When did your parents think seriously about emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A. My father died of natural causes in ’37 and after that my mother went to visit my brother in Israel and then decided to apply for immigration to Israel.</span> <span id="s163">When she came back she said, “I don’t know how long it will take for us to get to Israel, but I want you out.”</span> <span id="s164">She wrote to a cousin of our father’s in England, would they vouch for me?</span> <span id="s165">They did, they got me a job as a maid with an English family.</span> <span id="s166">I got out in April ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q. Would your father have left had he not died?</span> <span id="s168">Was your father of the opinion then that he would leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A.</span> <span id="s170">When he died, I don’t think he was of the opinion to leave.</span> <span id="s171">I’d like to interject here that it was about the 25th wedding anniversary of my parents and they had planned and applied for a currency to visit my brother in Israel.</span> <span id="s172">But unfortunately my father was very sick beforehand and I could imagine, since my father was a very intelligent man that he would have more or less maybe been talked into it or heard a little something how the outside world felt about it.</span> <span id="s173">He was not alive anymore when the Kristallnacht happened, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q. Your mother, I take it, was not of the same mind?</span> <span id="s175">That it was a passing phase…In the earlier years?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A. My mother was not as strong-minded a woman as my mother-in-law and was, I think, easier influenced by her husband, and also could not visualize that something that terrible could happen in Germany.</span> <span id="s177">My mother then finally wanted to go to Israel but unfortunately did not make it out of Germany.</span> <span id="s178">My mother died in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q.</span> <span id="s180">When she told you that you were to go to England as a maid, how did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A. Which part do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q.</span> <span id="s183">The thought of going alone…</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A.</span> <span id="s185">The thought of going alone did not worry me.</span> <span id="s186">I was, by ’39, 18 years old and life had made me more independent.</span> <span id="s187">I had been away from home various times.</span> <span id="s188">I supposed this is what it had to be and hopefully my mother would get out very soon and we had, we were all going to go to Israel…from England.</span> <span id="s189">My mother was going straight from Germany and when my mother was there then I would go there…because there were visas put in for both of us.</span> <span id="s190">So my stay in England should have really only been temporary and eventually I would join my mother and brother in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q.</span> <span id="s192">How did you feel about going as a maid?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A. Um…I was young.</span> <span id="s194">It had to be done.</span> <span id="s195">There wasn’t a big choice of jobs to be had.</span> <span id="s196">There was no other way to get out.</span> <span id="s197">So go.</span> <span id="s198">I do it.</span> <span id="s199">But I think where I made my big mistake was I hated the family I was with…not a very nice family and it went through my minds various times, I hope my mother will get out very soon, but how could I…should I try to get a maid’s job for my mother to get to England?</span> <span id="s200">But the thought of my mother having to do what I had to do, having had maids herself before…I just couldn’t get myself to expose my mother to treatment like that…which today I know was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q.</span> <span id="s202">What kind of treatment were you exposed to?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A. I had to get up at 6 o’clock in the morning and scrub the stairs before breakfast.</span> <span id="s204">There was another German girl and we were given different food than the family had.</span> <span id="s205">We were treated strictly as the “Colonial maids.”</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q. Were you in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A.</span> <span id="s208">It was outside London.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q.</span> <span id="s210">The day that you left Germany, that must have been very difficult for you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A.</span> <span id="s212">As I said before, I was a teenager…18.</span> <span id="s213">It was partly difficult to leave my mother and to go.</span> <span id="s214">I didn’t really know what was meeting me at the other end.</span> <span id="s215">It was partly also, I suppose, adventure.</span> <span id="s216">I mean, what is it to a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q.</span> <span id="s218">Did you have the hope that your mother would follow you?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A. I had the hope that my mother would go to Israel.</span> <span id="s220">And, of course, nobody figured on this war coming this fast.</span> <span id="s221">At least I didn’t.</span> <span id="s222">My cousins over there didn’t.</span> <span id="s223">And I thought well, if it’s not this month, the month after my mother will go to Israel.</span> <span id="s224">2 or 3 months after, what’s the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q.</span> <span id="s226">Did your grandparents still live in Eisenach?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A. My grandparents had died.</span> <span id="s228">My grandfather first and my grandmother, too, of natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q.</span> <span id="s230">When you said 2 or 3 months didn’t make a difference…were you still in Eisenach on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s231">What happened on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A. I was not in Eisenach, I was in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s233">Taking this sewing course.</span> <span id="s234">I’m sure you heard what happened in Frankfurt many times over.</span> <span id="s235">The temples were burned, people were taken away.</span> <span id="s236">I lived at the time with…this was a lady who had a small pension and I helped her.</span> <span id="s237">I took the sewing course and partly helped her take care of the people.</span> <span id="s238">So I lived free with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q. Was this a Jewish lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A.</span> <span id="s241">A Jewish lady, yes.</span> <span id="s242">There were mainly elderly people.</span> <span id="s243">One day, shortly after the Kristallnacht, the doorbell rings and there stands a man all beaten up and, as it happened to be, he was a friend of my parents who came from Eschweger and we took him in.</span> <span id="s244">This was awful to see this man so beaten up, was really a very dramatic thing.</span> <span id="s245">And I tried to contact my mother in Eisenach, which was impossible for…days.</span> <span id="s246">After the Kristallnacht I just went on a train and I went home to see what was what.</span> <span id="s247">Nothing had happened to our house because they came and wanted to arrest my father.</span> <span id="s248">My father was dead.</span> <span id="s249">They went through the house, they did not ransack it or throw anything out the window or anything.</span> <span id="s250">Our temple of course was burned.</span> <span id="s251">The Jewish men were all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q.</span> <span id="s253">How did things progress from Kristallnacht until, you mentioned, April 1939, when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A.</span> <span id="s255">After Kristallnacht my mother said, “It is time that you get out.”</span> <span id="s256">That started the arrangements my mother did, I did, to get out.</span> <span id="s257">(The arrangements were through relatives.)</span> <span id="s258">Right in the meantime came the edict that all valuables, all jewelry, silver and so on, had to be handed in, which I did for my mother.</span> <span id="s259">Whatever had to be done was done.</span> <span id="s260">We did it…we are blamed for it at this point.</span> <span id="s261">I don’t think we had any other choice.</span> <span id="s262">Whatever had to be done, we did…very meekly.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q.</span> <span id="s264">When you say, “we are blamed for it” at this time, that’s hindsight.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A. It’s hindsight.</span> <span id="s266">It’s a moot point to discuss.</span> <span id="s267">What could we have done?</span> <span id="s268">Nobody had a gun because nobody ever thought of there being a necessity for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q. Well, nobody knew even what would follow that.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A. Right.</span> <span id="s271">Even if some people would have said, “Well, we can fight for it” where could we get a weapon from to fight for it?</span> <span id="s272">You were a German like anybody else.</span> <span id="s273">There were were Catholics, Protestants and Jews, but we were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q. Except you weren’t being treated like a German.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A. I meant before Hitler.</span> <span id="s276">(Yes) So nobody…There was no need to have any kind of weapon in the house.</span> <span id="s277">What for?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q.</span> <span id="s279">The only question that comes up there is in terms of like silga upgava (?)</span> <span id="s280">or jewelry whatever it is, the announcement was made.</span> <span id="s281">Why comply with the announcement?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A.</span> <span id="s283">What would happen then, if you don’t?</span> <span id="s284">It was too late.</span> <span id="s285">People were mellow at that time.</span> <span id="s286">Don’t forget people were frightened already.</span> <span id="s287">A lot of the young people were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q.</span> <span id="s289">When you say people were frightened, was it a air of fear in terms of physical harm?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A. Yes…of physical harm…of just plain fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q.</span> <span id="s292">When you left in April of ’39 did you leave Eisenach via Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A. No, I left Eisenach by Holland and stayed a few days in Holland.</span> <span id="s294">Mother had her best friend in Holland.</span> <span id="s295">I spent a few days there and went to England from Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q.</span> <span id="s297">In England you mentioned this was the first position you had (yes).</span> <span id="s298">Did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A. I did not stay there too long because, as I said, these people were not the nicest people and the woman especially was not the most honest person.</span> <span id="s300">She had…a friend of hers had died and she was the executor of the will.</span> <span id="s301">In the will there was some money left to the maid of the other one and she said she would only get part of the money but that she has to come work for her.</span> <span id="s302">So I was out of a job and I went to my cousins who lived in Lancashire.</span> <span id="s303">They were expecting a baby.</span> <span id="s304">I lived with them.</span> <span id="s305">They became my second parents.</span> <span id="s306">I lived with them and they intended to come to this country.</span> <span id="s307">Somehow I got my visa earlier.</span> <span id="s308">I came here first.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q.</span> <span id="s310">When did you become aware that your mother couldn’t go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A.</span> <span id="s312">When the war broke out.</span> <span id="s313">Nobody was allowed out.</span> <span id="s314">I sent Red Cross messages back to Germany.</span> <span id="s315">I got a message back that my mother and friends had left benenbenaasdfg-kl (?)</span> <span id="s316">:…and some friends had left earlier, some later.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q. By the time they had left, this must have been in 1940 something like that (yes).</span> <span id="s318">Were you in contact with her between ’39 and the time you got that message?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s320">Before the war, regularly and after the war via the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q.</span> <span id="s322">When you got the message from the Red Cross did you understand what it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A. Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q.</span> <span id="s325">When you said you got the visa to come to the United States how were you able to get it?</span> <span id="s326">Did you apply earlier?</span> <span id="s327">Or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A. I also came on the German quota, of course.</span> <span id="s329">Two other cousins who lived here in those days, they gave me the affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">SIDE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q.</span> <span id="s332">You stayed in England for the 8 years during the war until 1946.</span> <span id="s333">Did you stay with your cousins after that first domestic job?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A. I stayed with them for a number of years until I was called up for war work.</span> <span id="s335">I took a training course in catering and through this I got a job with the Land army.</span> <span id="s336">The Land army consisted of girls being called up to work on the land to replace the men.</span> <span id="s337">I was in charge of one of the hostels in which they lived.</span> <span id="s338">I went to different hostels.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q.</span> <span id="s340">So you were assigned to different places then?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A. I was assigned to different places in England.</span> <span id="s342">I was also assigned to the Land Army Club in London but this had to be closed because of the large-scale bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q. Was everybody called up for war work or only aliens?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A. Everybody was called up for war work.</span> <span id="s345">Some aliens were also sent to camps…internment camps.</span> <span id="s346">I almost got there too because the judge in front of whom I appeared also had a German girl and he was very dissatisfied with her.</span> <span id="s347">Every girl almost automatically was put into internment camp.</span> <span id="s348">The police chief of Nelson, where I lived, went to the judge and said, “Look, you are really making a mistake in this case.</span> <span id="s349">I know this person personally.”</span> <span id="s350">The priest, who was a friend of my cousins in England, he also said, “This girl is beyond reproach.</span> <span id="s351">She really doesn’t belong in an internment camp.</span> <span id="s352">She’s no danger to England.”</span> <span id="s353">So they changed my status.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q.</span> <span id="s355">What made you decide to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A. Well, as I said before, this second cousin of mine, cousin of my mother’s who became my second parents…they felt that, at the time, their little boy would have a better future in America.</span> <span id="s357">Which he certainly has and they wanted to come here and, since I was more or less their daughter, I was to go with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q.</span> <span id="s359">The reason I asked was because in terms of going to Israel instead?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A. Yah.</span> <span id="s361">I hadn’t seen my brother for 14 years.</span> <span id="s362">It was a long time and I’ll never forget before I left for America they came to England.</span> <span id="s363">I’ll never forget the emotions before and while I was on the bus going to the airport to pick him up.</span> <span id="s364">The tears were running down.</span> <span id="s365">And I was joyful.</span> <span id="s366">It was…emotion you only experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q. Right.</span> <span id="s368">That was before you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q. Was there any strangeness after you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A. None.</span> <span id="s372">I didn’t know my sister-in-law and everything was fine from the first second.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q. Also I would guess that a lot had happened in between.</span> <span id="s374">Your father had passed away?</span> <span id="s375">And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s377">And I had grown up.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q.</span> <span id="s379">How did you feel about coming to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A.</span> <span id="s381">That was another thing to be done.</span> <span id="s382">Since my second parents were leaving I was coming here too.</span> <span id="s383">I got the visa first.</span> <span id="s384">I came first.</span> <span id="s385">And I stayed with my real cousins for a short time until I found a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q.</span> <span id="s387">How did you find a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A. Through one of the Jewish agencies.</span> <span id="s389">I worked in a home for the Jewish orphans on the teenage level.</span> <span id="s390">But I wasn’t particularly…it was an apartment project up here in 167th street.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q. Were you living in Washington Heights?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s393">But I really wanted to go more into a larger scale operation and I found a job, don’t ask me anymore how, as a housekeeper at the Home for Infirm and Aged Hebrews.</span> <span id="s394">It was all the way down on the lower east side.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q.</span> <span id="s396">That too, in connection with what we were talking about before, was that a very different experience for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s398">Very different.</span> <span id="s399">Very educational.</span> <span id="s400">Because, as I said before, I don’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s401">And they couldn’t really believe, the old people, that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s402">And on top of it, I didn’t speak Jewish.</span> <span id="s403">I mean, I was on the elevator once and they discussed me and they were absolutely sure.</span> <span id="s404">“How can she be a Yiddener?</span> <span id="s405">She doesn’t speak Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s406">So I turned around, “I don’t speak Yiddish, but I assure you I am a Yiddener.”</span> <span id="s407">They were mostly Eastern Jews.</span> <span id="s408">The Board of Directors, of course, consisted mostly of Eastern Jews.</span> <span id="s409">A very lovely old gentleman, with whom I had lunch one day said, “Please don’t misunderstand me, but now I think for once you know, with the shoe being on the other foot, how it feels the poor Jew who is coming.”</span> <span id="s410">And I said I do understand and believe me I can understand how you felt.</span> <span id="s411">Right, it certainly was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q.</span> <span id="s413">Did you know he was referring to them coming to Germany…</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A. Of course.</span> <span id="s415">And of course it wasn’t right.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q.</span> <span id="s417">That has an interesting… What did you do for recreation?</span> <span id="s418">…you lived with these cousins when you first came?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A. No, I lived in.</span> <span id="s420">I lived at the home the aged and…no, the first job as a housekeeper was the Home of Israel on the lower east side.</span> <span id="s421">I’m sorry…after a few years I got a job as assistant dietician, which was really my field at the Home for the Aged and Infirmed Hebrews at 106th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q. So, in other words, in both jobs you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A. No, the downtown I lived in and I changed to the other job…yes I lived in.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q. Were most of your friends of the German-Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A. Yes, as I mentioned before, we met pretty soon after Bosetter came back to New York and I came into New York.</span> <span id="s426">I had some friends here.</span> <span id="s427">I had relatives.</span> <span id="s428">I was terribly miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q.</span> <span id="s430">Why were you so miserable?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A. It’s a mixed job.</span> <span id="s432">A whole lot of different point.</span> <span id="s433">One point is I had come out of England and everyone was so tightly rationed and everybody tried to make do with what they had and you come here and everybody was so proud of what they all bought on the black market and everybody told us what they all had and they complained about little trivial things they couldn’t have.</span> <span id="s434">I just thought it was absolutely wrong to feel this way.</span> <span id="s435">That was one point.</span> <span id="s436">Second point was that everybody who I met and were friendly with were established already, were on the way up and I was again all the way down here being a new immigrant.</span> <span id="s437">And the whole lifestyle of America was so different.</span> <span id="s438">I was unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q.</span> <span id="s440">You mentioned the lifestyle was different.</span> <span id="s441">Different from England?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A. Yes, from England.</span> <span id="s443">In England I was with (due to my job) I had become friendly mostly non-Jews.</span> <span id="s444">They didn’t have the rush and the push of New York.</span> <span id="s445">I lived more in England in the small towns and villages, in the green.</span> <span id="s446">You left your door open, you walked to anywhere, any time.</span> <span id="s447">One of the first things somebody said, “Oh, you don’t go to Central Park in the evening.”</span> <span id="s448">Everything was so different.</span> <span id="s449">You lived in great big houses which were just bricks and stone and so on and this needed a lot of adjusting.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q.</span> <span id="s451">When you came to England, did you speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A.</span> <span id="s453">A certain amount.</span> <span id="s454">Not fluently.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q. Was that a difficult thing for you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A. I picked it up pretty rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q.</span> <span id="s458">But that was not a problem for you when you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q. Do you feel you were a different parent than other parents of your children’s contemporaries?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A.</span> <span id="s462">You mean the non-refugees?</span> <span id="s463">(Yes) I can imagine so.</span> <span id="s464">I think we were stricter.</span> <span id="s465">We were not as easy-going.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q.</span> <span id="s467">When you say you could imagine so, did anything point itself up or—what?</span> <span id="s468">Did your son point it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A.</span> <span id="s470">Our son has pointed it up at various points…</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q. It’s all right.</span> <span id="s472">I’m one of them, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A.</span> <span id="s474">We had grown.</span> <span id="s475">I think you’re apt to bring up your son on the values you are brought up with.</span> <span id="s476">Of course, if you are born in Germany of German-Jewish parents you have different values from an American parent.</span> <span id="s477">Of course, your values by now have also mixed in with your contemporaries who grew up here, both of refugee parents and of others, the same as Strawns (?)</span> <span id="s478">have by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q. That’s right.</span> <span id="s480">I was just curious as to whether he pointed up something.</span> <span id="s481">You’re saying yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A. Right.</span> <span id="s483">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s484">And I can remember myself saying many more times “no” to him than the other parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q.</span> <span id="s486">You knew that the other parents said “yes”?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A. I sometimes felt no was in place.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q.</span> <span id="s489">When you were living in the small towns in England, how did the blitz affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A. Well, I did my duty as anybody else.</span> <span id="s491">I was a fire warden…I walked around with a helmet same as anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q.</span> <span id="s493">But you didn’t have to be evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A. Well, when we closed the Land Army Club in London.</span> <span id="s495">That was a kind of evacuation.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q.</span> <span id="s497">That was the last place that you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A. No.</span> <span id="s499">From then on, we went to the hostels…mainly to the south of London.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q. Southern portion of England, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q. O.K.</span></p></body></html>
