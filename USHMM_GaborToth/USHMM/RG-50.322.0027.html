id="s3">It is August 21, 1984 and we are in the kitchen of her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: I am Bernice Muler.</span> <span id="s5">My maiden name is Fogel.</span> <span id="s6">[Spelled by Bernice]</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: What is your age please?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I will be 59 on August 25th.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born in a small town in Poland, Tomashant [that is what it sounds like] which is about 90 miles from Lublin [51.15N, 22.35E].</span> <span id="s11">This was then Middle Poland.</span> <span id="s12">[It is now Eastern Poland after the territorial adjustments of 1945.]</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Was it a rural town or was there industry?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: It was a small town.</span> <span id="s15">It didn’t have too much industry.</span> <span id="s16">There were merchants and farming in the surrounding area[s].</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Do you know when or how your family came to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Not really!</span> <span id="s19">When the war broke out, [in 1939] I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s20">I didn’t have any grandparents.</span> <span id="s21">They had already died.</span> <span id="s22">As far as I know, my family had been there for years and years.</span> <span id="s23">This part of Poland, through the years, it was under Austria, under Prussia and under Russia.</span> <span id="s24">Then, in the 1930’s, it was Poland.</span> <span id="s25">That had actually been so since WWI in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">[Poland was frequently divided and then “liberated” depending on inter-European wards mainly between these countries.</span> <span id="s27">The borders did depend upon the fortune of war.</span> <span id="s28">These divisions occurred in the 19th Century.]</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Your family was there then for generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s31">As far as I know, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: How many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I had and still have one brother and one sister.</span> <span id="s34">I also had a half-sister.</span> <span id="s35">My mother was my father’s second wife.</span> <span id="s36">His first wife died very young.</span> <span id="s37">My father had a daughter who was the same age as my mother.</span> <span id="s38">This first wife had two grown sons and that daughter.</span> <span id="s39">When my father married my mother, he was already a grandfather, and when I was born, I was a ready-made aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">For the longest time, I called my sister “aunt.”</span> <span id="s41">I just couldn’t understand that I had an adult sister.</span> <span id="s42">As a matter of fact, my niece was a mining engineer.</span> <span id="s43">At the time there were only two Jewish women in Poland who were mining engineers.</span> <span id="s44">I was kind of proud of that, but unfortunately they perished.</span> <span id="s45">We were nowhere around when that happened.</span> <span id="s46">They were deported to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s47">[That was an extermination camp just a little south of Lublin.]</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Was this sister at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No.</span> <span id="s50">She lived in my hometown when I was small, and then her brother got married and moved to a small town, Labawa, near Chelm [51.10N, 23.28E].</span> <span id="s51">Chelm is the city about which all the jokes are being told; jokes in Jewish folklore and Jewish-Polish literature.</span> <span id="s52">It is considered a town of fools.</span> <span id="s53">But it was a nice city.</span> <span id="s54">[There were jokes about the inhabitants not being very smart; as a matter of fact, being very naïve.]</span> <span id="s55">My half-sister’s husband had wealthy relatives in Chelm.</span> <span id="s56">He was the one who educated the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s57">They were all educated.</span> <span id="s58">There were two boys who were in the technical field, something like engineering.</span> <span id="s59">The girl was also educated.</span> <span id="s60">I was the youngest of the three children of my father’s second marriage.</span> <span id="s61">My brother was the oldest and my sister was in the middle.</span> <span id="s62">My brother is in Canada and my sister is in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So this half-sister was in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did you have any other family members with you such as aunts and uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: In my house?</span> <span id="s67">No.</span> <span id="s68">However we had a lot of relatives.</span> <span id="s69">My father was one of 13 or 14 children so there were a lot of uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s70">In another small town nearby, there were two sisters.</span> <span id="s71">One of the sisters died and the uncle married her sister.</span> <span id="s72">I had a lot of cousins and there were a lot of names which were the same as in our family.</span> <span id="s73">There were a lot of people called Sarah and a lot called Bernice.</span> <span id="s74">However, at that time, they called us by the Hebrew equivalent of Bernice.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Was it kind of an extended family?</span> <span id="s76">Did you see each other very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s78">Yes, we were close.</span> <span id="s79">As a matter of fact, my mother had very few friends outside of the family.</span> <span id="s80">You associated mainly with family members.</span> <span id="s81">She just had one or two neighbors and then cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What happened to your father’s first wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: I truly don’t know.</span> <span id="s84">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s85">I never inquired and I was never told.</span> <span id="s86">She could have died in childbirth, and the baby could have died with her; that was very common at the time because medicine was not so well developed.</span> <span id="s87">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s88">At 14 in Europe, I was not all that sophisticated.</span> <span id="s89">There were really enough relatives around.</span> <span id="s90">I didn’t really mature until I was an adult and by then my father was gone and I didn’t inquire.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: What did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: My father was a small merchant.</span> <span id="s93">He was selling material – such things as paint.</span> <span id="s94">My mother was helping him out in the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Was that something which your grandfather had also done?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s97">I think that my grandfather did what my uncle also did.</span> <span id="s98">It had something to do with wheat and a mill.</span> <span id="s99">They were making flour.</span> <span id="s100">This is something which my father did for a while as long as I can remember.</span> <span id="s101">However, my father was also the vice-mayor of the town after WWI.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">At that time he was a pretty well-to-do man because he was working for the city government.</span> <span id="s103">They had what they called a troika with a driver.</span> <span id="s104">This is how he got my mother because she was half his age and I guess she was impressed.</span> <span id="s105">She didn’t have a father.</span> <span id="s106">She was the oldest.</span> <span id="s107">At that time you needed a dowry to get married, and she didn’t want to take anything from her younger siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">My mother’s family had a small booth – a little store where they sold cigarettes and matches and things like that.</span> <span id="s109">My father passed by and he stopped to get cigarettes and saw her and sent a matchmaker.</span> <span id="s110">That is how it was done at that time.</span> <span id="s111">That is how they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: That was common use at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s114">Yes.</span> <span id="s115">He just sent a matchmaker who told her that she didn’t have to bring anything, that she could just leave everything for the brother and sister and that he would take care of everything.</span> <span id="s116">For a little while, they were well off, but then the money changed and times changed and everything which was left was an amount of paper money with which you could paper the walls.</span> <span id="s117">It wasn’t worth anything.</span> <span id="s118">It was a change of government, a change of regime.</span> <span id="s119">You can call it a depression or whatever.</span> <span id="s120">[Germany had a rate of inflation in the 1920’s that was staggering and the French franc was collapsing in 1926.]</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: So your father was politically active?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, I would not say that he was politically active.</span> <span id="s123">He was an official.</span> <span id="s124">You know, a mayor does not necessarily have to be a politician.</span> <span id="s125">This is what his work was.</span> <span id="s126">[In Europe, mayors, especially of small towns and cities were usually appointed.]</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Was it an appointive job?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: I don’t know if he was appointed or elected.</span> <span id="s129">All I know is that is what he was and my mother had a document – my sister must still have it – from before WWI which stated that.</span> <span id="s130">She kept that all through the trials and tribulations we went through.</span> <span id="s131">My sister has it because my mother made her home with my sister in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">I don’t know what happened to that document, even later on, when times were hard.</span> <span id="s133">The money he got wasn’t much but education in our family was very, very important.</span> <span id="s134">No matter how and what, there was always somehow money found for day school.</span> <span id="s135">After school we went to public school.</span> <span id="s136">[She might have had it turned around.]</span> <span id="s137">I went for a couple of years to something called Bat Jacov, which here would be called Beth Jacob.</span> <span id="s138">That was a Hebrew School.</span> <span id="s139">You had to be a good student to get permission from the public school to attend that.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Was that education somewhat similar to what your parents had?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: My parents were well educated in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s142">They both spoke some Russian and some German.</span> <span id="s143">My mother spoke Polish very well, extremely well.</span> <span id="s144">She could have passed for a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s145">My father spoke Polish with an accent.</span> <span id="s146">You see, he could not manage the “R’s.”</span> <span id="s147">He sounded like most Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: He had a Yiddish accent?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes, he had an accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Was Yiddish spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">Yiddish was always spoken in our home.</span> <span id="s153">However, as I was growing up and went to school – I am ashamed to admit it today – but I was ashamed of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s154">I refused to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s155">I would speak Polish and they would speak to me in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s156">My father would, jokingly, kiddingly, call me “shikse.”</span> <span id="s157">[That is a derogatory name for a young, non-Jewish woman.]</span> <span id="s158">I was a child whom he got rather late in life.</span> <span id="s159">He was 50 years old when I was born and he treated me more or less like a grandchild.</span> <span id="s160">I could get away with murder; that is with him, not with my mother.</span> <span id="s161">However, certain things were understood: we didn’t go out –I wasn’t old enough, but my sister was 16 -- she never went out with a non-Jewish person.</span> <span id="s162">That was understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Were your parents very religious then?</span> <span id="s164">Were they Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s166">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: We lived in a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s169">We lived in a neighborhood which was very much mixed and that is what saved us from a lot of problems because the Poles are anti-Semitic, but they were neighborly.</span> <span id="s170">We were good neighbors, so they kind of protected us if there were any pogroms which would start.</span> <span id="s171">[A pogrom is an organized massacre – especially of Jews.</span> <span id="s172">The term originated in Russia.]</span> <span id="s173">They would say: “Don’t bother them; they are our Jews!”</span> <span id="s174">That is not very flattering, but at the time it saved us a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s175">If anything, under normal circumstances, they would have continued to do that for us, but later on when that happened under the Germans, we found out that it wouldn’t help at all.</span> <span id="s176">The Germans started against everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did your family keep kosher at home?</span> <span id="s178">[Eating according the Jewish Dietary Laws.]</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s180">Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did they attend the synagogue on the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: My father went Friday night and on the Sabbath morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Did he take your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: My brother had to go.</span> <span id="s185">He did not go willingly!</span> <span id="s186">That is after his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s187">[The religious coming of age of the Jewish male at age 13.]</span> <span id="s188">Then things were pretty similar.</span> <span id="s189">He didn’t like to carry his prayer book.</span> <span id="s190">They bought him a pocket-sized prayer book.</span> <span id="s191">He also had to pray every morning while laying on the phylacteries.</span> <span id="s192">[The square leather boxes containing slips on which are written certain scriptural passages.</span> <span id="s193">Two such boxes are tied on with leather straps, one on the forehead and one on the arm near the heart, during morning prayer by Orthodox and some other Jews.]</span> <span id="s194">My brother would actually cheat a little bit and just make the marks and have a book, a novel or something.</span> <span id="s195">I would cover up for him, even lie for him if my father would interrogate me.</span> <span id="s196">My sister didn’t cover up and she got hit a couple of times.</span> <span id="s197">I was always sticking up for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Your brother was Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Oh yes, my brother had his Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s200">However, girls were not Bat Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s201">That was not the custom up to the last 20 or 25 years.</span> <span id="s202">[In the last 30 years of women’s rights and obligations, Jewish women have added the ceremony of joining the Covenant to their achievements at least in some phases of Judaism and now can be counted among the required ten people to make a quorum to say certain prayers.]</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did your parents speak any languages other than Yiddish and Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Some Russian and some German.</span> <span id="s205">My mother picked up languages quite easily and I believe that I take after her.</span> <span id="s206">When we were in Russia, she spoke beautiful Russian.</span> <span id="s207">Then she could read and write Russian.</span> <span id="s208">Even when she was already an older person and she went to Israel, she got to understand Hebrew quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Did you also understand the languages that well?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No, no, in Poland I knew Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s211">My Polish was better than that of a lot of Poles who were not Jews.</span> <span id="s212">I was an excellent student.</span> <span id="s213">Learning just came naturally to me.</span> <span id="s214">As a matter of fact in 1938, in sixth grade, I won a trip to Gdynia on the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s215">[54.32N, 18.33E] This was a free trip which only three people from the whole school could take each year.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: That was because you were a good student?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I was a very good student.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Were your parents pretty well off?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No!</span> <span id="s220">No.</span> <span id="s221">Far from well off.</span> <span id="s222">When I was growing up things were pretty hard.</span> <span id="s223">However, as I said before, somehow they found means.</span> <span id="s224">My brother went to something like Hillel Academy here in Dayton.</span> <span id="s225">[A Jewish day school that includes both primary and high school.]</span> <span id="s226">That was a school which was only for boys.</span> <span id="s227">My sister and I we got a private tutor to teach us.</span> <span id="s228">We called him a Rabbi although he was not an ordained Rabbi.</span> <span id="s229">[Actually a “Rabbi” means master as well as Jewish teacher as well as an ordained cleric.]</span> <span id="s230">He came a couple of times a week.</span> <span id="s231">He taught us to read from the table [sic], not the meaning of what we were reading, just to read and to pray in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s232">Then we were sent to a teacher to read and write letters in Jewish.</span> <span id="s233">That came in extremely handy in later years when I had to correspond with people who didn’t know another language.</span> <span id="s234">As a matter of course, a lot of my friends are surprised, being that young when the war broke out, that I know it.</span> <span id="s235">Even now, some American born people bring letters in Hebrew and I read them and translate them for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did you go to public school at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Was it run by the state?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: The public school?</span> <span id="s240">Yes.</span> <span id="s241">The public school was compulsory, up to the 7th grade.</span> <span id="s242">You started at age seven.</span> <span id="s243">I started a little earlier.</span> <span id="s244">They tested me.</span> <span id="s245">My sister was in school already and I wanted to go badly.</span> <span id="s246">I believe that they waived their requirement by a few months.</span> <span id="s247">After the 7th grade, it was high school, but you had to pay.</span> <span id="s248">I was enrolled and in 1939, I was supposed to start in it, but I never got to it because the war broke out just as school was supposed to start.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">That was another struggle which I had.</span> <span id="s250">I did have the certificate because I was a good student, but I had to fight with my parents – especially with my father – since we had to go to school on Saturday.</span> <span id="s251">Finally it was understood that I would attend classes, but not take any notes.</span> <span id="s252">Then I was going to use the notes which Gentiles [Christians] had taken; some of my Gentile classmates.</span> <span id="s253">He consented to that, however, it never materialized.</span> <span id="s254">The fight was for nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did you have mostly Jewish friends, or mostly non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: My friends were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s257">However, we were on very good terms with our neighbors.</span> <span id="s258">Some of our neighbors had farms and in the summer, I spent a lot of time in the fields.</span> <span id="s259">At the time we didn’t call it baby-sitting, but my sister and I would kind of take care of the little ones.</span> <span id="s260">In return, they would just give us all the fruit and whatever we could want or use.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">We were quite neighborly.</span> <span id="s262">They would always, on Christmas Eve, they would invite us to come and see.</span> <span id="s263">Of course we could not eat there.</span> <span id="s264">[The food was not Kosher.]</span> <span id="s265">They would invite us to come in to see their Christmas trees.</span> <span id="s266">As kids we were very fascinated and we would get to pick apples.</span> <span id="s267">They had decorated their trees with cookies and apples.</span> <span id="s268">Candles for decorations were quite different.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Sometimes we would sneak in there a couple of weeks before and help them make a picket chain.</span> <span id="s270">We were fascinated with that.</span> <span id="s271">We were good Jewish kids, but this was something we liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Did they have any interest in Judaism?</span> <span id="s273">Did they ask you a lot of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: They knew pretty much about our religion.</span> <span id="s275">They did not ask us any questions but they knew about our holidays and all that.</span> <span id="s276">There was a little boy whom we took care of.</span> <span id="s277">My father used to bring people, just naturally, people came from small towns, on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s278">These people didn’t have a place to eat.</span> <span id="s279">To bring somebody home for Shabbat mean was a big mitzvah.</span> <span id="s280">[A good deed; a commandment that Jews should follow.]</span> <span id="s281">The little boy was really proud to be with us.</span> <span id="s282">He obviously knew about our religion.</span> <span id="s283">He would say: “There goes Bronje!”</span> <span id="s284">meaning me since they called my Bronje; “Dad and a Jid,” that meant a Jew.</span> <span id="s285">“Jid” to Gentiles was an expression like what “kike” is here.</span> <span id="s286">But you know that my father was my father, you know, and the other person was the “Jid.”</span> <span id="s287">There you see the difference; there was anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: That was amongst your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s290">Oh yes, They wouldn’t show it personally, but they would speak about Jews like that.</span> <span id="s291">I had close friends in school; you know that I always had friends –even the mayor’s daughter was a friend.</span> <span id="s292">She was my good friend because she needed my help with lessons and homework.</span> <span id="s293">I was invited to her house.</span> <span id="s294">She would say things that disturbed her about Jewish people, but she would say: “Oh, you are not like that Jewess!”</span> <span id="s295">meaning “you are like one of us!”</span> <span id="s296">That made me even angrier than if she had said something about me.</span> <span id="s297">However, that is what she said.</span> <span id="s298">You know that we were the minority and you had to accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: It showed a lack of sensitivity.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes, but the teachers were horrible also!</span> <span id="s301">I remember, it must have been the last year during which I went to school in Poland.</span> <span id="s302">In 6th grade, none of the Polish Christian kids had done well enough in a Polish language test to get a “5” which was the highest grade3, meaning excellent.</span> <span id="s303">I know that I deserved such a “5” but the teacher didn’t give it to me.</span> <span id="s304">So I stood up for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">The teacher said: “You are not getting a “5” when none of the Polish kids are getting that grade!</span> <span id="s306">So I said: “What do I care if they don’t know?</span> <span id="s307">I that that I deserve it!”</span> <span id="s308">I said that because I knew that I was good and I hadn’t made any mistakes in my work.</span> <span id="s309">My spelling was good.</span> <span id="s310">I was good in literature.</span> <span id="s311">So I started to cry and he sent me to the principal.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">At that time I was very spunky.</span> <span id="s313">I was tested.</span> <span id="s314">I sat by myself in the classroom and was given a test by another teacher.</span> <span id="s315">He had to give me the higher mark because, as I knew, I deserved it.</span> <span id="s316">I never expected anything from gymnastic classes because I was lousy in gym and I was lousy in music.</span> <span id="s317">I can’t carry a tune.</span> <span id="s318">I know the notes; I always had a “4” because they didn’t want to spoil my grades as would have happened with a “3.”</span> <span id="s319">Life in Poland was, as far as I remember it from the point of view of a 14 year old, hard.</span> <span id="s320">It was harsh, but it was very good at the same time.</span> <span id="s321">It was family oriented.</span> <span id="s322">We never lacked any people for the Holy Days.</span> <span id="s323">We always had a full house then.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">There was always someplace to go on a Holy Day.</span> <span id="s325">All the kids, and in all the family, there was always one or two of the same age.</span> <span id="s326">That was the time when you started being aware of boys but not really getting serious, but just getting aware.</span> <span id="s327">We were cute, smart and happy!</span></p> <p><span id="s328">[At that time, the Germans had begun to make their demands which ultimately led to the breakup of Poland including their propaganda aimed at Polish citizens that all the problems, including the economic recession, were caused by the “Conspiration of World Jewry.”]</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So you liked your schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes, I loved school!</span> <span id="s331">My dream was to be an interpreter or a teacher.</span> <span id="s332">Now my daughter is a teacher, instead of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: I want to ask you a question which I asked your husband also.</span> <span id="s334">[Referring to Ben Muler whose interview is in the WSU-JCC Holocaust archives.]</span> <span id="s335">You both refer to the Polish people and then to your family as Jews and yet, in both cases, your families had been in Poland for generations.</span> <span id="s336">Did you feel that you were different, that you were not from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Not then!</span> <span id="s338">However you are speaking to us at a different time and at a different age.</span> <span id="s339">If you had asked me than and by myself, at the age of 14, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s340">I would have said “I am a Pole!”</span> <span id="s341">Now, however, I think of myself as Jewish first.</span> <span id="s342">However then, I knew that I was Jewish, but Jewish was the religion.</span> <span id="s343">Mosaic as religion was on you passports and on you other papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">At the time, no, I would have thought of myself as Polish.</span> <span id="s345">For me, Poland was my dear country, my great country and it was “Polashka the Great” and “Golushka the Great!”</span> <span id="s346">No, I did not feel anything other than that; that is why I called for the grade to be adjusted, because I was not foreign and the teacher had the nerve to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">If he had found an excuse, such as that I had made a mistake or whatever, I wouldn’t have said anything.</span> <span id="s348">My language was just as good as anyone else’s.</span> <span id="s349">As a matter of fact, no one except my father, because he wore the Jewish clothes, you know – that long coat of the Hasids, none of us “looked Jewish.”</span> <span id="s350">[Long black coats usually worn with stiff black hats used by Jews of that particular sect.]</span> <span id="s351">I know that we didn’t act as if there is any such thing as typical Jewish people of Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s352">Maybe some acted a little differently, but we didn’t!</span></p> <p><span id="s353">If I liked somebody, the religion didn’t make any difference!</span> <span id="s354">But we knew that when it came to serious boy-girl relationships, that wasn’t done.</span> <span id="s355">We heard about the boys and girls when somebody did get out of their faith; their parents considered it as a tragedy as if the parents buried their child.</span> <span id="s356">We knew that, but personally, if I liked somebody, and my Polish friends knew that I wouldn’t eat certain things and that I would eat others, something like let’s say an apple or other fruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">No, at that time I didn’t think of myself as Jewish first.</span> <span id="s358">However, if you ask the question for now, yes!</span> <span id="s359">Now I am aware, even here in the U.S., I think as a Jew first and then as anything else.</span> <span id="s360">I love this country, and I think that I am just as American as anybody else, even if I didn’t come over on the Mayflower.</span> <span id="s361">However I think of myself as Jewish first.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Was the synagogue in your neighborhood a big social center for the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No!</span> <span id="s364">No.</span> <span id="s365">There were a lot of little synagogues.</span> <span id="s366">My family belonged to some of them.</span> <span id="s367">I don’t even remember which ones they were.</span> <span id="s368">They were different; there were synagogues of that Rabbi and of this Rabbi.</span> <span id="s369">Then there was a big synagogue where we always went on public Holy Days when the Gentile children, those of the Greek Orthodox sent to their church and the Roman Catholics went to their church.</span> <span id="s370">It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s371">It was like an elaborate sanctuary here.</span> <span id="s372">The members were mostly doctors and academicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">They would attend that and they would even come by taxi, or car and park a little further.</span> <span id="s374">In the small synagogues it was unheard of for anybody to ride on the Holy Days or on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s375">Not that there were that many cars, but some people had horses and buggies.</span> <span id="s376">Some had drivers.</span> <span id="s377">We just walked to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So the people who drive were really not keeping the law that closely?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: They were not.</span> <span id="s380">We called them “assimilated Jews.”</span> <span id="s381">They thought of themselves as Poles first and Jews second.</span> <span id="s382">Some of them still did.</span> <span id="s383">They had the hardest time when Hitler came because they just couldn’t reconcile this idea with what they had thought.</span> <span id="s384">There were a lot of German Jews who were driven out of Germany into Poland after Hitler assumed power.</span> <span id="s385">They still considered themselves the higher elite and they considered themselves Germans.</span> <span id="s386">When the Germans came, they were the first to go.</span> <span id="s387">They really had a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: What kind of activities did your parents enjoy?</span> <span id="s389">Did they go to the theatre or listen to music?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No!</span> <span id="s391">My father would not go to the theatre.</span> <span id="s392">That was not written in the religion.</span> <span id="s393">My mother probably would have, but out of respect for my father, she didn’t.</span> <span id="s394">I remember that one time she took us to the circus.</span> <span id="s395">That is the only time that I remember such a thing.</span> <span id="s396">We used to go on picnics.</span> <span id="s397">Otherwise, everything was just around family.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">We would travel twenty or thirty miles to visit other family members, but otherwise we were just around the home.</span> <span id="s399">They worked very hard.</span> <span id="s400">Saturday was the only day on which they could rest.</span> <span id="s401">So they rested.</span> <span id="s402">My mother used to like to read from the book, religious stories.</span> <span id="s403">These were not written in Hebrew but in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s404">She used to like to read that.</span> <span id="s405">She used to like to read -- period.</span> <span id="s406">All through the week she never had time.</span> <span id="s407">We didn’t have a refrigerator and you shopped every day and you cooked every day.</span> <span id="s408">She also helped in the store and with three children and the washing and ironing.</span> <span id="s409">Remember that there was no wash and wear.</span> <span id="s410">So they were pretty busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Were they politically active at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: No!</span> <span id="s413">Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Now going back to the time when your father was Vice-Mayor.</span> <span id="s415">Wasn’t it unusual for a Jewish person to hold such a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s417">It was a privilege!</span> <span id="s418">It was a privilege and he did a lot of good in this job.</span> <span id="s419">He used to like to travel around.</span> <span id="s420">To this day, I don’t know how he went about it.</span> <span id="s421">It was very hard to get out of Poland for a man, I have been told, at that time.</span> <span id="s422">He would change the mayor’s name to a female name and they would dress him up as a woman and somehow get out.</span> <span id="s423">I have a book which came out after the Holocaust – you know every city has its own books – and my father is mentioned there.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: You have indicated that you had as many gentile friends as Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Not as many, but I had some.</span> <span id="s426">Yes!</span> <span id="s427">First of all, we didn’t go to school on Saturday and we were dependent on the gentile kids to get the assignments for us.</span> <span id="s428">We used to go to school for six days.</span> <span id="s429">Some of the gentile kids were jealous of us that we got to get by with going to school only five days.</span> <span id="s430">Sunday was their Sabbath.</span> <span id="s431">We got Sunday and we got Saturday.</span> <span id="s432">Most of the time they were pretty understanding.</span> <span id="s433">Since a good portion of the kids were Jewish they would not cover the most important subjects on Saturday.</span> <span id="s434">For some reason – which I don’t remember – we always had math on Saturdays and I would just get the assignments in it and do them.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Do you remember when you first heard about Hitler and the NAZI movement?</span> <span id="s436">[The political party which Hitler lead until 1945 was the “National Socialist German Worker’s party” and was abbreviated as NAZI.]</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s438">I was still a child and some kids came to school who did not speak any Polish.</span> <span id="s439">We were told that they were refugees from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Do you remember what year that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: That must have been in 1936, maybe 1935.</span> <span id="s442">[Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.]</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Were these Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Those were Jewish children who were driven out of Germany.</span> <span id="s445">Maybe they had relatives who took them in because most of them stayed closer to the border with Germany, unless they had a special reason to go further.</span> <span id="s446">Maybe they had relatives in our town.</span> <span id="s447">I started asking my mother and my aunt, telling them that some children came and that they seemed like intelligent children but they didn’t speak any Polish.</span> <span id="s448">They spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">German is very close to Yiddish and, you know, we could understand them.</span> <span id="s450">My mother said that Hitler is the leader of Germany; she explained who he was and that he was driving the Jews out.</span> <span id="s451">She said that we should be kind to them and help them out if they needed any help, such as with Polish.</span> <span id="s452">That we should help them out.</span> <span id="s453">I had a girlfriend who was bright and we helped those poor little girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">There were two little girls and I don’t remember if they were sisters or cousins.</span> <span id="s455">They were in our class and we would help them.</span> <span id="s456">That was about the beginning of the school year, but they being children – and as children – they picked the language up very quickly so by the end of the year, they were able to look after themselves and they were fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">That was the time when I started to hear about Hitler.</span> <span id="s458">By 1937 or 1938 we were maybe not all that sophisticated and mature as far as sex goes – as kids are here – and some other thing also, but we were pretty deep for little kids.</span> <span id="s459">Looking back now, we were.</span> <span id="s460">We read a lot and we wanted to understand.</span> <span id="s461">I even remember that we formed a little group which we called the English Club and we taught ourselves English.</span> <span id="s462">We did the same thing with German and we called ourselves the German Club.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Just to learn the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Yes, just because we wanted to.</span> <span id="s465">The summer of 1939, an older fellow – he was actually a young man – he taught us English.</span> <span id="s466">By that time I belonged to an organization, a Jewish organization, which I had joined at the age of thirteen.</span> <span id="s467">At fourteen you could join another and the only reason I chose the other rather than the other was because of the uniform.</span> <span id="s468">I wore the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What kind of an organization were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: They were Hashomer Haair and Hashomer Habat; that was Hashomer left and Hashomer right.</span> <span id="s471">[The latter was a Hassidic movement.]</span> <span id="s472">There also was a Bund which was Mosha Shavez [transcriber not certain of the spelling] which was a Socialist organization.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t remember if there were any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Were they all Zionist?</span> <span id="s475">[promoting a return to Zion/Palestine]</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yes, they were all Zionist.</span> <span id="s477">We also knew about Palestine.</span> <span id="s478">As a matter of fact, a cousin of mine – he is now in Miami, Florida – he went with a bundh of young people, Chalutzim [those who went to Palestine to work the fields].</span> <span id="s479">They were chopping wood.</span> <span id="s480">I was fascinated, wondering, why would they be chopping wood?</span> <span id="s481">They were actually trying to get enough money to make Aliyah to Palestine.</span> <span id="s482">[Means “going up” or settling in Palestine.]</span> <span id="s483">He lived there until 1965 and then he came to the U.S. with his wife, so I knew about my cousin going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s484">I knew what Palestine was and I knew about who Jabotinsky was.</span> <span id="s485">I think that for a kid my age, I knew pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did your parents agree with you belonging to this organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s488">We never did anything their agreement!</span> <span id="s489">Well, I guess I shouldn’t say I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s490">I am sure that my brother did a few things; after all, he was nineteen.</span> <span id="s491">However, me being fourteen, there wasn’t anything.</span> <span id="s492">The reason why I didn’t do anything was that they supported me.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: So they were not against you joining?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No!</span> <span id="s495">No!</span> <span id="s496">No.</span> <span id="s497">They were very Jewishly oriented.</span> <span id="s498">Listen, they were maybe not active Zionists, but I am certain that in their hearts they were Zionists.</span> <span id="s499">As a matter of fact, when my mother who lives in Israel now, she came to the U.S. a couple of times and I wanted her to stay here very badly.</span> <span id="s500">She said: “No!</span> <span id="s501">All my life I dreamed of dying in the Holy Land and now, in my old age, I am not going to settle here.”</span> <span id="s502">[Note from transcriber: Tape was changed to other side and portion of interview was lost.]</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: When were you first aware that Hitler was actually coming to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s505">I just know that all through the summer of 1939, the area was full of talk about Hitler and about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">[At Easter time in 1939, Germany had gotten away with completing the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and then Germany started applying pressure on Poland to obtain control of Danzig, now called Gdansk, and of a ‘land corridor’ between East Prussia and Germany proper.]</span> <span id="s507">They were talking that people should have gasoline and food and that we had to secure the windows better.</span> <span id="s508">However, nobody really believed that anything would happen.</span> <span id="s509">[France and England had pledged themselves to assist Poland and they were negotiating with Russia to provide even more support.]</span> <span id="s510">Then the war broke out!</span> <span id="s511">Then everything went so fast that it seemed that something had dropped on our heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">The fear was so great and then they [the Germans] marched in.</span> <span id="s513">By the time they got to us [Bernice was in East-Central Poland], people were fleeing.</span> <span id="s514">People were coming through our town and they were carrying, already at that time, what they could.</span> <span id="s515">At that time there weren’t yet any extermination camps!</span> <span id="s516">It hadn’t started yet!</span> <span id="s517">The young boys were being dragged to the front for the Germans to use as cannon fodder, so that when they would shoot, they would shoot the Jewish boys first, before they would be hit.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">When I get excited, even now, I forget certain terms.</span> <span id="s519">They were hacking off people’s beards just for the heck of it.</span> <span id="s520">[These Hassidic Jews had full beards because they were prohibited from shaving.]</span> <span id="s521">There was a man who probably today would be in an institution; he used to expose himself.</span> <span id="s522">He was a Jewish man.</span> <span id="s523">We all knew that he was not right in his head.</span> <span id="s524">He never bothered anybody, but he would just expose himself.</span> <span id="s525">At that time we were just aware of it and our parents told us to stay away from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">There was a woman who used to go around and kind of sing to herself.</span> <span id="s527">I guess she also was mentally sick.</span> <span id="s528">The first thing when they came in was that they just shot the two of them on the street.</span> <span id="s529">At first we were hiding when the war started and the bombs started to fall.</span> <span id="s530">Our parents sent us away to some farmers, my sister and I.</span> <span id="s531">We were there in some barn because they said that they were going to bomb the cities.</span> <span id="s532">We felt that they wouldn’t bomb the farms.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: The first thing which happened was that the refugees came through?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: The first thing we knew is that people were fleeing!</span> <span id="s535">Refugees were coming through!</span> <span id="s536">It started when the German people were driven out – that is the Jewish German people.</span> <span id="s537">They were driven out of Poland.</span> <span id="s538">I am sure that the adults knew more than what any mind absorbed, because what is on the mind of a 14 year old is a little different.</span> <span id="s539">Even my sister understood a little since is 2 ½ years older.</span> <span id="s540">I am sure that my brother was quite a bit more aware of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">As soon as the Germans came near our city, my mother packed a backpack for me and all of the money we had in the house was divided amongst the five of us.</span> <span id="s542">She gave my brother some and he got ready to go over to the Russian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">[Just before the German attack on Poland, the Russians and Germans had negotiated a pact.</span> <span id="s544">Many of the parts of this pact were still secret during the time Bernice talks about, but it did allow the Germans a free hand to attack Poland.]</span> <span id="s545">My mother wanted him to escape and we wanted him to escape because we were more afraid for the boys because we heard that the boys were being taken into the army.</span> <span id="s546">Then we heard of atrocities.</span> <span id="s547">Then my sister and I and my mother, we were carrying on and we were crying just as soon as he had gone.</span> <span id="s548">We didn’t want him away and we didn’t know what was going to happen and where he would be.</span> <span id="s549">He just went away with a number of boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">For some reason, the girls – all the girls – would go also.</span> <span id="s551">Very few families would allow a girl, a 14 year old girl and a 16 year old girl, to go unless they would have known of the danger which you know about today.</span> <span id="s552">Furthermore, very few 14 year old girls would venture out.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">I was like a tomboy.</span> <span id="s554">My sister was kind of quiet and shy.</span> <span id="s555">It would not have occurred to her – even if she had thought that it was going to save her life – she wouldn’t have gone.</span> <span id="s556">So my brother went first.</span> <span id="s557">Then, little by little, we knew more and more, because I remember that we were afraid.</span> <span id="s558">We were just as much afraid of the bombing, of the war, and not as much of Hitler’s action per se.</span> <span id="s559">[At this time many secret orders were not public knowledge.]</span> <span id="s560">We were afraid of the soldiers.</span> <span id="s561">We were afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s562">Soldiers came in and we didn’t know if they were German soldiers or if they were all soldiers who did things during a war which normally were not done and would not happen.</span> <span id="s563">We were scared to death!</span> <span id="s564">In the area where we were, first the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s565">They were with us for a few days.</span> <span id="s566">That was enough.</span> <span id="s567">It was already the beginning of being very scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">[Even if many facts were not known, rumors were afloat by September 1939, including some propaganda stories of the Germans and known deportations of Jews of Polish origin residing in Germany.]</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Is that when they shot those deranged people?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: They shot at people and they dragged people around and they were picking people up.</span> <span id="s571">They were going into stores and just helping themselves to whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s572">If somebody said something like: “Please!</span> <span id="s573">Why are you doing that?”</span> <span id="s574">They would just hit, especially if it was an older man with traditional Jewish clothes.</span> <span id="s575">When they came in, riding motorcycles, my father, my sister and I were watching them.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">They were coming in!</span> <span id="s577">They had already occupied our small town, so it was theirs.</span> <span id="s578">A soldier leaned over toward my father – my father had a beard – and he gestured not at the beard, but something implying: “I am going to cut your throat!”</span> <span id="s579">The gesture he made was one which everybody understands.</span> <span id="s580">My sister was trying to get my father to go into the house.</span> <span id="s581">This kind of thing was going on for a few days and then the Russians came in and the Germans went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">The Russians were with us for a few days.</span> <span id="s583">I had heard from some people that the Russian soldiers were terrible, however, at that time, in contrast to what happened later on when they were marching on Berlin, this was in 1939 and they were very kind.</span> <span id="s584">They were very kind to us.</span> <span id="s585">One day, after they had been with us for about three or four days, in the middle of the town there was a big square with a bell – if they wanted to call the people together for some reason, you know the telephones were not working like here, so that was the best way to call the people into the square – so they called the people into the town square and they announced that they had to leave, that the river Por, which was the dividing line set up by an agreement with the Germans dividing Poland [thought incomplete].</span></p> <p><span id="s586">At that time Germany and Russia were friends.</span> <span id="s587">In 1939, the Russians and the Germans were not at war.</span> <span id="s588">They said that whoever wanted to leave our town could come with them, especially Jewish people.</span> <span id="s589">They knew what would happen.</span> <span id="s590">They said that the door was open to whoever wanted to leave; that they would provide trucks and give one-half hour for the families to get ready and to gather the things whichever they wanted to take.</span> <span id="s591">They said that we could cross the border and go with them into Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Then it started!</span> <span id="s593">People were running back and forth.</span> <span id="s594">They were scared.</span> <span id="s595">They didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s596">My father refused to leave.</span> <span id="s597">He said: “I am an old person, an old man.</span> <span id="s598">What can they do to me?</span> <span id="s599">What can the Germans do to me?”</span> <span id="s600">Then he said to my mother: “You are going!</span> <span id="s601">Take the girls, if you want to go, go!</span> <span id="s602">The war will be over in a couple of weeks, or a couple of months, then you can come back.”</span> <span id="s603">We cried since we didn’t want my father to stay behind.</span> <span id="s604">He had a sister who lived not too far from us.</span> <span id="s605">He went to her and asked her if he could stay with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">I am always blessing her wisdom since she said to him: “No!</span> <span id="s607">You have young children; you have a young family.</span> <span id="s608">You ought to be with them.</span> <span id="s609">You go!”</span> <span id="s610">I think that in the back of his mind was the fact hat his daughter [the one who was as old as Bernice’s mother] was in the part of Poland which had been overrun by the Germans already; that there was no way that he could say goodbye to her, to see her to send word.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">He was hoping that things would get normal and maybe that he could be with them until we would come back.</span> <span id="s612">However, that sister of his said: “No!</span> <span id="s613">We are staying.</span> <span id="s614">We are older people.</span> <span id="s615">We have no young kids.</span> <span id="s616">We are staying.</span> <span id="s617">We don’t have the stamina to pack up and go, but you have to go.</span> <span id="s618">Your wife and daughters want to go.”</span> <span id="s619">So he came back and he said – her name was Rebecca – “she said that I should go also.”</span> <span id="s620">We had in the meantime already packed and left everything of his.</span> <span id="s621">We took off the mirrors and put them on the floor so that they wouldn’t break, and all that.</span> <span id="s622">We took what we could and we went.</span> <span id="s623">We went to Vladimir Volynski in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s624">My other had a brother there.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">[Interviewer’s note: Bernice does not pronounce the double name, however, she gropes – on the tape – for something after the Vladimir so that it appears to be the only town in the Ukraine to be the likely subject.</span> <span id="s626">It is located at 50.51N, 24.22E.]</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Did you know where your brother was at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: My brother went to Rava-Russkaja [50.13N, 23.37E].</span> <span id="s629">That is the town where he went.</span> <span id="s630">That was the destination where he went.</span> <span id="s631">That was the closest point [which was thought to be in Russian hands].</span> <span id="s632">We weren’t sure.</span> <span id="s633">We hoped that he got there.</span> <span id="s634">When we came to my uncle’s, two Russian lieutenants were there because, in Russia, if you had two or three rooms -- every person is entitled to so many square meters – if you had more than that they would assign anyone to occupy the excess room.</span> <span id="s635">That was because of the housing situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">By the way, on the road while we were traveling with the trucks, the drivers were very kind.</span> <span id="s637">They had big loaves of black bread and they wanted to share the bread and some jam with us.</span> <span id="s638">We had things but we had to pack so fast.</span> <span id="s639">We just threw in some clothes and some possessions which we could.</span> <span id="s640">We buried some things which we were afraid to even take, because maybe the soldiers would take them from us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: How long were you being driven?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Not too long because it wasn’t that far.</span> <span id="s643">However, with stopping constantly, I would say maybe ten to fifteen hours.</span> <span id="s644">Under normal circumstances, it should have taken maybe three or four hours.</span> <span id="s645">You know, that was because of the war and because the roads had been town up.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Were there mostly Jewish people who left?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s648">There were very few communists—Polish communists.</span> <span id="s649">[Until 1938 the Nazi’s vehement persecutions of all the people who were suspected of communist ties had been far more bloody than that of Jews.</span> <span id="s650">The early concentration camps were set up for communists and suspects of communism.]</span> <span id="s651">I believe that cured them from being communists when they got to Russia.</span> <span id="s652">That is the best way of curing someone of communism.</span> <span id="s653">I always say that they should send them to Russia and they would change their mind.</span> <span id="s654">We did get to my uncle’s but we couldn’t stay with him because, as I said, he had some other people staying at this house.</span> <span id="s655">So we went ahead to a location which they had set up for refugees in a school.</span> <span id="s656">My mother became sick.</span> <span id="s657">We sent word of that to my brother, and my brother did come.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Do you know how many people left with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: I would say maybe a third of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s660">Now this is the sad part: Everybody could have gone!</span> <span id="s661">The rich people did not want to leave their possessions.</span> <span id="s662">The poor people for some reason thought: “Where will I go?</span> <span id="s663">What will they want with me?</span> <span id="s664">Who is going to bother me?”</span> <span id="s665">A lot of young people earlier, they had just gone on by foot.</span> <span id="s666">Some took advantage of the transportation which was being provided.</span> <span id="s667">However, quite a few – even in comparison with other towns which did not have the facility of transportation – did go to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Quite a few from the small towns did also go to Russia.</span> <span id="s669">Some of them were sent to Siberia and died there.</span> <span id="s670">Some died because there was a war and food shortages and disease.</span> <span id="s671">They didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s672">However, comparatively, quite a few from my hometown made it – at least in so far as we know today – from other similar towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">They just lost everybody from some towns; they just perished.</span> <span id="s674">From those who stayed behind nobody, but nobody survived.</span> <span id="s675">We really didn’t know about others, such as I have a cousin who also went at the same time, not to the same destination, not to the same town.</span> <span id="s676">My uncle, from another little town, he left and we didn’t know where he went.</span> <span id="s677">He is alive today, but my aunt died a few months ago in Israel, but he and his children are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Just these few people who went to Russia survived.</span> <span id="s679">Of those of my family who stayed behind, not a one survived; not a one survived the concentrations camps.</span> <span id="s680">Nobody!</span> <span id="s681">I have another cousin – she is a second or third cousin – she is the head nurse in one of the hospitals in Israel.</span> <span id="s682">She survived in Russia and all of her family perished, except that her brother, I believe, survived.</span> <span id="s683">Some neighbors of ours survived, however, also in Russia.</span> <span id="s684">From my town of those who stayed behind, only three people – to the best of my knowledge – survived.</span> <span id="s685">That is out of twelve thousand people, there are maybe two thousand left.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Concluding Note: Here the first interview stopped and Bernice Muler and Julie Orenstein never did manage to get together for the second interview which carried Bernice forward from her survival in the Ukraine in the fall of 1939, to her settlement in the Miami Valley where she lives with her husband, Ben Muler.</span> <span id="s687">Ben has been interviewed and this interview is in the Wright State University Living History Archive.</span> <span id="s688">Ben and Bernice met because they were both deep in Russia, in the Ural Mountains where Ben worked with Bernice’s brother, at the end of 1941.</span> <span id="s689">It appears that after the German attach on Russia on June22, 1941, the Russians evacuated many Jews, including refugees from Poland and took them to places deep in Russia, including the Ural Mountains, where they were assigned jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">The end of Bernice Muler’s transcript.</span></p></body></html>
