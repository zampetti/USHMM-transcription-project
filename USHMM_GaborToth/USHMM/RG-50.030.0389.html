id="s10">Q: -- where and when you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I was born Inge Marion Sachs, on the 27th of May, 1923.</span> <span id="s12">Q: And tell us a little bit about where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I think you better remember that I don’t hear very well.</span> <span id="s14">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s15">And if you can tell us about where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Berlin.</span> <span id="s17">I was born in the same apartment from where I immigrated late -- sik -- 15 years later.</span> <span id="s18">So we -- my family always lived in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Tell us about your mother and father, their names, and where they grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My mother came from Silesia.</span> <span id="s21">She was married and came to Berlin, and her husband died in the first world -- f -- was a soldier in the first World War, and he left this life.</span> <span id="s22">My mother had one daughter, my sister.</span> <span id="s23">She was born in 1913, and my mother -- mother was left a widow, I think 1917, something.</span> <span id="s24">She had to earn her living, and I have photos of that.</span> <span id="s25">She had to bring up her daughter, was a very difficult life.</span> <span id="s26">My father was also in the war, the first World War.</span> <span id="s27">They were married, and I -- I don’t know in which year, might be 1920, and then we grew up as one family.</span> <span id="s28">That’s to say my sister was my sister, and there was no difference made.</span> <span id="s29">My f -- my family was always poor.</span> <span id="s30">I don’t know what my father actually learned.</span> <span id="s31">He was born in 1886, he must have had some sort of profession before the war, he certainly didn’t have any profession afterwards.</span> <span id="s32">It was very hard going, he was a s-salesman of some sort, or something like that.</span> <span id="s33">And in 1923, there was a inflation in -- in Germany, and the -- hyper inflation, was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s34">Later on, he fulfilled his dream.</span> <span id="s35">He set up, I think with money from his parents, which would have come to -- wh-which he would have inherited, he set up a shoe repair shop, and he really -- that was the sort of thing he loved, doing things with his hands, although in Germany you -- you had to have certain people there who -- who learned the profession, but he worked there, and he liked it, and it was hard going, but Germany is terribly well organized.</span> <span id="s36">They even had certificates for people to repair their shoes, in way of Social Security, that was part of Social Security.</span> <span id="s37">So when he got permission to use these certificates, things were try -- were starting to pick up.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Can you tell us your mother’s name, your father’s name, and your sister’s.</span> <span id="s39">I think we haven’t mentioned those.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s41">My mother was Marguerita Colcreeta Copaulna.</span> <span id="s42">That was her naiden -- maiden name.</span> <span id="s43">She married M-Mr.</span> <span id="s44">Suskind, and then my sister was part of the time called -- well, part -- when I say part of the time, she was later called my name, Saxe, too.</span> <span id="s45">But officially Suskind.</span> <span id="s46">Olga Minna Suskind.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s49">But she was really, for all intents and purposes called my family name.</span> <span id="s50">And my father’s Alfred Zemon Saxe.</span> <span id="s51">But you realize that during the Hitler period, every -- every Jew who hasn’t got a typical Jewish name also had to be called Sarah, although it’s a very nice name, and all men had to be called Israel.</span> <span id="s52">So that makes -- but that was cancelled later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you know any of your grandparents, on either side?</span> <span id="s54">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Can you tell us about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: I knew my father’s parents, but they lived somewhere else, I didn’t have very much contact, but I have a very -- I have a clear remembrance of my father’s parents.</span> <span id="s57">I was very close to my mother’s parents, although my mother’s mother died in childbirth, so my grandfather married again.</span> <span id="s58">But this grandmother was -- although my -- it was very difficult for my mother in the beginning, later on it was a good relationship, and I always considered her my real grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Where did they live, and do you remember what they did for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, my -- they lived in Breslau, although they lived in Upper Silesia in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">And my grandfather had a -- what would you call it, where you cut wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: A sawmill?</span> <span id="s63">A sawmill?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: A mill, a mi -- no, no, no, no, no, a mill.</span> <span id="s65">A mill to -- for timber.</span> <span id="s66">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s68">Now, they were quite well off until some sort of relatives or other -- this story I don’t know so well, but he went off with some money, so things weren’t so beautiful that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: That he what?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: They -- somebody went off with some money -- Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: -- and they weren’t so well off either, but that’s how they made their living.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And j -- if you could just describe -- you said you were close to your mother’s parents, and what -- what would a visit be like, or -- what are your memories?</span> <span id="s73">What would you do with your grandmother and grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I -- even as a small child, I was put on the train, and at the other end they took me out of the train, and I stayed with them.</span> <span id="s75">And there was a number of brother and sisters, my mother’s, in the same town, and that’s where -- that’s how I spend my time, m -- always being together with -- with uncles and aunts, and staying with my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Were you scared to go on the train when you were little?</span> <span id="s77">A: No, I don’t remember being scared, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: [indecipherable] interesting.</span> <span id="s79">And how about your father’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: They came to visit us in Berlin, I don’t remember ever visiting them.</span> <span id="s81">The family saga says I’ve been there, but I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And what would those times be like, what would you do?</span> <span id="s83">A: I went to school -- when -- I mean -- no --</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: I meant if they came to visit, would it be for a special holiday, or would there -- would -- was there -- were there big meals?</span> <span id="s85">What -- what did you do when they came to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, we -- we used to go for -- for an excursion or something like this, or visit [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t remember that too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s89">And tell us a little bit more about Olga.</span> <span id="s90">She was your older sister.</span> <span id="s91">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Di-Did you sleep in the same room?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: We s -- m-m-mostly we slept in the same room, later there was a little room where I went to.</span> <span id="s94">I always used to quarrel terribly with her.</span> <span id="s95">I was stronger than she was, although 10 years younger, and I believe now, I’ve believed for a long time, for the sake of family union, it was never told to me that she was my half sister.</span> <span id="s96">And I always knew it, and there was sort of insecurity about it.</span> <span id="s97">I think that made me quarrel with her.</span> <span id="s98">Later on we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s99">When I -- when nothing secret was kept f -- you know, we were very - - I -- I was always insecure because of that.</span> <span id="s100">Would have been -- nowadays one wouldn’t do that sort of thing, one would tell what it’s all about.</span> <span id="s101">But it was done all -- all out of love, to make the family closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Can you describe the -- the house you lived in, or maybe it was an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: It’s an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Could you tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s106">I can see that very clearly in front of me.</span> <span id="s107">When you came -- it was on the second, how do you call it, one, two, three.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Second floor, and you came in, and there was a corridor, and straight ahead there was a kitchen.</span> <span id="s110">Well, it was a kitchen 60 years ago.</span> <span id="s111">So that was different.</span> <span id="s112">Off the kitchen there was a very small room thot -- that’s where I slept at times, really meant for the maid, but we didn’t have a maid, and there was another exit to the sta -- to the stairs down, which was supposed to be used for maids, and other people who were -- are not the family [inaudible].</span> <span id="s113">Well then, if you go back from the kitchen, come to the corridor again, I still see in the corner, a place where I had all my toys, and which was always very untidy, and I always tried to tidy it up.</span> <span id="s114">And then to the right there was a room which was called th -- well, it’s much nicer in German to say it, but it was called a gentleman roo -- oh, you might call it a smoking room, maybe.</span> <span id="s115">There were books in it, and a table, and a couch, and something like that.</span> <span id="s116">And then you came into the living room proper, living room and dining room.</span> <span id="s117">It was rather big -- relatively big place.</span> <span id="s118">We always had flowers in the window.</span> <span id="s119">There was a balcony off from it, and beh -- and then came the children’s room, so-called, where my sister and I slept, and I had my desk and work [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Behind that room was another corridor.</span> <span id="s121">You could go th -- straight through th -- my -- my parents room, but you also had a little corridor going at the back to go from there.</span> <span id="s122">It was a t -- a do -- now, if I say -- in Berlin you had houses which had apartments in front, then a small garden, and then back part of the house.</span> <span id="s123">And that’s where we lived, at the back part of the house.</span> <span id="s124">I mean, it’s a four, five story house -- apartment house.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did you -- did you know other people in the building well?</span> <span id="s126">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Can you tell us about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Children used to play together -- I used to, up to a certain time.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s130">And did you have a good friend, particularly, or did your mother, or your sister?</span> <span id="s131">A: Whether they had any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Well, did you have like a best friend that lived in the building, or nearby, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Well, I had a very good friend who lived in the building nearby, and we used to have communication not by telephone, but by -- w -- by -- by mail, which we -- w-with strings, and a box, an -- which we could sort of -- she lived down there, and I lived up there, and we si -- I don’t remember how you call it, flafinpost.</span> <span id="s134">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Well, you invented your own sort of -- A: Communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Communication system.</span> <span id="s137">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s139">That’s great.</span> <span id="s140">What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Anita Berger.</span> <span id="s142">And there’s a story attached to this.</span> <span id="s143">One day in the Nazi time -- we were very good friends -- she came up to me, and she said, “I am terribly sorry, I’m not allowed to play with you any longer, my father would lose his job.”</span> <span id="s144">I was terribly hurt -- well, I mean, there were more things to be hurt about, but this I remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s145">And my mother understood it much better.</span> <span id="s146">She thought it was very good of her to come up and tell me.</span> <span id="s147">I still remember her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: After she said that, did you ever see her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: I might have seen her at school, but we never -- there was not -- no longer any relationship between us.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What did your mother tell you?</span> <span id="s151">How did she explain this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, she explained that she thought -- sh -- she just said -- I think she -- she thought it was good, and nice of her to come and explain that herself, and not just drop -- just let the relationship finish without saying anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: But how did you understand it at the time?</span> <span id="s154">A: No, I was just terribly hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So when you were younger, it was pretty normal for Jewish children, and -- and non- Jewish children to play together?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes, it was quite -- I mean, the district of Berlin where I lived, there were relatively many Jews, and we all went to school together.</span> <span id="s157">There was no -- well, nowadays I have my doubts whether the non-Jewish really had the same relationship as we thought we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">But I think there was no difference.</span> <span id="s159">There was Jewish -- there was religious instruction in school, and the non-Jewish children just stayed where they are, and the Jewish children went to the next classroom, and had other religious instruction.</span> <span id="s160">There was nothing much thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Tell us a little bit about your family, and it’s -- it’s faith.</span> <span id="s162">I mean, how -- did you observe Shabbat, just h-how was that passed to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: There -- we were what you call very liberal in we -- family in way of religion, that we -- we didn’t keep any Shabbat, what we kept the high holidays, the holidays, such as Pesach, which was a family affair, and we went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s164">I went -- I had a time of life where I was religiously inclined, but it was all ver -- very liberal, as I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Th-This was when you were a young girl?</span> <span id="s166">The time in your life that you were religiously inclined, when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Well, must have been around 10 - 12 years, something like that.</span> <span id="s168">I went -- I -- Q: Can you tell us about that?</span> <span id="s169">What -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: I went to the synagogue on Friday night, or on Saturday morning, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Well, that’s was all about it, I went to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s173">D-Do you -- do you remember why you became interested in it?</span> <span id="s174">A: No.</span> <span id="s175">It was just one of those things which happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s178">I was in -- I’d never had any Zionist inclination.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t know whether that was due to my parents influence, or -- I don’t know, or I just didn’t have -- happen to have those friends.</span> <span id="s180">I was never in any youth organization.</span> <span id="s181">Many people -- that was to -- to -- to be scouts, or something like this, or -- there were many youth organizations, I was never in any youth organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Di -- co -- do you remember any celebrations of holy days in particular where maybe your father really sort of guided the family, or your mother did something special, or your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yes, I remember at times being at my grandparents for Pesach, and also at home, my father led the -- the celebration.</span> <span id="s184">And I also remember that my sister and I, we usually didn’t behave very well.</span> <span id="s185">We used to laugh a great deal, I don’t know why, but it was always a very funny thing.</span> <span id="s186">But it was nice, and it was, in a way, in the spirit of the religious thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What did your parents tell you as you were growing up, about their faith, your faith, about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s189">This was such a thing we -- that was self understood.</span> <span id="s190">There was never any doubt in my mind that I was Jewish, that my parents were Jewish, but it didn’t -- at that time, it didn’t weigh, it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s191">I mean, that was just one of the -- I happened to be a female, I take it for granted that I’m a female.</span> <span id="s192">I wear glasses, I took that for granted, and I took for granted that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s193">There was never any problem about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: That’s an interesting choice of words, it didn’t weigh.</span> <span id="s195">It was a more natural thing when you were younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: It was the most natural thing in -- in the world.</span> <span id="s197">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I happened to be -- I was born in German, therefore I was German, so I thought.</span> <span id="s199">I happen to be -- I ha -- happen to have Jewish parents, therefore I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s200">Was just a perfectly natural thing.</span> <span id="s201">Although I do remember I had a very good friend who was Jewish, and she was brought up without any religion.</span> <span id="s202">And tho -- these people had far harder times still to accept later the -- the -- the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s203">And my -- I also -- the household wasn’t kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">So there was nothing very -- that separated me very much from my other friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What -- what was a -- a regular day like, what did your mother do?</span> <span id="s206">Early in the morning, wa -- ta -- sort of try to remember a -- just a regular day.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, nowadays I have a maid, so if I say she didn’t have a maid, that means something to me, it may not mean anything to you.</span> <span id="s208">So she took c-care of the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Would she be the first one to get up?</span> <span id="s210">Did she wake you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, I -- I -- that I don’t remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s212">I don’t remember clearly having breakfast.</span> <span id="s213">I remember very clearly having lunch after ca -- I came home from school.</span> <span id="s214">My father didn’t come home, so he had another hot meal -- hot meal in the evening.</span> <span id="s215">I us- usually partook part of the hot meal.</span> <span id="s216">And even when you have usually just bread and sandwich in the evening.</span> <span id="s217">And she cooked, and she washed, and she was popular in entertaining, but it was just ladies who came in the afternoon and had -- well, what I do remember very clearly is my birthday parties.</span> <span id="s218">And there were -- my mother had a great ability to make a -- a party.</span> <span id="s219">And so much so that I could take it -- I could continue with this with my children, and now I do it with my grandchildren, although it’s not at all done in Brazil.</span> <span id="s220">You just have -- in Brazil you just have food, and noise, and parents around, and I try to play with the children the way my mother played with me, with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Ca-ca-can you tell us a little bit about how your mother gave you a birthday party?</span> <span id="s222">A: Yes, although I don’t quite know how to -- there are different games y-you play, traditional games.</span> <span id="s223">They are all the same games on -- every year.</span> <span id="s224">For instance -- I ca -- I don’t know any proper name to the game.</span> <span id="s225">You hit a little present, and then you s -- what do you cook in?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: An oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s228">The food, on the -- Q: The -- the s --</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: The -- the -- the -- Q: The pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: The po --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: A pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: You -- you hid some little present under the pot, and then you tie it up, something around the eyes of your -- of the child, and gave her a -- a spoon, and then she had to find the -- the pot, and beat on it, and then the -- was taken off, and she looked underneath for a present that was underneath.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Or there was one, the journey to Jerusalem, which had one chair less than there were children, and the music played, and when the music stopped, each child had to find a -- a chair, and as there was one less, one child didn’t find a chair, and stepped out, until there was just two children, and one chair.</span> <span id="s235">Al-Always little presents to give when -- when -- whoever won.</span> <span id="s236">And there were different play -- when you were younger you had other plays, and when you were older, a little bit more sophisticated.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Tell us a little bit about school.</span> <span id="s238">What -- what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: I might even start with kindergarten, which I remember very clearly.</span> <span id="s240">I didn’t like to go to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s241">For a time, I vomited every morning before going.</span> <span id="s242">But at that time psychology wasn’t very known.</span> <span id="s243">After awhile I -- I went there, and I learned a lot of things to -- to do with my hands, to fold paper, to -- it was a lot -- you didn’t learn any reading or writing, you played, you sang, and you did a lot of handy work, too.</span> <span id="s244">And I have friends which co -- compani -- no, no -- the one friend who accompanied me since kindergarten, she died in Holland, she was murdered in Holland.</span> <span id="s245">Well, that was kindergarten, which I remember very -- very well indeed.</span> <span id="s246">And then school started, and I still have two friends which -- with which -- whom I started school.</span> <span id="s247">One lives in Philadelphia, and the other lives in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s248">The others I lost [inaudible].</span> <span id="s249">We had a very nice first teacher, who I -- got very friendly with me, and even after the Nazi ti -- time, she kept in touch with me, and I kept in touch with her even after the war.</span> <span id="s250">I got in touch with her again after the war, that was my --</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: She was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: She was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s253">She gave me a little book as a farewell present.</span> <span id="s254">She didn’t have the courage to write her own name, but she wrote, from your old teacher.</span> <span id="s255">I remember the name of the ge -- of the teacher who was our religious instructure -- in-instructor.</span> <span id="s256">We -- yes, what -- well, we’ll just say learn to read and write, and do the -- there were four years of -- of primary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: What was the name of the teacher, your first grade teacher that you loved so much?</span> <span id="s258">A: Snyder, Snyder.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Which is German for tailor.</span> <span id="s261">There were others later on, but this, I -- he -- now I don’t remember whether this was primary school where -- where we learned some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s262">Mus -- might have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s264">So even though it was just first grade, she kept in touch with you, she was sort of a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: She was a friend, yes.</span> <span id="s266">I used to visit her in her home.</span> <span id="s267">After the war when I -- I had to search for her again, I found her, and she was then very sick.</span> <span id="s268">I sent parcels to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: She died.</span> <span id="s271">I kept on the contact with her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So even when you were 10, or 12, sh-she was someone you would spend a little time with?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: And did she live nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Well, not very close, but near enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And yet -- w-what -- what were you most interested in in school?</span> <span id="s277">Were you beginning to think about what you might like to -- to do?</span> <span id="s278">What -- how were you thinking about being in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Well, ever since I can read -- and it was rather hard to learn reading for me, but ever since I could read, I’ve always been reading.</span> <span id="s280">What I was going to be later on, I think at one time I wanted to be a teacher, which wouldn’t have been a good idea at all.</span> <span id="s281">And I do remember later on -- a little later, we were -- some friends of ours sitting together, and discussing what we want to be, or how we want to be.</span> <span id="s282">I just wanted to be a housewife in an apartment, and nothing really else, so it turned out quite differently from what I planned.</span> <span id="s283">But I had no distinct trends to -- or talents to be something.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: C-Can you remember a little bit about your neighborhood, and about Berlin as a city?</span> <span id="s285">Di- Did your family move around the city a lot, or did they sort of stay in their neighborhood, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, no, we never moved.</span> <span id="s287">I mean, we always stayed in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s288">And I remember distinctly the street, and the -- the school.</span> <span id="s289">One was there, the other one was there.</span> <span id="s290">But that, of course, it’s different.</span> <span id="s291">It was near to Espan station -- to a sta -- train station, very close to the train station.</span> <span id="s292">I’ve been back to Berlin in more or less recent years, and I could remember everything, and in a way I didn’t recognize anything.</span> <span id="s293">I mean, was there, but it was -- I sh -- I must have changed, the neighborhood stayed the same as it was.</span> <span id="s294">I didn’t really take it in as something which was near, or close to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did your family go on outings much in Berlin, and -- you know, a -- as a family, an -- and -- o-or did the family pretty much stick close to the neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, on the weekends we always made excursions.</span> <span id="s297">Berlin has -- in the summer, Berlin has a very beautiful surrounding, there was always something to go o -- we went into the woods, and picked blueberries, or went on a -- on a steamer, on one of the rivers.</span> <span id="s298">In winter, my father almost always took me to a museum on Sundays.</span> <span id="s299">A little later on, with a friend of mine, we s -- we stood to buy some tickets for opera, was to go to the opera.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You had said earlier that there wasn’t a lot of money, that your -- your family was somewhat poor.</span> <span id="s301">Can you tell us a little bit more about that, do you remember feeling anxious about --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yes, I felt anxious about it.</span> <span id="s303">It was always a cloud over my head.</span> <span id="s304">Not really because -- yes, my mother used to make my dresses, and I -- my -- my friends always had much more beautiful dresses.</span> <span id="s305">And -- and I felt the sorrow, or the anxiousness my parents felt.</span> <span id="s306">Middle class people may -- it’s possible that they feel it stronger than people who are born poor.</span> <span id="s307">It was always -- it was a cloud.</span> <span id="s308">Although it didn’t affect my -- the warmth of the family, or our happiness together.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It -- did you ever feel like there wasn’t en -- enough food, or was it just an anxiety about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: An anxiety about it.</span> <span id="s311">There was always enough food.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And did you ever go to your father’s shoe’s repair shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes, yeah, I did.</span> <span id="s314">And what was a great pleasure, he went to town to this -- to downtown or whatever, to buy leather.</span> <span id="s315">There were big sheets of leather for the shoe soles, and he used to do the buying of that, and he took me along, and I liked -- liked that very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: He took you, did Olga go also, your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No, I don’t think she did, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: You had mentioned that you quarreled a lot with her, w-what else did you do together, you and your sister [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Well she -- she was 10 years older than I, we didn’t do anything much together.</span> <span id="s320">We -- we used to go s -- no, I went skating in the winter, and she used to fetch me from the skating rink.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Pick you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Pick me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s324">What was Olga doing at this time, when you were about eight or 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, when I was eight, she was 18, she already left school.</span> <span id="s326">She went -- she -- she learned sewing.</span> <span id="s327">In Germany there’s a system of having three years of apprenticeship, and then you have to make a exam, and then you went to -- it was something else.</span> <span id="s328">And she went in for sewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And -- but was she still living with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s331">I don’t really know what we quarreled about.</span> <span id="s332">I don’t think we quarreled about money.</span> <span id="s333">Every weekend my father gave the coins, the -- well, the pennies you have here, one week to one, and the other week to the other.</span> <span id="s334">And I always -- I never had any reason to spend my money, so I always had more money.</span> <span id="s335">But we didn’t quarrel about money.</span> <span id="s336">I - - I lend it to her -- I gave it to her.</span> <span id="s337">I mean, I lend it to her, but in the end it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s338">No, we didn’t quarrel about money.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Do you remember being -- of the first time you began to be aware that maybe things were shifting in your country, that something was different, in terms of your security, maybe being more aware of being Jewish?</span> <span id="s340">Can you begin to remember when things started changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Yes, very little, because in a big town like Berlin, it wasn’t nearly as bad for one person, really, than it was in small towns.</span> <span id="s342">But the parents were anxious.</span> <span id="s343">One heard the screaming voices on the radio.</span> <span id="s344">That’s when it started.</span> <span id="s345">And my worst remembrance is at night, they used to march with -- what do you call it, a fire in --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Torch.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: A torch.</span> <span id="s348">And that -- and singing, same time.</span> <span id="s349">And then of course, it started in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: But -- but before we go on, can you describe what that looked like?</span> <span id="s351">Ha -- ha -- where were you when you saw it?</span> <span id="s352">I mean, that’s a strong image, I would like to see it better.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Who was marching?</span> <span id="s355">Was it in front of your house, what did it sound like?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: As there was no television, I must have seen it myself.</span> <span id="s357">Do -- I can’t remember walking the streets of Berlin and seeing it.</span> <span id="s358">So -- and when it got dark, I was usually at home.</span> <span id="s359">I don’t remember how -- I remember, but that’s something which was terrifying, the singing.</span> <span id="s360">And I don’t remember this -- they marched in front of our house.</span> <span id="s361">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: What were they singing?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Songs that Germany was going to rule the world, and all the Jews were going to be slaughtered.</span> <span id="s364">I have a-another very plea -- well, a more satisfying remembrance, at school there was a -- one class which was for -- for music.</span> <span id="s365">And all the children were singing one of those Nazi so -- songs.</span> <span id="s366">And the teacher said, “Now we sing the first verse, and then second.</span> <span id="s367">And now we sing the fourth.”</span> <span id="s368">So a wonderful colleague of mine asked, “Why don’t we sing the third?”</span> <span id="s369">So he said, “That would hurt some of your colleagues.”</span> <span id="s370">And that was when Jews were cut their throat and all the -- the blood was dripping from the knife.</span> <span id="s371">So I’ve never -- I don’t remember his name any more, and I’m sure he died in the war, but I’ve never for -- it’s a memorial gift to him.</span> <span id="s372">And this was great things to do.</span> <span id="s373">I mean, this wasn’t just something somebody might say, that -- you had to have courage to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: You said you heard the screaming on the radio, do you remember who was talking, and what your parents might have said about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Well, it was Hitler, and -- and this Goebbels and some.</span> <span id="s376">I mean, they knew it were hard times, but unfortunately they didn’t wri -- realize early enough how hard they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Hitler, and then Joseph Goebbels was sort of a mayor of Berlin, and somewhat in charge of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: You refer to the two names, on -- or you -- Q: I’m saying ger -- Goebbels was.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No, Goebbels was a minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: No, he wasn’t, okay.</span> <span id="s381">He was a minister, okay, so this -- I was thinking earlier -- I’m probably mistaken.</span> <span id="s382">Do you remember ever overhearing your parents speak about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s384">I mean, I don’t remember any time, any -- any occasion, but there was always talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: So that wasn’t something that was hidden from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: No, that wasn’t something that was hidden from me.</span> <span id="s387">I mean, they didn’t themself realize how dangerous situation was, so there was nothing to hi -- but that it was a dangerous situation, that wasn’t hidden from me.</span> <span id="s388">It couldn’t have been hidden, it was too loud -- from the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: And we -- tell us a little bit about your father’s shop.</span> <span id="s390">Did he begin to not be able to get supplies, or w-was there a point where he could no longer run his shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s392">There was the ninth of November, 1938, when it all smashed.</span> <span id="s393">You heard of the -- Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: And that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s395">Q: This is Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: But before that, was there any fay --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s399">I think things were looking up, financially.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So as things began to shift, and friends could no longer play with you, di-did your family ever consider sending you away, or putting you into hiding, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: No, there was no question of hiding at all.</span> <span id="s402">But I had to leave the public school where I went, because things were getting too unpleasant.</span> <span id="s403">S -- pinpricks.</span> <span id="s404">Jewish children weren’t allowed to go on the excursions any longer, and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s405">Although, in my school it was relatively liberal, I mean, but things came to the point when I ha -- I went -- I left that school and went to a Jewish school, a Jewish private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You said pinpricks, so just what did you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Oh, well, Jewish children were sat at the -- sat at the back, maybe, and princ -- principally that we cou -- weren’t allowed to go to the -- to the excursions.</span> <span id="s408">The school had a house in the country that belonged to the school.</span> <span id="s409">I don’t think I’m wrong to saying that the -- it was mainly built by Jewish parents, with Jewish parent’s money, but they weren’t allowed to go there any more, and that was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s410">The class went twice a year, once in the summer, and once in the winter.</span> <span id="s411">And they weren’t allowed to go any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: How was that explained?</span> <span id="s413">Did someone stand up at the front of the class?</span> <span id="s414">I mean, how did you -- how was that explained to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, lip te -- I don’t remember that very clearly, but the teacher who organized it said, “We’re going from the seventh to the 14th, and the Jewish children can’t go over there.”</span> <span id="s416">I don’t remember that very clearly, but there was no doubt about it, that we had to stay behind.</span> <span id="s417">There were also performances for Christmas for some sort of -- the whole class took part, but that was when the Jewish children were not allowed to take part in the performances any more.</span> <span id="s418">Well, maybe even more than pinpricks for -- for a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: So was there a point when all of the children left the school, or finally that your family said, we want [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Well, there wer -- didn’t -- n-n-not everybody left at the same time.</span> <span id="s421">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: But they were always getting less, and wasn’t to be done any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did this make your family become any closer to the Jewish community in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Hardly.</span> <span id="s425">No, hardly.</span> <span id="s426">There was -- as we’re not allowed to go any more to the cinema, to the concerts, to the opera, to the theater, the Jewish community organized a Jewish cultural club, and that’s where -- where we went, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: So it did, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Oh, the Jewish community in Berlin did a lot in -- in the way of cultural activities, although there is a s -- there are people who nowadays say, maybe with some reason, that was a fault.</span> <span id="s429">If everything had been cut off, and no substitute, cultural activities would have been offered, people might have realized it sooner, what was coming -- what was coming.</span> <span id="s430">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s431">We enjoyed it at the time, but it might have been better if na -- if it had been left as it was, and not offer any alternative.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: So your father took you to some of these events, your father and mother?</span> <span id="s433">A: Well, ow -- to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: To the Jewish cultural events that were organized [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes, yes, I -- I went with a friend to concerts, for opera.</span> <span id="s436">They did quite a lot.</span> <span id="s437">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: My mother always regularly went to the opera, when it was still possible, and then of course, she -- she missed that very much.</span> <span id="s439">She was quite a talented musician, she played the piano.</span> <span id="s440">But, nothing professional.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Did you have a piano in the house?</span> <span id="s442">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s443">I had also piano lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: So, things were changing, but as you said, adjustments were being made, so it didn’t seem like there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Very gradually -- very gradually.</span> <span id="s446">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s447">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: But as I say, I lived in a big town, and somebody who lived in a small town, or in the country would tell quite a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Di -- did you hear anything about what was happening with your grandparents, and your uncles, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: No.</span> <span id="s451">Everybody was more or less the same, that they ignored, and thought it would pass.</span> <span id="s452">Q: Did you -- any of your friends, or family friends, did -- did you see them making plans, and -- and leaving, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Gradually, yes, gradually [inaudible] Q: Leaving Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, leaving the country.</span> <span id="s455">Q: Leaving the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And what was -- if -- if your family talked about that, what did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Oh, it was talked about a lot.</span> <span id="s459">My father, like very many other Jewish men, said, “I’ve been in the f -- I’ve been a soldier, I fought for Germany, nothing will ever happen to me.”</span> <span id="s460">So many people said that.</span> <span id="s461">And this was -- I now remember when I left primary school, went into high school, if I remember rightly, the permission to enter high school was only given because my father was a so -- had been a soldier.</span> <span id="s462">And even that should have given people food for thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: But at that point your father was right?</span> <span id="s464">I mean, you were able to go into high school because he had been a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yes, but I mean, it should have been a right fo -- for e -- for e -- there were many people in high school whose father was not in the war.</span> <span id="s466">So that shouldn’t be a reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Just going back again, if you can try to remember if they’re, you know, as things changed, and you couldn’t go, for instance with your school on the excursions, or when you finally did decide to leave the school, what was the discussion with your parents like, or how did they tell you, we think it’s time for you to go to a different school?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: I -- I think it wasn’t a decision my parents did, it was a natural thing to -- I don’t remember that there was a discussion about it.</span> <span id="s469">Other -- my other colleagues, other friends left, and so I left, too.</span> <span id="s470">And that was not something I remember as a trauma.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: When you got to the new school, what was the atmosphere like?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I went to a very small school, I don’t think there were more than 50 people.</span> <span id="s473">An interesting school in as much as there were a Jewish school, and there were very little room for people who were Jewish related, not Jewish by religion, and who didn’t have no -- nowhere to go to, really.</span> <span id="s474">And this school took all children in who were in any danger.</span> <span id="s475">They -- strangely enough, there was just one thing that was not allowed.</span> <span id="s476">That -- she -- this -- this school belonged -- belonged to a woman, a highly educated woman, who didn’t want to have any Zionists in her school.</span> <span id="s477">She was -- it seems incredible today, a Nationalist.</span> <span id="s478">She later immigrated too, to the United States, and saved her life, while through her influence, a number of people stayed in her school -- i-in Germany, because of her influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You said it was a school for any child in danger, could you tell us a little bit more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Well, I don’t want to use er -- the word non-Aryan, because I hate the word, but, I mean, that explained it -- explained it.</span> <span id="s481">Was a Jewish father, a Christian mother, or something like this, who were just as much in danger than -- than the purely Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Lachman.</span> <span id="s484">Dr. Vera Lachman.</span> <span id="s485">She was an extraordinary woman, she could -- she had to original Greek book before her, of the Odyssey and the Iliad, and read it to us in German, translating it.</span> <span id="s486">On the other hand, she spoke fluently is -- islane -- the language they speak in islend -- ice -- Iceland.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Iceland.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Iceland.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So she wasn’t just a principal, she taught you, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: She taught, she taught.</span> <span id="s491">And she -- it was a very small school.</span> <span id="s492">The commercial path didn’t make any difference to her at all.</span> <span id="s493">I think she got into a very great [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s494">But we really had excellent teachers for the different subjects, who just came in to teach two or three lessons a week.</span> <span id="s495">[indecipherable] Al-all my, if I may say so, intellectual interests which I might have, I owe to her.</span> <span id="s496">No, that is not quite true, as I said, my father took me to the museums every Sunday on -- although he wasn’t an int -- intellectual.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Did the school cost anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: The school cost something, but those who couldn’t pay, didn’t.</span> <span id="s499">Q: And do you remember if your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I don’t think we paid anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: I think we’ll stop now, for a -- a minute or two, and we’ll change the tape.</span> <span id="s502">We’ll take a little break, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: I wanted to just go again, over some of the changes that were going on.</span> <span id="s506">You had mentioned seeing the people, seeing the marching.</span> <span id="s507">Who -- who exactly was it, who was marching?</span> <span id="s508">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Who was marching?</span> <span id="s510">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Well, the Nazi army, the so-called SA.</span> <span id="s512">I don’t know what [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s513">The -- they were in uniforms, and they were a political military arms of the regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did you ever see any evidence of the Hitler youth?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Oh yes, they were all around.</span> <span id="s516">Hitler youth were the male, and they were called -- for the girls there was another organization, BDN, Bund Deutsch Nation, German girls [indecipherable] association of German girls.</span> <span id="s517">They were youth movements.</span> <span id="s518">Oh yes, they were -- they wore uniforms, and they were all around.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: They wore uniforms just every day, or on certain days?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: That was different, some wore them all the time, some only wore them to -- for the meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did some of your friends, the children who had been your friends join the --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Everybody -- everybody had to join.</span> <span id="s523">And there were -- i-if -- I -- I would have joined, too, in a different situation, because they did nice things.</span> <span id="s524">They sang, and they walked, and they went on excursion.</span> <span id="s525">I -- I think I would have tried them, too.</span> <span id="s526">Everybody had to, but it’s very possible that I would have enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s527">That part of it was -- well, it wasn’t harmless, because it turned -- it got increasingly worse, but as such it was a harmless situation at the time, for the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Do you remember seeing some of the kids going off on these excursions, and wanting to be with them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Well, they were all over the place, you went to a railway station, and there they were, all ready to go into the railway.</span> <span id="s530">I don’t remember that my heart was in it, that I all means wanted to, and later on there was plenty of -- of mistrust and hate.</span> <span id="s531">But before all this happened, I could imagine that I would have liked to join.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You mention mistrust and hate.</span> <span id="s533">Some of the -- the young people that you had been friends with, and now you’re not going to school with them, maybe you’re not even in contact, did -- did you begin to become suspicious or alienated from old friends and neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: One certainly had to become alienated and suspicious.</span> <span id="s535">I think the real hate came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s537">C-Can you remember a situation with a neighbor, or a -- a friend, where you had some sort of experience where you thought, mm, I don’t trust this person any more?</span> <span id="s538">Or perhaps your parents had it?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: My parents certainly had it.</span> <span id="s540">I mean, you knew that you couldn’t trust anybody, you couldn’t talk in your own living room without being afraid that the telephone was -- cou - - it’s -- it’s a word that’s used very much now.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Bugged.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Bugged.</span> <span id="s543">I mean, even in those days, one was afraid of bugging.</span> <span id="s544">Q: And this is about what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: From ’33 on, but it got increasinging -- increasingly worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: So would your mother or father say no, don’t say that on the phone, or something, to you, or to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: I -- I don’t remember them saying that.</span> <span id="s548">I do remember that it was always understood.</span> <span id="s549">I -- I haven’t got rid of that feeling to this day.</span> <span id="s550">I mean, it wouldn’t be a political situation, I wouldn’t -- I don’t want to discuss on the telephone, but if I would say our friend X is a terrible person, I wouldn’t say that on the telephone.</span> <span id="s551">I don’t know whether that’s my past that makes me do that, but I’m certainly careful.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What were some other things that you and your family started being careful about?</span> <span id="s553">Do you remember details of daily life shifting because you had to be more careful?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: No, I don’t really remember that.</span> <span id="s555">Again, that’s because I lived in a big town.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Now, your father got up and went to his shop every day.</span> <span id="s557">Did -- did he ever come home and tell you about experiences, or did you ever -- were you ever with him, and encountered an SS person?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: There was nothing -- there was nothing like that, that hit us personally.</span> <span id="s559">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s560">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: I mean, the friendships, yes, but nothing in -- my parents also lost some friends.</span> <span id="s562">On the -- on the other hand, there were friends who stuck to them.</span> <span id="s563">They might not make a big show of coming to see them, but there were many -- well, I don’t think my parents had many friends, but there were some who -- who stuck to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: There was a book burning in Berlin.</span> <span id="s565">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Do you n -- can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No, I can’t tell you anything about that.</span> <span id="s568">I know that really as history.</span> <span id="s569">I wasn’t witness, and it was talked about, but I can’t say anything mo -- more about it.</span> <span id="s570">I -- they might have -- my parents might have been more aware of it, but I don’t remember anything about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Did you ever witness, for instance, a Nazi ha-have an interaction with a Jewish person that was disturbing to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Just in a kind of casual way.</span> <span id="s574">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: What was it like for you when you came across somebody from the Hitler youth, or a Nazi, let’s say.</span> <span id="s576">I mean, what was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Well, one met them all the time on the -- on the road.</span> <span id="s578">There was no reaction.</span> <span id="s579">Maybe because, so I’m told, I have not what was then considered a typical Jewish appearance, so it -- it never -- I’ve never personally experienced any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s580">Personally, to me, I was never felt that I’m being aggressively treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Do you know if your parents ever considered pretending you were Christian?</span> <span id="s582">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s583">Pretending that I was?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: No, no, never.</span> <span id="s586">There was never a question about that.</span> <span id="s587">And I don’t think one could have done.</span> <span id="s588">I mean, there were documents which proved that was not in it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Not a possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: E-Except maybe that my mother let me go to a concert, which I shouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s591">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Well, there’s nothing much to tell.</span> <span id="s593">There were tickets, and I just went in.</span> <span id="s594">There wasn’t a - - at the entrance, anybody who would ask me whether I am Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s595">I mean, it wasn’t done that way, it’s just Jews didn’t go to a concert, weren’t allowed to, and I did.</span> <span id="s596">I remember that very clearly.</span> <span id="s597">I didn’t feel there was any danger.</span> <span id="s598">Later on, I revolted against that, I didn’t want to do things which weren’t allowed for Jews.</span> <span id="s599">I don’t remember ever sitting down on a bench in the park where it was written Jews and dogs are not allowed.</span> <span id="s600">I don’t remember doing that.</span> <span id="s601">Another thing which might be interesting, we -- I said we were very liberal Jews, and nowadays, of course, everybody celebrates Christmas.</span> <span id="s602">We always celebrated Christmas, was part of our tradition.</span> <span id="s603">And -- and from 30 -- and it was a lovely family affair, and very warm and close.</span> <span id="s604">We celebrated a Jewish festival, and we celebrated Christmas, and we searched for Easter eggs at Easter.</span> <span id="s605">So we didn’t leave anything out.</span> <span id="s606">But I think from ’37, we revolted against it, very much to the sorrow of my parents, we didn’t want to have any more Christmas celebrations.</span> <span id="s607">So we went instead to -- to relatives of mine who did continue celebrating, they were only half Jewish.</span> <span id="s608">I hate these words, but my grandmother’s youngest sister had married a non-Jew, so they continued and we went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: You say you revolted, you and your sister, what -- what were you revolting against?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes, against -- well, actually it’s a religious festival, we didn’t celebrate it as a religious festival, but I think it was a German tradition, and we revolted to -- to a German rid -- tradition -- against a German tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: So there came a point where you no longer wanted to participate in the things that you weren’t allowed to participate in.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s614">And you said that made your parents sad?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes, because they liked to do -- to have a nice atmosphere, a Christmas atmosphere in Germany is particularly nice, and so they missed the family tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: At one point, did -- was there a point when you began to feel fear in your daily life?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: When my father, after the so-called Kristall night, came t -- went to a concentration camp for I think three or four weeks, there was fear in the family, yes, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: You were still home during Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s619">A: I was still home.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Oh, then let’s -- ca-can you tell us about what happened on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yes, I can tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s622">On the night itself we stayed at home, there was nothing, but in the morning my father thought he had to go out and see what happened to his business, and while he was out, the secret police came to get him.</span> <span id="s623">And my father wasn’t home, so my mother said he wasn’t home, and the man asked, I believe quite politely, whether there was anybody else in the house.</span> <span id="s624">And she said, “Just an old sewing woman.”</span> <span id="s625">Which was the truth, there was an old lady who did our sewing.</span> <span id="s626">She did not say that her brother was also in the -- in the -- in the apartment, who came from Breslau, from another city.</span> <span id="s627">So the man went away, and said my father had to report to the police station when he comes back.</span> <span id="s628">I don’t know when and where my uncle left the house, but I do know that my father came back, and he said, “Oh, they said I should come to the police station, so I’m going.”</span> <span id="s629">My mother said, “Don’t go.”</span> <span id="s630">He said, “Of course I have to go.</span> <span id="s631">If I don’t go they’ll take my -- my wife and my daughters.”</span> <span id="s632">So he went.</span> <span id="s633">That’s a typical German man for you, who observes the law of the land.</span> <span id="s634">He was taken -- I remember also he was allowed to make a phone call to us, to my mother, and saying he was now going away.</span> <span id="s635">He went to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s636">Not one of your extermination camps, but a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: I-If you could go back, and you said nothing happened the night a -- but did you know something was going on on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s638">How did you know it?</span> <span id="s639">If you could tell us a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Must have been something over the radio.</span> <span id="s641">Q: Did you see anything outside your window?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: No, I don’t think I was allowed to go outside.</span> <span id="s643">I do remember to my shame, that afterwards, a day after or so, I was told to go out to do some shopping or other, and my mother asked me to bring her some -- some -- something to calm her nerves, in the drugstore.</span> <span id="s644">I’d forgotten that.</span> <span id="s645">And haven’t -- haven’t ever forgotten that I’ve forgotten it.</span> <span id="s646">And she needed it badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: And when you did go out, did you see anything unusual?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes, I saw the -- the men in uniform, standing outside Jewish shops, and preventing people to go in.</span> <span id="s649">I believe I remember that, it might be that I saw pictures of it, but I do believe I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And tell us what happened with your father’s shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I don’t know, it was never -- i-i-it was smashed.</span> <span id="s652">I remember being there again, and they didn’t talk about it in front of me.</span> <span id="s653">I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s654">But he never went there again, afterwards it was gone.</span> <span id="s655">I don’t know whether it’s one of the employees took over, I can’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: So, what you understood was one day he had a shop, and he -- he went -- he went every day, and then one day that was it, he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No.</span> <span id="s658">And then for four weeks he was gone, and I can’t remember what wo -- what it was like when he came back.</span> <span id="s659">From that point on, they tried very hard for -- to immigrate, and as that was very hard, at least try to get me to England on a children’s transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: What were those four weeks like without your father at home?</span> <span id="s661">What did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Well, my mother was nervous, and I didn’t bring her any-anything to calm her nerves, but I’m sure afterwards she did it.</span> <span id="s663">Don’t remember that, whether she try -- if she went to the police, and -- station and tried -- tried any -- I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: And -- but your sister was around?</span> <span id="s665">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Was your sister there?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: My sister was there.</span> <span id="s668">My sister went to England in February, so that was all at that time being organized to get things --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So tell us about your father coming home.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Well, most men who came home had a shaven head, but as my father didn’t have any hair on his head anyway, so he didn’t look very different.</span> <span id="s671">I don’t think he -- yes, he did talk about it.</span> <span id="s672">He said it was very, very hard for many people because they were beaten.</span> <span id="s673">But if you were put in a line, and were told to keep still, and somebody hit you from the back on your head, and you turned round, that was almost fatal.</span> <span id="s674">There were two kinds of people who managed better than others.</span> <span id="s675">One were the wa -- the soldiers in the first World War, the others were the Communists.</span> <span id="s676">The Communists at least had an ideal, and knew what it was -- for what they were put into prison, or concentration camp.</span> <span id="s677">And the s-soldiers, former soldiers knew what discipline was, so they didn’t turn around.</span> <span id="s678">So he wasn’t treated as badly as some.</span> <span id="s679">Bad enough I’m sure [indecipherable] and the fear was very great.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Did you feel that he would come home?</span> <span id="s681">I mean, what was the feeling those four weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Looking back I think I always knew he would coming ba -- one didn’t know about these terminal concentration camps.</span> <span id="s683">They didn’t exist at the time.</span> <span id="s684">So we always hoped and thought he’ll be coming home.</span> <span id="s685">Or maybe I was just a child, and felt things will turn out all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Well, if your father wasn’t working, then how did your mother provide for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s688">That’s a mystery, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s689">I’m sure there were a great many savings, I don’t know what happened in that time.</span> <span id="s690">Whether other people helped, or the Jewish community as such helped.</span> <span id="s691">I can’t tell, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: And you say after he was in concentration camp, then they tried to emigrate, what was -- where were they trying to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Anywhere.</span> <span id="s694">To England if possible.</span> <span id="s695">To the United States.</span> <span id="s696">Later on also to south ameri -- atose -- South America, yes.</span> <span id="s697">I remember a letter, very late in the day, when we were already in England, they even considered Shanghai because that was the only place in the world where you could go where there was -- without a visa.</span> <span id="s698">That’s to say there was no system of closing the door.</span> <span id="s699">But the sister of my mother went there, and it was very hard life in -- in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s700">And she wrote back, “You better stay where you are.</span> <span id="s701">It couldn’t be worse in a concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s702">To her everlasting shame.</span> <span id="s703">But even so, I’m not quite sure whether my parents would have brot -- came up with the courage.</span> <span id="s704">I remember reading somewhere it would have been so far away from you, or it would have been so far.</span> <span id="s705">I mean, people in Shanghai survived.</span> <span id="s706">They’re all living today in the United States, if they haven’t died a natural death.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: When you say they tried to emigrate, what did that mean?</span> <span id="s708">Did they spend the day going to embassies, or what did they [indecipherable] that mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: A -- no, my fa -- my father had a brother who already immigrated to Holland, so I remember him traveling to Holland to try to get into Holland.</span> <span id="s710">I think he rather enjoyed the trip.</span> <span id="s711">As a -- was not much to it.</span> <span id="s712">But, I mean, it was a serious undertaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Subsequently his brother and his wife were also deported and murdered.</span> <span id="s714">His two ch -- do -- their two daughters survived, they are living today in the United States.</span> <span id="s715">I think they survived in hiding, they were baptized, which was later revoked, and they could tell a very good story, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: The one lives in Florida, and the other in New York City.</span> <span id="s718">Q: And what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Mariana Greenbloom, and Hannah -- she reverted to her maiden name, Saxe.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s721">So when your father traveled to Holland, di -- was there ever any consideration that he just perhaps might stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Nothing illegal ever entered into my parents mind.</span> <span id="s723">I mean, there wouldn’t be -- no sin attached to it, whatsoever, but I don’t think it ever entered into their mind.</span> <span id="s724">I have friends who went over the border illegally.</span> <span id="s725">But Holland wouldn’t have been a solution at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So at that point when they were trying so hard to emigrate, what were they saying about the future?</span> <span id="s727">Wh-What were they saying to you about why they were trying so hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Well, at that point, we -- everybody knew why they have to immigrate.</span> <span id="s729">My sister went to England a few months before I did.</span> <span id="s730">I think she went in February, I went in -- in March.</span> <span id="s731">She was beyond the age of kindertransport, she went as a housemaid, she had a permit as a housemaid.</span> <span id="s732">Now, my parents tried very much to go and g-get into England as a married couple.</span> <span id="s733">He -- he couldn’t drive, but as a gardener, and as a cook, or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">My father had a course in -- came up yesterday -- in pedicule.</span> <span id="s735">Oh, and I have letters when he -- they tried to learn English, and they had courses to learn Spanish, and my mother had a course in learning to sew underwear.</span> <span id="s736">So they were preparing for immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And when do you first remember hearing about you possibly going o -- to England by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: My school closed down Christmas when there was a [indecipherable] vacation, Christmas, ’38, and from then on it was -- tried very hard to get, generally, children out, and even if it was an opportunity open still.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Your school closed permanently then?</span> <span id="s740">You said your school closed, did it close -- A: It -- i-it -- it was closed, yes, permanently.</span> <span id="s741">It wa -- finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: How was it closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: By decree.</span> <span id="s744">Strangely enough that school, a very tiny building, was next to the house of Himmler, and that he allowed those Jewish children to make a noise in the interval, and play around, and his two blonde children looking over the wall and watching us, it’s one of the amazing things, and I think he was too busy really, doing hart -- harm, to -- to bother about that.</span> <span id="s745">But in -- in December we couldn’t go back to school any more, that was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Do you remember saying good-bye to the teacher that you liked so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: I met her again in New York later on.</span> <span id="s748">No, I don’t remember saying good-bye to her, I don’t remember seeing her.</span> <span id="s749">But I think she was behind the organization to get the children out at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: What did your parents tell you as they started to talk about you possibly going to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: It was generally understood that immigration has to be done, and there was a saying, what a good job when we have the children out, I mean to save the children.</span> <span id="s752">I might add that from the moment when the school closed, till I actually could immigrate, three months, I went to a household school, I was supposed to la -- do I -- do -- do something, not to let the children just hang around and not doing anything, and being [inaudible].</span> <span id="s753">So I learned how to sweep and dust.</span> <span id="s754">Not very successfully, but that -- that -- some were allowed to cook, but I don’t think I ever graduated to cooking.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: So how -- you say your parents were taking classes, how was your mother preparing you to possibly leave?</span> <span id="s756">What was -- what else was going on?</span> <span id="s757">Was she teaching you anything, or buying, or making clothes for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: She was making clothes for me, and preparing all the things I had to take along.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And what was -- what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Just clothes, and I don’t think there was anything special.</span> <span id="s761">Life was much simpler in those days.</span> <span id="s762">What I did take along were photographs.</span> <span id="s763">I have photographs of my mother as a young girl, and from there on.</span> <span id="s764">And apparently my sister took all the correspondence and all, because it’s with me.</span> <span id="s765">And it was saved, it’s in our hands.</span> <span id="s766">That -- that she put into the - - that was given to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: What did you think about going?</span> <span id="s768">I mean, what -- how did you imagine it might be?</span> <span id="s769">What -- did it seem like an adventure to you, or something you didn’t want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: At one poi -- point during the trip, it was an adventure, we went by ship.</span> <span id="s771">But beforehand I don’t remember what I really thought about it.</span> <span id="s772">I thought it was a necessity.</span> <span id="s773">I was homesick, even then, before I left home.</span> <span id="s774">But that’s -- can’t remember any more reaction to it.</span> <span id="s775">Everybody was preparing to go, so it was nothing special that was just for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Do you remember your mother helping you pack, packing you the few nights before?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I don’t think it was a question of helping me, I’m sure she packed.</span> <span id="s778">And there were lists made of everything that was in there -- in the [inaudible].</span> <span id="s779">You were only allowed -- oh yes, so nothing variable left.</span> <span id="s780">I mean, you couldn’t take any money with you.</span> <span id="s781">I left with 10 marks in my purse.</span> <span id="s782">And with two knives and two forks, and two spoons, silver cutlery.</span> <span id="s783">I think my sister took more, because she was more marriageable age, and her relatives gave her -- her father’s brothers gave the money to -- I don’t know, her.</span> <span id="s784">Yes and no.</span> <span id="s785">I remember she had a set of coffee cups, and bed linen, and that sort of th -- that’s -- I didn’t take it on her -- s-she was more marriageable age.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: What were you supposed to do with the forks and spoons?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Well just the only valuable thing I could take out that was silver.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: No jewelry?</span> <span id="s789">Your mother didn’t send you away with any jewelry, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: No.</span> <span id="s791">I don’t think there was anything special, but it was -- some people who were brave, took it to some other place -- to Turkey, somebody left for Turkey, and he took something along, and it was la-later sent to me.</span> <span id="s792">I don’t know any more when, but it came into my possession later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: And what was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Bracelets, and a little watch, which I still have in my possession.</span> <span id="s795">Things like that, trinkets.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Was there anything special that you wanted to take?</span> <span id="s797">I don’t know what it would have been, a book, or something that was your favorite thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Probably, probably.</span> <span id="s799">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Probably, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Can you describe the night before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: No.</span> <span id="s803">No, don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s804">I remember leaving, but I don’t remember the night before.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">My father took me to the railway station.</span> <span id="s806">I always understood that my mother didn’t have the courage or the strength to take me, but I’ve read recently that only one part of the parents could take you to the railway station.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: And we were sitting in the -- in the train, and I remember it was quite a cheerful occasion, actually.</span> <span id="s809">It was a sort of adventure.</span> <span id="s810">It wasn’t cheerful at all for my parents.</span> <span id="s811">And then we left the -- the person or persons who accompanied us, because there were crowds of children, were very skillful, they made us sing.</span> <span id="s812">And then we came to Hamburg, to the port.</span> <span id="s813">And there was con -- control, and there were some women who didn’t have -- who - - who made a -- a s -- personal search, whether we had anything on our bodies.</span> <span id="s814">And I do remember that I thought if I was tickly, I would laugh now.</span> <span id="s815">I wasn’t, but it just made a grin appear on my face, I’m quite sure.</span> <span id="s816">So it wasn’t a terrib -- for us, or for me, it wasn’t a dramatic situation.</span> <span id="s817">And then we came on board ship, and as I said, the person who was respons -- or persons were responsible, they were very skillful.</span> <span id="s818">They made us sing, and we were quite cheerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Do you remember saying good-bye to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: No.</span> <span id="s821">I remember my father waving, and -- but I don’t remember that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s822">I’m sure they weren’t cheerful in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: You remember him waving, you’re in the train?</span> <span id="s824">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s826">A-And then you got to Hamburg, and you went on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: I went on the boat, I went to Southampton, but there was a stopover in France, in Avri, and we could go make a land excursion, and that was an adventure.</span> <span id="s828">I mean, I’ve never been outside Germany, and that was an adventure.</span> <span id="s829">And then the boat went on, and landed in Southampton, and from Southampton we went by train.</span> <span id="s830">And in Southampton there was a number of ladies who gave each child a box with sweets, and sandwich, and so on.</span> <span id="s831">And then we went to London, to Waterloo Station -- this is all very vivid in my remembrance.</span> <span id="s832">And we sat on wooden benches, and the name was called.</span> <span id="s833">You see, some youngsters went to -- with the kindertransport to s -- to a boarding school.</span> <span id="s834">Some went to a Quaker organization, and many went to private people who wanted to take a Jewish child in.</span> <span id="s835">And I was one of those.</span> <span id="s836">We didn’t know the people.</span> <span id="s837">There was some correspondence beforehand, but -- so the name was called, and the name of the person who would take the child in, or the school, or ever was responsible.</span> <span id="s838">And that really when life started in earnest.</span> <span id="s839">There were many children crying because they only realized at that moment they had left home and parents.</span> <span id="s840">I don’t think I was crying.</span> <span id="s841">But then my name was called, and the la -- the name of the lady who was expecting me.</span> <span id="s842">I had an aunt living in London at the time, she was at the station.</span> <span id="s843">She waved to me from afar, greeted me in some manner or other, but not very long, because people didn’t want to interfere, or be, you know.</span> <span id="s844">So Mrs. Stevenson took hold of me, and we walked away, and she drove me to her home.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Mrs. Stevenson was your guardian?</span> <span id="s846">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: What -- what was your first impression of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Oh, she was an elegant woman.</span> <span id="s849">I was lucky, she could speak some German.</span> <span id="s850">She was of Austrian extraction.</span> <span id="s851">I think she was a little bit Jewish.</span> <span id="s852">I mean, I say a little bit because she didn’t make much of it.</span> <span id="s853">But she’s been in England, I think of -- of a first generation, second generation, something like that.</span> <span id="s854">So she could speak some German.</span> <span id="s855">Because I’ve learned English at school, but there’s nothing much to -- about, about my English.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: When did it hit you that you had left your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: At that moment.</span> <span id="s858">I mean, it’s a complete stranger, and I was 15 going onto 16, but in those days one was still considered a child, and was a child.</span> <span id="s859">I was expected to go -- I expected to continue school, but when I arrived and they realized in a month or two ti -- ti -- I -- I will be 16, they said, “N-No more school for you, it’s too expensive.”</span> <span id="s860">You had to be a uniform, and whatever, no school.</span> <span id="s861">And was a -- that was a very big blow to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: What was your first day or night like in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Probably very sad, I don’t remember well.</span> <span id="s864">She was really -- I don’t know -- I can’t to this day say why they took some Jewish German child in, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s865">She was a very hard woman, extremely hard woman.</span> <span id="s866">He was a -- a nice, warm, maybe too warm man in his, I would say early 60’s.</span> <span id="s867">He was -- had been born in India, Scottish extraction, and he was a typical colonial English -- Scotchman.</span> <span id="s868">He went to England to study medicine, lived in India for many years practicing medicine in -- in -- in -- in India, and then he went to -- back to England.</span> <span id="s869">He had to practice in England.</span> <span id="s870">Was both their second marriages, and he was a widower, and she was divorced, and she was a charming, good looking woman, and I think she was as cold as ice.</span> <span id="s871">And -- which doesn’t make sense why I -- why they took a German Jewish child in, but that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Did they have other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s874">Not together.</span> <span id="s875">He had a daughter, and she had a daughter.</span> <span id="s876">Q: So when you got to the house, you weren’t the only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: No, they -- their children weren’t living there.</span> <span id="s878">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Later on in the war, her daughter came to live there, and I moved from her room, which today is perfectly clear, and normal, and right to me.</span> <span id="s880">I had a nice room, and I had to move out -- out of that room into a maid’s room, which hurt me very much, but I don’t think that would have -- should have done much difference to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: So -- so what -- what were your feelings in those first days about being there?</span> <span id="s882">A: About?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: About being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I was terribly lonely, I had ho -- was homesick.</span> <span id="s885">My sister lived in -- in London, I must have talked to her somewhere, although I didn’t meet her very soon.</span> <span id="s886">I didn’t get out there -- it wa -- it was near London, I -- where I went in Surrey, near Croidon.</span> <span id="s887">Oh well, I don’t think I had much feeling, I just was raw and traumatic -- traumatized [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: And if you weren’t going to school, what did you start doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s890">Then they decided I was going to be a children’s nurse.</span> <span id="s891">I was going to be trained as a children’s nurse, and I was put into a day nursery.</span> <span id="s892">That’s to say, day as far as the children are concerned.</span> <span id="s893">The -- the nurses, the trainees stayed there.</span> <span id="s894">And that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: You were sent to a -- like a school?</span> <span id="s896">A: No, it wasn’t a school --</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: No?</span> <span id="s898">Training.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: -- it was -- it was a day nursery, a real day nursery where the working women left their children in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Oh, a daycare center.</span> <span id="s901">A: Daycare center, yeah.</span> <span id="s902">Q: Okay, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Well, that was an extremely hard time for me.</span> <span id="s904">In the morning, the di -- the children changed their clothes.</span> <span id="s905">They had clothes that belonged to the daycare center, and they had to be washed.</span> <span id="s906">So one of my jobs at one time was to wash clothes.</span> <span id="s907">Now, there’s no harm in this, if somebody tells you how to wash clothes.</span> <span id="s908">I can only advise you never to wash clothes like that.</span> <span id="s909">I didn’t have any more skin on my fingers.</span> <span id="s910">I mean, my life has been saved, so I’m not complaining, I’m just telling you.</span> <span id="s911">In the morning my -- my fingers were all raw.</span> <span id="s912">I couldn’t hardly do this, but I had to wash washing again.</span> <span id="s913">Do the washing again.</span> <span id="s914">For some reason which is not understandable, we’re not given enough food.</span> <span id="s915">Not because there wasn’t enough food, but because, I suppose, the matron, and the sister learned at some school or other, you give so many grams of these vegetable, so many grams of that vegetable, and so many grams of meat.</span> <span id="s916">I suppose that must be the case.</span> <span id="s917">And you didn’t help yourself, you’re -- just like David Copperfield, it was put on your plate, like this.</span> <span id="s918">I was always hungry there.</span> <span id="s919">Now, the other fellow nurses -- trainees, were also hungry.</span> <span id="s920">But they went into the larder in the evening, secretly, and took whatever they needed to satisfy their hunger.</span> <span id="s921">They didn’t take me with them, but they said afterwards when it was found out, that it was me who had taken the food.</span> <span id="s922">I mean, that sort of thing I’ve never encountered in my life.</span> <span id="s923">I was taught sort of, one stuck together.</span> <span id="s924">I would have gone with them, I would have helped myself too, I was never a -- my English was as good as non- existent [indecipherable] in those days, and yes, I remember there was -- we were sleeping all together, 10 or something like that.</span> <span id="s925">And I had a drawing which I very much liked, and I took with me, my drawing teacher did that.</span> <span id="s926">And I put it with -- I put it on the wall with pins -- with -- and every morning it was found taken down.</span> <span id="s927">Now, I wouldn’t, if I live in a house where there -- a house where there’s a wall, I wouldn’t advise anybody to do this either, but I would have talked to the girl, and said don’t -- please don’t pin it up, makes hole in the wall.</span> <span id="s928">But it’s just taken down, and -- and that sort of -- those sort of things were very bad to take.</span> <span id="s929">And I had -- I remember very clearly that I had to take care of 25 children who had a rest after lunch.</span> <span id="s930">And they were supposed to close their eyes and sleep, if possible, but at least keep quiet.</span> <span id="s931">Well, under my care they didn’t keep quiet, and I didn’t know how to ke -- let them -- how to manage to keep them quiet.</span> <span id="s932">So I shouted at them, and I remember very clearly that I always said, “Shut your eyeses.”</span> <span id="s933">Which was a great success in the way of humoring them, and they thought it was very funny indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">So that was a -- and I remember more.</span> <span id="s935">I remember that every two weeks -- it could have been every week, there was no reason why half of the trainees stayed over, and the other could leave for the weekend.</span> <span id="s936">But however -- before every -- before that half which had the weekend off could leave, the whole place had to be cleaned, washed.</span> <span id="s937">Now, after awhile I realize if I just throw water over the furniture, that’ll do nicely, and get us off quickly.</span> <span id="s938">But I had thought that cleaning the place means taking off whatever dirt.</span> <span id="s939">So it took me -- I’m always -- I’ve always been slow, it took me ages to get it, and the others couldn’t leave.</span> <span id="s940">So that didn’t -- couldn’t leave until everything was finished.</span> <span id="s941">So that -- that didn’t make me much more popular either.</span> <span id="s942">On the other hand, there was a party at -- which wasn’t very far, the people, Stevenson, I lived -- I had -- they had brought me over, didn’t live very far.</span> <span id="s943">They had a party, and there was cake left over.</span> <span id="s944">And the rest of the cake was brought to me.</span> <span id="s945">I had a chauffer at that time.</span> <span id="s946">It never occurred to me, I wasn’t brought up that way, it never occurred to me when I had the cake, not to vide it -- divide it among everybody in equal parts.</span> <span id="s947">So everybody had something, but they didn’t take me into the larder with them.</span> <span id="s948">One of the things that had to be done to be a children’s nurse one day, is to knit -- to knit something for a child.</span> <span id="s949">Well, I would never finished it, because there was always some -- something wrong with it, and I have to try -- like Penelope, I always say to -- to [indecipherable] again, and start all over again.</span> <span id="s950">I would never meant -- made it.</span> <span id="s951">That war broke out in September, and the -- the children were evacuated, and the place closed down.</span> <span id="s952">So I went back to those -- to family Stevenson, and thought I was lucky, but then my hard time really started.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: How -- why?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Ho -- yes, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Well, I was a housemaid there, I lived with the family, which didn’t help at all, didn’t make it any better.</span> <span id="s957">I got a very small amount of money each week, tiny.</span> <span id="s958">Two dollars or something like that.</span> <span id="s959">And I was terribly lonely.</span> <span id="s960">Occasionally I went up to London with my sister, my relatives, and a friend, very good friend, but most of the time I was terribly lonely.</span> <span id="s961">I -- it was suggested to me -- and don’t know now whether it before I went to the child care, or afterwards, it was suggested to me that I join the Girl Scouts, and I did go there one afternoon.</span> <span id="s962">I never went back again.</span> <span id="s963">And they were so -- there were uniforms, and -- and military drill, so to speak -- maybe it wasn’t as bad as I -- I had the ex -- impression, but it reminded me too much of Nazi Germany, so I never went back, which was a big mistake, I might have made some [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s964">But nothing could make me go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Why -- I -- why didn’t you live with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Every -- well, these people made me come over.</span> <span id="s967">They -- they gave the guarantee, and whatever it took.</span> <span id="s968">So, one of the things was not to interfere, after all, they took on the responsibility.</span> <span id="s969">On the other hand, my aunt, too, they had -- they were economically not settled down yet.</span> <span id="s970">I mean, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s971">After three years, they decided a child -- a child -- I was 18 by then, had to learn something, so I -- I did go away from them.</span> <span id="s972">It was very hard, they didn’t want to let me go.</span> <span id="s973">I was a very bad maid, but I was very cheap.</span> <span id="s974">And was a hard struggle, but I did go to my aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: How -- how did they treat you?</span> <span id="s976">You mentioned that Mrs. Stevenson was cold.</span> <span id="s977">Did -- did she -- just what was it like to be in the house with her?</span> <span id="s978">How did she treat you, or -- did -- did you have conversations with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: By the time I learned to speak English, I had conversations with her, yes.</span> <span id="s980">I don’t think she had any understanding of what was going on.</span> <span id="s981">I used to write letters, that took an awful long time.</span> <span id="s982">By hand, of course, not by computer.</span> <span id="s983">And I don’t think we had much in common, but I can tell you one thing that might illustrate the coldness.</span> <span id="s984">I told you about our Christmas celebration.</span> <span id="s985">Well, in the beginning of December, or the middle of December, it was decided that the family was going away somewhere for Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">There was another maid in the house, she was also a Austrian refugee, but she didn’t live with the family, she came over as a maid.</span> <span id="s987">Everybody was going to leave the house, but the house couldn’t be left alone.</span> <span id="s988">So it was decided that I should stay.</span> <span id="s989">So I stayed all alone over Christmas in the house.</span> <span id="s990">Snow was falling, to make it a picture.</span> <span id="s991">Well, when I learned that I couldn’t leave, I couldn’t go to my sister, to my relatives, I had the first nervous breakdown crying spell in my life.</span> <span id="s992">I couldn’t stop myself.</span> <span id="s993">Afterwards, when it came to the 21st -- 24th of December, I’d calmed down, but it was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s994">So that might illustrate the coldness.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: And this is your first within a month or two of you having left your family?</span> <span id="s996">A: No, I’d left the family in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: In March, okay.</span> <span id="s998">But it is your first holiday?</span> <span id="s999">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Were you in touch with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1002">At that time, that was still ’39, there was regular correspondence.</span> <span id="s1003">No, no, in -- war broke out in -- in September.</span> <span id="s1004">But there was still some -- I could still get Red Cross messages, which I have with me, across [indecipherable] I think they went by porch -- via Portugal, and they could -- my parents could write on this -- on the other side of the -- of it, a reply.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Did you tell your mother what was going on, or what was the -- what were the contents of the letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I don’t have my letters any more, but I don’t think I described it very drastically.</span> <span id="s1007">Q: I think we’ll -- we’ll go ahead and stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: -- would like to talk a little bit about, you were in a -- a communication with your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Do you remember the first letter you got from your parents when you were living in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: No, I don’t remember the first [indecipherable] Q: Okay, or -- or any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: But, I mean, they wrote about daily life, they wrote about the birds, which -- the canary and the parakeet, and with people they met I knew.</span> <span id="s1014">They wrote about my friends who came t -- who were still in Berlin, who came to visit them.</span> <span id="s1015">And they were constantly writing about the possibility to come to England, and that these people -- the people my sister stayed with, they were very kind, and they tried to do their utmost to get permission for them to come over, and -- looking for a job as a couple who take care of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">And that was a constant worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Did you think that they might come?</span> <span id="s1018">A: Yes, we hoped the would come.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: You were out of Germany at this point, and you were perhaps maybe beginning to hear more about what was going on with Hitler.</span> <span id="s1020">What -- what was your sense of what was happening in your country, the country you had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: We were sure war would broke out, and I don’t know whether many people thought so, but it never occurred to me that Hitler, Germany could win the war in the end.</span> <span id="s1022">I mean, it was just a question of evil against good, and it was just impossible that Hitler could win the war.</span> <span id="s1023">Which wasn’t a factual statement, because it was very possible that Hitler might won the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Did you -- I mean, when you thought of your parents, you thought about them coming, did you worry about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Yes, but I don’t think I was more aware -- or fantasy didn’t reach the point to which they could come.</span> <span id="s1026">I mean, the worry wasn’t as great as it should have been, if one could have imagined things that happened, could happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Was there ever a point when you will -- that they had to move out of your house, and you realized it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: No, no, luckily they’d never had to move out the house.</span> <span id="s1029">I -- I only realized that re -- fairly recently.</span> <span id="s1030">I did think somehow, I don’t know why, that they had to move out.</span> <span id="s1031">They were deported from their own home.</span> <span id="s1032">This one of the very few, small, consolation ca -- I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: You had mentioned the letters that you would send to them through the Red Cross, I just wonder if -- if you can share a few of those now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Well, I believe I only have two left.</span> <span id="s1037">Q: That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: This one is -- well, it’s in German, of course.</span> <span id="s1039">Do you want me translate it?</span> <span id="s1040">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Ollie, which is my sister, and Inge send their mother -- their dear mother, the very best for her birthday.</span> <span id="s1042">To keep healthy is a main thing.</span> <span id="s1043">To osh -- to -- to you all, many kisses.</span> <span id="s1044">You don’t have to worry about us.</span> <span id="s1045">There were so many words you were allowed to write.</span> <span id="s1046">And my father replies on the backside.</span> <span id="s1047">That was sent on the eighth of August, and my father replied on the 25th of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: O-Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: ’41.</span> <span id="s1050">Many thanks for the wishes -- for the birthday wishes.</span> <span id="s1051">Happy about your well being.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">We are very -- we have great desire to see you again -- it’s another word there.</span> <span id="s1053">Send gradulation for Ollie for her birthday.</span> <span id="s1054">To you both, our sincerest, or dearest kisses.</span> <span id="s1055">And then it’s signed by him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: And h-how would that arrive to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1058">I remember that I had to go to a certain place, to a certain Red Cross place, but I don’t remember how it -- how it arrived at -- how it came into my hands.</span> <span id="s1059">And this one is of October ’49 -- ’41.</span> <span id="s1060">Happy Christmas to you both, and a good new year.</span> <span id="s1061">Our thoughts are always with you.</span> <span id="s1062">Let us hear from you soon.</span> <span id="s1063">Love.</span> <span id="s1064">And this is how my father answered.</span> <span id="s1065">Beloved children, return your Christmas and New Year’s wishes.</span> <span id="s1066">Be happy and stay healthy.</span> <span id="s1067">S -- congratulation to Ollie’s birthday.</span> <span id="s1068">What do -- and then there came -- come a number of names of friends, and relatives -- of friends and relatives, he asks how they’re doing.</span> <span id="s1069">Kisses, father, mother and the two birds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: What were their names, the birds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Well, the parakeet d -- was called Aquilar, and he -- I can’t help that, and the canary was called Henshu.</span> <span id="s1072">That was usual, to call a canary Henshu, as [indecipherable] name very much invented.</span> <span id="s1073">I don’t seem to have any other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Th-This was probably the only news they had of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1076">At that time, the United States was in war with Germany, but I do not remember whether there were any news with -- by -- by relatives United States.</span> <span id="s1077">It was very difficult, mail, also.</span> <span id="s1078">I mean, there was no air mail as far as I remember, and ships were in great danger to be torpedoed on the way.</span> <span id="s1079">So I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Do you know anything about what your parents life was like in -- after you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Well, I don’t know, I can only imagine.</span> <span id="s1082">They left wor -- for -- they had special permission to use the public facilities, pu -- I’m sorry, that’s the wrong expression, public transportation.</span> <span id="s1083">And they worked, and they came home.</span> <span id="s1084">In one letter my father writes that he had pneumonia, and was very, very sick, he was always a big man.</span> <span id="s1085">And he writes we wouldn’t recognize him again because he lost so much weight, and all his clothes are just not fitting him any more at all.</span> <span id="s1086">And of course I suppose at that point, I’m not sure there was rationing, and I’m quite sure there was less rationing for -- for Jews, and all this was very hard.</span> <span id="s1087">And the -- ever a constant longing for their children.</span> <span id="s1088">There was no television at that time, any case it would have been taken away from them.</span> <span id="s1089">There was not much diversion like it is today, so they’d had themselves, and they had a very few friends -- even non-Jewish friends, secretly.</span> <span id="s1090">But life was very simple, and had to depend on one’s own resources.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Do you think that they felt that you were safe and well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: There was constant preoccupation whether we were well.</span> <span id="s1093">And they did realize things weren’t going so well with me -- with us -- Mrs. Stevenson.</span> <span id="s1094">But well, they -- there was lots of preoccupation, but they hoped -- they knew I was -- we both were well, and that was a main thing for -- at least the children are safe, that was a constant saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: That was something they really wanted to accomplish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1097">Well, they didn’t accomplish it.</span> <span id="s1098">My sister died.</span> <span id="s1099">And one of my unforgivable sins was that I let them know.</span> <span id="s1100">I mean, I was pressured into it by relatives.</span> <span id="s1101">They thought parents have to know, and after the war they’ll be confronted with the fact, and this, so -- I mean, I could have avoided that, that they still had to have that sorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Well, tell us about how -- what -- what happened with your sister.</span> <span id="s1103">A: My sister died of cancer at -- at the age of 28.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: So which year was this that she -- which year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: That was in ’42.</span> <span id="s1106">And my parents were deported in ’43, so there was no necessity at all, they would learn of it.</span> <span id="s1107">I could have spared them that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: How did you tell them, you wrote to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Via the Red Cross letter.</span> <span id="s1110">I faked the letters for a long time, and that’s probably why my aunt said they have to know.</span> <span id="s1111">I think I overdone it.</span> <span id="s1112">I wrote in her name, and she was always very exuberant, and I imitated that style.</span> <span id="s1113">And I overdone that, probably, and my aunt thought to put a stop to it they should know.</span> <span id="s1114">And I let myself be influenced.</span> <span id="s1115">That was, well, my unforgivable sin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Did your sister die at home, or did she die in a hospital?</span> <span id="s1117">A: Well, she didn’t, in that sense, have a home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: She died in hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: And was she very sick for a long time?</span> <span id="s1121">A: She was very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Were you involved in taking care of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Not in taking care of her.</span> <span id="s1124">I lived with the [indecipherable] I visited her constantly -- not as constantly as I should have done, but she -- there were people who looked after her, too.</span> <span id="s1125">I can’t say that I looked after her, but I did go and see her frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: You said by that time you had quit quarreling and become very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Oh yes, by that time we were very good friends, that was -- it’s nothing that’s on my conscience in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: So what led you to feeling that you should write to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: I was influenced by my -- by my relatives.</span> <span id="s1130">I would never have done it on my own account, which is no excuse, but their argument influenced me, and so I wrote it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Did they write back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1133">I still have letters about that.</span> <span id="s1134">Oh, the following happened.</span> <span id="s1135">I have a great -- I have -- that’s why I have letters, and that’s why I don’t have letters I wrote, because I couldn’t write, but they wrote as if they write to me, but it was never sent outside Germany.</span> <span id="s1136">I had an uncle, a great-uncle who was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s1137">He married my -- the sister of my Jewish grandmother.</span> <span id="s1138">And he took care of them very well, and they were in constant contact with him.</span> <span id="s1139">And he sent the letters to me after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Your parents wrote you letters that you never got when you -- but they kept writing, and writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And then your great-uncle saved them?</span> <span id="s1143">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And where are those letters?</span> <span id="s1145">A: In Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1147">What was it like to get those?</span> <span id="s1148">How old were you when you finally got them?</span> <span id="s1149">A: Well, the war was over in ’45, he might have sent them a little later, but I was 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Was there a point when you gave up, that you thought that your parents wouldn’t be able to come?</span> <span id="s1151">I mean, as the war progressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I didn’t quite ge --</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Was there a point -- I’m going back to your parents were in Germany, and you’re in England.</span> <span id="s1154">Was there a point where you began to feel that they might not be able to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Well, after war broke out, and -- well, the first year people still went to Shanghai, and there was still some immigration.</span> <span id="s1156">I believe 1940, I can’t say when the phony war, as it was called, was over.</span> <span id="s1157">I don’t think I -- there was any more chance, when real war began, that they could get out.</span> <span id="s1158">But I’m not the only one who couldn’t imagine what would ge -- would happen.</span> <span id="s1159">I must admit that I’m -- wasn’t constantly worried about it, because it was 18, 19, there’s so much that involves one’s own life.</span> <span id="s1160">I probably didn’t see the danger in the same way as many other people didn’t see the danger.</span> <span id="s1161">I mean, I saw danger, and it wasn’t -- I could leave that all unsaid, I think.</span> <span id="s1162">No, but I couldn’t have done anything anyway.</span> <span id="s1163">But one feels one’s own pains very strongly, too, at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: What was it like for you when the war broke out, and then eventually, really, the war was felt profoundly in England?</span> <span id="s1165">Did you experience it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: No -- the outbreak of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Well, the bombing, the shift in -- you know, as the country really went actively to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yes, I remember that very clearly, all of it.</span> <span id="s1169">I remember clearly when Mr. Chamberlain on the radio declared war.</span> <span id="s1170">Dr. Stevenson, who was a colonial Englishman, or Scotchman, stood up and -- when the national anthem was played.</span> <span id="s1171">I remember that.</span> <span id="s1172">And I remember the first bombing.</span> <span id="s1173">I can’t s -- on London, that was -- s -- what you would consider a small bomb nowadays, but made a lot of noise, and frightened terribly at that time, because it was a quite new experience.</span> <span id="s1174">I was alone, this was on a Sunday morning, I was alone in the house, and I was terrified.</span> <span id="s1175">The bomb fell quite close.</span> <span id="s1176">The first thing I did, I went in the kitchen, turned off the gas.</span> <span id="s1177">I was told that.</span> <span id="s1178">And then I went to the -- I -- I h -- I have these very vivid memories, I went to the mirror, and looked into the mirror and wanted to see how a person looks who’s really terrified.</span> <span id="s1179">Well, there was lots of broken glass about, and afterwards I had to sweep it up when the people came back.</span> <span id="s1180">And that was that for the time being.</span> <span id="s1181">But it cured me.</span> <span id="s1182">I think I’m perfectly honest in saying I was never afraid again.</span> <span id="s1183">Things were quieting down, and the real bombing on London started when I was in London itself.</span> <span id="s1184">I never went to a shelter, I slept in my bed, perfectly safe and sound -- no, safe I wouldn’t say, but perfectly sound.</span> <span id="s1185">I didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s1186">I inquired the next morning how the night has passed.</span> <span id="s1187">On the other hand, I mention that always because it’s - - human nature is so strange.</span> <span id="s1188">I lived in a -- by that time in a very old house, and there were mice around, and I was terrified of mi -- I -- I am terrified of mice.</span> <span id="s1189">And they ran around in my room, and when they did this, I woke up.</span> <span id="s1190">But at that time, I realized it didn’t really matter to anybody whether I am alive or dead.</span> <span id="s1191">So that gives you a sense of safety.</span> <span id="s1192">I could never go through that again without being afraid.</span> <span id="s1193">It didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: It didn’t matter to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: To -- no, well, I wasn’t sure of my parent’s death then, but I was in a vacuum, I was alone, so I n -- never really had a responsibility there.</span> <span id="s1196">I have responsibility today, but I -- I can tell a funny story if you want to know.</span> <span id="s1197">As I was very cool, calm and collected when my uncle had to go to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1198">They called me to take care of his wife, and his two children.</span> <span id="s1199">Well, so that anybody who is cool, calm and collected would be with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Well, I went over, I slept there, and in the middle of the night the alarm sounded.</span> <span id="s1201">So my aunt got up and called me, I didn’t reply.</span> <span id="s1202">She got her children ready, because it went downstairs, and she called me again, and the third time she took off my -- the covering off my bed.</span> <span id="s1203">I didn’t move, I didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s1204">And when all the -- the all clear was sounded, she came back, put her children to bed, put the cover over me, and they told me all about it the next day.</span> <span id="s1205">That is as far as my taking care of -- of them was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Did this become a family joke?</span> <span id="s1207">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: I-It -- it -- it strikes me for -- what you were saying a few moments back of how often you were by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: When you -- how often you were alone.</span> <span id="s1211">A: I was alone [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Did you make any friends in those first couple weeks?</span> <span id="s1213">A: No, I didn’t make any friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: I didn’t make any friends.</span> <span id="s1216">I had a friend in London which I saw very seldom, but I was really very alone.</span> <span id="s1217">After I left Stevenson, because my aunt -- my relatives said, “The child has to learn something.”</span> <span id="s1218">I went to live in London, I lived first with them, and then I lived in a furnished room, where the mi -- mice ran around.</span> <span id="s1219">Then I had -- I was still very lonely, but I had a happy time.</span> <span id="s1220">I worked in a factory where they make glasses, and there’s a na -- there were another two refugees there, and we decided we want to study optics.</span> <span id="s1221">So there was a course at -- today it’s a different type of cour -- a university course, but at that time it was a course that took place on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1222">So I went to school every Sunday, and I as I don -- didn’t have any school finish -- that’s not -- school certificate, and in order to graduate in optics, I had to have a school certificate.</span> <span id="s1223">So at the same time I went three times in the -- in the evening to have -- to study for the soos -- school certificate.</span> <span id="s1224">And in the factory I got my paycheck every week, I get paid a week, and I live by myself.</span> <span id="s1225">I was still alone, but doing things which I liked, and that was really a relative happy time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Was that unusual for a young woman to live by herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s1228">I know that I had a difficulty finding the proper room, but that might have been more because of my foreign name, and hence of my Jewish -- Jewishness, because there’s also quite a lot of anti-Semitism in England -- in -- anywhere in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Did you -- you just reminded me, but did you, after you left home, after you left Germany, did you ever celebrate Jewish holidays again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1231">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Tell us what you know about what happened to your parents, and how you found out.</span> <span id="s1233">A: Only after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Through this uncle, and through the different places one went to asov -- to inquire.</span> <span id="s1236">Q: What did you piece together, what happened to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Well, there’s enough literature about what happened in Auschwitz, I didn’t have to do any piecing together.</span> <span id="s1238">I have official notification that they are considered dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: D-Do you know, though, how they were taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1241">My mother wrote, and this I have.</span> <span id="s1242">Short notice on pieces of paper that minutes before she was deported, that she’s now going on a -- on -- on the trip.</span> <span id="s1243">And she also wrote day before that her -- my beloved husband has been taken, the whole factory -- whole -- whole people people in the factory have been taken.</span> <span id="s1244">And she was left alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: Who do you think she was leaving the note for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: For this uncle, and for me.</span> <span id="s1247">Take care of the child.</span> <span id="s1248">The child was not a child any more by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Do you have that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Yes, I have that.</span> <span id="s1251">Now my father was also giving notice to -- to this uncle that he was being taken away.</span> <span id="s1252">He just managed to write the envelope, and he didn’t manage any more than put three empty pages into it.</span> <span id="s1253">That’s the last notice of him.</span> <span id="s1254">And this here above is written by the uncle, and this is practically the last -- this is the last but one notice she wrote.</span> <span id="s1255">Do you want me to read it to you?</span> <span id="s1256">My dears -- this is not meant for me, this is meant for those relatives.</span> <span id="s1257">Please send the Red Cross formula to -- to our dear friend, send it back.</span> <span id="s1258">But I don’t know what she really refers to -- that will be sent from here.</span> <span id="s1259">But be very careful what you would write -- whatever you would wri -- will write.</span> <span id="s1260">This letter will be sent only if we are, with God’s help -- I get a bit emotional [indecipherable] together again.</span> <span id="s1261">That was it -- if we -- this letter will only be sent if with God’s help, we’ll be traveling together -- if we have to travel together.</span> <span id="s1262">Farewell, stay healthy, and we hope -- we hope all ch -- we hope that also.</span> <span id="s1263">Think of us -- no, think with us, of our beloved child.</span> <span id="s1264">Love, Grete and Alfred.</span> <span id="s1265">But this isn’t the last one, they didn’t go away together, my father was fetched two days earlier.</span> <span id="s1266">Now, there is one letter from a friend -- from a non-Jewish friend who take -- took care of them in Berlin, obviously, and they made out that if mother and father would meet again, they would send a postcard one way or the other.</span> <span id="s1267">And this friend writes that she did receive the postcard.</span> <span id="s1268">So I am to think that they got together again in Breslau.</span> <span id="s1269">I have never believed it, but I hope it is the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Did anyone ever see them at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: No.</span> <span id="s1272">I don’t know how long they stayed there.</span> <span id="s1273">The end might have come very quickly, that’s -- was told that.</span> <span id="s1274">And this, on the first of March, my father was taken on the 27th of February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: ’43.</span> <span id="s1277">My very dears -- this is agains to -- to the relatives, not to me.</span> <span id="s1278">I’m still waiting that one will take me to my beloved Alfred.</span> <span id="s1279">He als -- he -- he -- he needs, after all, his things, his clothes, and I believe he also needs me.</span> <span id="s1280">What -- how much he -- he’ll be worried.</span> <span id="s1281">The hours become very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1282">The arranged registered letter you will get only when I am out of the house, so that you will know -- so that you will know I have arranged it that way.</span> <span id="s1283">Independently from that, I’ll send you today, again, a small amount of money.</span> <span id="s1284">This is -- it is enough if I have a little with me, and in the end it will be all for our child.</span> <span id="s1285">Oh, it will be the -- to -- to the good of our child.</span> <span id="s1286">Somehow, with God’s help, shall we -- shall we get in contact with you again.</span> <span id="s1287">To the list which you got from Mrs. B -- it’s -- it’s almost incredible, these are people condemned to death -- in the list which you will receive from Mrs. B, is now also -- i-is edit, one electric watch, one red -- something with a -- something red with -- with -- some other things, and small things.</span> <span id="s1288">A broom, a little icebox, and a bowl -- and a bowl, a glass bowl.</span> <span id="s1289">The English boo -- books, one dress, one cap.</span> <span id="s1290">Please do not write to our friend any questions.</span> <span id="s1291">Please -- don’t -- don’t let her answer back.</span> <span id="s1292">It could be -- it could be understood wrongly, and the results would be disastrous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Well, my dears, for the time being, keep well.</span> <span id="s1294">Keep -- we -- we wish that for us, too.</span> <span id="s1295">Most lovable greetings from your Grete.</span> <span id="s1296">The icebox, and the broom are meant as a present.</span> <span id="s1297">If we come back, we don’t need it, and if we don’t, it should be a remembrance for our friend.</span> <span id="s1298">Can’t believe that, can you?</span> <span id="s1299">Now these are the two notes which my mother, I think, wrote literally minutes before being deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: She is very conscious of documenting what was going --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Well, this is typical German.</span> <span id="s1302">There never existed a more typical German citizen than the German Jews.</span> <span id="s1303">This is for my uncle.</span> <span id="s1304">Go on the trip today.</span> <span id="s1305">We are always -- our thoughts are always with you.</span> <span id="s1306">Take care of our child.</span> <span id="s1307">We -- we hope of our to see you again.</span> <span id="s1308">Stay well.</span> <span id="s1309">With very much love, yours everything, Grete.</span> <span id="s1310">I’m trying to translate it -- and this is for me, this all has been sent to me after the war.</span> <span id="s1311">I’m just thinking of the English word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Thinking -- s -- always with great sorrow, and in be -- with big love to you, and to all who are good to you.</span> <span id="s1313">We travel today.</span> <span id="s1314">Stay well.</span> <span id="s1315">Good-bye.</span> <span id="s1316">I hadn’t looked at those papers for years.</span> <span id="s1317">I think my guardian angel prevented me to looking at it in my happiest, and my unhappiest time.</span> <span id="s1318">I had it in my hands again last November.</span> <span id="s1319">It fell on me like a bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Where had they been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Always close to me.</span> <span id="s1322">They were -- they were in my house.</span> <span id="s1323">I immigrated with them from England to the United States, and from the United States to Brazil, and they’ve always been with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: I mean, you say you don’t know exactly what happened to your parents, but in some way you do, you know what your mother was thinking those last --</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: -- few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: And what physically happened to them, there’s enough literature about it, too.</span> <span id="s1328">Q: Where were you when you got those?</span> <span id="s1329">Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: When you originally got those.</span> <span id="s1332">When your uncle gave them to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Oh, he send that to England.</span> <span id="s1334">It was between ’45, and ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: After the war -- when the war was over and you could begin to make contact, di -- di -- did you go back to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: So how -- how long was it before you knew that your parents had been deported and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Oh no, I knew that soon after the war, like everybody knew, everybody searched for [indecipherable], I had -- but there was no need for me personally to be in Germany to find that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Did you ever see your uncle again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: No.</span> <span id="s1343">I didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s1344">I didn’t know him personally.</span> <span id="s1345">He send photos, and I knew him through my parents, I knew him through photos.</span> <span id="s1346">I didn’t -- I’ve never met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: She obviously had great faith in him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Yes, but that developed with time, because he was such a -- he -- he was really a -- I mean, he always knew that he existed, but there was no close relationship.</span> <span id="s1349">But that developed during the war, and he was so good to them, and far and above what was safe to him -- for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s1351">A: Karl Heinrich Meyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: And di -- does he have children that live in Germany?</span> <span id="s1353">A: He had a daughter, yes, and the daughter had one child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: You say that it was -- very quickly that there was no need to know what happened to people who had been deported.</span> <span id="s1355">Ca -- can you talk a little bit about your first awareness of what happened in the concentration camps?</span> <span id="s1356">Did you see it on a newsreel, or read about it?</span> <span id="s1357">What -- what -- as you began to know what had really happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I don’t remember how I reacted or -- or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Well, do you remember just what was that like, as that information began to become known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: I very soon lost hope.</span> <span id="s1361">There were people who were searching years and years.</span> <span id="s1362">I very soon believed what I read, and what I saw.</span> <span id="s1363">And if they had been alive, they would have found ways to get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s1364">That doesn’t mean that I didn’t search, or -- we searched together, people who were involved.</span> <span id="s1365">But I didn’t have much hope, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Searching entailed looking through the lists of names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Yes, and writing to the authorities who were doing these things.</span> <span id="s1368">I mean, we had written, photocopied news that they were declared dead.</span> <span id="s1369">And I took their word for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Just tell us a little bit about what made you begin to think about leaving England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Well, after I became a optician, I had a very nice job -- I left the factory, I had a very nice job, and I had more time, but I didn’t have any more social life.</span> <span id="s1372">I continued being very lonely.</span> <span id="s1373">Not totally, but empty.</span> <span id="s1374">And I had a cousin in the United States with who I corresponded, and he su -- put the idea into my head, and then -- he had relatives who give an affidavit, and I thought, it doesn’t matter really, where I live, so I might just as well try something new.</span> <span id="s1375">I was just as lonely in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: At that point did you still have contact with your original guardians, the Stevensons?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: I did for a long -- yes, I -- I even wrote them from the us -- United States.</span> <span id="s1378">I visited them, and I said good-bye to them, and I even wrote to them from the United States, but they weren’t very much more interested in me.</span> <span id="s1379">I don’t know what became of them.</span> <span id="s1380">They can’t be alive any more now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: I mean, that’s surprising, because they -- that you didn’t have a very easy time with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Yes, that’s surprising, I’m surprised about my -- about it myself, yes.</span> <span id="s1383">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1384">He was a warmer -- at times almost too warmer, party.</span> <span id="s1385">And he did send me Christmas greeting, and put a 10 pound note or whatever it was into the envelope, saying I should not thank him for it, I should not mention it.</span> <span id="s1386">This just to illustrate what sort of people they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: You’ve said twice now that he was too warmer.</span> <span id="s1388">Did he ever make you uncomfortable as a young girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: He made me uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1390">Not seriously, but he did make me uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1391">Q: He -- he was inappropriate sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Because I had read that that had been a situation that some of the young girls had encountered as they came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1397">No, it was nothing -- I just giggled it away.</span> <span id="s1398">But that was a fact.</span> <span id="s1399">But I’m alive today, and it didn’t really hurt me, and I wasn’t -- I don’t think anything serio -- serious harm would have come to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: But can I ask exactly what he did?</span> <span id="s1401">What -- I mean, did he try to -- A: Well, he touch --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: -- have a relationship with you as a young girl?</span> <span id="s1403">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1404">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: I mean, he touched me in inappropriate places, but not that seriously either.</span> <span id="s1407">Q: Did you tell anyone about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: No, I just giggled it away, and I didn’t sit on his lap any more.</span> <span id="s1409">I mean, he was a father figure, so -- not that I was that naïve, but naïve enough to sit on his knees because he was a father figure really, and I realized there’s nothing so terribly fatherly about it.</span> <span id="s1410">But nothing really serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Y-You said a couple times about how -- how lonely you were, what -- what -- what did make you feel less lonely?</span> <span id="s1412">Was there anything, was it -- were there some people, or animals, or reading, or -- was there anything that you were able to find to sort of fill yourself up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: You mean what I did with my lonely time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Yeah, or -- yeah, I guess your lonely time, or what -- what was -- A: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: -- pleasing to you in that time when you were alone so much?</span> <span id="s1416">A: What was pleasing to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Well, I always read.</span> <span id="s1419">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: And three years, almost four years, I studied very intensively.</span> <span id="s1421">I went to the -- there wasn’t much time to -- I had no vacant time.</span> <span id="s1422">That’s to say I always knew what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s1423">During that time in London, I went to -- went to the factory in the morning, I did my shopping with my ration coupons during lunchtime, I had something to eat.</span> <span id="s1424">I came home to my room, to my furnished room, might have been five or six.</span> <span id="s1425">And I made myself something to eat on a little stove, that size.</span> <span id="s1426">Put a shilling in till the gas came out.</span> <span id="s1427">And -- and I studied, and then I went three times in the evening -- three times a week in the evening I went to school, and I went to school on Sunday, so there wasn’t much time to throw away, or not to [indecipherable] but I was just -- didn’t have any close relationship with anybody.</span> <span id="s1428">Not on a regular basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: And tell us a little bit about going to the United States.</span> <span id="s1430">Were -- were you excited?</span> <span id="s1431">A: Did I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Tell us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: -- a little bit about the United States, that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Well, I arrived on board of the Queen Elizabeth, and there were many people on board of the Queen Elizabeth, and just for the comic relief, I stood in line, in big, huge lines, for the -- for the immigration ceremony.</span> <span id="s1436">And the lady in front of me turned round, and said -- cause there’s so many people on the Queen Elizabeth, “Last time I saw you, we were both bending over a basin, and you said, “Life isn’t worth living.</span> <span id="s1437">”” You were so seasick.</span> <span id="s1438">Then I arrived, friends came to meet me aboard ship.</span> <span id="s1439">I don’t know whether it was the same day, or the next day, they took me to a concert played by Jaffa Heifetz.</span> <span id="s1440">That was very nice.</span> <span id="s1441">And then I lived -- I lived in several places, but I spent this very small apartment in Greenwich Village was lent to me by this friend, and I lived there.</span> <span id="s1442">And on weekda -- on weekends I went to New Jersey, and -- to spend time with them.</span> <span id="s1443">But it was still lonely.</span> <span id="s1444">I could go -- I eventually found a job at a doctor’s office, which wasn’t easy, although everybody I went to see said with your qualifications and your experience, it should be very easy to find a job, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1445">But I did find a job in the end, in a doctor’s office, in a eye doctor’s office [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1446">But if I went to work and came home, and then didn’t -- it didn’t occ -- I -- I died, and nobody was the wiser for it until after four dee -- days, it couldn’t be hidden any more.</span> <span id="s1447">I think that would be a def -- a defin -- a definition to say that I was lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: When did that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: When I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1450">I did have a boyfriend, so to speak, and he took me to a friend’s one evening for dinner.</span> <span id="s1451">And the boyfriend disappeared.</span> <span id="s1452">But the people who had invited me for supper, called me one day.</span> <span id="s1453">Now, I’m going to tell this story somewhat shorter.</span> <span id="s1454">My husband had come to Brazil in ’39, and he opened his farm, and then he came for a year to the United States in ’47, ’48, and that’s where we met.</span> <span id="s1455">And then he asked me for a date, and that was the beginning of the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: What is your -- what was your husband’s name?</span> <span id="s1457">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: Your husband’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Hans --Hans -- Hans Rosenthal.</span> <span id="s1460">Q: Okay, we’ll stop now, for supper.</span> <span id="s1461">End of Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Tell us ho -- why your husband went to Brazil originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Oh yes, he is a Jew, or he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1465">So -- it’s a very long story, maybe.</span> <span id="s1466">There was -- he went to a training farm in Germany, and they wanted to immigrate together.</span> <span id="s1467">They were non-Zionists, they wanted to immigrate together.</span> <span id="s1468">The other part of the story is that his brother, his older brother immigrated years before to Brazil.</span> <span id="s1469">I don’t know why Brazil and no other country, because he was engaged to a non-Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1470">And they had to leave the country very fast.</span> <span id="s1471">She went first to France, and then later on to Brazil, and he went to Brazil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: And so where did you get married?</span> <span id="s1473">A: In New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1475">And then he suggested that you move to Brazil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: No, he didn’t suggest that I move to Brazil, and especially not after we got married.</span> <span id="s1477">That was part of the plan.</span> <span id="s1478">I mean, he told me all about what I have to expect in Brazil, and I thought I would like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: So here you are again, going off on another -- you know, to another country you’ve never been to, and a language that you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: Oh yes, I like traveling, but that’s another story.</span> <span id="s1481">I am at home at last in Brazil, on my farm.</span> <span id="s1482">And I’m not any more lonely.</span> <span id="s1483">I live by myself, alone, but I’m not lonely.</span> <span id="s1484">Can you see the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: When did you know you were home?</span> <span id="s1486">How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Within 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1488">It’s hardly not believable except that’s a fact.</span> <span id="s1489">I knew exactly, my husband, or my then to be husband explained everything there is, was very primitive.</span> <span id="s1490">There’s lots of virgin forest still there, which was already opened a path, and there was some coffee on it, and there was a house, a very small house.</span> <span id="s1491">But we didn’t have any electricity, we didn’t have any running water, we didn’t have a car, we had a two wheel carriage with a horse, or we went horseback riding.</span> <span id="s1492">A little later my s -- s -- brother-in- law gave us a radio as a -- a wedding present.</span> <span id="s1493">We did have -- we have kerosene lamps, and a kerosene icebox.</span> <span id="s1494">It was really very, very primitive.</span> <span id="s1495">I didn’t mi -- on the first day or two I searched on the wall for the -- put the light on.</span> <span id="s1496">But as I knew exactly what to expect, and the people I was going to meet -- and he explained everything to me, I was never for a moment feeling strange, except once, when the radio arrive as a wedding present.</span> <span id="s1497">If we put the radio on, and I her -- heard the sounds from all four corners of the world, I felt I am really deep in the woods, but that passed very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: And you had children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yes, after we got married in ’49, I had my first child in ’51.</span> <span id="s1500">That was two and a half years afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: You had four children?</span> <span id="s1502">A: I had four children, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: And I’m curious, did you raise them in a religious way at all, celebrating the Jewish faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Well, yes, we tried in our very primitive way, we tried.</span> <span id="s1505">They were always told that there were Jews, and what happened to their grandparents.</span> <span id="s1506">And they were always informed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: S-So the story of what happened to your parents, that wasn’t something you made a secret, or just didn’t discuss?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Oh no, on the contrary, on the contrary.</span> <span id="s1509">It was always talked about.</span> <span id="s1510">Oh, they even had religious instructions.</span> <span id="s1511">Our neighbor, she -- we asked her to give [indecipherable] religious instruction, well, like a -- like you would have at school.</span> <span id="s1512">They learned a little bit of Hebrew, and Bible history and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: You mentioned once earlier going back to Berlin, I’d just like to ask a little bit more about that.</span> <span id="s1514">Did you go to your street, the street where your house was -- your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1516">That was very strange, my daughter -- my eldest daughter, who lived in Germany at the while, I told her at the time, she should go and see where her mother had lived.</span> <span id="s1517">And she said, “Well, it looks very shabby and run down, but it’s there.”</span> <span id="s1518">And years later when I went to Germany, I saw her in Munich, she said, “Do go and see it.”</span> <span id="s1519">So I went there.</span> <span id="s1520">As I said, I knew everything, but I didn’t really recognize it.</span> <span id="s1521">Well, the house where I lived was just a construction place.</span> <span id="s1522">There was -- everything was gone.</span> <span id="s1523">The apartment where we lived was just one blank wall.</span> <span id="s1524">I took a photo of that, and months later I realized the photographer had eliminated that.</span> <span id="s1525">He didn’t -- he didn’t realize that I wanted to take a photo of the blank wall.</span> <span id="s1526">It was all gone, and I never had that photo.</span> <span id="s1527">But there’s nothing left of it.</span> <span id="s1528">But that in itself doesn’t affect me emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: I wanted to ask a little bit more about Olga, actually.</span> <span id="s1530">Can you just tell us a little bit about what it was like a-as she got sick?</span> <span id="s1531">Where would you visit her, or would you -- would you spend time with her?</span> <span id="s1532">What was sh -- what were the kinds of things she was thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Well, she was always a very lively girl.</span> <span id="s1534">I think in fact as a child, she had a certain nervous condition which made her overactive.</span> <span id="s1535">And then -- you want to know about it.</span> <span id="s1536">Well, I didn’t observe it at close range, because we lived apart.</span> <span id="s1537">Not -- not really very apart, but we didn’t see one another.</span> <span id="s1538">I remember her vividly in the hospital, being very sick.</span> <span id="s1539">But I can’t say very much about the beginning of the sickness.</span> <span id="s1540">She was always very thin, and I can’t say more about that, I don’t -- don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Did she want you to not tell your parents, or to tell your parents?</span> <span id="s1542">A: That didn’t come up, I don’t think that came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: And she was 28, how long did she live with the cancer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Well, one doesn’t really know when it started, and she just didn’t feel well.</span> <span id="s1545">I don’t think in the final stage it took very long, but long enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Before she did get sick, though, were you and Olga able to do some things together?</span> <span id="s1547">I mean, did it feel like your sister was living, you know, nearby, and that you would -- you would do things with her on, you know, some days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Do things together with her?</span> <span id="s1549">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: No.</span> <span id="s1551">I mean, build up a life together, live together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: I -- I guess that’s what I mean, maybe if you’re not even living in the same apartment, but that you were relying on each other as sisters, again.</span> <span id="s1553">Or was it because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: No, I was still living -- Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: -- with the Stevenson then, and I was sort of tied down to them.</span> <span id="s1556">I think at that point she didn’t -- she wasn’t a maid any more, she worked in a factory, sewing uniforms.</span> <span id="s1557">And she also lived in furnished rooms.</span> <span id="s1558">She may have even lived with a friend, but I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: But did she -- she ever get married?</span> <span id="s1560">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: Did she ever get married?</span> <span id="s1562">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: She didn’t, okay.</span> <span id="s1564">Well, I think that’s what I wanted to ask about, but I wonder if there are some things that I haven’t asked you, that you would like to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Well, as this is a -- on the whole -- I -- I -- I’m a very happy person, and when life lets me, I’m happy.</span> <span id="s1566">So this seems to be a terribly sad story, but as I said, I was home when I came to the farm.</span> <span id="s1567">But -- I mean, it sort of -- well, I don’t think it’s out of proportion, but it needs to be said that my husband died in ’73, and my eldest daughter died in ’48 -- ’84. ’</span> <span id="s1568">84.</span> <span id="s1569">So you asked me, I said I had four children, just to round the picture up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Well, I think that it would be good to show some of the photographs.</span> <span id="s1571">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Think that they’ll adjust --</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: See that far, so I can’t say -- it’s written on the back who is who, so I wouldn’t -- can’t say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Well, you could say just a general thing, when they’re ready.</span> <span id="s1575">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1576">Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: We’re ready now.</span> <span id="s1578">Who is this?</span> <span id="s1579">Is this your father’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: That’s my father’s siblings.</span> <span id="s1581">Only the girl in the middle survived, the others were murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: And this picture, who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: This is my father as a soldier in the first World War.</span> <span id="s1584">Q: And what is this building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: This is the house -- the apartment where I was born, lived all my life, and where I emigrated from, and also where my parents continued to live, and were deported from, from that apartment they were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Do you remember the address?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1588">Fluta styshash examfofemsee.</span> <span id="s1589">I even know the telephone number.</span> <span id="s1590">Q: And what is this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: This is one of my birthday parties.</span> <span id="s1592">I’m at the extreme right, and the girl with the tilted head was a friend and a f -- far relative.</span> <span id="s1593">She had a non-Jewish father, and a Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s1594">They immigrated to Holland and survived.</span> <span id="s1595">She managed to study medicine.</span> <span id="s1596">She later emigrated to Canada, but I think she had a unhappy love affair and committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: And the picture on top?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yes, both pictures are more or less in the same place, i-in the kitchen of my -- of our apartment, and there are two birds, a canary, and a parakeet.</span> <span id="s1599">And one of the letters I still received from my parents, or were given to me after the war, said that now, also, the birds have been taken away from them.</span> <span id="s1600">Not only the gramophone, and the telephone, and whatever, even the birds have been taken away from us, and so the last thing that could give us a little bit of happiness in life, has also been taken away from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Now this is a copy of what photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: That’s a family reunion -- well, just a family gathering, because my pa -- grandparents were in Berlin, it’s in our apartment, and I might say from the upper row, from left to right.</span> <span id="s1603">This is a great aunt from -- from me, she was murdered in Lódz.</span> <span id="s1604">The next one is also a great aunt, she was also murdered.</span> <span id="s1605">Then comes her husband, who was also murdered, and her two cousins, two daughters of the lady at the extreme left.</span> <span id="s1606">They immigrated to England.</span> <span id="s1607">One was a dentist, and other a social worker, but they both worked in factories in England.</span> <span id="s1608">Then comes my aunt, who lived -- who immigrated to England.</span> <span id="s1609">My sister, almost hidden behind my sister, my aunt’s husband, the one who lived in England.</span> <span id="s1610">At the extreme right at the bottom is my father.</span> <span id="s1611">And then comes my -- going now from right to left, my grandfather, my grandmother, and my mo -- my -- my grandmother who -- my father, who was murdered in Auschwitz, my grandfather, who was lucky enough to die in ’32.</span> <span id="s1612">My grandmother, who together with her sister, was murdered in Lódz, and my mother, who was murdered in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1613">That’s, I think a collection of 12 people, and 50 percent were murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: And this photograph here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: The photograph is a grave, and the gravestone of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1616">It says there, I believe the date of birth and death, and the name Hammond Copaulna.</span> <span id="s1617">And below is the -- are the names of his two sons who died in the wa -- in the first World War.</span> <span id="s1618">Below is a photocopy of the register they have at that cemetery.</span> <span id="s1619">And it says the field and the number of my grandfather’s pla -- grave.</span> <span id="s1620">Below it is the place next to it, which was reserved for my grandfather -- for my grandmother, and it’s empty, and it will always be empty, because she hasn’t got a grave, she was murdered in -- in Lódz, in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: And this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: That’s my sister’s grave, who died in ’42.</span> <span id="s1623">And I put up a plaque in memory of our parents Alfred and Grete Saxe because I always felt very strongly about the fact that there’s no grave for my parents.</span> <span id="s1624">So this just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Is this in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: That’s in London, yes.</span> <span id="s1627">Q: This photo here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: This is my sister.</span> <span id="s1629">I think it must be the year 1940, because I do think she sent it to my parents.</span> <span id="s1630">And at the back of it she wrote in her first, best English, isn’t she a lovely girl?</span> <span id="s1631">She wrote that herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: And this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: Well, this is a boat trip which my parents took in June ’39.</span> <span id="s1634">They send the photo to us.</span> <span id="s1635">It’s the sort of thing people who live in Berlin always -- often did on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s1636">And the remarkable thing is they were still moving around freely, in -- before war broke out in ’39.</span> <span id="s1637">Now, my parents can be seen to the left.</span> <span id="s1638">I can’t know how to desc -- well, they -- they’re on the photo.</span> <span id="s1639">On the other side it’s also written that they’ve been picking strawberries, wild strawberries in the wood, while the boat landed somewhere.</span> <span id="s1640">And the thermos flask got broken during the searching for the strawberries.</span> <span id="s1641">That’s what’s written on the backside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: And this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: This is a Pesach celebration at my sister’s relatives.</span> <span id="s1644">Her father’s brothers and sisters, and she had contact with them.</span> <span id="s1645">She is at the extreme right, my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: And this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: This -- the first lady at the right, sitting at the typewriter is my mother.</span> <span id="s1648">She’s in mourning because her first husband died in the first World War.</span> <span id="s1649">She is -- she has to work because she has a child to bring up, and she worked for re-armament -- armament adminis -- for the re-armament administration.</span> <span id="s1650">She’s still in deep mourning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: And who is this person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: This is a girlfriend of mine I started school life with, we started going to school together.</span> <span id="s1653">My mother wrote that Inge is now s -- at the time of ri -- of her writing the letter, she is now swimming on her way to Shanghai, but she came to say good-bye to me before she left.</span> <span id="s1654">Must be 1940.</span> <span id="s1655">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: And this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: This is my father in our house, in our apartment, which was sent to my sister’s birthday, as a birthday greetings.</span> <span id="s1658">He was then a very strong man, fat, you might say.</span> <span id="s1659">He later on wrote that he was very sick, lost a tremendous amount of weight, and put in -- we wouldn’t recognize him again.</span> <span id="s1660">I mean the weight through undernourishment, and not being well.</span> <span id="s1661">Well, he was taken very well care -- taken care of by my mother, but other circumstances made him not recover again, his former size.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: And what is this group here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Well, this is in a place at the Baltic Sea, where we went several times during vacation time, to spend vacation there.</span> <span id="s1664">Now, this is a group of people who just came together to be photographed.</span> <span id="s1665">Haven’t -- hadn’t known one another before, and they’ll never see one another again, but they are group photos, which was a habit to take at the time.</span> <span id="s1666">I am -- my mother and my sister are in the picture, right up in the middle.</span> <span id="s1667">I’m sitting on the lap of a lady who is probably the girlfriend of the gentleman who’s lying down reading the paper.</span> <span id="s1668">But the rest of the people I do not know, I haven’t known before the picture was taken, and nobody ever will remember who the others are.</span> <span id="s1669">But it was a habit in Germany at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Now, who is this gentleman here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: The gentleman at the right is my great grand-uncle.</span> <span id="s1672">He was not Jewish, he married the sister of my grandmother, who was Jewish, but during the third [indecipherable] she was dead, he was a widower.</span> <span id="s1673">He was a enormous help to my parents.</span> <span id="s1674">He didn’t -- he was not afraid to put himself out to made this bi -- Jewish niece and nephew.</span> <span id="s1675">He went to Berlin, he lived in Hanover.</span> <span id="s1676">He -- he gave them moral support, and material support also, in the way that he kept all of my corres -- all the correspondence which was sent to him, which were meant for me, and which he sent to me after the war.</span> <span id="s1677">My mother wrote on one occasion, he is like a father to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: Karl Heinrich Meyer.</span> <span id="s1680">Next to him is his grandson, and his daughter.</span> <span id="s1681">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: This is a Red Cross message, which was still ali -- there -- there was no correspondence between the two countries, England, and Germany, dur -- we -- after war broke out.</span> <span id="s1683">But it was still a possibility to send messages of so many words to Germany by the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1684">So I send those.</span> <span id="s1685">I believe I could send messages from England, and my parents could, on the other side, reply, and I got it back again.</span> <span id="s1686">But I don’t think it worked the other way around, I don’t think they could send messages on their own.</span> <span id="s1687">They could only reply, they couldn’t send any messages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: That’s a reply -- End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
