Allen.</span> <span id="s3">I was born on January 10th, 1916.</span> <span id="s4">I served in World War II from March of 1942 until April of 1946.</span> <span id="s5">1 was drafted.</span> <span id="s6">I went in as a private and eventually went to Officer’s Candidate School, graduated from there, and was assigned to the Combat Engineers.</span> <span id="s7">We had a training session in Mississippi with new troops and then eventually ended up in England.</span> <span id="s8">We were stationed there in preparation for the invasion of Europe, and prior to D-Day some of us did go over to see about removing the obstacles for the landing.</span> <span id="s9">We landed in Europe after the other troops because we came back and then there was a storm that's [unintelligible] in the red area.</span> <span id="s10">We were Combat Engineers assigned to a group who in turn assigned us to support the different divisions, and we were part of the first, third, and seventh armies.</span> <span id="s11">On the way through Europe, one of the incidents that occurred was the liberation of Dachau, and our company was assigned to support one of the infantry divisions.</span> <span id="s12">We went with them in support, and prior to getting to the actual stockade, we began to see these railroad cars lined up with human bodies laying in them like stacks of cordwood.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: As we progressed, we became more agitated, all of us.</span> <span id="s15">The infantry was really the first people there and we were right behind them.</span> <span id="s16">At that time, the prisoners and the guards were still there.</span> <span id="s17">We contained the guards, and the prisoners threw themselves on the barbed wire fence and made a way for them to get over, and they crawled over each other’s bodies to get at these guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Did you have any problem with the guards?</span> <span id="s19">A: No.</span> <span id="s20">Soon as we surrounded them, they....</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: They surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: ...pretty much dropped their weapons.</span> <span id="s23">But, everybody was so incensed at the condition of these people which were walking corpses really.</span> <span id="s24">They incinerated them there and you could smell the burning flesh odor even though the fires had gone out or were down.</span> <span id="s25">They weren't burning people when we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Was that the first you knew about the prison?</span> <span id="s27">Had you heard about the prison before?</span> <span id="s28">What did you expect?</span> <span id="s29">Did you find about what you'd expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">We had been told that we would be in the neighborhood of what had been a crematorium.</span> <span id="s32">It was more than we expected, because we never expected to see something in the fashion that occurred there -- to see human beings do this sort of thing to other human beings.</span> <span id="s33">I stood on a little knoll there and looked and saw these people.</span> <span id="s34">Their eyes were black coals, their head was like a skeleton, and their hair was half gone.</span> <span id="s35">It’s just, I guess, malnutrition and everything.</span> <span id="s36">I looked at these people whose elbows stood out like big knobby things and their bodies swollen.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Did you have an opportunity to talk to any of these prisoners?</span> <span id="s38">Do you know what their nationality was or anything about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Of course, there was a language problem.</span> <span id="s40">Most of them just said Jude, Jude.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Most of them were Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: To my knowledge, all we saw were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: All of them Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I understand that they had not confined that to Jewish people, but also to political dissidents.</span> <span id="s45">And there were some.</span> <span id="s46">But I stood in one position and I could look behind me and see these bodies like cordwood piled up in these cars, these open-like coal cars.</span> <span id="s47">They were taking those bodies from wherever they came from, some other camp or whatever, and burning them there plus the people that died there.</span> <span id="s48">These people were supposed to be worked in these camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: How many bodies do you suppose it was being brought?</span> <span id="s50">How large was this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: That train was probably half a mile long.</span> <span id="s52">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s53">A hundred cars or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes, because they were the shorter European cars.</span> <span id="s55">I guess it could possibly be a hundred or more cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q; How many bodies would you estimate to the car stacked up like cordwood?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: We talked about that at the time, and we figured there had to be somewhere around four, five, six hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: To each car?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s60">It bends your mind.</span> <span id="s61">Q: Beyond your imagination.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s63">That‘s why we, I guess, held the guards so that the prisoners could get to them.</span> <span id="s64">We felt like they were entitled.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did they attempt to get to the guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: They got to them, as weak as they were.</span> <span id="s67">Of course, they just overwhelmed them, and all they could do was beat them and pummel them and hit them with whatever they could find.</span> <span id="s68">It was finally stopped, but I mean the first reaction was let them have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: That's easy to understand, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes, it sure is at a point like that.</span> <span id="s71">After all, you're in combat, you're mentally geared to kill and things of this sort, but you see things like that...in fact, I've got some pictures somewhere.</span> <span id="s72">I didn't have a chance to look them up before you came.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: I’d like to look at them when I have time.</span> <span id="s74">No rush.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: They’re similar to what you've seen in all magazines and everything where these bodies are just stacked up like cordwood.</span> <span id="s76">It's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: But these are pictures that you made?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, I made some pictures there.</span> <span id="s79">And I ran into people after the war was over who had been in different places.</span> <span id="s80">Shortly after the war was over, in the fall, I saw one man at one of these...it became the CIA but it was the OSS then, and they were handling all the civilian details of setting up the towns, cities....</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: That was American soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: That was American soldiers who acted as I guess you might say political people setting up a town, and I had some business with this one man there.</span> <span id="s83">He spoke English; in fact, he was from Milwaukee and had been to visit his mother in Europe when the war broke out, and when that thing happened they put him into one of these concentration camps.</span> <span id="s84">I said, "You look very good," and he took his leg and put it over the edge of the table and pulled his pants down and said, "I haven't got any flesh on my legs yet."</span> <span id="s85">But he was still skin and bones really.</span> <span id="s86">And that's essentially my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How long did you stay at this camp, and how many prisoners would you estimate survived?</span> <span id="s88">You said they wanted to break out and did break out.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">How many prisoners do you think survived, and how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: I didn't see the whole camp.</span> <span id="s91">It's a big area and I saw one area.</span> <span id="s92">We had come down the railroad track in the process of coming there.</span> <span id="s93">We were going on to...I get my towns mixed up, but to where Hitler's headquarters had been.</span> <span id="s94">They had all the records, and that was really a part of our purpose to stay right with the infantry because Dachau....</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Was that in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s97">Dachau is not that far from Munich.</span> <span id="s98">So this is our reason for being so close in behind the infantry.</span> <span id="s99">We were normally either way in front or way behind, because we were a bridge building company, and they sent us in front to build a bridge for the tanks and the infantry to go over and they left us behind fixing the roads so that they could be supplied.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What was the reaction and what was the thinking of you and your buddies when you arrived and found all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s102">The first reaction was anger.</span> <span id="s103">And the second reaction was to retaliate.</span> <span id="s104">That's probably the reason that they let the prisoners get at the guards and things like that.</span> <span id="s105">I don't think that there was anybody in command at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: The commanders of the camp had already abandoned and gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: They'd taken off running, yes, and they were later caught.</span> <span id="s108">But, the American troops reacted on their own initiative rather than anybody giving any commands for them to do these things.</span> <span id="s109">It just happened.</span> <span id="s110">But I could understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Mr. Allen, is there anything that you feel like adding to your statement?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">What was your first reaction?</span> <span id="s113">Has it affected your life since then?</span> <span id="s114">As you look back today, what is your reaction to the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: My reaction is probably one of horror, because being a Christian, it's unbelievable to me that human beings would do such a thing to each other.</span> <span id="s116">You can't understand how anybody could be involved in doing such a thing from one human being to another.</span> <span id="s117">But it's also understandable what they did because of the emotional mentality of the time.</span> <span id="s118">These people did anything Hitler wanted.</span> <span id="s119">They had twelve- and thirteen- and fourteen-year-old kids fighting toward the end of the war.</span> <span id="s120">They were told that we would do things like this to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: A brain washing operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Right, and a complete one, and the thought comes to my mind that the next time some powerful figure gets up and waves a flag and starts playing the marches and everything that the Germans won't follow them again.</span> <span id="s123">They've done it throughout history, and yet, as we discussed, probably the most aggressive, most active people in Europe are the Germans.</span> <span id="s124">And you don't understand this, and looking back at it you don't believe that it's really true.</span> <span id="s125">You think this has to be some sort of a nightmare, but when you see the physical evidence such as I did, you know that this is what people had done to each other.</span> <span id="s126">As far as it affecting my life, you put unhappy things behind you if you can, and that probably was the most unbelievable thing that I have ever seen.</span> <span id="s127">Going to the moon was more in line of doing what you strive to do, but this sort of a thing is just unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Thank you very much., Mr. Harry Allen.</span></p></body></html>
