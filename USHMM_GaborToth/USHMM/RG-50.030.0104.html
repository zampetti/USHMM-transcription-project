The second year of high school, I spent in Kiev.</span> <span id="s61">And uh,...and uh, uh,...</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Then the Communists again are in Kiev...

Not far away were the White Russians, you know.</span> <span id="s64">And the...we felt the Communists were again after my ... My parents had to live in hiding.</span> <span id="s65">And uh, we decided to go to the west.</span> <span id="s66">And so we went to the west, to Poland.</span> <span id="s67">And we landed in a city called Bia_ystok: B-I-A-L-Y-S-T-O-K.</span> <span id="s68">And basically in Bia_ystok, my parents lived there 'til '40...oh, to '42 or '43.</span> <span id="s69">I uh, will explain why I say so.</span> <span id="s70">I uh, graduate from uh, Polish high school with top honors.</span> <span id="s71">There's all marks were excellent.</span> <span id="s72">And nevertheless, first year I was not admitted... I applied for medical school, and I was not admitted.</span> <span id="s73">I applied next year; next year I was admitted.</span> <span id="s74">And so I entered the medical school in Vilna--called now Vilnius.</span> <span id="s75">It is now Lithuania.</span> <span id="s76">At that time, Poland.</span> <span id="s77">It is University, so- called, of Stephan Báthory.If you want to spell it: Stephan Báthory.</span> <span id="s78">And uh, I graduated in '33.</span> <span id="s79">That is university and medical school--together, six years.</span> <span id="s80">And uh, '33, I was... Right after my graduation, I was drafted into the Polish Army as a doctor.</span> <span id="s81">And I spent, as a doctor, one year in the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s82">After liberation, I worked in Jewish hospitals.</span> <span id="s83">It was in Bia_ystok, and in a city call Brest-Litovsk [Pol: Brze nad Bugiem].</span> <span id="s84">You know here the Peace of Brest-Litovsk.</span> <span id="s85">And I uh, worked mostly, during the last three years, in obstetrics.</span> <span id="s86">And in '37, with 29 years of age, I became already a director of small obstetrical department.</span> <span id="s87">I will pronounce the city--was very, very hard--named Mi_dzyrzec-Podlaska.</span> <span id="s88">It is a city, you know, twenty thousand population--mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s89">A nice hospital, built by American emigrants what they were from...from the city Mi_dzyrzec.</span> <span id="s90">And they collected money, and they built a beautiful hospital there for the population in this city. '</span> <span id="s91">39--February--I am drafted into the Polish Army and sent to the border.</span> <span id="s92">It was early...you know, early February.</span> <span id="s93">The Poles felt it very possible war may break out, so a partial mobilization took place.</span> <span id="s94">I was mobilized; and we were on the border with Germany.</span> <span id="s95">In uh, August, I was sent home to my civilian life; but on the 1st of September, '39, I was mobilized again.</span> <span id="s96">Here the war really broke out.</span> <span id="s97">And on the 4th of September, I was already a prisoner of war with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Near a city called Siedlce.</span> <span id="s99">And uh, I was brought to a marketplace.</span> <span id="s100">And I will say, you know, uh,... For example, you know, I was on the marketplace; and there are thirty, forty officers--SS and regular officers.</span> <span id="s101">And I came out; and I was thinking, "Should I salute?"</span> <span id="s102">And I saluted.</span> <span id="s103">And all the forty officers--some with the SS salute, some with the...mostly with military salute--greeted me.</span> <span id="s104">Although they were informed that I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s105">The first question 1 Simon V. Petlyura was a Ukrainian journalist and military leader during the Russian Revolution.</span> <span id="s106">In 1919, he made a deal with Polish Gen. Jozef Pilsudski and took Kiev on April 25, 1920.</span> <span id="s107">In June of that year, however, the Red Army recaptured the city and Petlyura was forced to flee.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">2 Apparently after the 16th century King of Poland of that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">3 Reference is to a treaty between Germany and Russia which was signed there on March 3, 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">of the sergeant who took me prisoner was... Uh,, I told him that I am a doctor.</span> <span id="s111">And the first question was, "Und bin sie eine Jude?"</span> <span id="s112">[Ger: "And are you a Jew?"]</span> <span id="s113">And I thought...still thought, "This is my last minute of my life."</span> <span id="s114">No, his attitude very...was very fair.</span> <span id="s115">And he... I can say very fair.</span> <span id="s116">And he brought me to this marketplace; and he informed that "He is...he's a Jew."</span> <span id="s117">Nevertheless, a major came to me and said, "In the hospital, there are many Polish wounded soldiers and very few doctors.</span> <span id="s118">You are going right there; and you will take care of the Polish soldiers."</span> <span id="s119">And so I was put to the hospital.</span> <span id="s120">It is on a stretch where here the Poles [NB: the Germans], and then the Russians.</span> <span id="s121">And on the 29th of September, the Poles...uh, the Germans left the city.</span> <span id="s122">And uh, they ask, "Who want to go with us, let go.</span> <span id="s123">And who want to stay, let stay."</span> <span id="s124">And I remained to stay, because my city Bia_ystok is occupied already by the Russians.</span> <span id="s125">Was more...more to the east.</span> <span id="s126">And uh, after four or five days, the Germans came back.</span> <span id="s127">Had to come.</span> <span id="s128">Here, I asked the permission; and I was permitted to go from the three hundred wounded.</span> <span id="s129">Few...few--not few.</span> <span id="s130">Will say, a small proportion left--the hard cases.</span> <span id="s131">And the chief doctor told me, "We will be able to take care of these cases."</span> <span id="s132">And he allowed me to go uh, to Bia_ystok.</span> <span id="s133">And I..</span> <span id="s134">.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: What... For you as a Jew, working in that hospital as a doctor, what was it like in the fall of '39?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I, first time... For the first time, I felt the cleavage between a Polish Jew doctor and a Polish doctor.</span> <span id="s137">They somehow stayed away.</span> <span id="s138">I didn't care for this.</span> <span id="s139">I was working day and night.</span> <span id="s140">It was at that time tremendous amount of uh, wounded.</span> <span id="s141">And I will not forget how one Polish officer doctor--he was a patient, and he had tetanus.</span> <span id="s142">And I know he will die of this tetanus.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, he became...and he knew that he has tetanus.</span> <span id="s144">And how he didn't want to let me go away.</span> <span id="s145">Very young.</span> <span id="s146">And: "Stay near me.</span> <span id="s147">Stay near me."</span> <span id="s148">Was very much attached.</span> <span id="s149">But ...but I felt the cleavage at that time between the Polish doctors and the Jewish.</span> <span id="s150">Jewish - I was only Jewish doctor there.</span> <span id="s151">There was one doctor who converted to Catholicism.</span> <span id="s152">For them, it was a Catholic; and he was...uh, he was...uh, went back to to to Warsaw, where his family was.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s154">So you have received permission, you're about to leave the hospital.</span> <span id="s155">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s156">A: Now... I went to my city where I am...where I am... Not where...I went only to the city where I worked as a doctor only for few--for one, two days.</span> <span id="s157">I knew that the Germans will come there; and will occupy this city uh, in one, two days.</span> <span id="s158">I went to the east, and I went to Bia_ystok.</span> <span id="s159">I have to say here, you know, you see such these old difficulties.</span> <span id="s160">Dangers, you know.</span> <span id="s161">After all, you know, to be 12 days in a war, being all the time on a on a aerial bombardment, you know.</span> <span id="s162">You know, all the time.</span> <span id="s163">And uh, here I read signs that all officers of the Polish Army have to register in this and this place.</span> <span id="s164">I am a disciplined person, and I know, took... You know, at that time we had carriages drawn by horses, you know.</span> <span id="s165">And I took such a carriage; and I'm driving.</span> <span id="s166">And on the way there, I meet a very good friend--also a doctor.</span> <span id="s167">He was with me.</span> <span id="s168">I know that he was also in the Army.</span> <span id="s169">He is already dressed completely in civilian clotheses.</span> <span id="s170">I stopped, and I..</span> <span id="s171">.</span> <span id="s172">"Doctor Epstein," I said.

How luckily it was I met my friend uh, Epstein in this.</span> <span id="s183">Alright.</span> <span id="s184">I am in Bia_ystok, where I uh, a Soviet system of uh, uh, health is being established.</span> <span id="s185">I go and I being assigned...to the officials, I being assigned to be associate director to the uh, uh, delivery...</span></p> <p><span id="s186">How to say?</span> <span id="s187">It is only obstetrical department.</span> <span id="s188">Obstetrical department...</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: You're delivering babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: ...and my friend, Dr. [Saufkis (ph)], is the director.</span> <span id="s191">I'm his uh, right hand.</span> <span id="s192">And there we're working into...working in a maternity...maternity hospital.</span> <span id="s193">While, before the war, I was courting a young doctor--a sister of my very good friend.</span> <span id="s194">When I came back from the front, she was in Vilna.</span> <span id="s195">And Vilna already was separated from Poland, and put to...given to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s196">And borders, you cannot go through.</span> <span id="s197">You cannot even write.</span> <span id="s198">She is in Lithuania, and I'm in...under Russian.</span> <span id="s199">But after a year, we started to get letters.</span> <span id="s200">I started to write to her, and she's...

She was at that time now in Vilna, but in a city called Kaunas [NB: Kovno].</span> <span id="s204">And the year after--one day, two days--we got married.</span> <span id="s205">And one day, on the second day of our marriage, the war between Russia and the... the Germany breaks out.</span> <span id="s206">It is June.</span> <span id="s207">I don't recall- -25th, 26th of June.And uh, one day later, the Germans are in the city of Kaunas.</span> <span id="s208">City is very close to the German border.</span> <span id="s209">One day it was they needed to occupy the city.</span> <span id="s210">Here, another pandemonium starts now with the...with the Germans.</span> <span id="s211">They uh, hook...they catch Jews on the street.</span> <span id="s212">And we know that they did...the Jews will not come back.</span> <span id="s213">It is just to enhance the spirit of the Germans.</span> <span id="s214">They were brought to the Seventh Fort.</span> <span id="s215">And uh, if a soldier or an officer wanted to show his patriotic feel... feelings, he could go there, kill two Jews.</span> <span id="s216">And that, as you know, was an expression of patriotism.</span> <span id="s217">And here I am arrested on the street.</span> <span id="s218">They brought me to the police precinct.</span> <span id="s219">I..</span> <span id="s220">.</span> <span id="s221">in this...in a country where I don't know a word of Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s222">One word I know; that a doctor is a "[gitidois (ph)]."</span> <span id="s223">And the the officer, police officer, at the entrance, look at me.</span> <span id="s224">I say, "[Gitidois (ph)].</span> <span id="s225">[Gitidois (ph)]."</span> <span id="s226">And he made it with the head: "Go away."</span> <span id="s227">And I again, you know, escaped at that.</span> <span id="s228">On the 15th of July, was already ghetto put on.</span> <span id="s229">And uh,...and uh, I am with my wife... (Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: How are you living?</span> <span id="s231">Describe the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: First, you know, the ghetto is still for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s233">This is awful.</span> <span id="s234">We don't have anything what to eat.</span> <span id="s235">We are in a suburban area of the city Kaunas, you know, where rather poor people lived.</span> <span id="s236">They had to empty the apartment; they got the better apartments in the city, and here the Jews were put.</span> <span id="s237">I got a small, small room--tiny room--for two persons.</span> <span id="s238">And a family with children is in another room.</span> <span id="s239">That was the whole apartment.</span> <span id="s240">Small apartment.</span> <span id="s241">The...we don't have anything what to eat.</span> <span id="s242">I say to to my neighbor, "Maybe we will go on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Maybe we will find, you know, we will buy some potatoes.</span> <span id="s244">Or maybe bread, you know.</span> <span id="s245">The 4 Germany invaded Lithuania on June 22, 1941 and occupied Kaunas (Kovno) on June 24th.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">the peasants are going every day to the...to the city to sell their...their... their...their uh, products."</span> <span id="s247">And we went.</span> <span id="s248">We are on the road; and suddenly he says, "No.</span> <span id="s249">I'm afraid to go.</span> <span id="s250">I am going back."</span> <span id="s251">And he turned back.</span> <span id="s252">And I made, maybe, twenty steps over a hill.</span> <span id="s253">Then here comes--crawling, almost--another Jew, and tells me, "You don't see?</span> <span id="s254">All the Jews are being there held up."</span> <span id="s255">And twenty or twenty-five Jews they caught, brought them aside of the road, and killed everybody--including even my friend who went with me for...for buy the potatoes.</span> <span id="s256">If I went with him, I would be killed.</span> <span id="s257">And that's again how I survived this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Now we are in ghetto.</span> <span id="s259">Ghetto is closed.Somehow we manage...managed to get potatoes-- most primitive form of food.</span> <span id="s260">And uh, we went there through a uh, big so-called Aktion.</span> <span id="s261">That is selection where we all were brought to a very big empty place, and just one SS man.</span> <span id="s262">We had to go family after family; and family with children or with elderly people, he will put on the left.</span> <span id="s263">Young people, you know, without children, he will put to the right.</span> <span id="s264">And so from the thirty-some thousand people, we remained fifteen [thousand].</span> <span id="s265">The rest went, you know, to another place for one day.</span> <span id="s266">Next day, they were brought to a fort.</span> <span id="s267">It was called Ninth Fort.</span> <span id="s268">Kovno was surrounded with old forts.</span> <span id="s269">You know, F-O-R-T, fort.</span> <span id="s270">And all these eighteen [thousand] people were killed there.Uh,, we could hear it.</span> <span id="s271">It was around two [and] one-half miles [away].</span> <span id="s272">We...for two days, we heard the...the uh, crying; and the crying of this and of this.</span> <span id="s273">And how generators started to come down.</span> <span id="s274">And then, you know, they killed every...everybody was--eighteen thousand with the children.</span> <span id="s275">Lithuanian soldiers were very much active there.</span> <span id="s276">So we are now in a ghetto, a Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s277">We are now only fifteen thousand.</span> <span id="s278">And soon thereafter, we started, you know, we wanted, you know--not wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">The Germans wanted to utilize this uh, physical force.</span> <span id="s280">The airport in Kaunas was a small, relatively, area.</span> <span id="s281">It is not good for military purposes.</span> <span id="s282">So they had to enlarge the airport.</span> <span id="s283">So the mass of the people from ghetto was put to work in three different shifts, uh, the airport to enlarge.</span> <span id="s284">And I had to go there, too.</span> <span id="s285">I was assigned to go to night; every night, from approximately from twelve to eight in the morning.</span> <span id="s286">Approximately.</span> <span id="s287">It was end of December.</span> <span id="s288">I came home, and I don't find my wife.</span> <span id="s289">Meanwhile, one uh,...one day, the Germans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">They say, "We need three hundred able people."</span> <span id="s291">And without asking, from our own house to the other house, came into the house where my wife was.</span> <span id="s292">Took her.</span> <span id="s293">And so my wife disappeared.</span> <span id="s294">Disappeared;
