and talk with us.</span> <span id="s3">We appreciate you making this recording.</span> <span id="s4">Dr. Crawford, of course, is the director of this program, and what we'd like to have is what you saw and what you experienced and what you think about what was happening at the time in Germany.</span> <span id="s5">If you would please give us your name and address and date of birth and then just tell us whatever you remember and what you think about.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: My name is Lauren Nash.</span> <span id="s7">I was born October 14, 1918, and I grew up in the rural county of Wilkes County, Georgia.</span> <span id="s8">Washington, Georgia is the county seat.</span> <span id="s9">And I came to Atlanta in 1940 and then in January of 1943, I went into the service, going with the 961st Engineer Maintenance Company.</span> <span id="s10">We took our basic in Camp Swift, Texas.</span> <span id="s11">After basic training maneuvers in Tennessee, from there to Camp Miles Standish, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s12">From there we went overseas to North Ireland, where we got prepared for the invasion of Normandy Beach.</span> <span id="s13">I went in on Omaha Beach, on the 10th of June, 1944, and we went in to St. Lo.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">There we joined General Patton's Third Army.</span> <span id="s15">I went in as a Second in the Second Armored Training Division, I believe they called it that.</span> <span id="s16">Anyway I went with the Third Army and we went through the campaign of France.</span> <span id="s17">In Christmas of 1944 we was at a little village outside of Metz, across the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">We was on the west side of the river from Metz in a little town of Hagendange.</span> <span id="s19">I believe that's spelled H-a-g-e-n-d-a-n-g-e, France.</span> <span id="s20">That was during the Battle of the Bulge and they transferred us up to Clemency, Luxembourg, and from there we worked into Arlon, Belgium, as a back up during the time the 101st was trapped there in Belgium.</span> <span id="s21">Then we came back down into Gotha, Germany.</span> <span id="s22">We came back to Konigsmarkef, France, near the Maginot Line.</span> <span id="s23">From there we went into St. Wendel, then into Weimar, where just outside of Weimar is the Buchenwald prison camp.</span> <span id="s24">And this is where we first saw the real core of what we was fighting for, what Germany was doing to people, that they were trying to destroy the human race.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Were you with the group that liberated this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s27">We were a service company.</span> <span id="s28">We were the maintenance company for the XX Corps of Engineers, and it and the Fourth Armored was the ones that went in.</span> <span id="s29">We went in the day that they liberated it.</span> <span id="s30">We went in to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What was the first unit that went in, do you know?</span> <span id="s32">A: I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: But you were with the second unit that went in to the prison camp?</span> <span id="s34">A: I was with that, and we went into the camp.</span> <span id="s35">I have pictures here.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: There's some real good pictures there.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: This is the main entrance to the camp, and I have another one here if I can find it.</span> <span id="s38">Yes, here's a shot that I am back away.</span> <span id="s39">This faces the southwest as you go through one of the prettiest forests you've ever seen.</span> <span id="s40">And the people in Weimar did not know that this camp existed or what was being carried on.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: It was right near them?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: It was near them, less than five miles away in this forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: When did you first hear about the camp?</span> <span id="s44">When did you know there was a camp there and you were going in to help liberate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: The day after we went into Weimar.</span> <span id="s46">Q: That's the first you heard of this camp?</span> <span id="s47">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What did you expect to find there?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: We really didn't know.</span> <span id="s50">There was nothing said too much to us.</span> <span id="s51">They just wanted to see it.</span> <span id="s52">After this happened we used some of our trucks and we went into town and rounded up some of the civilians -- the old people, the women, and some of the teenagers -- and we brought them in there and showed them this.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And they didn't know anything about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: They were appalled.</span> <span id="s55">This was something that let them know, because they did not know what was going on or just what Hitler was doing.</span> <span id="s56">They were supporting a government that they didn't know what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: What did you actually see when you approached?</span> <span id="s58">What was your rank at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I was a Tech Sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You were a Tech Sergeant, and you carried your group in to view this camp.</span> <span id="s61">A: Yes sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: What did you actually see?</span> <span id="s63">What did you first see when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: When I first got there, you could smell the stench of a peculiar odor which was the burning of these bodies, and the ovens were still warm.</span> <span id="s65">I made some pictures inside of these partially burned bodies that was in this oven, but not having a flash camera they didn't come out.</span> <span id="s66">They had huge ovens that had a steel flat on wheels that ran on a track.</span> <span id="s67">There was perforated holes right through the steel, and they laid these bodies on there and they would slide them over these gas jets that were fired up under there and it would burn the bodies up.</span> <span id="s68">All except for the ash.</span> <span id="s69">I have a picture here of the ashes from those burned bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Of course, there was a calcium bone ash that...this is a pile of ash.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: That's just a pile of ashes from where they burned the bodies?</span> <span id="s72">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s73">It was dumped out back of the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you learn anything about how these people come to die before they were</span></p> <p><span id="s75">cremated?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes sir, they carried them in to a basement like thing underneath this crematorium and they questioned them, and I guess after getting all the information they could from them they clubbed them to death.</span> <span id="s77">On the walls were ring handcuffs and [unintelligible] wall where their nails just clawed in.</span> <span id="s78">There was blood splattered all over that wall, and this table here had this club that had blood on it where they clubbed them to death after they tied them up.</span> <span id="s79">They then put them on this conveyor that carried them up.</span> <span id="s80">It was like a small elevator that ran from there up to the floor.</span> <span id="s81">They loaded them on these flat steel carriages that had wheels on them like a small -- about this big -- railroad type wheel that ran on these little rails that went in the oven.</span> <span id="s82">They closed the door and turned on the jets and the fire, and these ashes fell in the pit and that's where they cleaned them out.</span> <span id="s83">Now this is a picture of some of the bodies stacked there ready to be burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Stacked up like cordwood, aren't they?</span> <span id="s85">A: There's another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you have an opportunity to see or talk to any of the people that were running this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: They had all gone before you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: They had arrested the ones in charge.</span> <span id="s90">I also went over to the headquarters of this.</span> <span id="s91">There was a guide that was taking us into this and showed us the lampshade that the camp commander's wife had made from tattooed skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">They'd skinned the tattoo off of the prisoners that had them.</span> <span id="s93">You probably read about that or heard about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: You actually saw that shade?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I saw that shade.</span> <span id="s96">Yes sir.</span> <span id="s97">I sure did.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: That was a vicious and vile thing, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes, it sure was.</span> <span id="s100">This is a crematorium and that is the chimney to the back of it.</span> <span id="s101">That's on the south side.</span> <span id="s102">The main entrance was on the north side.</span> <span id="s103">I’m just trying to give you a little direction on those pictures there.</span> <span id="s104">This is some of those survivors there at the barracks and there's one who put on...see how well he fits those GI clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Did you have an opportunity to talk to any of these people?</span> <span id="s106">These people survived the camp, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: They spoke mostly Polish and German and I wasn't very up on that, so I couldn't talk to them.</span> <span id="s108">I just took pictures of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What was your reaction and thoughts to viewing this thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: You was in a shock so to speak.</span> <span id="s111">You felt like you was in a slaughter pen, like you had gone to a packing house or something where they kill animals and process them.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Except they're Jews and human bodies.</span> <span id="s113">A: Just human bodies, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And then destroying them by fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Of course, these bodies that are stacked here were just outside piled up.</span> <span id="s116">There was also two trailers.</span> <span id="s117">They had rubber tires like the old Hoover wagon type trailer.</span> <span id="s118">It was just piled with bodies, too, and I don't know why those pictures didn't come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You got some very good pictures there.</span> <span id="s120">Especially good pictures of the bodies piled up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: You can see how skinny they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: What effect did this have on you, Mr. Nash?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: It sort of changed my outlook on what war is all about -- why we have entered various wars when we have seen persecution by one force overrunning another that's weaker.</span> <span id="s124">I guess that's partly the reason we got into the Korean War.</span> <span id="s125">Also some of the reasons we was in the Viet Nam War, but those two wars seem to have been bungled a little.</span> <span id="s126">We didn't go in to conquer, we just went there to serve as a police force seems like.</span> <span id="s127">We didn't go in there to fight like we did in France and Germany.</span> <span id="s128">We went there to conquer.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: What was your occupation before the war?</span> <span id="s130">What did you plan to do?</span> <span id="s131">What were you doing when you went into the Army?</span> <span id="s132">Were you drafted or did you volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: No, I was drafted.</span> <span id="s134">I grew up on a farm and then when I came to Atlanta I went to work for the old Genesco [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s135">I had worked there two years before I got drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Went into the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s138">I was working in the maintenance department and also doing the shoelasting, forming the toes of the shoes.</span> <span id="s139">I ran a machine there for a good while and I worked in the maintenance department.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: You are now operating a garage and an automobile agency.</span> <span id="s141">A: No, just an auto repair shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Auto repair shop here on Candler Road.</span> <span id="s143">Did your experience in Germany change your thought or change your work in any respect?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s145">I came back and took up life about like I left it.</span> <span id="s146">I was married at the time.</span> <span id="s147">I had been married two years.</span> <span id="s148">I came back and I still have the same wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Congratulations.</span> <span id="s150">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How long did you stay in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A. I was from June until October 4.</span> <span id="s153">We left [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s154">That's south of Munich.</span> <span id="s155">We were there until October 4th then we went to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s156">From there on into Le Havre and back to the states and came back on the Queen Mary.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Buchenwald was the first camp you went into?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: That’s the only concentration camp I saw over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Did you see any other prisoners of war, or near any other camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No, I didn't [or I didn’t] know that they had been prisoners.</span> <span id="s161">There was a lot of people after the war ended that was with a pack on the back, walking in some direction, possibly towards home.</span> <span id="s162">Whether they had been prisoners or Germans, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: You didn't know their nationality?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: We also saw a lot of trainloads of prisoners going back to Poland, heading north over there near Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Did you see any American prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No sir.</span> <span id="s167">Not during the time they were taken prisoners.</span> <span id="s168">Q: They were already liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: And the camp had already been liberated that you had an opportunity to visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">But you was right behind the liberators and saw everything there and what they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: What else should we record about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: You're more or less interested in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: We are interested in people like you who was there and saw it.</span> <span id="s176">A: Yes sir.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: We’re very much interested in what you saw and what you think and what your reaction was to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I thought what I saw here in this camp was the most terrible thing I had ever witnessed in my life or even since.</span> <span id="s179">I just think that it's something that came along in my lifetime that I never want to see a repetition of it, because it's terrible.</span> <span id="s180">It's awful.</span> <span id="s181">It's unbelievable what one human being will do to another when they have the advantage to do so.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What was your reaction and certainly you discussed it with your buddies?</span> <span id="s183">What do you think the German people was tying to do in doing this kind of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: They were trying to eliminate the Jewish population that was in Germany and in the countries they conquered, such as Poland and the other countries that they had overrun.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Was it your understanding that most of the people, all of the people, in this camp were Jewish people or were there other people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: They were Jewish and perhaps some of them were town officials that had opposed them.</span> <span id="s187">They had resisted the German movement into these places, such as the towns in Poland, Belgium, Holland, Russia, France, any of these towns that they had overrun.</span> <span id="s188">But I couldn't single out any of them.</span> <span id="s189">I think that most in this camp here were from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Polish Jews or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes sir, I don't have any knowledge or record of any of the people that were executed in these camps as being prisoners of war, like the American prisoners, because of the Geneva Convention, because Germany knew we had a lot of their prisoners and we could retaliate had they done something like this to our prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Is it your understanding that some of the victims in this prison was officials in other places that were opposing Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes sir, Like the mayors or....</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Then, they were not Jewish people?</span> <span id="s195">A: Some...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: What were their nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A., They might have been...I don't know their religious faith or what have you.</span> <span id="s198">They most likely were Catholics or some Protestants perhaps, but most of the people we see here were Jews.</span> <span id="s199">That was his method.</span> <span id="s200">He would just round them up and take them into the camp and this is what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Kill them any way they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: In some of the camps they gassed them.</span> <span id="s203">They told them they were going to march them in to have a shower, but instead of water coming out of the shower heads there was cyanide gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Did you see any of those victims or any of that operation?</span> <span id="s205">A: No sir, I just heard about those while I was over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: From your information here, the victims here were carried in and murdered.</span> <span id="s207">A: They were murdered, I am pretty sure, or starved to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: And then burned the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Then they burned the bodies.</span> <span id="s210">In some of the camps, they dug mass graves and put them in and just covered them over, just a huge trench.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Did you see any of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: We saw one at Gotha, Germany that was covered over but I didn't see them dig it up.</span> <span id="s213">We were just passing through at that time.</span> <span id="s214">I was told that that was a mass grave there.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Experience you’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s216">A No.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: What’s your reaction to the thing today?</span> <span id="s218">What should be done?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I understand there are a few that have escaped from here that was involved with this.</span> <span id="s220">If they catch some kind of officer perhaps or some guard or anything that was pertaining to this, I think they should be dealt with in practically the same manner they had done to these folks.</span> <span id="s221">Just like they did Eichmann when they caught him.</span> <span id="s222">They hanged him.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Do you think all these people that was involved in any way, even a minor way, that can be identified should now be executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: They should be charged with murder and executed if they prove that they had had any involvement in committing any of this crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Can you think of anything else we ought to put in the record this morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No, not necessarily.</span> <span id="s227">That's about the extent.</span> <span id="s228">I was a soldier going through and I carried out my orders and this is what I came across and saw when I was going through there.</span> <span id="s229">I saw why we was over there fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A. Thank you very much, Mr. Lauren Nash.</span></p></body></html>
