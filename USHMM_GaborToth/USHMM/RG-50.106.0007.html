Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: What happened when you got off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Off the train there was people we know already.</span> <span id="s365">And they put my father and me in a -- in a stable.</span> <span id="s366">It was a barracks.</span> <span id="s367">The barracks, big old barracks.</span> <span id="s368">There were about 60 people at least in there in bunk -- bunk beds.</span> <span id="s369">It wasn't a nice side, but there was better than some of the other ones.</span> <span id="s370">Some of them were living in worse.</span> <span id="s371">They were living in little houses, they were living in one or the other.</span> <span id="s372">So my father started working for the transport unloading box cars, and I was playing

id="s393">Before September they start getting transport together.</span> <span id="s394">We didn't know where they go.</span> <span id="s395">They send us out of Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s396">And we came on in September '44 and I think was Yom Kippur even that day, Yom Kippur arrived, maybe, I don't know.</span> <span id="s397">Anyway, we were put on box cars and sent to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: There was a large group of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: The whole train.</span> <span id="s400">I don't know how many people there were on them,

healthy.</span> <span id="s404">I was strong.</span> <span id="s405">So was my father, too.</span> <span id="s406">But the thing when we got out there, you know, Auschwitz, he wore glasses.</span> <span id="s407">I didn't wear no glasses then, and had a beard from the train ride and he looked tired.</span> <span id="s408">And Mr. Mengele was standing there at the train, we had to go in lines, and Dr. Mengele, left and right.</span> <span id="s409">My father went to the right, I went to the left.</span> <span id="s410">And I said, "This is my father.</span> <span id="s411">I want to go with him."</span> <span id="s412">This man, he had a whip and he whipped me with my bag and I was running to the left.</span> <span id="s413">So from that date on, that was the end of my father.</span> <span id="s414">I never saw my father again.</span> <span id="s415">And I found out there was a fire, I think it was a fire, yeah, smokestacks.</span> <span id="s416">And I said, "What is it?"</span> <span id="s417">Somebody told me that's -- they burn the bricks, until I find out -- it was really messy and stinky, you know.</span> <span id="s418">So what it was, it was the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: When you were taking the train to there from Theresienstadt, were these cattle cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: That was cattle cars, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q:

id="s425">Q: Did you get any food during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: We had still food on us.</span> <span id="s427">But the worst part was I was voluntary -- they was looking for people, I never got the tut (ph).</span> <span id="s428">I was only stamped like an animal.</span> <span id="s429">And I was voluntary to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s430">I said to myself I wanted to get out of hell, because what was going on there, I can't even say all that.</span> <span id="s431">I said go away from here.</span> <span id="s432">I want to get out, just out of here.</span> <span id="s433">So when a group of Viennese people, about 50, we got voluntary to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s434">But we never came to Buchenwald, we came to Kaufering.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Well, now, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s436">You left Theresienstadt and went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Auschwitz,

was the feeling of the people -- did they have any idea where they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: We didn't know where we were going, no, I said this.</span> <span id="s446">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s447">We had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did they let you get out at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No.</span> <span id="s450">No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: What were the sensations in the car?</span> <span id="s452">Was there any light?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: No.</span> <span id="s454">There was no light in there.</span> <span id="s455">Cattle bar -- cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Could you lie down at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: We were sitting down.</span> <span id="s458">There were about 50 people in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Was it all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s461">I think we were all men.</span> <span id="s462">No, no, we were mixed.</span> <span id="s463">From Auschwitz away we were all men.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And then you got to Auschwitz and you said you were separated from your father and that was the last time you saw him.</span> <span id="s465">And then where did you -- where did you go in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s466">Where did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I went to the

the striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s470">And then we were sent to one of those mogs (ph).</span> <span id="s471">And we were sitting, I don't know, a week.</span> <span id="s472">And they asked for volunteers for Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s473">So I said let's go to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s474">And then when we left there, it was September 2, and we left and went over in cattle cars again.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s476">How many -- how many people went with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: There were about 50.</span> <span id="s478">In half a

yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Young men volunteered to go to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I didn't know everybody volunteered, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Well, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Quite a lot volunteered to get out of -- out of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s486">Because you knew what was happening in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I saw what was going on.</span> <span id="s488">We didn't get no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: They did not give you any food that week?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: When they carried the food through the block, people coming out, they kill them, they shoot them.</span> <span id="s491">But they were going under with the food container and robbed the food container.</span> <span id="s492">So the most of them was in the underground.</span> <span id="s493">Before they come to the block, they had no food.</span> <span id="s494">But when we left there, they gave us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s495">One loaf of bread, actually, not a piece, a loaf of bread, a piece of sausage and a piece of cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q:

--</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Escape?A: We shoot them all.</span> <span id="s511">And the train when we left Auschwitz went to ViennA: I could see from the top under a bridge where we passed on the train, I see the house where I used to live.</span> <span id="s512">And I tried with the barbed wire, and then he said if one goes away, everybody is dead.</span> <span id="s513">So I said forget it.</span> <span id="s514">I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s515">I don't want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s517">And then you got to Kaufering.</span> <span

id="s529">That was going steady.</span> <span id="s530">Steady, steady for two weeks I did this.</span> <span id="s531">And I said to myself, if I keep on doing this, I won't live long.</span> <span id="s532">So I disappeared always.</span> <span id="s533">I got caught a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Where did you disappear to?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: One of the big halls

id="s659">And we have to search the camp.</span> <span id="s660">And that the oldest one, Mr. Niches (ph), he had all the camp, we know where it was right away when he said, so we went to each one.</span> <span id="s661">And he said this is the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s662">We had our barracks, the Red Cross had blankets and milk was inside and we had the key.</span> <span id="s663">And we hide everything there.</span> <span id="s664">And he went inside, Mr. Niches, the oldest, camp oldest, got in and found it right away and he came out and (spoke in German) there is nothing inside.</span> <span id="s665">So we were lucky, otherwise we would be hanged.</span> <span id="s666">Because the camp hanged a lot of people in the camp, in</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Kaufering.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Did you see people being hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s670">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s671">I saw people between the fence.</span> <span id="s672">They got caught stealing potatoes, they put potatoes in their mouth.</span> <span id="s673">You stayed between the two wires for many, many hours.</span> <span id="s674">When they didn't want to live anymore, they just touch the wire and they fell over.</span> <span id="s675">When anything you steal, they put you between the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Did you ever feel just like giving up?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No.</span> <span id="s678">I had a will, will to live.</span> <span id="s679">I always had the will to live.</span> <span id="s680">I think I was strong.</span> <span id="s681">I was very strong.</span> <span id="s682">I saw so many people dying, dying like flies, but I never gave up.</span> <span id="s683">And I always washed myself.</span> <span id="s684">I dried myself in my shirt that was six months old.</span> <span id="s685">At night I put it under the blanket so it dries.</span> <span id="s686">And I was shivering, but still it dries for the next day to go to work.</span> <span id="s687">But I washed myself.</span> <span id="s688">The people -- the first two weeks when they were in Kaufering, they had the cement coming out of their ears, out of their nose, and it was like, like concrete.</span> <span id="s689">They couldn't get that off no more because they never washed.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Where did you get the water from?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, we had a fountain, we had –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Faucets?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: We call it -- it was a little hot, a faucet around, but no towels, no soap.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What were the sanitary facilities like?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Very bad.</span> <span id="s696">Very, very bad.</span> <span id="s697">The toilet was called the latrine, and there was just one two-by-four, four-by, something like that, and everybody was sitting on it next to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Um-hmm, um-hmm.</span> <span id="s699">And your health, you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: My health went bad after I got freed.</span> <span id="s701">I had typhus, typhus.</span> <span id="s702">I got freed on the 30th of April in Allach, and I went with Landau, I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: What were your feelings when you got freed, when you realized what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Well, the war is over and we live.</span> <span id="s705">That's all.</span> <span id="s706">I want to live.</span> <span id="s707">I want to live.</span> <span id="s708">So we went to -- we took a car from Luftwaffe and we drove to Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: How did you get the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It was standing in the street with the keys inside.</span> <span id="s711">It is a long story, too.</span> <span id="s712">But, anyway, we came to Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: And the two of you just got in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Got in the car and we drove.</span> <span id="s715">And I was sick, I was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s716">I didn't know what I had.</span> <span id="s717">And we came to Salzburg and they took away the car from us, but when they opened the door I fell and I went unconscious.</span> <span id="s718">So they put me in a Lazarette, in a hospital, in a German hospital.</span> <span id="s719">They didn't know I was in -- because I didn't speak a word of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s721">You were 19 years old at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Something like that.</span> <span id="s723">I didn't speak a word of English and I didn't even know what German means.</span> <span id="s724">I swear that's the truth.</span> <span id="s725">I said I am German, I am German.</span> <span id="s726">I want to say I am a Jew, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s727">And I said I am German, because I hear that so often, you know.</span> <span id="s728">So finally explained to me a chaplain that, I don't even know the name, Kaplan, Kaplan was his name.</span> <span id="s729">He said don't ever say that again.</span> <span id="s730">So they put me in that hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: This is in Salzburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: In Salzburg.</span> <span id="s733">They put me in that hospital and that was -- the war ends on that day and there were a lot of shooting going on.</span> <span id="s734">And I was scared because there were only German people in there.</span> <span id="s735">So I explained it to them.</span> <span id="s736">Then they transferred me to -- they transferred me to Landis Kartenhaus (ph) in Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: This is the American Army that kind of took you under its wing?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Right.</span> <span id="s739">They put me in that Lazarette, in that hospital with the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s740">I didn't want to go in there, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s741">So finally they send me to Landis Kartenhaus, (ph) and there I was about a month, month and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Was that also in Salzburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: In Salzburg, the Landis Kartenhaus (ph).</span> <span id="s744">I still got (unintelligible).</span> <span id="s745">That's the only two things I got.</span> <span id="s746">And I was there for about 30 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Recovering from typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Typhus, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s750">And you were very thin?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Skeleton.</span> <span id="s752">Real skeleton.</span> <span id="s753">But like I say, I am lucky I am alive.</span> <span id="s754">I am still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Where was your future brother-in-law at that point?</span> <span id="s756">Was he still with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: No -- I was in the hospital and he met one of the kapos in Salzburg from our camp, too.</span> <span id="s758">It was a Viennese, too, and all of a sudden he came -- an American soldier came in the hospital, and I looked, it was the kapo from the camp.</span> <span id="s759">It was a Jewish boy wearing an American uniform.</span> <span id="s760">I said, "How you got on a uniform?"</span> <span id="s761">He worked for the CIC, and I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s762">When I got out, I worked a few months in Hielbrunn.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So you were in recuperating from typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And then you got out?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: I got out and I went to the American Army for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s767">I was looking for SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: They hired you, the American Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: They hired me.</span> <span id="s770">They took me in the wings -- under their wings.</span> <span id="s771">And they put me in it because I spoke German.</span> <span id="s772">And they were saying to me, don't say nothing.</span> <span id="s773">Just listen.</span> <span id="s774">And if I see somebody with a tattoo under the arm, then we know it is the SS.</span> <span id="s775">I catched only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And you came and told the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s778">And then I was with the Seventh -- Seventh Division, Seventh Infantry, Third Division.</span> <span id="s779">A long time with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: They treated me so nice.</span> <span id="s784">And I said to myself, there was a demarcation line between -- in Austria between Linz, Wuffe (ph), and I said I want to go back to Vienna.</span> <span id="s785">And so I left them and I could not go over to the Russian side -- they didn't let me -- I couldn't go with them.</span> <span id="s786">So I came back to Salzburg.</span> <span id="s787">So I worked for the Rainbow Division in the kitchen for the time being, and after this I got back to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: When did you get back to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: September 26th, 1945.</span></p> <p><span
