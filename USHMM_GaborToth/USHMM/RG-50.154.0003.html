My sister, she was not for house, homework, so it was decided immediately she goes to the office and I had to stay home.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What kind of business was he in?</span></p>

was my youth, and when I was, ah, in ’39--to make it short--in ’39 I was already 20, married, and, ah, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: How long, when did you marry?</span> <span id="s34">At what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: What”</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: At what age did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I, no...in twenty--when I was 26--my father would never have allowed me to marry because he got me too late and he wanted to have me home.</span> <span id="s38">But, ah, so we went together with my husband and then we married when I was 29--in the year ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Were you a religious family?</span> <span id="s40">Did you belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No, we went to the synagogue, in--to every, ah, holidays, I must tell you---every holiday.</span> <span id="s42">My sister was older than me, myself, she was, ah, two years older.</span> <span id="s43">And so, when she married---she married when she was 24--it was in the Temple, in the synagogue, and our Rabbi, he knew us very well, so he made a big speech--everybody cried.</span> <span id="s44">So, you know, I cried the most, and then I married.</span> <span id="s45">And then that was already ’39, so Hitler came to Germany.</span> <span id="s46">As you know, the.</span> <span id="s47">.</span> <span id="s48">no, you don’t know it, but you know it from this experience--in ’33—I think there was a Kristallnacht, as you remember.</span> <span id="s49">And we still stayed in Prague with my husband.</span> <span id="s50">And he still doesn’t say he’s Czech, he doesn’t want to go out.</span> <span id="s51">But then we had to...and...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What kind of work did your husband do?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My husband did a factory with neckties.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: He was the owner of the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yeah, with two brothers.</span> <span id="s56">There were three brothers.</span> <span id="s57">And, ah, in ’41 he was a collector of photo apparatus, you know.</span> <span id="s58">He was the best photo amateur in Prague, and when he was not, he was visiting people.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: So you were still in Prague in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I was still in Prague in 1939--in 1941--I was still in Prague.</span> <span id="s61">And before we were sent to the camp, he went to his store, to buy appliances for his photo material, photo material that he bought.</span> <span id="s62">And there was one boy, and he didn’t know it, and he was a German.</span> <span id="s63">And he knew about my husband--how many photo apparatus he had lost.</span> <span id="s64">And he bought a new one.</span> <span id="s65">And one--my husband invited him to my home and I always told him--don’t do it.</span> <span id="s66">Don’t.</span> <span id="s67">Aw, he’s a very good boy, he would never do...</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Why did you feel he shouldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s70">Instinct!</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Nothing that he actually said?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: My instinct.</span> <span id="s73">I was afraid of the Germans that were in Prague and I was afraid he heard tell of him.</span> <span id="s74">And really one day, they came at ten o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s75">My husband was in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s76">They rang the bell and they came and I knew that this SS.</span> <span id="s77">So I shouted to my husband, we never talked German we always talked Czech, but this time I talk German to give him time to recover.</span> <span id="s78">So I said in German, “Victor, there are two gentlemen who want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s79">He came out and he said, they said he has to go with then, with them.</span> <span id="s80">So I was awfully upset and he said, “Don’t be upset, he comes home, don’t be upset!”</span> <span id="s81">And he really came home.</span> <span id="s82">That was their tactic.</span> <span id="s83">They came one week, they took him to Peychek Pali in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What was that, a prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Peychek Pali?</span> <span id="s86">Peychek was the richest man in Prague, and he fled to--he went in time to the states, and they immediately occupied--SS immediately occupied the whole pali--it was a pali.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: SS means what?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: SS means what?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Sturmbahn--everybody knows what SS is.</span> <span id="s91">Oh, I can’t tell you...SS, with two stripes.</span> <span id="s92">You know, with the armbands.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Sturmbahnfuhrer?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Your husband will tell you what SS means.</span> <span id="s95">Sturmbahn...Anyway, so in downstairs, in the cellar, they had a torture chamber.</span> <span id="s96">They tortured the Jews.</span> <span id="s97">They wanted the Jews and they tortured my husband because he--they thought he make it for business.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: The pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: He made it for his own collection.</span> <span id="s100">He had collected like watches he collected, the best watches they wear in--he collected it.</span> <span id="s101">Like somebody collects pictures, he collected.</span> <span id="s102">So, and actually he came home at night.</span> <span id="s103">Oh, so we were so happy and everything after exactly one week--they came again--instead of seven, at six.</span> <span id="s104">They took him and finished, and he went to the, mmm ahh, to the ...So they took him to the jail and I was really not myself the whole day.</span> <span id="s105">In the evening I phoned our lawyer and ask him what could have happened?</span> <span id="s106">And they said don’t be upset, tomorrow morning you take a little valise and give pajamas and his toothbrush, and something in gold and they will let you in.</span> <span id="s107">So, really I did it.</span> <span id="s108">I was the first for him, and, ah, he went, he stayed there about two weeks and Then I started to make, to bribe the Germans, because you could bribe them with lots and lots of money, and they told me on the 28th, I will never forget, on the 28th of October he will be out.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: This is in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: 1941.</span> <span id="s111">And on the 28th of October, from the morning I was sitting and waiting yet he didn’t come.</span> <span id="s112">At that time, we had already the Jude, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: The “J”?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: The “J”.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: It stood for “Jew”.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I covered it.</span> <span id="s117">I went because we didn’t have any phones.</span> <span id="s118">We had to go out of our homes to the old town and I went to the telephone and I phoned the German, I was very courageous, you know.</span> <span id="s119">I phoned the German and said, you promised me that my husband will be out, and he didn’t come.</span> <span id="s120">He said, I forgot the 28th of October they don’t, they don’t let anybody out, because the 28th of October was the Revolution, the Czech Revolution, in nineteen hundred--in 1917.</span> <span id="s121">So he said, but tomorrow he’s coming--and he really came.</span> <span id="s122">He came on the 29th of October out of the jail.</span> <span id="s123">On that 30th of October, one day later, two Germans came--be prepared--in the afternoon you go to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: In the week between the first time the SS had picked him up and the second time, had he thought about leaving the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: No, he couldn’t have--anymore.</span> <span id="s126">How could he have left the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Had he thought about it before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: He didn’t think about it at all.</span> <span id="s129">I told you.</span> <span id="s130">He didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s131">Maybe he thought about it before he came into the jail, and that was much too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Did you think about it before...?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I thought about it from ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: What was the first--clues or inkling that you had that...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Anschluss in Austria.</span> <span id="s136">In Austria, when Schusnig was murdered, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: In what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: That was the first in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: That was in 1937.</span> <span id="s141">And we were still playing tennis like nothing in Prague and then came this awful--and that--then we knew--now it’s finished.</span> <span id="s142">And then my husband knew it too, but it was much too late.</span> <span id="s143">He would never have got a passport.</span> <span id="s144">He wouldn’t have got a visa, he wouldn’t have got anything.</span> <span id="s145">Who didn’t escape before this couldn’t escape any longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s147">I interrupted you, you were saying the following day they came and took...</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: The following day, without preparation.</span> <span id="s149">I remember my, I had a harmonica, hohner, you know.</span> <span id="s150">That was on the day the--we were at home--we had to leave everything and go.</span> <span id="s151">We had one valise but what could you pack into one valise?</span> <span id="s152">My husband had one valise and we had to go to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: They took both of you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Both.</span> <span id="s155">Both of us.</span> <span id="s156">And we went to the, eh, summer concentration in Prague when there were about, I don’t know--twelve hundred people.</span> <span id="s157">But you know, I have to laugh when somebody asked me, why didn’t you fight?</span> <span id="s158">With what?</span> <span id="s159">With what should we have fought?</span> <span id="s160">With what?</span> <span id="s161">We had pistols, silver.</span> <span id="s162">For every two hundred German SS, who would have killed you, they would have had very good work because they would have killed all of us and they didn’t have to spend money for the gas chambers and for everything.</span> <span id="s163">It would have been very easy.</span> <span id="s164">They would have killed--all of us.</span> <span id="s165">And so we had at least a hope--maybe we come home, not all, but maybe we come home.</span> <span id="s166">Can you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: I can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: I can’t.</span> <span id="s169">I can’t hear this at all when somebody says, why didn’t you fight?</span> <span id="s170">I was----------------------</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: At that point did you people in Czechoslovakia already know about the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No.</span> <span id="s173">We didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s174">Would you believe me when I tell you I three years in Theresienstadt and when they talked about gas chambers, I thought that’s not possible.</span> <span id="s175">That’s impossible.</span> <span id="s176">And, no, it--I don’t want to go ( words missing in original transcription) and if you want to tell me how it was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s177">Theresienstadt was a village where usually I lived in Czechoslovakia, where usually lived, free, it was a garrison, you know what they say, garrison?</span> <span id="s178">Where they--militant--where the...</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Yes, where the soldiers are quartered.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Soldiers were.</span> <span id="s181">Three thousand five hundred people in Theresienstadt all their lives.</span> <span id="s182">And when we came there were seventy thousand.</span> <span id="s183">So you can’t imagine how it looked like.</span> <span id="s184">We were in casserns-- in, in, um...</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: In barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: In barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Describe some of that, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: We had our valises and we slept on our valises, nothing else.</span> <span id="s189">If somebody was fortunate who could get a blanket, you had to bribe-- I don’t know whom-- to get only a small blanket, otherwise we slept...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: On the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: But, on the blanket-- on the val-- valises.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: The valises were on the floor, or you had bunk beds or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: On the floor.</span> <span id="s194">No, not in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s195">Not in the beginning, at least.</span> <span id="s196">No, no we slept the whole time on the valises.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: How did you get to Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s198">In cattle cars, or trains, or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: In cattle cars.</span> <span id="s200">There were no trains for us and from, from a station-- if you kill me I don’t know now the station-- we had to go on foot with all this valises.</span> <span id="s201">It took us about one hour, to come to the, um, place where we were incarcerated, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How far was Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: From Prague?</span> <span id="s204">Ah, normally maybe four hours but we, we had to, it took one whole day because we, then--they went one hour we were standing, you know, stopped.</span> <span id="s205">Another hour, so it took us the whole day.</span> <span id="s206">And when we arrived they--they knew that we are going to Auschwitz, they would take everything from us, but they didn’t take anything from us.</span> <span id="s207">So therefore, we slept on our valises, you know.</span> <span id="s208">So, and that in the beginning there was no food.</span> <span id="s209">It was not organized, of course.</span> <span id="s210">And so they boiled the water, put caraway seed into it, and that was the whole food.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: For how long a period?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And that was about three, four months before we got potatoes, so they put some potatoes in the soup and we could get packages, you know.</span> <span id="s213">They--of course--if you got a package like I got from my friend every month, at least she put something that was interesting like, ah, sardines or she put lots of liquor, wine or something that--all they took.</span> <span id="s214">They give us--gave us only, they put some--I don’t know—whatever--rice or something that they gave us.</span> <span id="s215">And then later on we had a little oven and that was, ah, organized.</span> <span id="s216">Every room, you know, from the barrack, had a special times they have an hour to cook something.</span> <span id="s217">But it came much, much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Did many people perish during those few months when they had no food?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: The old .</span> <span id="s220">They couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s221">Not with this food...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: It doesn’t sound like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, they couldn’t survive in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s224">But later it was better.</span> <span id="s225">I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s226">One of my friends had a friend, a man who was, like, ah, manager of the garden outside the, in the camp, and she took me with her.</span> <span id="s227">So we were outside.</span> <span id="s228">My late husband, he was the happiest person in God’s earth because to go out of the stench, out of this misery, from seventy thousand people being in this little, little town, it was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Were you actually in the town or where the barracks outside of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: No, no, it was in town.</span> <span id="s231">In town.</span> <span id="s232">It was, anyway, who survived in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s233">And when we came to Auschwitz we always said--I would like to be one month in Theresienstadt and one day in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s234">You know we changed...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: There was that much of a contrast.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Of course, it was much, much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: How long were you in Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: In Theresienstadt I was, eh three and a half years, nearly.</span> <span id="s239">We were fortunate, really very fortunate.</span> <span id="s240">And then we went, our man, five thousand people.</span> <span id="s241">I think you heard about it, five thousand people, every week or twice a week had to go.</span> <span id="s242">And we asked them to write us, but they had the order to write, “I’m very well” and so on, you know.</span> <span id="s243">So what can you take out of it?</span> <span id="s244">I thought it’s a camp where they have to work.</span> <span id="s245">So I went to the office in Theresienstadt and asked that I wanted to go, on my own whim.</span> <span id="s246">And you know, they didn’t let me go.</span> <span id="s247">And for the third time, they let me go.</span> <span id="s248">I didn’t see my husband anymore.</span> <span id="s249">I went to Auschwitz on my own free will, maybe I would have survived in Theresienstadt, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Up until the time you left Theresienstadt were you and your husband together?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Never.</span> <span id="s252">I tell you, I came to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: No, at Theresienstadt, were you with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: The whole time.</span> <span id="s255">In Theresienstadt we were together and, ah he was, ah, ghetto service-like a ghetto cop.</span> <span id="s256">So, he got a room.</span> <span id="s257">I was in this room with my sister and her husband and two children and in the middle they had a curtain and on the other there was a small room like this.</span> <span id="s258">Not so long like this, in the middle a curtain and she was on one side, I was on the other side because I didn’t want her to be with the children in the, in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: My father was dead.</span> <span id="s261">Unfortunately my father died when the Germans started to get the businesses.</span> <span id="s262">He always said to us, “Children, I won’t let a German touch my family, I kill him.”</span> <span id="s263">So we were always afraid, and he got pneumonia and died, fortunately.</span> <span id="s264">One week later they came, and he was already dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Can you tell me some particular incidents that stand out in your memory from these experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes I could.</span> <span id="s267">In Theresienstadt for instance, suddenly they came.</span> <span id="s268">Everybody has to go to a certain place in the forest.</span> <span id="s269">Immediately, that was always immediately, so we didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s270">Later we knew what happened, what should have happened.</span> <span id="s271">So, we went--without food, without anything and they let us stand there, standing the whole day.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: In the forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: In the forest--standing the whole day.</span> <span id="s274">We didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s275">Everybody was guessing.</span> <span id="s276">But not why.</span> <span id="s277">And in the evening they came, one-two-three, one-two-three, go, go, go!</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Was this in cold weather?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: And, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Was this in cold weather?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Cold weather.</span> <span id="s282">And afterwards we knew they wanted to kill us all...</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: That’s why they sent you there</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: That’s why.</span> <span id="s285">They wanted us to be in the end--and then they changed their minds.</span> <span id="s286">I don’t know why, alright.</span> <span id="s287">And I don’t know until now, it’s only guessing why they changed their minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: What is your guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: My guess is that they didn’t want the Red Cross, actually.</span> <span id="s290">Wars should have come to Mondria, to Theresienstadt, and they didn’t want this to happen.</span> <span id="s291">And that was a farce, the Red, the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s292">Imagine after one week after this happened they started to make a little circus.</span> <span id="s293">They started to make a lake, they started to make a beach.</span> <span id="s294">Would you believe it?</span> <span id="s295">The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: In Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s298">We didn’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s299">The children were told that they said, Uncle Schneider, that was, (words missing in original transcription) the German who, were the boss of the whole camp.</span> <span id="s300">We have a game chotla(?)</span> <span id="s301">, they were taught, little babies, they were taught to tell, and, ah, so it went on for month and then we heard the Red Cross coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: So they were trying to put on a show for...?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah, a show.</span> <span id="s304">They came, they saw it.</span> <span id="s305">The children went to bed.</span> <span id="s306">Awful German who was in Theresienstadt came, “Uncle Schneider can we have piece of chocolate?”</span> <span id="s307">“Oh, sure, darling.”</span> <span id="s308">He put the chocolate out of reach, they never saw a chocolate in their life in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s309">And, thank you!</span> <span id="s310">uncle.</span> <span id="s311">The other child came, “Oh you gave me chocolate, you want to give me chocolate again?”</span> <span id="s312">Such a shock.</span> <span id="s313">One wouldn’t believe it, that it is possible.</span> <span id="s314">After all this--as soon as they vanished, as soon as they went, everything vanished--in no time at all.</span> <span id="s315">And Theresienstadt was Theresienstadt again; how it used to be, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: We hear when reading the history of the Holocaust that there were selection lines when people came into the camps.</span> <span id="s317">Were you exposed to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: That was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s319">That was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s320">In Theresienstadt we didn’t have no selections.</span> <span id="s321">In Theresienstadt I heard they started to build the gas chamber but it was already too late, you know, you were at the end of ’44 and as you know, the Russians, they had no, ah, success anymore and Hitler was nearly fatally ill with his imaginations, so we didn’t came to it.</span> <span id="s322">And Hitler gave the order every young woman has to work.</span> <span id="s323">So when we came to...so I came to Auschwitz to save faith.</span> <span id="s324">I tell you a little story.</span> <span id="s325">I had a friend and she thought I was pregnant in Aush--in Theresienstadt too, but I had to have an abortion.</span> <span id="s326">They didn’t allow children.</span> <span id="s327">And my friend, I don’t know how it came, she had her birth, and she had twins.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: In the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: In the camp.</span> <span id="s330">And on the day when I went to--to Auschwitz there were all the children with their mothers on the platform before the train came and I was afraid they will leave me in Theresienstadt because I wanted to go to my husband, so I begged her--give me one child of yours, that they let me go.</span> <span id="s331">That was that--that same day, and she said, no, no, no--I keep them.</span> <span id="s332">If I would have had a child, do you know what Mengeles said, that was so and so.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: So, and so meaning that...</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: That means, that goes to the gas chamber...That goes for work.</span> <span id="s335">And we didn’t know that that meant the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s336">So these little things happened.</span> <span id="s337">My sister--my sister was with her two children in Theresienstadt and when I went, I thought, to the camp where my husband was, I came to her, I said, Addie, what will Paul say, that was her husband, when I come along and she said to me, I will never forget--she said to me, “If you have to go, go Lilly.</span> <span id="s338">I don’t go, because I had the order of my husband to stay and wait for him in Theresienstadt”.</span> <span id="s339">If she would have gone with the two children I would have gone with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: You said that when you left Theresienstadt your husband remained there?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: My husband was--you didn’t understand...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: That’s why I’m asking, to clarify it for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: My husband went maybe one week before I went.</span> <span id="s344">He went with the 5,000 men.</span> <span id="s345">We were, the whole night, we didn’t sleep, the train didn’t come because at that time already the Germans needed every train for the military.</span> <span id="s346">But, and we were so happy maybe the train won’t come anymore.</span> <span id="s347">But the train came.</span> <span id="s348">So my husband, and my husband told me.</span> <span id="s349">“Without you, I won’t survive.”</span> <span id="s350">And these words, I have in my brain every minute of my stay.</span> <span id="s351">So, I decide, I’d go after him.</span> <span id="s352">So after one week, as I told you before, I went to the office in Theresienstadt and told them I go on my own free will.</span> <span id="s353">So two times they didn’t want me, the third time I..</span> <span id="s354">.</span> <span id="s355">the boss of the...I can’t...the Jew, it was the Jewish office.</span> <span id="s356">So he said, if you want to go, go--because he knew what’s awaiting me.</span> <span id="s357">He knew it, that the (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s358">That’s the story, and I went after him one week and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s359">He was, he...We were in the women’s camp and they were in the men’s camp and he was not in there, Auschwitz anymore, they went to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you ever find out what had become of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah, when I came to Prague.</span> <span id="s362">I..</span> <span id="s363">.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: After the war when I came.</span> <span id="s366">I escaped, it was quite a story what would take you five hours when I would tell you how I escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Well we will get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: But after the war, we had always signs in every coffee house, like Usted’s, Victor Usted’s born this and this day and went to Dachau and Auschwitz and Greenberg(?)</span> <span id="s369">, I don’t know where every, and if somebody can give me, ah, information.</span> <span id="s370">Nobody came, and we, remember we were five, so always talking, “Did you...?</span> <span id="s371">No.”</span> <span id="s372">So one day one of my friends, she said, did you go to this and this street and there is an office and there you can make out where is your husband.</span> <span id="s373">So the next day, I went, of course, because I thought maybe he is a, lying somewhere and I am here.</span> <span id="s374">So the first man said no, he’s not under the um, ah, (words missing in original transcript) and the second, a, give me the same, and then they told me--why don’t you go to this man.</span> <span id="s375">So I went, and he looked, and I hadn’t found him.</span> <span id="s376">But this is already the end of this, so this is not interesting anymore for you because this is the end, so let’s go back to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Alright, tell me how you got to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I got to Auschwitz, you know how I told you, by train.</span> <span id="s379">We, we--it took us about three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Auschwitz was how far away in miles from Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: I’m not really—Auschwitz is in Poland.</span> <span id="s382">And maybe, normally from Theresienstadt, I don’t know how many hours, but eh, you can imagine, it’s not abroad, it’s only Poland and Czechoslovakia--border of Czechoslovakia is Poland, so it was maybe even four hours, but it took us three days.</span> <span id="s383">And, eh, with women and children in this train, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s384">I will never forget there were a lovely woman with three children.</span> <span id="s385">She looked like a queen, and the children had such lovely voices of their singing.</span> <span id="s386">All of them end in the gas chamber, you know.</span> <span id="s387">That was a tragedy anyway.</span> <span id="s388">When we arrived in a..</span> <span id="s389">.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Did they provide food on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Were there toilet facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: We had something with us--bread, but how long does it take--three days?</span> <span id="s394">We are all hungry.</span> <span id="s395">No food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s396">We went to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s397">Birkenau is actually a camp next to Auschwitz, but mostly for gas chambers.</span> <span id="s398">In Auschwitz are political, eh, lots of political prisoners and gentiles who don’t go to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s399">But Birkenau is a Jewish camp where everybody had to go, later or, ah--or sooner, to the--to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s400">So when we arrived we came one after--first of all the Kapo.</span> <span id="s401">The Kapo is, ah, ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Kapo.</span> <span id="s403">K-a-p-o?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: K-a-p-o or c-a-p-o, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s405">They went, as soon as the, eh, the train stops in, ah, in Birkenau, they come into the train, they take, and boom, they, eh, throw you out of the--and everythings stays in the train.</span> <span id="s406">That’s what I said.</span> <span id="s407">In Theresienstadt at least we had our own nightshirts or something.</span> <span id="s408">In Birkenau, Auschwitz you’d have nothing.</span> <span id="s409">Nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s410">Only the money what we had on us and this--this started to...the, the whole way until we went for cutting of the hair that full with money, because we knew we had to give it up.</span> <span id="s411">Our, our watches.</span> <span id="s412">I stamped on this, you know.</span> <span id="s413">Everybody, did...So when we arrived at the platforms, the children and their mothers, they had to go, ah, eh, right and we went left.</span> <span id="s414">So we came.</span> <span id="s415">It was like not even anywheres lived like this.</span> <span id="s416">It was a bunker.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Bunker is like a trench in the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: A bunker, yah, and we were like crouched inside--five girls--when we wanted to turn, we had to turn four of us because it was just for one person and we laid five.</span> <span id="s419">And we are always to tell, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s420">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s421">Every Thursday was selection day.</span> <span id="s422">That’s what you asked me.</span> <span id="s423">Every one whom they selected had to walk in the middle of the room with a platform like this.</span> <span id="s424">And like martyrs they had to walk naked.</span> <span id="s425">And, eh, again, ah, ah, either left or right, either she stayed, or she had to go on this side.</span> <span id="s426">At that time we knew already she goes to the gas.</span> <span id="s427">I remember when I lived in Birkenau, Auschwitz so that when I saw so much smoke and I asked one of the girls, she was Polish, and I asked her, where is the smoke coming from?</span> <span id="s428">And she started to shout at me and she said, “Be quiet--you don’t see any smoke.”</span> <span id="s429">That was the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s430">That was already from the people who arrived with us.</span> <span id="s431">She didn’t tell me.</span> <span id="s432">She was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: What was your life like during the ordinary day there?</span> <span id="s434">What did you do?</span> <span id="s435">Did they have you working, or what did you do...?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: In the beginning, we didn’t work.</span> <span id="s437">We were selected for work, you know, but we didn’t work.</span> <span id="s438">They had to organize it, where to go...I will never forget, I saw a little bit of--I saw a little bit of, eh, whatever I found.</span> <span id="s439">I used (words missing in original transcript) like a crazy woman.</span> <span id="s440">And we had these, Holland, eh, Dutch sandals, you know, and it was mud, and sometimes we had to run from one place to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: With wooden Dutch, the wooden shoes that Dutch use?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: The wooden shoes, the Dutch wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s443">And, eh, you can imagine when we stepped in the mud, the shoes stayed inside so you had to--and that was one (words missing in original transcript) he was (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s444">So I always run around with only--without the sandals.</span> <span id="s445">I kept it in my hand because I couldn’t run thru it.</span> <span id="s446">Now, and one day, I will never forget, we had very, very little--only potatoes to eat, and potatoes--ya--that was fortunate too--when I in (words missing in original transcript) Theresienstadt--when I lost my job in the garden, and that was only because a friend of mine waited for her daughter, and she asked me if I could take her with, with me--out.</span> <span id="s447">So I said--it was Yom Kippur--I will never forget.</span> <span id="s448">And I said to her...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Out where?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: In, that was still in Theresienstadt, now I come back to the story...</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: But where did she want you to take her out to?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Because she was waiting for her daughter.</span> <span id="s453">And the daughter, as I told you, we walked one and a half hour with all the valises.</span> <span id="s454">And she wanted to see her daughter, can you...it’s nothing--she wanted to go out to see her daughter.</span> <span id="s455">I said to her, I asked, I talked.</span> <span id="s456">I called her mommy because she was older than I, much older.</span> <span id="s457">And I said, “Mommy, if I take you.”</span> <span id="s458">I was the leader of these girls, anger.</span> <span id="s459">And never were only a girl, there was always six girls, sometimes they had flu or something.</span> <span id="s460">So I said, “If I take you, you have to promise me that you won’t run to, to her, because if you run to her you make me unhappy and you make yourself unhappy, I tell you because contraband was not allowed.”</span> <span id="s461">And if that German was in the group with us, we never knew somewhere, and she runs, and her daughter has contraband, you know, eh, contraband means lots of things what they had, conserves or something--so that was the worst what she could do.</span> <span id="s462">And she said, “No, no, no, I swear to God I don’t want to run.</span> <span id="s463">I want only to see her.”</span> <span id="s464">I said, “Even if you see her with her children, and even if she has lots of (words missing in original transcript) leave her alone.”</span> <span id="s465">What do you think she did?</span> <span id="s466">The first thing what she did--she saw her daughter--she runs to her.</span> <span id="s467">And next to me was a German (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s468">He said to me, what’s your name.</span> <span id="s469">I know already, but I was afraid he send me to Auschwitz, it was in ’42.</span> <span id="s470">after Heidrich, you know when Heidrich was killed; you don’t remember.</span> <span id="s471">(words missing in original transcript) And so he said to me my name and I should come to the office.</span> <span id="s472">And she had to go with her husband immediately to Auschwitz...</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: As a punishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Punishment.</span> <span id="s475">As a punishment.</span> <span id="s476">And I told her that was on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s477">You remember such little stories...Anyway, (words missing in original transcript) and when I came, ya, and in Auschwitz we stayed about, eh, three weeks.</span> <span id="s478">It was like five years.</span> <span id="s479">And then they ordered us for work.</span> <span id="s480">I didn’t finish with the selection.</span> <span id="s481">The girls were naked, you mentioned.</span> <span id="s482">Five SS and they had to parade to and fro and if she was too thin, she, if she had something on like this, I have now, she went to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: It was very humiliating.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Aw!</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: As well as...</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: You know that what was the most humiliating.</span> <span id="s487">When we wanted to go to the toilet --toilets!</span> <span id="s488">holes only--we had to go with the SS, a German.</span> <span id="s489">Could you believe that?</span> <span id="s490">And there was a time exactly when you can go--in the morning--the whole day not--at six o’clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s491">Whatever you did you had to wait until six o’clock.</span> <span id="s492">So, the old woman couldn’t go there, of course, and they died because eh, it was something that they couldn’t keep and when they made it a..</span> <span id="s493">.</span> <span id="s494">ah, I can’t even tell you.</span> <span id="s495">,,,Then we went for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: What kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: We had to, eh, work, how do you call--schitengarten for the military to make holes that they can hide, eh, when the camions came, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Like bunkers?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Bunkers.</span> <span id="s500">Like bunker.</span> <span id="s501">And we had to do it.</span> <span id="s502">So that, ah, went on in the morning at five o’clock so we had to get up because--black coffee, one piece of bread for the whole day, and we had to go for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: That was hard physical labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Hard physical labor, without food, therefore so many died.</span> <span id="s505">For nothing didn’t die six million people.</span> <span id="s506">And, eh, when, then came the, the kettles with soup, but it was quite some way before they came (words missing in original transcript), you know.</span> <span id="s507">It come half, half full.</span> <span id="s508">So everybody got a few spoons of, eh, eh, soup and that was all.</span> <span id="s509">In the evening we came and we get again a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s510">I don’t know how I survived.</span> <span id="s511">I don’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Were you still able to get food packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No.</span> <span id="s514">Not in Auschwitz, oh no, not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s515">And so it went, and the last day we stayed in this camp, I remember came meat.</span> <span id="s516">That was the first time we got meat.</span> <span id="s517">And the same day, the Russians were very near already, and the same day, the German said, everybody in five minutes has to go out.</span> <span id="s518">There were girls with typhus, they were on the carriage, and they were shot in front of us, all of them--thirty.</span> <span id="s519">Then there were huts where the girls who were carriers of typhus...They had typhus but they didn’t know it, but they were carrying the bug.</span> <span id="s520">So they were separated too, naked of course.</span> <span id="s521">They were shot in front of us.</span> <span id="s522">Then we started to walk, it was marsh.</span> <span id="s523">There is so called marsh.</span> <span id="s524">And we started to walk and it was so cold that only food what we had was snow, what we ate on our way.</span> <span id="s525">So I, after maybe two weeks, I said to my friend, we will never survive, because we saw immediately who was, eh, this time to die.</span> <span id="s526">They got big eyes, they got big bellies...and we knew exactly they die.</span> <span id="s527">So I said, I will escape.</span> <span id="s528">However it is, if they shoot me, it’s better than this.</span> <span id="s529">So she said, please, please take me with you.</span> <span id="s530">She lived in Montega(?)</span> <span id="s531">.</span> <span id="s532">So I took her with me and now that fate started, one day, yeah, the whole day we walked.</span> <span id="s533">In the evenings the Germans went into the city because in where we walked thru the forest that nobody sees us.</span> <span id="s534">In the evenings they went to the city in schools, in barracks, whatever...</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: What time of year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: It was in, eh, nineteen hundred, eh, beginning nineteen hundred, no--end of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: In the winter then?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: It was such a winter, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s539">If your husband, or, but it was the coldest winter what I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: So, on top of no food, you didn’t have adequate clothing...</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: So one day, we went to eh, eh, how do you call where—Baden...and I said to my friend, “Don’t talk with me.”</span> <span id="s542">Yeah, she was Czech, she couldn’t speak German so I always told her, “Don’t speak, don’t speak.”</span> <span id="s543">So, I said to her, “Do what I do.”</span> <span id="s544">And in the middle of the barn there was a ladder up.</span> <span id="s545">So I started, when I saw everybody was sleeping, I start to go out.</span> <span id="s546">And there was hay, and she went after me and we were, and I thought we are saved.</span> <span id="s547">So she said, “What will you do, what will you do?”</span> <span id="s548">I said, “We will see what happen.”</span> <span id="s549">In the morning I heard a like this--get up, get up, get up.</span> <span id="s550">And we stayed, we didn’t get up, we stayed.</span> <span id="s551">And we slept the first time after a long, long time.</span> <span id="s552">And then suddenly we heard dogs...</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Were there just the two of you in the barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: We didn’t know!</span> <span id="s555">The two of us...later...and then we heard dogs and we had--we heard people, and they had sticks and they put the sticks in every barn, in every barrel, and everywhere and they had had us and they put me out and they put her out and then we saw...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Who were these people?</span> <span id="s557">Farmers?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Germans.</span> <span id="s559">Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Not soldiers, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Not soldiers.</span> <span id="s562">The Germans from the village where we were.</span> <span id="s563">I don’t even know why because they took us everywhere.</span> <span id="s564">And everything was in the vicinity of maybe five miles.</span> <span id="s565">Around and round.</span> <span id="s566">And, and then I saw there were fifteen women hidden in this....</span> <span id="s567">So in the morning, that was in the morning when they left already, so I remember I went to him, I asked him and begged me to shoot me.</span> <span id="s568">This I remember very well because I knew if we come to the camp they will shoot us anyway.</span> <span id="s569">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Who was it that you asked to shoot you?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: The German.</span> <span id="s572">One of the Germans.</span> <span id="s573">(words missing in original transcript) all of them, and a Nazi may be a Nazi from the, the village.</span> <span id="s574">So they took us all, and we had to go in a carriage and they said no, you go to the camp, I won’t shoot you--they would shoot you--I won’t shoot you.</span> <span id="s575">And now what happened, I gained faith--I remember it was a hill down.</span> <span id="s576">And we went down and behind was a soldier with a bayonet.</span> <span id="s577">I wanted to jump and stay.</span> <span id="s578">And we had to go, and suddenly, we came to the road and then there are hundreds and hundreds of those.</span> <span id="s579">Carriages with, with eh, like in historic times, you know, in times when they wandered from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s580">In those...</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Like gypsy caravans?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Like gypsy, yah--caravan.</span> <span id="s583">And everybody screamed, everybody cried, “The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming.”</span> <span id="s584">They didn’t, they didn’t fear the English or the Americans or the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Begin Side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">You wouldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s587">The Germans jumped out of the carriage.</span> <span id="s588">They didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s589">They came to me and they said to me, “Listen, we are going back.”</span> <span id="s590">They were afraid of the Russians too.</span> <span id="s591">“We are going back.</span> <span id="s592">Over the bridge is your camp.</span> <span id="s593">You guarantee that you bring all the women to this camp.”</span> <span id="s594">I was standing there because I was perfect in German, so I said, “Okay, okay, I’m going to bring everybody to the camp.”</span> <span id="s595">They turned their carriage and went back and left us.</span> <span id="s596">So, we went to the--over the bridge, And I said to all the girls, “Girls, go wherever you want.</span> <span id="s597">I go somewhere and you go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s598">We can’t stay together.</span> <span id="s599">They would catch us and they will bring us.”</span> <span id="s600">So I went with my friend to the first--in the first door of eh, of eh, cafeteria was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: This was in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: That was in Poland.</span> <span id="s603">And we came into the laundry room.</span> <span id="s604">And now what--so we were sitting there and suddenly the door opened and the man came, and I didn’t know if he’s German, German--and suddenly he said to me, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s605">And on the accent I recognized he’s Czech.</span> <span id="s606">And I started to speak Czech to him and I said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s607">I am, he was lieutenant to a German, he was a--he’s a--how do you call?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Assistant?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: He’s not assistant.</span> <span id="s610">He...he, ah...cleaned his shoes and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Aide?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yea, aide.</span> <span id="s613">And so I told him, we are from the camp and we are here and I don’t know what to do and the camp is very near here--the other camp.</span> <span id="s614">He said, “You can’t go--and you can’t go where the Germans go--you go opposite because the Germans go, ah, to the Germans.</span> <span id="s615">You go opposite.</span> <span id="s616">So--I--you can walk only at night, during the day you have to hide.”</span> <span id="s617">So that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So you had to hide from the Germans at night or the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: We had to hide for the Russians.</span> <span id="s620">Now we went where the Germans were not.</span> <span id="s621">We went to the Russians.</span> <span id="s622">You know, one--eh--one road went like this--to the Germans--and one road went against--they went through the Russians.</span> <span id="s623">They went through the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: What was the prevailing attitude of the Polish people towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: We didn’t meet any Polish people.</span> <span id="s626">What do you mean Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: When you said the...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yea...all the time with the Germans.</span> <span id="s629">We were all the time with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: But wasn’t the concentration camp in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yea--but that had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s632">There was a German concentration camp in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s633">I told you I can’t even know if we got out--we went round and round.</span> <span id="s634">We--they went with us during the night and during the day in the forest, in the evening we went some school or whatever, we had to sleep on the floors--and so I escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: How long did it take you to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Umm, it took me a long time but I was the first who came to Prague.</span> <span id="s637">It was May the first--first, nineteen hundred eighty--uhh--nineteen hundred forty-five.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: What did you find when you got back to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: When I got to Prague I didn’t know that my husband is dead and I had my, eh, sister-in-law where I used--where we both said we will meet.</span> <span id="s640">So I went to her and when I went up the stairs to--I thought I will never see my husband because I had dreams.</span> <span id="s641">He had very strong glasses and I was always dreaming that the Germans took the glasses from him and...so I came and Martha, that was my sister-in-law, and the first thing I said, “Victor is here.”</span> <span id="s642">She said, “No.”</span> <span id="s643">And I sit down and started to cry.</span> <span id="s644">She said, “You are the first I see who came from the camp.”</span> <span id="s645">She had--her husband is a gentile, you know.</span> <span id="s646">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So she never had to leave Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: She never had to leave Prague.</span> <span id="s649">He saved her.</span> <span id="s650">She left maybe for three months only.</span> <span id="s651">And so, and then afterwards, comes the story what I telled you--we are looking for our husband.</span> <span id="s652">That was after I went to her.</span> <span id="s653">But with the Russians--I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s654">This story I wouldn’t tell—because that was something...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Did you ever encounter any Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Heh!</span> <span id="s657">What do you mean encounter?</span> <span id="s658">One day I was with the Germans and they—I had--here, you see my arm.</span> <span id="s659">I had a, um, blood poisoning from working too hard.</span> <span id="s660">And, ah, um, we were at the, at the--we were on the street all the time and sometimes somebody gave us a few pennies.</span> <span id="s661">So we saved up only for the coffee and for sitting down somewhere because we had so much water in our shoes.</span> <span id="s662">So one day we came to such a place and there was an oven in the middle of it, and I..</span> <span id="s663">.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: There was a what in the middle?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: It was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: No, you said there was something in the middle of it...</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: An oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: An oven?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: An oven.</span> <span id="s670">And that was heated.</span> <span id="s671">So I went straight to the oven and took off my shoes.</span> <span id="s672">I started to arrange my stocking--there was water in it--and suddenly the owner of this was standing there.</span> <span id="s673">I had already a story in my mind, you know.</span> <span id="s674">I didn’t want them to think we are Jewish, eh, ah, because they would give us immediately to the police.</span> <span id="s675">So we started--—I started to say we are Polish girls.</span> <span id="s676">We are Polish, our--our cam--our camp, because there are lots of Polish camps in .</span> <span id="s677">(words missing in original transcript), our camp was--ah dismantled, there were nobody in and we are on our own and we have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s678">So he said, “Would you like to work?”</span> <span id="s679">And I said, “Yes, I would like to work for my food and for--that I can sleep somewhere”--because we slept in the--in the forest--we didn’t sleep because it was cold--we stand there--anyway, it’s unbelievable what--that’s the truth.</span> <span id="s680">So he said, “You know what--stay here, in the evening there is here a meeting and we will decide.”</span> <span id="s681">Imagine, we two Jewish girls stay there--there were about twenty Germans—and he said, “I have here two Polish girls who can’t be in the camp anymore because the camp is now closed--would you need somebody for work--they want to work.”</span> <span id="s682">So there came a small German, a big German--one took me and one took my friend.</span> <span id="s683">That was the first time she gave me--I was sleeping in a bed.</span> <span id="s684">I will never forget it in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: After how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: After four years.</span> <span id="s687">I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s688">And I would have done anything.</span> <span id="s689">So she came and she said, “Can you milk a cow?”</span> <span id="s690">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s691">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s692">So, “Can you?”</span> <span id="s693">Everything I said, “Yes I do.”</span> <span id="s694">In the morning she came and she brought me ah----ah--this--ah, schmatas--um--how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Trousers?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: No, no--not trousers—ah--now I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s697">Front cross anyway—from—from—ah--from some sack--a sack.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Oh a sack.</span> <span id="s699">Like a flour sack?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeh, a flour sack.</span> <span id="s701">And she said, go with me.</span> <span id="s702">So I go with her and I begged to what I prayed that I will be able to close my hand.</span> <span id="s703">At that time I couldn’t close my hand from the bump...and she gave me a stool and I was sitting under the cow and I didn’t close my hand properly--she looked at me and she start to go.</span> <span id="s704">I took this stool to the second cow, to the third cow--until I started really to cry.</span> <span id="s705">And she came, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s706">I said that happened in the camp--in my Polish camp--and, “Look--I can’t close my hand.”</span> <span id="s707">So she looked at me, she said, “Okay, I will do it.”</span> <span id="s708">She was a good woman because she knew it—eh--finished, you know.</span> <span id="s709">So she said, and she was such a woman--if she was four feet--I don’t know--but she was sitting like this--and she--she took all this what the cows--the dirt from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: The manure?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yea, manure.</span> <span id="s712">And she put it--I couldn’t even do it, so I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s713">In the evening we prayed grace.</span> <span id="s714">I prayed with them, and what, that was faith, there was eh-some-eh--knitting what she give.</span> <span id="s715">And I asked her, what is she doing?</span> <span id="s716">And she said, “I have to finish this pullover and I never have time.”</span> <span id="s717">And I said to her, “Would you allow me to finish it for you because I am very good in knitting.”</span> <span id="s718">She just looked at me, she said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s719">So I stayed up the whole night.</span> <span id="s720">I finished it for her.</span> <span id="s721">In the morning we came--and five o’clock I came too--and I brought it--I said, “I finished it for you.”</span> <span id="s722">So she saved me--and since then I was the knitter of this little village.</span> <span id="s723">I had my food, I went back to this woman to sleep and I was knitting--you know--that’s fate what I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Yes, that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yea--so after this time one day we got up and she said to me, “Unfortunately, now you are on your own.”</span> <span id="s726">The Russians were very near.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: By this time the war is still going on...</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Oh sure--of course, the Russians came always nearer and nearer and nearer.</span> <span id="s729">And the Russians fought for every small village--even if five hundred people, they fought for it.</span> <span id="s730">So she said to me, “Here, have a piece of salami, and here you have a piece of bread and you are on your own.”</span> <span id="s731">So I thank her because they went to the bunker they had--and she said, “We have a bunker--but only for the two of us.”</span> <span id="s732">So I went to my friend.</span> <span id="s733">My friend was still in bed, and I said, don’t you want to go up, the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s734">She said, naaa--they talk about it so long the Russians are coming--and suddenly, I saw a Russian in front of me and I said to her, you know what--the Russians here.</span> <span id="s735">She got up so quick that you can’t remember.</span> <span id="s736">So when we--I went to the woman and I said to her--she should give me all the cigarettes she had .</span> <span id="s737">So she give me the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s738">I knew only one expression in Russian, straustuet(?)</span> <span id="s739">, that means everything--good morning, good afternoon--I don’t know--I don’t know.</span> <span id="s740">Anyway they looked at me and they said, where we are coming from, and I said, from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s741">So that I gave them cigarettes and everything.</span> <span id="s742">And then came--eh--so a lieutenant and higher military and he told me we have to go--we should go with him--because here is no good.</span> <span id="s743">But that was the first military who came--and they are the worst--they are the Mongols and all this.</span> <span id="s744">And we are in this room and there are Mongols.</span> <span id="s745">Did you see a Mongol?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Well, I don’t think I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: A Russian...You have never seen something like this in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Ca you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: You can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s750">Short--all of them were short--very heavy, with beast eyes, with beast noses, with their mouths open and big teeth.</span> <span id="s751">Not--if I met him at night, I die.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Very fierce and frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Very, very--and I went to her (words missing in original transcript) and I took a knife and I said to her, “I have enough.</span> <span id="s754">I will slash my veins.”</span> <span id="s755">And she took the knife from me and said, “Don’t do this.”</span> <span id="s756">At that moment, I saw in the room, Stalin, you know--you remember Stalin?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Yes, of course I remember who Stalin was.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: I took the picture.</span> <span id="s759">I don’t know why--and they all--door opened and the higher military man came in.</span> <span id="s760">And he asked me and I said--I told him I’m Czechoslovakian.</span> <span id="s761">I told him, “Look what I have the whole time with me.”</span> <span id="s762">And I showed him Stalin.</span> <span id="s763">You have no idea what they did--how they adored Stalin.</span> <span id="s764">He sat down, he looked at the photo like a sad man and he said look she had the whole time Stalin with her, our father Stalin.</span> <span id="s765">So he took us too and went with us to another barrack and in this barrack we stayed for about two days and then he told us we should go because in the other villages there is already order--not in this village.</span> <span id="s766">So we went to the other villages and so we survived.</span> <span id="s767">One day I went to the Russian officer and I ask him if we can’t go home.</span> <span id="s768">It was about the end of--ah--end of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: 1945.</span> <span id="s771">And so he said, ah--I will send you home with one of the trains.</span> <span id="s772">I didn’t believe him, but really after three days he came and he said, be ready in five minutes.</span> <span id="s773">We have nothing.</span> <span id="s774">So anyway we were ready.</span> <span id="s775">And so we went with the trains, but you don’t know what the Russians did, you know.</span> <span id="s776">Seventy-year-old women, seventy-year-old women even, they, ah, raped.</span> <span id="s777">And we were hiding all the time--in the cellar, in the abbey, wherever we were hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: It sounds from the way you describe it as though you were more afraid of the Russians than you had ever been afraid of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: I can say merely that the Germans had another method, you know.</span> <span id="s780">They had--the Germans in Auschwitz had their own whores--Jewish women.</span> <span id="s781">Did you read the Death of a Salesman?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Did you read the story how she was a whore of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: And she took her own life.</span> <span id="s786">That’s what the Germans did.</span> <span id="s787">And they took only the nicest, the prettiest girls what they could find.</span> <span id="s788">The Germans, for the Russian, that was the same—they wanted sex and they raped everybody.</span> <span id="s789">That was the difference...the choice is very difficult for me to make, you know--very difficult for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: When you got back to Prague was there ever a time when the war was officially declared over and there was a sense of celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Oh ya, oh ya--at--actually, the Germans didn’t bombard Prague very much.</span> <span id="s792">It was not too much damage done with the--Prague--to Prague, because as you know, Chamberlain went to--German--to--uh--Berchtesgaden in Germany to talk with Hitler and--and--ah--they made the pact that they want the Sudetenland and part of--uh--Czechoslovakia, and then they took it all so they--they didn’t fight.</span> <span id="s793">So they didn’t bombard Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s794">I came on the march on May the fifth, and on May the tenth--until May the tenth--it was not--not even order enough in Prague.</span> <span id="s795">When they saw some Germans with white stocking, they throw them into the river--the Czechs, you know.</span> <span id="s796">But then it was very, very--eh--soon there were--wasn’t any Prague.</span> <span id="s797">At the end of May, there were order--nobody can forget the time, not even the Czechs, not even-- not only the Jews but not even the Czechs because there were lots of communists, lots of communists in Czechoslovakia at the end--and they are all taken to the concentration camp, so they didn’t have it so easy too--not only the Jews--but, uh, to be frank.</span> <span id="s798">But, of course, the Jews took the biggest deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: After you went back to your sister-in-law and asked if your husband was there and she said no, from then on how did you get your life back together again?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s801">I didn’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s802">I had one friend who lived next to me and she was with me from morning till evening--ever afraid I will make suicide, or something.</span> <span id="s803">And as soon as I saw somebody, I didn’t talk, you know.</span> <span id="s804">That’s how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s805">Actually he was invited--he already--he will tell you that--he already went to friends for lunch everyday and he still had his uniform--the striped, you know--he had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: What uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: That was a striped...</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Prison uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Prison only because they send their (words missing in original transcript) to London.</span> <span id="s810">He wanted to go to London with his wife.</span> <span id="s811">Actually he was in London before, ah--the concentration camps started and his wife was still in Prague and he came back.</span> <span id="s812">He could have stayed there, but he’s a very honest man, and--uh--fair, and so he came back for her, and they didn’t allow her to go because she looked very much like a gentile girl and they tore her passport in two, you know, when she said, you don’t go with German pig, you know.</span> <span id="s813">And, ah, some--ah--one day I went to my friend and, ah, suddenly the door opens and my husband comes and he cries, “FiFi--imagine what I bring you.”</span> <span id="s814">And it was my husband--and I wanted to run--and she said, “No you stay for coffee, at least.”</span> <span id="s815">So that was all safe too, because usually went in the street and this one day he went in street and my friend’s husband was standing with his dog.</span> <span id="s816">FuFu was the dog, and he said, “Oh, so you came back--you have to come upstairs--you have to come upstairs--so”...the whole story, but ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: As I had asked you a few minutes ago, if there was any celebration when the war actually ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s819">Nobody even had the head for a celebration.</span> <span id="s820">It was so sad.</span> <span id="s821">If you come home and you went through so much and suddenly you don’t find your husband.</span> <span id="s822">It was no--I had no head for--nobody, actually--it was very sad in Prague, because usually, ah--the men didn’t come back, you know.</span> <span id="s823">Bit in some cases both came back.</span> <span id="s824">It was sad, very sad, either woman or man came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Did your sister survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: My sister survived only because her husband arranged in Theresienstadt she was employed (words missing in original transcript) she was working in a factory who make glima.</span> <span id="s827">This is--it looks like glass--it looks like a convex.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: What do they do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: For the--they needed for their planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: And who worked for them was--safe for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s832">He didn’t go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s833">And this is what my brother-in-law did before even Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s834">So she stayed.</span> <span id="s835">She came back much later, but she came back.</span> <span id="s836">One son had to go with her husband.</span> <span id="s837">Her husband didn’t come back and how her oldest son would be today--fifty.</span> <span id="s838">He didn’t go--he go--and the small boy, he stayed with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: So, when did you come to this country, and what made you decide...</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: When we--this decided the (words missing in original transcript) and told me why are the Jews going from here, you know.</span> <span id="s841">The communists.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: In what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: That was in 1947.</span> <span id="s844">So we worked for a whole year.</span> <span id="s845">My husband, if you will--if you want to hear the story--he can tell you stories you never heard in your life.</span> <span id="s846">What he went through before we came out of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s847">Because as I told you...</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: I would like to hear about that from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: From me!</span> <span id="s850">You know he was in a very exposed position.</span> <span id="s851">First of all, the workers, about three thousand in the chemical factory, loved him.</span> <span id="s852">And they choose him as their leader--that was already when the communists...Then he went to, as a delegate to Poland.</span> <span id="s853">And--ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: A delegate to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: As a delegate from the chemical production, you know.</span> <span id="s856">And, ah, he went everywhere--and at the last they wanted him to go to Moscow.</span> <span id="s857">If he would have gone to Moscow he have never came out of the country because it would have been in the passport--Moscow.</span> <span id="s858">The English wouldn’t have let us in--and he had a friend in London and he knew how efficient my husband and clever he is--so he wanted him in London.</span> <span id="s859">So they send him a visa for London.</span> <span id="s860">We were the only two people who went to London without an immigration passport, on a normal passport.</span> <span id="s861">Anyway, and--when he was in London--he was always traveling--when he was in London so he was in very good face with the home service because he had English--they needed some material they couldn’t get, and he had the choice either to give it to the Russians or to give it to the English--so he gave it to the English.</span> <span id="s862">And maybe because they gave him a better price--the only reason.</span> <span id="s863">And--ah--so they didn’t forget it.</span> <span id="s864">So they wanted him in :London and he made every... Then they told him he has to go to Moscow--he fell down and fainted.</span> <span id="s865">And the doctor in Prague, he said his heart is not in order--he can’t go, you know.</span> <span id="s866">That was forty years ago.</span> <span id="s867">So he came to London.</span> <span id="s868">And I remember when we arrived in London the customs--the customs in London have very much to say about every immigrant who comes and they said to him, “Look your passport is expired, your visa is expired.</span> <span id="s869">What will you do after one year?”</span> <span id="s870">And he said, I was in there, and he said, “I hope to be of such help to the chemists--to the chemical production in England that you will let me stay.”</span> <span id="s871">He looked at him and said, “Go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: You must have been very malnourished and thin and needing to be...</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Of course, no he was even worse than I was.</span> <span id="s874">I was--then I had in Prague many, many friends, gentile friends, who gave us food because in the beginning there was no food even in Prague--just like in England—rations--everything on rations.</span> <span id="s875">And so, after a time I gained enough, too much after a time.</span> <span id="s876">But in the camp, the girls who were too hungry and had nothing to eat, you know, you read about it I think, they ate mushrooms and died.</span> <span id="s877">They ate everything and then they were free.</span> <span id="s878">The Germans gave them fat and pork and all this stuff and they ate it and they couldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Couldn’t digest it.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Digest it.</span> <span id="s881">So they died even at the last minute.</span> <span id="s882">I didn’t--I didn’t have to do it because I escaped.</span> <span id="s883">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: You’re a very thin lady now.</span> <span id="s885">You must have been a great deal thinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I lost with my illness.</span> <span id="s887">I was not so thin.</span> <span id="s888">I lost, but now I have to stay like this.</span> <span id="s889">My oncologist didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s890">He said, “You have enough.</span> <span id="s891">One hundred four pounds is enough for your height.”</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Do you know how much you weighed when you left the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Oh--eighty, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: Eighty.</span> <span id="s895">That’s very thin.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Ah--we were all--we were all only to put in the grave.</span> <span id="s897">That we were all looking like.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Can you recall at what point you began to feel better emotionally and physically?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Emotionally, my husband helped me...</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: How long after you had met him did you marry him?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: In--in 1946.</span> <span id="s902">I didn’t want to marry him in the beginning, but as I said, he was really very exposed in this, and this officer, he’s uh—uh--one of the directors told him he has to marry.</span> <span id="s903">They knew he lives with me, you know, and he said you have to marry because you have to meet my people and we can’t have it in our company.</span> <span id="s904">So we married.</span> <span id="s905">I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s906">Then I was happy I married.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: How long were you in London before you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Actually, we didn’t come to the United States, we came to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Canada--that’s right, you told me you’re from Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: We were in London three years.</span> <span id="s911">That was my happiest time.</span> <span id="s912">Did you ever live in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: I’ve been there, I’ve never lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: I lived there and who--at that time--today I couldn’t like to live there, not even one day with all the Arab.</span> <span id="s915">But when we came to London, after Prague, after the communists, after the Germans.</span> <span id="s916">After all we went through--I could have kissed the earth--in--on the airport.</span> <span id="s917">And then it was everything so easy for us.</span> <span id="s918">My husband went the second day immediately for work, you know, it was like we were home--it was so wonderful in London.</span> <span id="s919">And then Korea came, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: The Korean war.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Yeah--and--eh--my husband wanted to insure a whole train--a whole train.</span> <span id="s922">He had some material for India in this train--from the government--from the English government.</span> <span id="s923">And he wanted to have it insured at Lloyds, and you know Lloyds is the best insurance in the world.</span> <span id="s924">They insure everything, even your tongue, they insure.</span> <span id="s925">And they didn’t want to insure it.</span> <span id="s926">And that was it.</span> <span id="s927">They said (words missing in original transcript) and my husband wanted to have him insured against a war and bombardment.</span> <span id="s928">They said, “Mr. Baron, this we can’t do.”</span> <span id="s929">So he said, “It’s (words missing in original transcript)” And he said, “ I don’t want to win through things like that.”</span> <span id="s930">So we went to Canada.</span> <span id="s931">And we went to Montreal because his firm in London didn’t want to let him go and they opened an office in Montreal for him, you know--that they don’t lose him--so we went to Montreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: You’ve had to rebuild your life several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Oh--so many times.</span> <span id="s934">I said the other day, somebody had so much jewels on them, I said, I lost to the Germans because as I said we had to--in twenty-four hours we had to be finished.</span> <span id="s935">We had to leave.</span> <span id="s936">Everything I left there, and when the Russians came it was just the same.</span> <span id="s937">My husband was so afraid that they don’t let him--that they will call him back--I had a little ring--like this--with a little stone what I got from him in the beginning, and he didn’t let me wear it.</span> <span id="s938">I had to give it back to my sister.</span> <span id="s939">So, we lost so much--and we went through so much--you know, you have to have the nature--not everybody could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: I am very strong, maybe.</span> <span id="s942">And, ah, as I said, even now, I have constant...My Doctor Goldman in, in, Memorial, he said, “My wonderkin.”</span> <span id="s943">I am a wonder.</span> <span id="s944">Anyway, so you see, when I read these books and when I read, I mean, I see these--ah--pictures and so on.</span> <span id="s945">So always I think, I don’t know why people say, why don’t you read--why do you read the books, because I have to say all this happened--all was true--and I am still here.</span> <span id="s946">And when I get up and see the sun rising and the sun going down, still I’m happy like a, I don’t know what--nothing can--can destroy my happiness, only when my husband is ill, then I’m down completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Yes, I know you were very worried about him when I spoke with you last month.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Oh--I was--you can’t imagine (words missing in original transcript) I went too much now in the last time is my illness, so I had it always in my head.</span> <span id="s949">I have three year blood tests he had to do and then he had to go to Dr. Goldman and, ah, I don’t want to tell the name of the doctor, and he said, I don’t know--you don’t have enough protein in your blood and I don’t know what--and you have, eh--I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s950">And if he had an X-rays, how many X-rays that if he lives through this--nearly three weeks.</span> <span id="s951">And do you know what is wrong with him?</span> <span id="s952">He had--he has the inflammation of the joints, here.</span> <span id="s953">That’s what--why he went to the doctor in the first place.</span> <span id="s954">He thought it’s arthritis.</span> <span id="s955">He couldn’t--and he said to tell inflammation of the joint.</span> <span id="s956">And I said to him, “Isn’t it the same like arthritis?”</span> <span id="s957">He said, “Nearly, nearly, nearly.”</span> <span id="s958">And then he started with all this blood test.</span> <span id="s959">And at the end they give him Prednisone.</span> <span id="s960">And in three days, now he’s thin, he’s much, much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: And you’re very relieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Oh--you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s963">I saw me already going home and leaving--because if ever something happens I don’t want to stay here in the hospital.</span> <span id="s964">I want to go home.</span> <span id="s965">I--I tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: You’ve had many losses in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: I can see why any additional ones would be very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: And still, you see, I would sometimes--I wonder--I went through so much even in my youth, I was a child when we were out of (words missing in original transcript) .</span> <span id="s970">Of course, then we had everything, but we have no mother--and no money on earth can give you a mother, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: No money on earth.</span> <span id="s973">And I remember I always, even now, when I think about it, so I think, how could we--how could we live without a mother when I hear the people talking about mothers.</span> <span id="s974">It was the worst for me-I--you can think.</span> <span id="s975">And still, we had so much to go through--concentration camp and now my illness.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Well you said earlier that you gave your foster father a great deal if credit for having helped you grow up to be a strong person.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: That, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s978">You can’t imagine how I blessed him every day, every day.</span> <span id="s979">Because I had a friend--she was very well off, certainly like I was, and she--she had the lice were already inside her body because we were all full of lice.</span> <span id="s980">And they were inside her body because she didn’t wash properly, and when I--when I said to her--I--Azzi why you’re so careless like--I can’t at that time, you know--you see.</span> <span id="s981">And they shot her.</span> <span id="s982">They shot her--just like I talk to her--you.</span> <span id="s983">They were finished in no time (words missing in original transcript) this shooting.</span> <span id="s984">We had to go on the--(words missing in original transcript) marsh and we had to make a big bunker, and then I was still in the bunker-my friend she took me out.</span> <span id="s985">And then they--all the girls have to jump, about twenty--and they shoot--boom, boom, boom, boom, boom--and we had to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Were you constantly terrified, or did you become numb to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Become numb...there was not one minute when you were not terrified of them because you don’t know what could happen.</span> <span id="s988">For instance, we walked at night and some girls had bound their feet, so they said, “I can’t walk anymore.”</span> <span id="s989">So we kept her walking and the SS always fight, and from both sides SS, the German Nazis, with--with the bayonets out, and they said, “Go, go.”</span> <span id="s990">And when--if she didn’t run to go--if she couldn’t go, she had to go aside and they made selections on the (words missing in original transcript), we were about a thousand girls.</span> <span id="s991">Selections.</span> <span id="s992">And they were selected lots of girls--and we went on after ten minutes we heard it; they were all shot and they promised we come--we come for you.</span> <span id="s993">You stay here, we come for you...From the typhus, from malnutrition, from the hydration, from all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s994">I mean all from eating, as I said—uh--mushrooms what they couldn’t eat--or later on eating, but mostly of typhus, mostly of typhus--and that the Germans were very much afraid of typhus because they went with us, they would have got it.</span> <span id="s995">But you would have seen how they changed at the end, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: In what way?</span> <span id="s998">They started to be friendly because they wanted us to know “the evil is very friendly” but we knew exactly who was friendly or not.</span> <span id="s999">But--I escaped--I was glad I didn’t see them anymore.</span> <span id="s1000">But my friend told them--that girl what I telled you--she had ah--that was her friend, but she saved her own family.</span> <span id="s1001">I don’t give it against her because she had to, but he was nice to her.</span> <span id="s1002">He gave her his watch.</span> <span id="s1003">He gave her money and there at the last time he said, “Look, I am lost anyway.</span> <span id="s1004">I am a German.</span> <span id="s1005">I was--ah manager of this whole camp--they will shoot me anyway, but you go.</span> <span id="s1006">Go with your family, you have money.”</span> <span id="s1007">And she went.</span> <span id="s1008">So, sometimes, you know, you found somebody like this, but it’s not...Yah, you can find somebody where, ah--between--ah--thousand SS men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: In the conversation we had, I have sort of directed you Are there things that I haven’t asked you about that you want to talk about that I just didn’t think to ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Anything that I haven’t thought to ask you that you would like to include?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: I--I could tell you lots, but I can’t even remember now.</span> <span id="s1013">It was so much, it was so cruel.</span> <span id="s1014">In the little time we were in Auschwitz it was so crowded I couldn’t understand how they could survive in the family.</span> <span id="s1015">They had a name for it in Auschwitz--they called it family camp--and the whole families could stay together.</span> <span id="s1016">But that was their trick, that was awful--mind of the Germans, you know--always prepared at the last minute, anyway, you know.</span> <span id="s1017">They started this nicely--ya, you stay together with your children and your wife--okay.</span> <span id="s1018">After two months they came and all the children with their wives had to go to the gas chambers, you know.</span> <span id="s1019">But it was only keeping the life for two months.</span> <span id="s1020">It was so--so--every German, I think, was a--think of a sadist because that was the nature of them.</span> <span id="s1021">When we came to Auschwitz, as I said to you, we had to go to the road and they cut off our hair.</span> <span id="s1022">I got such hysterical--ah--laugh--laugh cramp that I started to rub and I saw my friends--they looked--like (words missing in original transcript), I started through the showers, the Germans were standing there naked--I had to rush through the showers, you know.</span> <span id="s1023">Such things, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1024">Or they took all our--our dresses and they threw us.</span> <span id="s1025">I had to blouse half of my breast that was open because it was torn and our good things and they sorted it.</span> <span id="s1026">The best things went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1027">The next best things, they got their wives of--the--of all the Germans what were with us in the company and we got the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Well, as you’ve said earlier.</span> <span id="s1029">People like myself can’t really understand...</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No.</span> <span id="s1031">And I can’t, you know--I actually, English--I’m sorry to say is not my--one--ah--my language, you know.</span> <span id="s1032">I can’t express myself properly--say in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: You express yourself extremely well.</span> <span id="s1034">What I meant by not being able to understand is that we have lived in such security here that we can only try to understand your considerable experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: You can’t even try.</span> <span id="s1036">You can’t even try to imagine--you live at home--you sit, and when--when we made a hunger march once, we were standing on a place and I looked in the window and I said to my friend, once in my life I would like to sit on a real chair and sit at a table--and do you know what was my dream all the time--we always said--she said, “I would like to have a goose.”</span> <span id="s1037">And you know how they talk.</span> <span id="s1038">I said I would like only one thing--to have a bath.</span> <span id="s1039">And then I will sit in the bath--or--and do you know that I never forget whenever I sit--yeah--everyday in the bathtub, I remember this--that I--yes--I wanted only to have a bath.</span> <span id="s1040">Everybody--you don’t want to eat?</span> <span id="s1041">I said, yes--but first I want to take a bath.</span> <span id="s1042">We--when we escaped.</span> <span id="s1043">So on our way, one soldier told us this all belongs to you because the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s1044">So we went in, and my friend, she was very clever, I was not that clever, she took pillows.</span> <span id="s1045">I said, what are you doing with it?</span> <span id="s1046">She said, “You never know.”</span> <span id="s1047">Then we came to the market, we have no money, of course, and she was standing--and she took a basket, a laundry basket—and she put it in the laundry basket and we were standing there and (words missing in original transcript) was nothing, you know...So we are standing there and people bought it for us, for a few penny.</span> <span id="s1048">And there’s a police standing, so we put it back--we run--you should have seen us.</span> <span id="s1049">Then we had a few pennies and now I go and ask how much is a bath here, in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1050">It was a Polish, very nice city.</span> <span id="s1051">It’s one of the nicest churches in the world in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1052">So, we went--ah--we had a bath--I was another person.</span> <span id="s1053">And then we bought cookies.</span> <span id="s1054">When I remember today the cookies--I wouldn’t touch it today.</span> <span id="s1055">Cookies--yellow and red, and you know how the Polish make cookies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: But when you haven’t had any cookies, they taste better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Never.</span> <span id="s1058">And by the time we ate the whole--the whole piece, we had a few pennies from this what we saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Well, I think you have been wonderful to have given of your experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Thanks.</span> <span id="s1061">Maybe I didn’t give you all the details, but it is much too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: I understand that you can’t cover all those years in such a short period of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: No, I can’t...I know only one thing, when I came back after half a year, I wrote to the television in Prague, but I tell you now, only much more--better, and ah--I wanted to have it ah--in London.....the Readers Digest, and I wanted if I can--if they would take it.</span> <span id="s1064">And they wrote me back that they would take it if I have a ghost writer.</span> <span id="s1065">And I wrote to television--I wrote in BBC--in London, and they wrote me the same.</span> <span id="s1066">And then I said--uh--so many people.</span> <span id="s1067">And it was shortly after the war, I mean, it was three, four years, and I said--everybody--will you talk about it.</span> <span id="s1068">Well who am I to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1069">But even now, after so many years, they want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Well now it’s becoming even more important because people like yourself are older and pretty soon we will not have accurate stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Anybody like I am--ah--old—and everybody--and you know in Canada we have a man at school, he teaches school in Ontario, and he said all this what they talk the Jews is not true.</span> <span id="s1072">Now, what would you say to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: I know that there are people who would like to believe that and would like to convince other people that that is--that it never happened, but we know differently.</span> <span id="s1074">And you certainly know differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: But okay, but how can a person think what is--we only fantasy of ours--or--I can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1076">And he teaches children--and the students say, no it’s not true.</span> <span id="s1077">Mr. So-And-So said it’s not true--it’s not true.</span> <span
