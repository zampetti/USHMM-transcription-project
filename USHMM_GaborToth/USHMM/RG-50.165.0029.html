GEIZHALS</span></p> <p><span id="s11">December 25, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">HW: Tell me a bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">EG: I was born October 29, 1929 into a middle class family in Lodz.</span> <span id="s14">I had one brother and we had a fruit store.</span> <span id="s15">My parents were traditional.</span> <span id="s16">I was sent to Auschwitz in 1944.</span> <span id="s17">Later I went on a death march.</span> <span id="s18">My father survived but my mother died.</span> <span id="s19">We were in the D.P. camps for a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">WH: Now tell me a bit about yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">BG: I was born in Cracow.</span> <span id="s22">My father was a self-made man from a poor family.</span> <span id="s23">He was in the printing business and was active in Jewish politics as well as city politics.</span> <span id="s24">The Jews in Cracow were pretty integrated with the larger Polish community.</span> <span id="s25">We didn’t feel the anti-Semitism as much as in other parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s26">The family was very religious but I went to a Polish school.</span> <span id="s27">I was sent to Plaszow and worked as a printer.</span> <span id="s28">My four sisters were sent to Auschwitz but because they knew printing they were saved.</span> <span id="s29">As you may know, they printed English pounds, but they also tried to print dollars.</span> <span id="s30">Later on I worked in a factory making mortars for the B-2 bombers.</span> <span id="s31">My parents and a brother were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">WH: And then you married each other after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WG: Well, it was a common pattern for many of these 25 or 26 year old men to marry these younger women of 17 or 18, to take care of them, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">BG: These marriages weren’t necessarily made in heaven</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EG: No, it was more a commitment.</span> <span id="s36">Yet, surprisingly these marriages often lasted longer than the ones of today.</span> <span id="s37">My husband wanted to get married, he was alone, and he wanted to make a home.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">HW: What was it like when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">BG: When we came the HIAS wanted to help us.</span> <span id="s40">My sisters and I met with the social worker who said: “We want to support you for about six months, get you clothing and everything.”</span> <span id="s41">And I said: “But I’d like to get a job while you’re doing that.”</span> <span id="s42">“No,” she said: “It’s too hard for you now.”</span> <span id="s43">And this didn’t sit well with me.</span> <span id="s44">I felt so bad I started to cry.</span> <span id="s45">I mean, I cry easily, but I was really upset.</span> <span id="s46">I said to her: “Do you want to make welfare cases out of us?</span> <span id="s47">We don’t want to take any money.”</span> <span id="s48">“No,” she said.</span> <span id="s49">So I got very upset with her and I said: “You know why you want to do it?</span> <span id="s50">Because your future depends on supporting us.</span> <span id="s51">All I want is a job where they speak German or Polish so I can work.”</span> <span id="s52">So in a few days they gave me a job in a printing place.</span> <span id="s53">At that time I lived on 101st Street and Columbus Avenue.</span> <span id="s54">I remember I saw a sign near 96th Street that said “To Let.”</span> <span id="s55">And I thought it meant toilet.</span> <span id="s56">So I went and asked if I could go in and the people said “Why?”</span> <span id="s57">I said: “I want to use the toilet.”</span> <span id="s58">And they started to laugh.</span> <span id="s59">I went to night school and there was an Italian teacher.</span> <span id="s60">I said to her: “I want to open up a printing business.</span> <span id="s61">If I learn one word a night, it will take me 100 years.”</span> <span id="s62">So she said to me: “This is not for you.</span> <span id="s63">Go into a movie theater, sit two or three times through the film.</span> <span id="s64">The third time I want you to mumble what they’re saying.”</span> <span id="s65">And that’s what I did, my wife and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">WH: So what type of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">BG: I went into my own printing business and after two years we bought a two family house for five families in Queens Village.</span> <span id="s68">Then we moved to Hyde Park and bought a house for $12,000.00.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">WH: Are your friends mostly survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">BG: No, they’re mostly Americans because survivors are not generally in the printing business and this is where we made a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s71">Then politically we got involved in both Jewish/Israeli politics and American politics.</span> <span id="s72">We go to Israel very often and our son made aliya and lives on a Shomer Hatzair kibbutz.</span> <span id="s73">He’d gone to Israel as a volunteer in the Yom Kippur war and they assigned him to this kibbutz.</span> <span id="s74">My wife has bought an apartment in Netanya.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">WH: So you visit Israel often to see him?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">BG: No my son is there because we went often.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">EG: We instilled in him this feeling.</span> <span id="s78">Our children went to yeshiva day school and we were on the first Board of the North Shore Hebrew Academy.</span> <span id="s79">Another son lives in Port Washington.</span> <span id="s80">He’s an attorney who went to Brandeis and N.Y.U. Law School.</span> <span id="s81">My daughter went to F.I.T. and then became a registered nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: What about religion.</span> <span id="s83">How do you feel about it as a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">BG: I don’t think the religious world can tell us survivors one way or the other, because each and every one of us had either to lose something or gain something from the experience of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s85">I came from a religious home but I do things because of being Jewish not because of religion.</span> <span id="s86">We strongly support Israel because we believe that if there had been an Israel then, there would not have been a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s87">And Israel has brought us a great deal of pride.</span> <span id="s88">Compare what Israel has done in the first forty years with what the U.S. achieved in the first eighty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s90">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0029 PAGE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s91">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
