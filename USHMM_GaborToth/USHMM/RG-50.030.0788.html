survived and sister survived, you know, the war times.</span> <span id="s125">And she – she’s buried in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: In Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span></p>

id="s131">Did you – di – were her parents alive when – your grandparents on her side, when you were born and when you were a little boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I don’t rem – I don’t rem –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: You don’t remember your grandparents on your – on your mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: On my mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, they must have been gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s140">So it sounds like you had a – a really rather small family, all told.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, if you had – am I making an assumption?</span> <span id="s142">Is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Right, m-my – my – my aunt had two sons, they were both younger than I, but they already dead for several years now.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Oh, I see, so they were born in the 1930s.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: But after you.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s149">What kind of place did you live in, in Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, when we came to – from the village, we lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s151">And I – I do remember it slightly.</span> <span id="s152">But then my father was – decided to go back into the army, and there was an – in –in the Polish army there was a – like a training system, where they would train the young people before they were drafted into the military, which – which a – all the young Poles who were drafted, it was just like United States had a draft at one time.</span> <span id="s153">And so he would be teaching in high school, the basic skills of the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So he had been in the army before he was a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Yes, beca – well, he graduated from – from the military academy – you know, the officers’ training school.</span> <span id="s156">And he left as a – as a second lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s158">So he had quite a rank, as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well no, it was the lowest – lowest officer’s degree.</span> <span id="s160">And he – because he – he was a teacher and th – and then he was teaching these courses in – in Lódz, in 1939 he was transferred to eastern Poland, and he became assistant to the regional commander.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Okay, before we get there, a little bit – did he fight in World War I, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: No, so he –</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: He was born in 1906, so he would have been too small.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s166">So he was rather a young man in –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: When – when –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: When World War II broke out, he was still quite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: He was still 30 – 33.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: All right, so yes, I’m sorry I interrupted you.</span> <span id="s173">So, he was transferred to a village in the eastern part of –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: No, it was – it was a town.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: It was a town, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Town in eastern Poland, and so he went there in about April, and then we moved to – to be with him in July, and of course in September first, the war broke out, and so we were left behind, completely away from our family.</span> <span id="s177">And I suppose the reason we were deported was simple.</span> <span id="s178">My father was a military and he was therefore the enemy of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: We’ll come to that, we’ll come to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: I want to talk a little bit more about pre-war life.</span> <span id="s182">Did you go to school when you were – were – were you already old enough to start school when –</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yes, I was – I was seven year olds [indecipherable] the school year.</span> <span id="s184">I was seven, and I went to first grade in Lódz, and I graduated from –</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: First grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: – that in – before the – before – you know, in – in June of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Do you have any memories of it?</span> <span id="s188">Any memories of this first year of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Just sl-slight ones.</span> <span id="s190">I know – I know where I was going, you know, th-th-the – not – it wasn’t too far away from where we lived.</span> <span id="s191">And I remember some beginning of some poetry that we were learning of how [indecipherable] was – a poem that everybody knew by heart.</span> <span id="s192">And so I remember some of these – these things, you know.</span> <span id="s193">But I don’t remember the daily – daily, you know, life or something from that.</span> <span id="s194">I knew that I could walk by myself, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you – at home, did your mother have help in running the household, or did she do it all on her own?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, she did it all by herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: All by herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: And so when – when my father started working for the military in – in – in Lódz, we moved into a military building, an-and that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What wa – how wa – why is it distinct in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Well, it’s – I suppose because those – in a bigger building, you know, we were on seventh floor or something like that, and – and it was much nicer apartment than the one we had before.</span> <span id="s201">And so I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Was it bigger?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: It was bigger.</span> <span id="s204">And I – I remember one Christmas that we spent there, and by that time I had the little dog, and the dog was named Tito.</span> <span id="s205">Way before Tito [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s208">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: A precursor.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: – and we had the Christmas tree like this one in here, an-and there were some chocolates hanging on it, you know.</span> <span id="s211">And the little dog would eat away the – the bottom of the chocolate, and the chocolate would fall out and he would eat it.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: A smart little dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Smart little dog, it’s stuck in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s215">What are your memories of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Well, I have a – a – a very distinct memory of – of him when he came out – after he moved into the eastern Poland, he came back, you know, to help us get, you know, loaded and – and things.</span> <span id="s217">And I was going – I was co – I was out – outside on the street, and he – and here was a figure of an officer in a – what do you call these, like a long – it wasn’t a coat, it was a – like a hanging thing, you know, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Was it a cape?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Like a cape, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: And because he was in – in a different unit in – over there, he had to wear this cape.</span> <span id="s222">And he’s walking in his uniform, with the cape on.</span> <span id="s223">So, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: He must have been quite elegant looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What kind of a person was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s228">He was – he was a loving father, and – and that’s all I can say really, because you know, I – at the age of seven, what kind of recollections do you have of what – what kind of person your father was, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Well, some people – yeah, one can’t have much.</span> <span id="s230">But is he someone that you were in awe of, or afraid of, or was he very warm?</span> <span id="s231">Those sorts of thi – memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, I was never afraid of my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: And I suppose wa – once he started wearing the military uniform, you know, I was quite impressed.</span> <span id="s235">Because Polish military uniforms were very elegant, you know, with the – with the high boots –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: – you know, and things, and so he –</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: He must have cut quite a figure.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: He quite – that’s him.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: That’s him?</span> <span id="s241">And can you focus in on that?</span> <span id="s242">Let’s focus in on that picture.</span> <span id="s243">Such a young man, truly.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s245">But – so he – he cut quite a figure in the – in the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Did that mean you wanted to be – to grow up and be that way too, or did that thought not occur to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: It didn’t occur to me at that time, but en – and later on I n – actually never did.</span> <span id="s248">And my military career is something else, and I’ll talk about it later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s250">All right.</span> <span id="s251">All right, so then, let’s turn to your mother.</span> <span id="s252">While I’m at – while I’m at it, what – what are your first memories of your mother, as a little boy before the war?</span> <span id="s253">A: I don’t know, I don’t really have any particular memory because she was – she was with me all the time.</span> <span id="s254">I suppose when – when she took me to kindergarten, and it would just – just happen to be that in the – in the building that we lived in, the kindergarten was just across the street.</span> <span id="s255">And so she took me there, and I remember her at that time.</span> <span id="s256">But, otherwise I – I don’t remember hearing any park – particular thing from – from those days, that – she was there all the time.</span> <span id="s257">She was helping, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Again, I’ll ask the same type of question.</span> <span id="s259">What kind of personality did she have?</span> <span id="s260">Was she outgoing, was she more reserved?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: I suppose you could say that she was both.</span> <span id="s262">Sometimes she could be very outgoing and sometimes she would withdraw into herself.</span> <span id="s263">But she was very active.</span> <span id="s264">Before the war she – I don’t know how it happened, but – but she became part of a women’s movement of some sort.</span> <span id="s265">And it was also kind of a mi-military thing.</span> <span id="s266">And so these women were head – were having camps every year.</span> <span id="s267">And I remember that we were went with my mother to those – those camps, and she was working in th – as a quartermasters at – at the camp.</span> <span id="s268">And so she was quite – quite active during those days, and I suppose she was very happy, because you know, she would do something, so, you know, very useful.</span> <span id="s269">And one of these camps was – was in the area where the president of Poland came to visit.</span> <span id="s270">And I remember seeing him at that time, in nine – 1937, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: So it wouldn’t have been Marshall Pilsudski, he had already died.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, he was gone, right.</span> <span id="s273">But it was – no, no, it wasn’t Wojohosky(ph).</span> <span id="s274">No.</span> <span id="s275">Nn – he was never president.</span> <span id="s276">But anyways, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: But that’s quite impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: So I was – I was quite impr – because you know, the ceremony and everything else, he – you know, and so thi – all the women from the camp were over there, that’s why I – I [indecipherable] that’s why I came, you know, there too.</span> <span id="s279">So that – that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did – I mean, you were a little boy, so you know, again, it’s like you said, how much can one really say, but your – did your parents talk about the things that were important to them?</span> <span id="s281">And I’ll say what I mean, like did you have a sense of whether they were religious people, or whether they were, I would assume, quite patriotic people?</span> <span id="s282">But what sort of stories do you remember hearing from them, and the – the things that they did at home?</span> <span id="s283">What – what were those pillars of – of identify, I guess one would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Well, you – I do remember s-stories that my mother would tell me about – about her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Who traveled when he was – when he was a young man, he – he was edu – being educated in – in Saint Petersburg in – in a medical school.</span> <span id="s287">And then he traveled, and he traveled through the areas through which we traveled later.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: So you mean through the areas of Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Right.</span> <span id="s290">And the –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And so you’d hear stories about those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: And I remember too, this particular one, that he was – he was in – in – in Tashkent(ph), and that’s where we went through also.</span> <span id="s293">And so it was, you know, an unusual story that the second and third generations went the same way.</span> <span id="s294">Slightly – in slightly different circumstances of course, because he went as a free man, and we did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: But that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Did – was there a sense of patriotism at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s299">I think all the time, and – and especially with – with Father in the military uniform also.</span> <span id="s300">It was – it was always present.</span> <span id="s301">I can’t recall any particular talks about it, but – but you know, they – they lived through the period when Poland was born, so for them it was very important.</span> <span id="s302">And they were patriots, both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: What about church?</span> <span id="s304">Did they go to church regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s306">Yes, we – we went to church, and I – I remember – I don’t remember the name of the church, but I no – remember where it was.</span> <span id="s307">And when – when we lived in the military block, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Now again, this is probably not fair – a – a fair question to somebody who was six and seven years old at the time, but I’m curious.</span> <span id="s309">In Lódz, which is a rather large city, there were – there was a large Jewish population as well.</span> <span id="s310">And did you know of – did you know that there were people who were Jews?</span> <span id="s311">Did you have any Jews who were neighbors?</span> <span id="s312">Did that – did the Jewish world ever, in any way, come across into your world?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: I no – I don’t go, I – you know, I – but – but yes, I – I knew that it’s a multinational, because there was not only Jews, but there were Poles, the Germans, the Russians.</span> <span id="s314">It was very international city, because it was an industrial city and the – the – you know, with all kinds of – of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So it was multi-ethnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: But – right, but I don’t remember any kind of a anti-something, an anti-somebody talks, because my mother was going with – with girls that were of German origin and I’m sure they went with the – with the Jewish girls, and then so – but I don’t remember particular that – like if there was a Jew that was visiting us, for example, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Well, I’m thinking, did you ever go to streets that were – maybe the baker, or there would be a tailor, or you would see like streets that would be particularly, you know, more Jewish, in the Jewish section of town, or – or neighbors who might be around.</span> <span id="s318">That – that sort of question.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Mm, no, I – I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: – I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s322">And I’m sure, because they were all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: So, but it – it did – it didn’t strike me in particular because – I guess because there was no distinction in – in the way that no, they’re something else, you know.</span> <span id="s325">So in – in – in my mind there was – there was no some kind of a predetermined love or hatred of somebody else.</span> <span id="s326">I think it – it was just natural to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s328">Did you know – did you have a sense – now again, this may not be a fair question because I’m asking it of somebody who was seven at the time, but did you have a sense that there were others, people who were not Polish in the city, or is that something you learned or knew about later?</span> <span id="s329">When you say that Lódz was a multi-ethnic place, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Well, I’m sure I have seen all kinds of people in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: You know.</span> <span id="s333">And – and because the Jews at that time were dressing in a distinct way, you know, so you could recognize them.</span> <span id="s334">And they – m-most of them wore beards, you know, and things like that.</span> <span id="s335">And I’m sure I have seen hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s336">But I – it did not impress me in any particular way that this, oh my goodness, is something else.</span> <span id="s337">So it – and – and that’s the way I am, I – I’m – I’m very accepting person.</span> <span id="s338">Besides, I’ve seen many people of all kinds of things, so – and we’ll talk about it later [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s340">Describe a little bit about the city itself, again, through your eyes.</span> <span id="s341">You told us that, you know, you were in a military barracks – that that – not a barracks, but an apartment –</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: – that your parents moved to.</span> <span id="s344">And was it – were you in a section of the city that was in the center, or in the outskirts, and what did it look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well, I cannot tell that [indecipherable] exactly, and I did visit it later when I was in Poland.</span> <span id="s346">But no, it wasn’t a – in the middle of the city, but it was just a little bit away.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Outside, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: But we had the very good connection by – by rail, you know, in the – what do you call it, the trams?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: The trams, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Right.</span> <span id="s351">And so, I remember having to use two or three trams to get to my – my aunt’s place.</span> <span id="s352">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s354">Your father’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No, my mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Oh, your mother’s sister, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: My mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s358">And I don’t remember where my – my mo – father’s family lived.</span> <span id="s359">You know, my grandfather.</span> <span id="s360">But I do remember that they – he was working in a – in a factory, and most of the industry in Poland was – was the textile industry.</span> <span id="s361">Very highly developed textile industry.</span> <span id="s362">And so he was working as a maintenance man in the – in the – in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: That would have been your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: My grandfather on my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: So I – I remember him.</span> <span id="s367">My grandmother died, and I do remember that she was, you know, in – in Poland there are no places where you could put the people like – like a – funeral homes.</span> <span id="s368">So basically the person lied in the house for three days before the – the person was buried.</span> <span id="s369">And I remember seeing her in the – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Was that a shocking thing?</span> <span id="s371">You know, you had seen her alive, and now she wasn’t any more, and you were a child, or was that something strange for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Well, I’m – I’m a – I’m sure it was, I – I don’t recollect it right now.</span> <span id="s373">But seeing your grandmother laying there and not moving, you know, i-it’s a shock to any child.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: And you know – but it’s – it’s so strange that I remember that she was laid out, and that was natural thing, this was the thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: And in fact, it was – you couldn’t think of anything else, because she belonged here, so therefore she goes from here, you know, to the – to the burial ground.</span> <span id="s378">And tha – that – that I recall.</span> <span id="s379">And I do not recall the – the funeral of my grandfather, or my – my mother’s mother at all, because we were not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So, let’s turn now to the place that your father is sent in April 1939.</span> <span id="s381">What kind of a place was this?</span> <span id="s382">What was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: It was a small town in the mountain area, very beautifully located, that I – that I remember.</span> <span id="s384">And I – and I remember when other – when we were – when we were traveling, I remember when we went into the train to – to start the journey.</span> <span id="s385">And so he had rented a – a – part of a villa on a hill.</span> <span id="s386">So in order to – to go to the town, you had to go down the hill and – and th – and walk to the town, because it wasn’t too far away.</span> <span id="s387">So that – that I do remember, and it was really a – a beautiful, beautiful area –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: It sounds so pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: – with the mountains across, you know, you could see the hills.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: This the Carpathian?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s394">And, you know, we didn’t have time to travel and visit and anything else, because we only had two months there.</span> <span id="s395">But – but I do remember – I si –I still – I still can see the view, you know, of the – of the mount – of the hills, because they are not very – very tall.</span> <span id="s396">But of the hills that were – that were across the way from – from our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Well, that was, you know, the summer of 1939.</span> <span id="s398">And was there any sense in your world that people were getting more nervous, or was it a beautiful summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: As far as I was concerned, it was a beautiful summer.</span> <span id="s400">My – my father, you know, worked and I – I do remember, I think that – that he took us on one of the – he had to visit the camp where he was training th-the kids, and – and we did go with him to – to visit that.</span> <span id="s401">I don’t recall the details, but then I remember that we went.</span> <span id="s402">And you know, it – the – the area, which of course loc-located in – in the part where many people were Ukrainian, White Russians, Jews – again, you know, because that’s – that’s the way it was in Poland, all – all over the place.</span> <span id="s403">And that I remember.</span> <span id="s404">And I – and I remember our – our apartment very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: The villa.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: And in the villa –</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: And you – you were – we were renting so-somebody was the owner of the villa, and downstairs was a lawyer that had an apartment and we had the one upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Tell me about it.</span> <span id="s410">What did it look like, this apartment.</span> <span id="s411">It sounds beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well, it – we had – we had the – the living/dining area, and the – and the bedroom for my po – for my parents.</span> <span id="s413">And the little – little place where – where I lived.</span> <span id="s414">And then – and the kitchen.</span> <span id="s415">So it wasn’t very bag – big, but – but it had – had the balcony, so you could go on the balcony.</span> <span id="s416">And we brought all the furniture of course, from – from which when we moved.</span> <span id="s417">So it was very nicely furnished, and my mother was quite happy.</span> <span id="s418">I don’t remember how we were going to the – to – for the supplies for example, was the nearest – nearest shop or something –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: – grocery store, but – but apparently everything was fine, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Was it a – were – was it a residential area where there were other villas right next to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes, it was – as I said, it was located on the hill, overlooking the town, and – and very, very, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Would you think that – would you be able to say whether it was a well-to-do area of this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: That I wouldn’t – I don’t think so, because my father was just living off of the military pay, and it wasn’t that much.</span> <span id="s427">But – but apparently the apartment was affordable, and you know, th-the owner had built the – the villa several years ago, and my father apparently found a space, and that’s where we moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s429">And the name of the town again was?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Dolina(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Dolina(ph), mm-hm.</span> <span id="s432">So, any other sort of memories from the summer of ’39, after you moved there?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, not until – not until my father was ordered to go back to his unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: So tell us about that.</span> <span id="s435">Did you – oh, excuse me – September 1st, 1939, did your parents have a radio at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: So how did you learn that there was going to be a war, or that there was a war?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: My father must have learned through this – through the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Because I don’t remember exactly when, but several days later, he was ordered to go back.</span> <span id="s441">And I remember taking – you know, taking him to the train, oh – and him standing – him dressed up in unit – mili – uniform, and saying goodbye to us, and I remember his picture, it was the last, you know, picture of him being in a uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: You mean, your – the picture in your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: In my mind, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s445">I forgot to ask this before, but as far as you could tell, were your parents close to each other?</span> <span id="s446">I know, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: It’s a difficult question to ask, because you know, what – what does a seven year old know about –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: – what their parent – but they – I don’t remember ever of them arguing or – or yelling at each other or anything like that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s451">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: It was – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: A peaceful home.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: A peaceful foam, yes, that’s very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: So, when you said he was ordered back, where was he ordered back to?</span> <span id="s456">Was it Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s458">I don’t know it was [indecipherable] that he was not reassigned, but you know, of course, it’s several months, you know, that it – but he was reassigned to go to his regiment, and it was 27th regiment of – in the army.</span> <span id="s459">And so he left, maybe two or three days after the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: So, early September.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Early September.</span> <span id="s462">And by that time I – and I do remember when later on there – there was a lot of mil – you know, people and military, they were moving out to – to go to the border and go to Romania and go to – to Hungary.</span> <span id="s463">So I remember these transports and transports and transports of people on the – on the – you know, horse driven carts, and military walking.</span> <span id="s464">Thousands of people just moving out.</span> <span id="s465">That I – that I’m – that was even before – on the – of cour – of course before the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: So tell me, Dolina(ph), it – was it close to the border of Romania and Hungary?</span> <span id="s467">And was it close to the border of Soviet Ukraine?</span> <span id="s468">How – was it is – a borderish area.</span> <span id="s469">That’s what I’m trying to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yes, it must have been about, you know, maybe 50 - 60 kilometers from the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And about the same thing from – from the other borders.</span> <span id="s473">Because you seen that Poland was like this, and this thing goes straight over here, you know.</span> <span id="s474">So it was – it was called Do-Dolina(ph) Koa(ph) Stanisławówa (ph), and the Stanisławówa(ph) was largest city.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: And now it’s called Ivana(ph) Petrowsk(ph) in – you know, in the Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s477">So apparently it wasn’t too far away because people who were just walking, you know, within walking distance from the borders.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: And you would see this on your street, where you lived, or would you –</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No, down below.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Down below.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Down below because the main st – main road was going through there.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Could you see that from your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: The balcony of your house –</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: – you could see all the movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: All the transports were walking, you know.</span> <span id="s488">And – and of course at that time we didn’t know what happened with my father at all, because when the Germans attacked, of course they’re moving very fast, and the Russians – on the 17th of September the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s489">And my father came back to us after the Russians have occupied our area.</span> <span id="s490">And he was wounded.</span> <span id="s491">A shrapnel had hit him in the leg, and so he was wounded, and he came.</span> <span id="s492">I don’t know how, but at that time the border was still kind of fluid.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Permeable, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: And so he had the chance to – to escape from – because his unit was destroyed, bit – be – by – by the time he go – he got there, it – it was gone.</span> <span id="s495">So – and complete disorder was – was in charge of everything.</span> <span id="s496">And so he managed to come back to us.</span> <span id="s497">And he was wounded, and – and I remember that somehow they found out that he came back.</span> <span id="s498">And the Russian military people came in, and they saw him, and they saw him being wounded, and they said, well, we’ll – we’ll send you a doctor.</span> <span id="s499">And the Russian doctor came in and was tending to his wound.</span> <span id="s500">But my fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Was this the fir – was this the first time you saw any of the Russian soldiers, or – or Russian military [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No, I – no, we saw them also coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: You also saw them coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: We saw come – coming in, and they were not very impressive, because they – they we – they kept, you know, kind of goofy looking boots on it, you know, and – and th-th-th – they were not just like, you know, Polish military.</span> <span id="s505">They were not really very well dressed, but there were plenty of them, so – and they were armed.</span> <span id="s506">So that I remember, their – their coming over, you know, transporting –</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: – themselves into – into Poland.</span> <span id="s509">And then ma – somehow, I don’t know, they alt – already the underground system must have started, because my father decided that he’s not going to be waiting until she – he is well, so they can take – take him – you know, the Russians can take him.</span> <span id="s510">So he decided to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: And he left us, and went toward the border, and there must have been some kind of, you know, group of people that was being formed, and apparently they were just caught on the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: And he was brought back into our town, which of course we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s515">But sometime later, his barber, who was a Jew, came to my mother and he said, you know, my – my cousin is working as a guard in – in the jail, and he told me that your husband is in jail.</span> <span id="s516">And he also said that if we wanted to visit him, he will permit us to get in, provided it’s four o’clock in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: So, we did go, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: You too, as well, even though you’re a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes, so – so we went and – and he brought my father out from I don’t know where, and this was the last time we saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s522">A: So, it must have been some time in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: What did he look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Of course, he was no – no military uniform, he was dressed up in some kind of a – maybe jail uniform or something, but – but I don’t exactly remember ama – as that, you know.</span> <span id="s525">But this was the last time we saw him, and as I said, it was probably the – towards the end of 1939.</span> <span id="s526">And then we were told that all the prisoners were being transported away from – from Dolina(ph).</span> <span id="s527">And several weeks later my mother went to Stanisławówa(ph), to the larger town, to inquire about what happened with him.</span> <span id="s528">And of course, nobody knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s529">You know, and of course they did, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s530">So this was the last time I saw my father, was –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Did you – you – when you went and you saw him then, you didn’t know it was the last time, and your mother didn’t know it was the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: No, of course not, of course not, because we – no, we know, you know, somebody’s in jail, who knows what – what happens.</span> <span id="s533">And – but – so we didn’t expect him – but sometime in the beginning of March of 1940, the transport occurred, and he was taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Also, you say he must have been in jail for several months before –</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Before he was –</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: – he was taken out –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: – taken away.</span> <span id="s539">Do you remember his demeanor when you saw him?</span> <span id="s540">Did you – you know, did – do you remember anything of what he said, or your mother said, or how long the meeting lasted?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: No, I don’t remember the – the – the words that were exchanged, but it lasted about 15 - 20 minutes, no longer than that, because you know, the – th-the fellow that was the to – that permitted that, was taking a very great risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Because if the – if the NKVD would come in and just –</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: – find it, he – he would really suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: You know, so – so it was very brave on – on his part, and very kind on the part of my father’s barber to even come up with this idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: You know, so we were grateful for that, but it was the last time.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: And – and after that we –</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: What did – how did your mother live?</span> <span id="s553">I mean, how did you – did you have any savings, did she – or were you spared from these types of day to day worries, where will the food come from, how will we get by, or things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I’m sure that that’s wa – that’s the way it was, because you know, the – the – the pay stopped, of course, everything just was ruined.</span> <span id="s555">So – but it – I don’t recall that she would be going and selling some of the things like it happened later.</span> <span id="s556">But – but this is, apparently she – they must have had some money.</span> <span id="s557">And – but you know, then the Polish złoty had been exchanged, taken out, and the Russian ruble came in and – and all that, and I really don’t know how – how that happened, but it was just several months that we lived, because we – when the Russians came in it was September 17th, and when we were deported, it was April 13th.</span> <span id="s558">So it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: So your father – your – she finds out that he is – he is taken away, some time around March – February or March –</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Something –</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And she doesn’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s564">Did you go to school during those months, or was there –</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: – no school?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s568">Every – ev – no, everything was just – just – the whole thing was shut.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: You know, and the Russians were taking over, and no, I did not go to, like second grade at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Did you vi – you and your mother, did you venture out of your apartment, or did you pretty much stay at home during those months?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: No, I remember we went – we went into town, and must have been to – to get some supplies or something, but I don’t exactly remember what stop – you know, what store we stopped, or something like that.</span> <span id="s573">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did the town look – did – did you notice anything in the town, were there a lot of soldiers around, was it – the atmosphere and things like that, do you remember anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No, but you know, y-yo-you could feel that it was not the same.</span> <span id="s576">Then – and then of course, th – right then from the very beginning, the – the kind of terror started, where you wouldn’t be able to talk to anybody freely.</span> <span id="s577">You – you would – you know, it was – it – you could feel that everybody is kind of backing off, you know, I’m not going to say anything, and you know, that’s the way it was, because you couldn’t trust anyone any more.</span> <span id="s578">And of course, like everywhere else, there were – there were a lot of communists, Polish communists or Ukrainian communists or Jewish communists.</span> <span id="s579">And those people would – did go into cooperation, so you already didn’t know who you can trust.</span> <span id="s580">We apparently trusted my – you know, the landlord, because then he didn’t – didn’t kick us out or anything like that, so, you know, must have been a very kind and good person to permit that.</span> <span id="s581">But, other than –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Did you go to church?</span> <span id="s583">Do you remember going to church during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, I don’t remember at all.</span> <span id="s585">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s586">And I don’t even know – I don’t even remember what kind of church we went to in – you know, before that, but – because I don’t recall – recall that there was – there would have been church close to where we lived.</span> <span id="s587">It must have been somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: I asked, I mean not only for, you know, whether this keeps up traditions or so on, but sometimes in such moments, that’s where people gather, and they feel safer doing it, even if they may not speak to one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Yes, I’m – I’m sure – I am sure we did attend the masses got – but I don’t recall seeing – you know, being any – any church at the time, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: What was your mother’s demeanor like during these – these months?</span> <span id="s591">Did she seem to change for you, or not so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, I – I – she was apparently a strong character.</span> <span id="s593">And so somehow she accepted that, you know, and when she was born and – until 1914, that part of Poland was under Russian occupation, all – you know.</span> <span id="s594">And so she was not shocked by – by, you know, being under Russians again somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So Lódz had been under – had been under the Russian occupation, earlier in the century?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: In – wha – in it – in – before the first World War, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: That is par – part of the tsarist empire?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Uh-huh, okay, so she was – it wasn’t the first time she saw Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s600">Or soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Right.</span> <span id="s602">Different – different ones, different uniforms and you know, different government kind of thing, but – but she was familiar with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Did she speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: No, she did not.</span> <span id="s605">Even – even – you know, she probably some few words.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s607">[technical interruption] Okay, where were we?</span> <span id="s608">We were talking about your mother, and her knowledge of Russian, or lack of it and so on, and that she was not unfamiliar.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Right, but – but she – I don’t know, maybe she was just simply not the type to learn other languages.</span> <span id="s610">She did learn some sp – some French, and – when she was in school, but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to speak Russian.</span> <span id="s611">But – but she did not become fluent, you know.</span> <span id="s612">Probably enough words to – to get by.</span> <span id="s613">And the Russians and Polish are very similar, so you could really understand without having to really learn the language.</span> <span id="s614">And that’s the way she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s616">So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was rather minimal.</span> <span id="s617">It was when they came – the doctor came to look at your father’s wound, and then your father left, and – I should say Soviet military authorities, not Russian military authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And then it was when you visit him in – in prison that one time.</span> <span id="s620">Had it – had soldiers, or had any, from the occupying military authority been down your street or in your home in, you know, after that, before – before April?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No.</span> <span id="s622">Becau – you know that when they found out that my father was going – was out –</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: – they – I don’t remember that somebody came in to inquire about what happened, that my mother was beaten, or something like that.</span> <span id="s625">Somehow we – we were lucky enough to avoid that kind of contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s627">So what happens in April?</span> <span id="s628">And what date in April?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Then we – then the first deportation from the Polish territories occurred in – in February – in February.</span> <span id="s630">And so we were aware of the fact that people were being deported.</span> <span id="s631">And of course, you never knew who was going to be the next one.</span> <span id="s632">But then on – on April 13th at night, another – three o’clock, four o’clock in the morning or something like that, a banging sounded at the door, and the Russian troops came in, and th – we were ordered to pack within half an hour, and we’re being taken away.</span> <span id="s633">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: And you were woken up from sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yes, and this is – this is the standard normal way that those units operated.</span> <span id="s636">Because you were asleep, you were drowsy, you know, you – you don’t – you couldn’t resist because you were not organized yet.</span> <span id="s637">And so this was the standard way that they would come in in the morning.</span> <span id="s638">And so we – my mother packed whatever she could into a match – kind of box, and we were then taken to the – to the railroad station in – in Dolina(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: And how were you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: By – by horse driven cart.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s642">Were you the only ones in the cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: I see, so the neighborhood, nobody from downstairs, nobody from across the street.</span> <span id="s645">You were the only ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: That’s what I – from – from – from – within the nearest –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: – area.</span> <span id="s649">And we were taken over to the – to the station and loaded on the – no, I call it cattle car, it was just a regular, you know, railroad car that how was – inside was divided into two areas.</span> <span id="s650">The middle was open, and then on – the other two they had the – they had the lower level and they had another level where we – they would put the people on.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So there was like bunkbeds inside the –</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Like a – like a bu – like a bunk, but it was just a whole solid floor across the whole thing.</span> <span id="s653">And – and so they loaded the entire thing, I don’t know how many, 60 people, I think were just like – we’re just packed, you know.</span> <span id="s654">And the doors were shut, and in the, you know, several hours laters, this – the train started and we started moving towards the – the Soviet border.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Did you know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Which way we were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Did you – did you have one of those bunks, were you standing up, were you sitting down, were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I think we were – we were on the lower floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: And so th – and – and a – the – the – you know, the only facility that was in the thing was – was a hole in the – in the floor where you could go and do your whatever – things.</span> <span id="s663">And so we were taken, and it took couple days, I suppose.</span> <span id="s664">Because you know, those – those transports, they are not – they stopped for military and this and that, and they didn’t – they didn’t care how long it takes for them to travel.</span> <span id="s665">So, a-after a couple days we had to be relo – reloaded into the Russian train.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Tell me – tell me this, the – the atmosphere within the cattle car, were people silent?</span> <span id="s667">Were they crying, were they talking, were they – what was – what was going on?</span> <span id="s668">Did anybody say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: I don’t recall, but I’m sure they did talk ab-about it, you know, and – but there weren’t any c-cries, any yellings, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s670">It was rather quiet, because everybody was s-so scared –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: – that you – you know, I mean all of a sudden you’re taken away – everything is you – y-you in completely different world.</span> <span id="s673">This is what you have, and that’s all?</span> <span id="s674">And so it wasn’t something that the people start sa – you know, telling jokes, and laughing, you – you know.</span> <span id="s675">It was – it was rather silent.</span> <span id="s676">And I remember when – when we came to the border, and we had to move to the Russian trains, because the Russian railroad system was wired in Polish.</span> <span id="s677">So th – we couldn’t use Polish trains any more.</span> <span id="s678">So we were reloaded, and kept going east.</span> <span id="s679">And then realized that we are being sent, you know, into the territory of the so – Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s680">So it – I don’t remember how it – how long it took, but it probably took several weeks for us to finally travel almost to – to the Ural Mountains, just a – towards the – towards the – with – on the south of the Ural Mountains, and – and the – and the – and the steppe begins, the – the plains.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Did you have any – I mean, how did you eat?</span> <span id="s682">Did they give you any food, any water?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes, we were ti – we were fed apparently, you know, the – the famous Russian thing that you can get on a train.</span> <span id="s684">It’s called kipiatok, the hot water – the boiling water from the – from the engine.</span> <span id="s685">So they would open and said okay, okay, go and get kipiatok.</span> <span id="s686">So everybody went, you know, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Did people have cups with them?</span> <span id="s688">In – did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: You – if y-you better had something on your own.</span> <span id="s690">So that was the only liquid that we were given, and they apparently must have stop on their own – on the – on the way wherever they stopped, to give us some bread.</span> <span id="s691">And in general, in Russian –in Russia that’s what you – if you’re lucky, you eat bread, not like this one in here, but – but you were lucky if you – if you got, you know, a hundred grams of bread a day.</span> <span id="s692">And that’s the way we were fed.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did – were – did everybody survive the three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s695">Which was very different from the first deportation, where people were deported in the middle of the winter.</span> <span id="s696">And in that time, many old people, many children have died o-of – just froze to death.</span> <span id="s697">I-In our case no, because it was – you know, already spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: So you don’t remember the cold –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: – particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: No, no, no, it wasn’t – it wasn’t that, because no, it was just normal spring temperatures already.</span> <span id="s702">So we were not freezing and – an-and it was cold, but we were not freezing.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Did your mother say anything to you during this transport, at – during the time you’re in the cattle car that you remember?</span> <span id="s704">I’m sure you spoke, I’m sure you talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Oh sure, n-no, I – I don’t remember any particular –</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: – like I suppose she must have talked to m – told me that don’t worry, everything is going to be fine, but I don’t recall this, as a particular, you know, moment of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Did you know anybody else prior – I mean, there were other people on the – on the cattle car, did you recognize anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: So, they were all strangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: They were all stranger, y-you know, you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: You were just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: – and you know, after being two months, you know, in an – in a new area.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: But – but you mir – you make friends right there, you’re beginning to talk to people and –</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Okay, so tell me what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Okay, and then after – after traveling for some time, we were unloaded in Kostanay, which is a capital city of the Kazakhstan, Kazakh Republic.</span> <span id="s720">And we were transported to a – to a kolkhoz, which is –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: What’s a kolkhoz?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Kolkhoz is a – is a farm run by the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: It’s a – you know, there was no pra – private property, there was just a – when the revolution happened, they took the mi – the land from the landlords, and from the people and made them into units, which are large administrative units called in – I think our case, kolkhoz.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: And we would – we put in a – in a – the village, and in – into the house of a – of a Ukrainian couple that was deported during 1930s.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: When – when the – you know, the Russians started the killing of the Ukrainians, and they just simply starved them to death.</span> <span id="s729">And I think it was just like nine million people di – that starved to death, because they started rebelling against the, you know, Russians taking their soil, their land, their – their things.</span> <span id="s730">So they became a part of this group that lush – Russians, as they say, pacified them by transporting them into the Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s731">So – so they fully realized what we went through, because they went through it.</span> <span id="s732">So they were very kind, very friendly, you know, and – and opened their house for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Isn’t that interesting, given that there had been tension and conflict between Ukrainians and Poles historically –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: – particularly in the border regions.</span> <span id="s736">And it’s – kind of – feels almost like grace, that you – your destiny brings you to a place where you have people who understand what you’re going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Right, you know, and in – and I – I don’t to – I don’t think there was any Russian normal person that did not go to some kind of something like that.</span> <span id="s738">And then ta – so, we were there for several months, and my mother was working cutting peat.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s740">And how do you – what does that mean, cutting peat?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Well, you know – you know what peat is, it was – it’s a – it’s a – like a – hm.</span> <span id="s742">A growth of – of – of a thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: – and it’s – like the growth is so thick, that it – it forms about a size like that, you know.</span> <span id="s745">And once you try – once you cut it into – into like squares, and then it gets dried up.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: And then you can burn it.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So it can be used for heating.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: It can be used for heating, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: And for fuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: And so she was doing that and – and I remember telling him – her telling me later is that the – the lady of the house, that – the Ukrainian woman took my mother away for – for a minute and she said, Sabina, I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s754">My son, who is in the military is coming to visit us, and please, for heaven’s sake, don’t say anything against the Soviet government, because he’s going to report you, and he’s going to report us, and all of us are going to be taken away.</span> <span id="s755">Mother about her own son.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: So, you know, that – this – th-this – that’s the way the system worked.</span> <span id="s758">That you never – you – you never knew – you couldn’t form any kind of units, like you know, people getting together and thinking and whispering and thing, because you were afraid of your neighbors, of course, but you were also afraid of your own children, because the propaganda was such strong thing, they said it – if they – if he heard them talking something about the Soviet Union [indecipherable] government, they would a – a – have – against it.</span> <span id="s759">They were – there were people to be – get in river – get rid of because you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: They’re [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: – the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: You know, and so that’s the whole system worked, it worked on the basis of complete distrust to each other.</span> <span id="s764">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: So that makes it even more remarkable that you – you were able to form this bond with these people, because they had gone through enough that they reached out to you, or you reached out to them, I don’t – I don’t know how, but – but in that atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Right, but what – apparently they – well, the – first of all, they knew that we’re new, so we are not part of the system, you know.</span> <span id="s767">And – and the other thing was that all of a sudden they realized that they had gone through that, and they may as – may as well open their hearts to people that are going through it right now, you know, and so it was – it was really very nice.</span> <span id="s768">But we weren’t there too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s770">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: And then we were transferred –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Oh, by the way, did the son – did the son come and did you meet him?</span> <span id="s773">Did you remember that – anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No, I don’t remember that, but – but he – he was going to come right – right away, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: – so you know, so she – he must have come.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: And you know, then everybody was quiet and –</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: – everything was fine.</span> <span id="s781">The – the – the system is wonderful, and you know, and you have to do anything to survive.</span> <span id="s782">So everybody – they didn’t know exactly what to do, what to say, and how to, you know, say hello for the Soviet Union, you know, Batka(ph) Stalin, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Father Stalin.</span> <span id="s785">He was father of the whole Fatherland.</span> <span id="s786">So, you know.</span> <span id="s787">And it’s really strange that within few years – because the revolution was in 1917, and that within few years, it’s to – what, 20 years, and you could – you could create such a system of oppression, that – of mistrust, of – of fear.</span> <span id="s788">And – and s – and many times you didn’t have to say anything.</span> <span id="s789">It’s just that you happened to be in the wrong place in the wrong time.</span> <span id="s790">And you were just arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: So this – this knowledge – you were seven years old.</span> <span id="s792">Did you feel this automatically?</span> <span id="s793">Is this something your mother warned you about, so that – you know, don’t talk here, don’t talk there.</span> <span id="s794">How did you know this, as a seven year old boy?</span> <span id="s795">A: Well, that – I was listening to – to – to the Ukrainian woman telling my mother about it, and so this – this is – it – it just becomes natural.</span> <span id="s796">You c – you c – you could feel this happening, you know, and so everybody just simply shuts up.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: And – and a – and I d – I didn’t tell you that, but – but when we were being deported, my – my little dog Tito, the chocolate eater, the Russian officer that was in charge throws it at me and he says [speaks Russian].</span> <span id="s799">Take – take your –</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Take your dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: – do-dog with you.</span> <span id="s802">And so he was deported with us to the – to the Soviet Union, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: There was a dog in the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yes, a little dog in the – and the dog is – dog was about like this.</span> <span id="s805">It’s – it’s a – it’s a kind of a dog that apparently comes from India, but, you know, thousands of years ago.</span> <span id="s806">And he was simply a house dog.</span> <span id="s807">And when we ended up in a – in a – after being taken away from this kolkhoz and put in another one, which – which was a – a cattle farm – no, I’m sorry, no, this was the kolkhoz yet.</span> <span id="s808">My mother was going on – on to this – cutting this – this peat.</span> <span id="s809">And he run after her one time, and then he c – he run away and come – comes back after a while, jumping at my mother and – and you know, and – and howling and taking, you know, just come with me, you know.</span> <span id="s810">So – so she goes with him into the steppe, and she sees a – a big rabbit, killed.</span> <span id="s811">And killed by this little dog.</span> <span id="s812">And what happened in – in all these generations of being house pet, in – in circumstances like this, his past comes to him.</span> <span id="s813">Because apparently these dogs were used to kill the snakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: And they’re little – little dog, half of the – of the rabbit, jumps at the rabbit, grabs him here by the throat and kills him one – once [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s816">And then –why did he realize that my mother will be very happy to take this, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s817">But she came in and – and we had the feast that evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: That’s amazing.</span> <span id="s819">That’s amazing.</span> <span id="s820">That’s amazing and I’m also amazed that the cattle car people didn’t eat your little dog, cause everybody’s hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: He was not much to eat, you know, so the – wouldn’t – wouldn’t even feed one person, so probably that’s why he survived.</span> <span id="s822">And he survived through the – all – all our being in Russia, and we took him back, you know, we took him to Teheran, and I’ll tell you that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s824">So he got some of your crumbs of bread when you were in the cattle car, and that allowed him to survive, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s827">Okay.</span> <span id="s828">So your mother is then transferred.</span> <span id="s829">How – do military authorities, or the local authorities –</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: No, the – the – the loc – loc – local ter – authorities just loaded us up and you know, send us to another area, and that area was – it was a f – a farm that was dedicated to raising cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: And so all of a sudden from peat digger, she becomes a cattle rise – raiser.</span> <span id="s833">She had a group of 30 calves that she had to take into the steppe, feed, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: So, shepherdess.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Shepherdess, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: And so she – she was doing that for the rest of the stay up north.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: For a city girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: For a city girl who – person that was taking care of, you know, camps an-and things like that.</span> <span id="s840">But that – that was normal, and i-if – in – in Russia there is a saying that [speaks Russian]</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s842">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: It doesn’t work, it doesn’t eat.</span> <span id="s844">So – so everybody had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: What about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: No, I was too small.</span> <span id="s847">But then wa – once we were transferred to the other location, and it was already getting into the time when the – when the schoolyear begins, I was assigned to go to the Russian school.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: So this is half a year.</span> <span id="s849">If you’re leaving in April, if you’re deported in April 13th, 1940, you spend a couple of months in the first place, and then several months in the second, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: End of September came around –</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: And then September comes around.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: – and – and – and – and I was – and I was – I was put to school, and I – again for the fir – to the first grade, because I, you know, didn’t know Russian at all.</span> <span id="s853">And – but for a kid to learn is much faster, and so I – I went to school, and apparently I was very good, because I have – I got a diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: You got a diploma?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Let’s see the diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Oh yes, I have – I have a diploma that I was given after graduation – after completing the first grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: So that would have been a regular school year, September to May or June or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Something like that.</span> <span id="s860">And this is my diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s862">Got that?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: And it – and this [speaks Russian] or diploma, because I – I graduated as – as a – one of the first students.</span> <span id="s864">I had – everything was very good, and so Batchka(ph) Stalin, Lenin gave me this in appreciation.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Well, were you proud of it as a young child, or did you already feel a sarcasm there?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: I already knew what it was all about.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: What are some of those other papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Oh, this is – this is a – a – was graduation from the fir – first case – grade – the first grade, and the Russian language, the mathematics, history, and I – all the grades were – were very good.</span> <span id="s873">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Let’s turn it this way a little bit, okay.</span> <span id="s875">Can you – can you focus in a little more so that they co – we could actually read the writing?</span> <span id="s876">Okay.</span> <span id="s877">Thank you.</span> <span id="s878">So you took these papers with you.</span> <span id="s879">You –</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: So somehow I am – I managed to save them, and you know, this is really – the only thing that I remember, that proves that – that I was deported to the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: You never had any other kind of – of –</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Documents, passports or something like that?</span> <span id="s883">I – I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s884">I do – I don’t recall seeing anything that my mother had.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Now, when those soldiers came to deport you, did they in – you know, back in Dolina(ph), did they say why?</span> <span id="s886">Did they say, you’re enemies, or did they just say, pack up you’re leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Yeah, that’s all.</span> <span id="s888">They just simply do not discuss these things.</span> <span id="s889">It’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: No reason given.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: – no reason given, just pack up and go.</span> <span id="s892">And so, you know – but I – I’m – in a way I’m glad that I – that I went to school, because I still remember a lot of Russian.</span> <span id="s893">I cannot – I cannot just talk too much, because you know that, after years of not using it.</span> <span id="s894">But – but – and it’s – it’s very difficult for me to – to read, but after a while I can – I can begin to read, you know, and so like [indecipherable] just, you know, it comes out.</span> <span id="s895">But – but it’s – but it isn’t – oh, and this is – this is [speaks Russian] the national –</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: The people’s commissariat?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Yeah, commissariat of education.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s899">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: So, you know, I’m very proud of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Well, actually, I think it’s something very much to be proud of, for a child that is traumatized like that, to still be able to perform in school to such –</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: And – and – and – and I di – passed grades, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s904">I’m sure that your mother was very pleased, even though it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Well, you know, it wa – it was – I’m glad yat – that I did, that I didn’t waste my time, that I have learned basics to the point where – I’ll tell you later, probably, this was useful for me when I was in U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: No kidding.</span> <span id="s907">No kidding.</span> <span id="s908">Okay, we’ll talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s910">Anyway, so th-the rest of the time that we spent in 1941 –</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: So where did you – excuse me – you – you moved to this other place where she becomes – she starts herding cattle.</span> <span id="s912">Your living circumstances, were you – tell me a little about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Well, we lived in a – in a – a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: That we were assigned, I think we were like three families in – in one room in a barrack.</span> <span id="s916">And s – it was just the place for you to put down for night.</span> <span id="s917">And because my mother was working, so she was entitled to – to some kind of a ability to get food, you know, from the local store.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Were you hungry during these times, during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Most of the people in the Soviet Union are hungry.</span> <span id="s920">If you survive on a piece of bread that’s about that size, you know, of loaf of bread, and maybe little bit of vegetables, or something that, you know, that come out your way, yes, you are hungry all the time.</span> <span id="s921">Maybe you’re not starving, but you know, you don’t – you don’t – and there’s not much – not – not mu-much else to eat.</span> <span id="s922">And you just – so you just simply feed yourself with th-the least things that you can get.</span> <span id="s923">And it – it’s – in a way it’s good because you don’t have to spend your time cooking things, you know.</span> <span id="s924">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: So it’s a – it’s a far cry from Tito eating candies off of a Christmas tree.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes, it was a ver – a very far cry.</span> <span id="s927">But Tito was wi-with us, and he – he became a – a protector dog of the cattle.</span> <span id="s928">Because I remember one time the – the wolves came into the village, you know, to see if they can get one of those calves, you know.</span> <span id="s929">And it was in – in the evening and I remember the whole village came out with – with you know, something to bang on and trying to get those – those wolves out.</span> <span id="s930">And my dog run out and he started after them.</span> <span id="s931">And since they never saw anything like that in their lives, they got scared.</span> <span id="s932">So they started escaping and he run after them.</span> <span id="s933">And I said to myself, well, that’s – that’s the end of Tito.</span> <span id="s934">Well, after couple hours he comes back, he’s – his mouth full of – of you know, wolves’ –</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Fur?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: – wolves’ fur.</span> <span id="s937">So apparently he was chasing them and – and biting them, and he chased them away.</span> <span id="s938">So he became a hero of – of the – of the farm.</span> <span id="s939">So – he had quite a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Was sort of like, you know, in Shakespeare when he wrote “Romeo and Juliet,” and it was a tragedy, he’d introduce some comic relief.</span> <span id="s941">So here is Tito, he’s the comic relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s943">And so, you know, all the people in the village really liked him, you know, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s944">And he survived until later.</span> <span id="s945">And I’ll tell you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s947">So, during this time, do you know whether your mother was able to inquire about your father, or not even?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Oh, no, no, not at – not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No, because the system is such that once you – you become arrested, you are lost to your family.</span> <span id="s951">You just simply, you know – and you don’t want to – anybody to know, because then you became a – a – an enemy of the people.</span> <span id="s952">So, you know – but everybody knew, of course, that we are the enemies, because once we were deported, that means that you are the enemy.</span> <span id="s953">And – but – but – but the locals were understanding.</span> <span id="s954">They knew, because they went through the same thing themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Even in the second place?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Ena – even in the second place.</span> <span id="s957">It was – some of the people were there, you know, the same way, and the only other thing that I remember, other than just – just going to school is that one time a Russian, whoever, one of the representatives came in to me and he said, you know, we – we lost a couple horses, they escaped, they run away into the steppe and they probably went to this other vil – you know, place.</span> <span id="s958">Are you willing to – to go after them and bring them back?</span> <span id="s959">And of course I said yes, of course.</span> <span id="s960">So they gave me a horse, and they say okay, you go that – that direction, and that – that village is over there.</span> <span id="s961">And somehow I managed to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: You’re eight years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Eight years old.</span> <span id="s964">And to bring those two horses back.</span> <span id="s965">And in the meantime my mother almost had a heart attack, because they told her do – what they did.</span> <span id="s966">And you know, to get lost in the steppe is no problem at all.</span> <span id="s967">But somehow, I don’t know how, I managed to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: So not only my dog was a hero, but I was a hero also.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: Did you – when you were in the cattle car, and you started talking to people, do you remember anything about any of those people, what kind of people they were, whether they were all military families, or some professions, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: No, they’re – they were a congregation of all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s972">Because you know, anybody that worked for the polis – Polish government was naturally a – a –</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: An enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: – an enemy.</span> <span id="s975">So they – they had professors, they had teachers, they had, you know, simple people who were in the army, you know, for example, you know, just – just being a private in the army.</span> <span id="s976">But it was in the army of the – of the enemy of the – of the Soviet Union, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: And when you were in both places, I get the impression that your contact, actually, with official authorities was rather minimal.</span> <span id="s978">They weren’t part of your daily life, but they controlled your lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Right, because you know, th-the – the thing is that – that once you get deported into these vast territories, you – you – you can be physically free, because you’re not going to go away anywhere, because it is just simply impossible to escape.</span> <span id="s980">And I read many books later on, that – it’s the same thing is written in – in many books or people that were actually in jail, they were – they were, you know, under – under the – the supervision of the – of the military and things.</span> <span id="s981">And – but they were free to move about, because they didn’t c – there was no way you can escape.</span> <span id="s982">Because you knew that once you walked away into the – into the steppe, you’re dead.</span> <span id="s983">And if you’re not going to just die because of hunger, you – th-the wolves are going to get you.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Tell ma – you know, for those of us, and I’m one of them, who – I’ve never been in a steppe.</span> <span id="s985">What does a steppe look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: It’s – it-it’s a just vast space, flat.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Anything grows in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Just a – just weeds, just, the s – you know, grass.</span> <span id="s989">No trees.</span> <span id="s990">Just simply no trees, just flat as you – as far as you can go.</span> <span id="s991">Just like sometimes it feels here in – in – in – in – even in Illinois, except here they are, you know, they’re farms.</span> <span id="s992">But over there just simply, what it probably was here a couple hundred years ago, just plain full of grasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: And probably small animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: And some – some small animals, some wolves, you know, things.</span> <span id="s995">And in the middle of those – of those things, there were these locations of different farms, and like this one that we went – that we were, the – the cattle farm.</span> <span id="s996">Or there were – there were both the grown-up cattle and the calves, you know, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: You might have – you might have mentioned it before, but tell me again the name of the first place you were at, with the Ukrainian couple, and the second place.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: The first place I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: But – but the second one I – I even know the address.</span> <span id="s1001">[speaks Russian].</span> <span id="s1002">The first – the farm number one, Krabawick(ph) was – was a little town that was like a c – a county seat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: And Kostanay was the – the capital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: So, that I remember.</span> <span id="s1007">The little [indecipherable] I don’t remember what its name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: So, you were there at least through the school year.</span> <span id="s1009">What about the summer of 1941?</span> <span id="s1010">Where – in June 1941, the Soviet Union is attacked by Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s1011">Did you find out about that in this remote, remote place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Apparently yes, later on, because you know the – th-the newspapers would arrive there from time to time, and th-they would learn from the Russians we would – we would find out.</span> <span id="s1013">But it wasn’t until later, of course, that it came to us somehow, you know, through word of mouth or whatever, is that – that there – once the Russians were attacked, and the Germans were moving very rapidly, th-the Russians somehow managed to make contact with the – with the west, with the British and the Americans.</span> <span id="s1014">And they formed a ali-alliance all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s1015">And so, because they – they couldn’t have enough equipment, you know, so the – so the British and the Americans started supplying them with – with the military equipment.</span> <span id="s1016">And at that time, of course, the – the relationships between the Soviet Union and the Polish government was broken in 1939, and we didn’t have any mu – a-any diplomat relations with – with them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Wa – explain how there could be a Polish government, where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Well, in – in 1939, as I told you, there were people, hundreds of people, thousands of people moving out of Poland, going – going south.</span> <span id="s1019">The Polish government also left.</span> <span id="s1020">And from – from Hungary they were then transported to France, and they f – reformed as a – as a new government representing different political parties.</span> <span id="s1021">Then es-established this – themselves in France, and they started building up Polish military, because there were a lot of people that were escaping.</span> <span id="s1022">And that – they somehow managed to escape then from – from – from Romania and from Hungary, where they were – they were interned, because those countries were – were in – were – what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1023">Were not participating in war, they were – they were neutral.</span> <span id="s1024">So they – by the thousands they just run different ways.</span> <span id="s1025">You know, the – the roads opened to Italy and – and all kinds of places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: So this is where your father had hoped to be able to land.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: That’s what he was hoping, that he’s going to – to end up.</span> <span id="s1028">And so they formed military units in France.</span> <span id="s1029">And then, of course, when France was attacked, they did give up even sooner than – than Poland did.</span> <span id="s1030">And since we had an alliance with – with the British, the British had evacuated Polish troops from France, into England.</span> <span id="s1031">And this – so the Polish government had reestablished itself in England, and upon British insistence, the Soviet Union, because I don’t know exactly what – what was the – the – the words, but they said, you know, okay, we’ll – we’ll qui – give you equipment, but you know, you got – you – you telling us to open the second front, you know, we not quite ready yet.</span> <span id="s1032">But you have thousands of Polish troops in the Soviet Union prisons.</span> <span id="s1033">Why don’t you release them, and you’ll have ready troops, you know.</span> <span id="s1034">So somehow they managed to reestablish relationship with the Polish government in – in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So it’s the Americans and the British who are saying this to the Soviets?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1037">They said, you know, wis—we’ll help you, but – but you know, you saying that you don’t have enough troops, and blah-blah-blah-blah, this or this.</span> <span id="s1038">But you know, you have – you have maybe couple hundred thousand troops that you have arrested when you came into Poland.</span> <span id="s1039">Because that’s what happened, you know, because the units that were located in – in the east, they were all, you know, taken over by the Russians, and by the thousands they were deported to Russia.</span> <span id="s1040">And as you probably know, the – the – many of the officers and – and a – and a -- leading classes, like judges and teachers and things, they were – they were arrested by the thousands by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1041">And – and then the Polish officer corps, at – at least they know about 20,000 that were killed in Katyn, which was several times where they decided to liquidate the Polish military prisoners of war, which was against, you know, the Geneva Conference, of course.</span> <span id="s1042">But they killed 14,000 that was known, that – that were – that – that were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Do you think your father might have been amongst them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1045">I don’t think so, I don’t think so, because those were the officers that were – that were arrested as – as they gave themselves up to – to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1046">Because you know, Poland ha – had a – had a – a pact of – of military help.</span> <span id="s1047">And of course when the Germans and the Russians reestablished their pact, th-the Russians just liquidated that – that pact, so th-th-the officers that were arrested, you know, in the – in the military, they were in mi-military uniforms, they were in the units.</span> <span id="s1048">So the troops were sent, you know, into exile, but the officers were put in the – in a – in the prisons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1050">When you were talking about the first days of the war, and the Germans overri – overrunning Poland very, very quickly.</span> <span id="s1051">And then September 17th the Soviet army marching in.</span> <span id="s1052">Were you surprised to see the Soviet army?</span> <span id="s1053">Did anybody – I mean, did anybody expect to see them?</span> <span id="s1054">How did they kn –</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Th-Th-They – they came in and they were actually saying that they are helping us.</span> <span id="s1056">They are liberating us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: From the possibility of being taken over by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1059">And then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: So that was – that was what officially was being spoken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: This what – what – what was telling people on the street, you know.</span> <span id="s1062">And because we didn’t – you know, th-they didn’t let know that they had the Stalin li-libben – Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which they signed in August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: So tell – I mean, this is all stuff outside of your own specific experience.</span> <span id="s1064">But to put it in some context, can you explain a little bit about that pact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Well, as I said, th-the – the Russian and Poland had non-aggression pact –</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Russia and Poland, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: – for the – for the 10 years, and so we did not expect that the Soviets would move.</span> <span id="s1068">But the Hitler and – and Stalin signed a pact, called the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And what – what are those names?</span> <span id="s1070">Mili –</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Ribbentrop was a German repres-representative of – of the government, and the Molotov was the – the Russian like min –</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Soviet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: – Soviet – Soviet minister of mili – of the military affairs.</span> <span id="s1074">And so they signed a pact where the – the Russians told the Germans that they are – they will attack Poland from the – from the east.</span> <span id="s1075">And they pre-assigned the border, which they are going to divide Poland into – into, you know, into two parts.</span> <span id="s1076">And so, on September 17th, they just simply moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: And – and so the – all the Polish military were, you know, surprised as to what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1079">We have pact of non-aggression with you, and – and so that’s what happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: So, in other words, they had the pact.</span> <span id="s1081">There were several pacts going on.</span> <span id="s1082">There was a Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and there was a surprise on the side of the Poles when they see the Soviets there, because what happened to our pact?</span> <span id="s1083">Then there is the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Which kind of canceled –</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: – canceled that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: – canceled the Polish – Polish-Russian pact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: And that one is when Nazi Germany and Soviet Union agree not to fight each other, and divide Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: And then when the Soviets march in, they tell people – locally, the word on the street is that we’re here to save you from the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1092">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: We are here to help you.</span> <span id="s1094">And so, you know – and the – and then the – once the – this became and – and they came in to Poland and – and all that, I remember they were al-always saying [speaks Russian]</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: We are friends with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: They would say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: They would s – the military, you know, people that – well, the authorities, were saying that they are friends of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: And yet they’re saving you from German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1101">Well, because they took over, you know, that – that – and that they – you know, several months after they – they took over, even before we were deported, they had elections.</span> <span id="s1102">And 99.9 percent of Poles voted for those territories to become parts of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1103">O-On paper, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Did your mother have to vote in those elections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Everybody had to vote.</span> <span id="s1106">And it didn’t make any difference how you voted, because the percentage came out 99.9 anyway.</span> <span id="s1107">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: So, let’s go back to the address of the place that you were, which I could not repeat for the life of me.</span> <span id="s1109">And in June 1941, the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union, and somehow world – word must filter to your village that – that now – you know, there is an attack, the Soviet Union is at war on its own territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Well, there’s not [indecipherable] yet, but they were – they just moved to – to west –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Eastern.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: – the eastern part of Poland, and then it’s a military –</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: But apparently this is what – this is what – what happened, and as I said the – they would receive from y – from time to time the newspapers, and all of a sudden ne – you know, the newspaper just turned out to write like that.</span> <span id="s1115">Because once we were friends, and now we’re the enemies.</span> <span id="s1116">And so, somehow this kind of information got leaked into – into our areas.</span> <span id="s1117">But it didn’t make any – any difference, until later on, when the re – when the relations were reestablishment between the Polish and the Russian government.</span> <span id="s1118">And when the Russian issued a – a document, which made us back free citizens, with ability to move on the territory of the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And when did you find out about this?</span> <span id="s1120">How did – did somebody come to the – the barracks that you and your mother lived in, one day, and say you’re free now, you can move about the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: I don’t know how it happened, of course you know.</span> <span id="s1122">But – but this is – I know that later on from – from reading, that this is what happened, is that – that all of a sudden, even the people in our – in our little community have realized that now they can move about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: But – but – okay, now I’m going back to your life and your mother’s life and your experiences.</span> <span id="s1124">How did this happen with the two of you?</span> <span id="s1125">Was there a moment when you found out, and do you remember that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1127">I remember – one – one thing I remember is that after that happened, is that all of a sudden the older – the people that were located within – within the territory that we were in, somehow they discovered that the Polish army is being formed, in the southern states of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1128">And so everybody started moving south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: So in other words, you knew that you could – all right, I think I’d like to stop here now, though – [break] End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Witold Pawlikowski, on January 21st, 2015.</span> <span id="s1132">And before the break, Mr. puli – Pawlikowski, we were talking about the moment, or let’s say the – the – the time when you and your mother learned of the agreement that the Polish government in exile made with the Soviet Union, and what was going on, you know, in those – in those immediate days and months.</span> <span id="s1133">Before we get to that, I want to know, did your – did you make friends, did your mother make friends with other Poles while – or other people while she was in the Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s1134">You had mentioned before that people were very distrustful, and kept a distance between themselves.</span> <span id="s1135">Was there ever any exception to that, when people bridged the gap?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Well, in a way, but you know, it – it wasn’t – it wasn’t a friendship.</span> <span id="s1137">You just don’t develop friendship all of a sudden like that.</span> <span id="s1138">It was – it – it was a – a kind feelings towards us, und-understanding feelings, that they know what we’re going through because they have been through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: That means the locals who were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1141">And – and – but it’s very gi – difficult to call friendship, if you’re there for three or four months and you move somewhere else, you know.</span> <span id="s1142">It’s – it’s not th – not the same thing as you develop friendships over a long period of time.</span> <span id="s1143">But it was g-good relationships, let’s put it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: And what about other deportees.</span> <span id="s1145">Di – do you get to meet or get to know, in any way become close to other deportees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1147">The-These – these were – these were your – your people, and so, you know, and – and since we are in the same village, and well, like I said beginning that we lived in with two other families in there.</span> <span id="s1148">So – so you developed this kind of friendship.</span> <span id="s1149">Which lasts – I have friends now that – that I – not too many, I – I haven’t – those that I met in the Soviet Union, they all went different ways.</span> <span id="s1150">But the ones later on in Teheran and Iran, I – I ha – I maintain friendship with those people until now.</span> <span id="s1151">And I – I remember an – an incident when I was working for steel – U.S. Steel Corporation, and I was traveling throughout the United States, and I – so I – I went – I was going to Cleveland, and I told my boss, I – I said that’s great, because I have a friend in Cleveland.</span> <span id="s1152">And then a few months later, I-I was going to Philadelphia, and I said, oh, it’s terrific, I have a friend in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1153">And then I’m going to San Francisco, and he says, if you tell me that you have a friend in San Francisco, I won’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1154">And I said, but I do.</span> <span id="s1155">So he said, how in the heck could you guys do that?</span> <span id="s1156">Well, you know, I have a friend that I just talked to just recently who – who lives in – in Argentina.</span> <span id="s1157">I have friends in Australia.</span> <span id="s1158">That’s – that’s the way – what happens, you know, that those people spread around all over the place.</span> <span id="s1159">I have fre – friends in Canada that – that we visit, and we – we keep the – those friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: You mentioned something to me earlier, that your mother also developed such friendships.</span> <span id="s1161">That there was a lady in particular who was her best friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: We – we – we were in the same collective farm, and she was there with her mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Who was this lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Her – her name was Leila.</span> <span id="s1167">She was a Polish Jewess, and my mother had developed close friendship with her, and then when we – we left, she went to England sooner than we did, because her brother was in the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: So she was Jewish, and she had been deported as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: She wa – she was deported as well, with her mother.</span> <span id="s1170">And so when – when – after years that we haven’t seen her, because she was already in England, when we finally ended up in England, she – she ca-came to visit us, and then I was moving to London from the little town that – up in the – almost on the Scottish border.</span> <span id="s1171">And so she accepted me there, I was with – with her for some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Oh, so you lived with her, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I lived with her, and then after years, you know, after I came here, and I was in the army again, and we f – with a friend mi – of mine, we – we went to visit London, and we went to visit her.</span> <span id="s1174">And at that time she was working for a very exclusive nightclub.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: And she invited us and – and we met Mr. Errol Flynn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1180">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: So – so, you know, these friendships last a lifetime, because you had something in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: You had this experience that you’d gone through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1184">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Did you ever meet her brother, who was in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Yes, and he moved to the United States, he lived somewhere in the – in the west coast, and he’s gone by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: And do you know much about their story, where they were from?</span> <span id="s1188">Where she – what town she was from in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: No, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: – I don’t, no.</span> <span id="s1192">But she was very close with my mother an-and I – I have a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1194">Maybe you’ll show me later.</span> <span id="s1195">Okay, terrific.</span> <span id="s1196">So, there you are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: Oh [indecipherable] her last name was Yolis(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Yolles(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yolles(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Would that be j-o-l-e-s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Double L.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: J-o- double l-e-s, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Not – not the J, Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Y-o-l-l-e-s.</span> <span id="s1207">Okay.</span> <span id="s1208">Filo(ph) Yolles, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A2: [inaudible in London, Janusz(ph) Scruwajinski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Oh, and well, we’ll – we’ll tell that story later.</span> <span id="s1211">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Okay, about somebody else that you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1215">So – so yes, so your mother and other people in – you know, who were – who were deported from Poland learn about this agreement where you’re free to move, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Right, and – and how did it come and all way to this little godforsaken place, I don’t know, but we found out that there is an agreement, and that by this agreement all the Poles are released from the prisons, and then the Polish army is being formed.</span> <span id="s1217">So when – when this group of Poles in our village and o-other places heard that, they all got together and they decided to move south towards where the army was being formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: So how were you going to do that?</span> <span id="s1219">How did they do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: We were transported to – to this – to the railroad station, I don’t know how, how they managed this I have no idea, but the transport was formed and we were moved to the railroad station, loaded on a train.</span> <span id="s1221">And the train, I think it was like six weeks that we were on the train.</span> <span id="s1222">Again, the cattle car, and so we were moving from one place to another, until we went to – through Tashkent(ph), the place that my grandfather was – was in, and we went through Bukhara(ph) and I – I don’t know how many other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Was – was the cattle car different than the first cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Well, it was – it was slightly bigger, because of – of the railroad system of – in – in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1225">But the – the – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: The slats were the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: The slats were the sa – the same.</span> <span id="s1228">Except for more people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: And I take it they weren’t closed then, and – and you weren’t locked into these cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: No, we were not locked any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: No, because we were free citizens to move about.</span> <span id="s1233">Which is, you know, very unusual in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1234">And so, in traveling all these – these distances, we finally ended up where they decided to unload us because the railroad wheels were being abused, you know, so we had to discharge.</span> <span id="s1235">And they moved us to a kolkhoz called Frumza(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: So this was a collective farm called Frumza(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: It was a collec – collective farm called Frumza(ph), and is – and it wasn’t far away, maybe 20 kilometers from what they call now Almaty(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Or Almata(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Almata(ph), mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: And so we’re unloaded there, and put in a kolkhoz, and then we found out that a part of the division is being formed in – in alna – Almata(ph).</span> <span id="s1242">And we were with this other woman and her son, and both my mother and she became ill with typhoid fever, and she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: The other lady died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: The other lady died.</span> <span id="s1245">The son was 15 or 16 at that time, older than I was, and so my mother, you know, took care of him.</span> <span id="s1246">And my mother almost died also, but she was – and she was – she was – she told me later on she was moved from the room, into the hallway, and this – the – the nurses said uzha(ph) konshied(ph).</span> <span id="s1247">She’s finishing up.</span> <span id="s1248">And – and then my mother said no.</span> <span id="s1249">I have a son.</span> <span id="s1250">And then she recovered.</span> <span id="s1251">And so, what happened that this – this – this lady’s husband was in a – in a Polish military unit, a corps of engineers, and he escaped and was in – in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1252">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Did she know that, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: And she knew that, and he had also her addresses from – from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1255">So he discovered that his best friend is in a unit that is being formed in Almata(ph).</span> <span id="s1256">And his friend came to pick us up – pick them up and take them to where the military was.</span> <span id="s1257">And she was gone already, so instead, we were taken, and – and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: And the boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: – and the boy.</span> <span id="s1260">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s1262">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Janusz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: And his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Sohachewski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Sohachewski(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Sohachewski(ph).</span> <span id="s1268">And when – when – when we came to Teheran his father took him and brought him to – to Palestine, and enrolled him in – in the Polish like organization of – like a mil – paramilitary organization.</span> <span id="s1269">And then, of course he went to England, and he lives in England [indecipherable] right now, and we keep in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Amazing.</span> <span id="s1271">Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: So, you know, he’s just like my older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Did you have hopes of maybe finding out about your father when the Polish military unit was formed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1275">My – my – my mother had written to the Polish Red Cross, and the international Red Cross and I – somewhere she has a – a document which is – it appears that your husband has died on the territory of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1276">And that’s the only thing we have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: But there – there’s no record of when and how, of what causes – was it his wo – you know, re – reworking of the wound, or was he killed?</span> <span id="s1279">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s1280">Because this kind of documentation you simply do not get from that system.</span> <span id="s1281">There, nobody knows anything.</span> <span id="s1282">And as – it’s much easier that way.</span> <span id="s1283">And you know, it – to me, right now, it doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s1284">I know that he perished.</span> <span id="s1285">So what else can you do?</span> <span id="s1286">But, you know, it’s – it’s something that you have to live with, and something that you must realize, that this is what happened, that you have gone through some unusual circumstances, and – and you have to live, because if you don’t, if you think about it all the time, you can really hurt yourself quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1287">So that’s why me – maybe I have forgotten some of these things, maybe purposely, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: That’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: But you know – but it’s one of those – those things, and what difference does it make where he is, and if I – if I could find his grave or something?</span> <span id="s1290">It’s 50 some years, you know, he’s gone.</span> <span id="s1291">And you know, I – I d – I know he’s gone and I know that he’s perished at the – you know, in the territories of the Soviet Union and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: – that’s satisfactory to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Did you find that when you were s – when you were already – had you already left the Soviet Union, or before, your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Yes, I think it was already in – in Teheran that she found out, right.</span> <span id="s1296">And we have never – there was nev – never a trace of him, you know, somebody coming out that knew him from the prison or something.</span> <span id="s1297">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1298">Just gone.</span> <span id="s1299">So I – I suppose he must have died soon after he was deported, you know, and probably from the wound, because it wasn’t healed, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Tell me a little bit about your journey from Almata(ph) to actually leaving the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1301">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Well, first of all, you know, once we were under the protection of – of the military, we began to be fed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: The Polish military.</span> <span id="s1304">Even though – even still in Kazakhstan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: In – in – still in – in Uzbekistan because Almaty(ph) is in –</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Uzbekistan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: – Uzbekistan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Yeah, so – so our survival was – the possibility of survival was much, much better terms.</span> <span id="s1310">And then, as I said before, the – the Russians didn’t want to – to arm the Polish military, because it was – you know, something that they just don’t do.</span> <span id="s1311">You do not arm the enemies, who become now friends, and so – so they were still asking Americans and British to open up the front, and – and they said, well you have – you have the Polish army, you have over 100,000 troops, you know, why don’t you arm them?</span> <span id="s1312">Oh, we don’t have anything to do.</span> <span id="s1313">So the British said, well, then you release them.</span> <span id="s1314">Let us take care of them, let us arm them, and they can become a part of the second front when we finally open it.</span> <span id="s1315">So, by miracle I suppose, Uncle Stalin decided that yes, okay, we will do that.</span> <span id="s1316">And we were released.</span> <span id="s1317">And so military started moving [indecipherable] troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: So the first – the first thought had not been to release all of – not – not allow anybody to leave the territory, but just grou – regroup and form a military unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: That’s what – that’s what even the Poles wanted to do, because of what – they wanted to fight for Poland, you know, as when the Russians are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: – going to start pressing westward, they will part of the – of that system.</span> <span id="s1322">But the Russians didn’t trust them, because they were all anti-Soviet.</span> <span id="s1323">Many of them had – had fought in the – in the war of 1920, when the Soviets started pushing into Poland, and were defeated, luckily.</span> <span id="s1324">So – so the – all these troops were enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: And also the – the – you know, nobody knew about Katyn yet.</span> <span id="s1326">Nobody knew at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: No.</span> <span id="s1328">Not – not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: No.</span> <span id="s1331">And so – so the – the relationship was lukewarm at best.</span> <span id="s1332">And I suppose they really wanted to get rid of those people too, because there – there would – you know, there would – th-they were like a – like – like a foreign organism within the system, you know, and th-there were – there were – y-you know – I – I remember there’s a little story that one of the units, I don’t know which one it was, because I had it – I heard a story about it.</span> <span id="s1333">But they were being formed and a – and then local people have come to – to this unit, and they said, do you – do you – do you play this – this hymn that – that is being played by – by the trumpet?</span> <span id="s1334">And – and guy says what – oh, what a – what a di – this single trumpeteer sings this song, you know, di – plays this song.</span> <span id="s1335">And all of a sudden this – this guy realizes that in the city of Kraków there is a – there is a – a church with a – with a spire on it.</span> <span id="s1336">And in – in 14 – in 1200 some, when – when the Tartars and – and Turks s-started moving towards Poland, they came to that town.</span> <span id="s1337">And the guy being at the top of the – of – of the – of the tower, he saw it.</span> <span id="s1338">And so he played th-the hymn to warn the city to close the gates and – and protect itself.</span> <span id="s1339">And – which we did.</span> <span id="s1340">And then – their – their attack was repursed – repursed, and then they had to go back, and we chased them away.</span> <span id="s1341">And – and they remembered this story being told over generations, because you know, from – that if they hear that flo – that – that – that hymn again, they will become free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: So the local people came to a Polish army unit –</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: To ask that they play this – this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Trumpet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: – that they can be free – free.</span> <span id="s1346">Well, of course it took another 50 years, but they – they’re free now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: So these – these stories do happen and – and I – I had it in a book and I don’t know what happened with the book, but – but it was written, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: And you heard it – and you heard it then, when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: After we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: After you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: After we left, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Because it – you know, it would be written and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1355">But can you imagine now, from 1200 something, to have it believe that something like that, if – if this – this trumpet is played again in our town –</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: We can –</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: – we’ll – we’ll be free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: We can – we can [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1359">We can be free.</span> <span id="s1360">Did you travel then, from this place to – by train, or by horse driven carriage, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: No, we were – we were loaded on the train – because it was, you know, quite far east.</span> <span id="s1362">So, together with the military we were loaded on trains, and we were then sent all the way to – to the Caspian Sea, to the par – port of Krasnovodsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Krasnovodsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1365">And then we were loaded on the ship, and went south to the port of Baclevy(ph), which is already on – on the – on the Persian territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: What do you remember on the ship crossing over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: It was packed with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Just a – people were sitting on – on the – on the – not only all the – th-the – the – in-inside the ship, but also on – on the decks.</span> <span id="s1370">They’re just packed the people wer – as much as – as they could.</span> <span id="s1371">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Your mother and your – yourself were together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yes, we were together.</span> <span id="s1374">And it was – i-it – it happened right before Easter of 1942.</span> <span id="s1375">So, the Easter of 1942, we celebrated as free people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: So, when you left – so, in other words, it was like a – a two year saga.</span> <span id="s1377">You had been deported on April 13th, 1940, and two years later you’re on this boat, leaving the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1379">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Now, were you had been deported to, you know, that second place, were there others that couldn’t – that weren’t free?</span> <span id="s1381">I mean, was it only Polish deportees who were – or deportees from Poland who were in this cattle breeding, or cattle herding town, or were there deportees from other countries that were also there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: No, just – just – just Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: So, all the Poles more or less left that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Ay – ma – those that had the guts enough to say, we are going.</span> <span id="s1385">But there were some that had little, you know, a little – started little gardens and th-they put the vegetables on there, something like that.</span> <span id="s1386">And some decided to stay.</span> <span id="s1387">And out of over a million and a half of people that were – that were deported to the Soviet Union during the – at the time, only couple hundred thousand people have moved away.</span> <span id="s1388">The rest of them either died, or had to wait until 1953 to return to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Right, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Luckily, we were not one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Okay, I wanted – thank you for filling that in, cause I wanted to get a sense of the scope, and that’s what you gave me right now, is that a million and a half people had been deported from these eastern territories of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: And only a couple of hundred thousand were able to leave.</span> <span id="s1394">Now, did you have to have a military connection in order to be able to leave the country?</span> <span id="s1395">Because this was – the whole purpose was to regroup, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I – I – I think so.</span> <span id="s1397">And this – and – and I think, luckily for us, because we were considered to be military family, just the same like – like this friend of mine, Janusz, we were able to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Some of them probably not.</span> <span id="s1400">I don’t know all the stories, you know, how it – how it happened, but – but that’s what happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1402">And on this ship, did people feel like they could talk freely?</span> <span id="s1403">Were they talking all the time, were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s1405">Well, you – you can imagine the stories that – that the people were saying, and – and you know, then we’re dropped in – in Baclevy(ph) in – in – on – on the shore, and the British had already the tents prepared.</span> <span id="s1406">The camp – camp already was being formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Was it the – excuse me, was it the Soviets who had – were commandeering the ship, or was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: It was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Oh, right, it was a Soviet ship, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: It was a Soviet ship –</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: – and so Soviet officials?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1416">And, did they treat you any differently now that you were, you know, leaving the country, or were they distant, or were they rude?</span> <span id="s1417">What were they were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Oh yeah, they were always distant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Because you are afraid that if you get too close to someone, that someone, like I told you about the son –</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: – may tell them that they are too friendly with us, for example, you know.</span> <span id="s1423">So no, they were – they were a distance away.</span> <span id="s1424">They did their duties, whatever they were told to do, they were doing.</span> <span id="s1425">So they – they were to transport all this Polish cattle, that was fine with them, and you know, they did their – their duties as a seamen.</span> <span id="s1426">But, you know, we were on the ship only, I think two or three days, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: – this is a shi – it’s a short distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Because Caspian Sea is a lake, huge lake, but it’s called sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: The Caspian Sea, yeah.</span> <span id="s1432">So you’re dropped on the shore in Baclevy(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: We dropped on the shore in Baclevy(ph) and we spent Easter there, and – and the first thing you – you had to do is to attend, or to go to – to be washed, and all your things were to be given up, because lice was in everybody’s clothing.</span> <span id="s1434">And not just lice, hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s1435">I remember one time sitting down and – and killing 200 of them in one time.</span> <span id="s1436">Just, ck, ck, ck, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: This was in the Soviet Union [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: This was Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1439">So that’s – that’s why we had to give up all our clothing, and they were just burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Well here – I didn’t ask this before, but let me ask it now.</span> <span id="s1441">You mentioned that when you were in the cattle car, in your first deportation, there was only a hole in the ground for people to take care of their natural functions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Were you ever able to take a shower?</span> <span id="s1444">I mean, this is – it’s such a naïve question, but I wondered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Wer – no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: No.</span> <span id="s1448">No, you know, it’s – you – you are being transported, you di – never knew when you’re going – you know, you’ve made a stop.</span> <span id="s1449">Some people would go away, you know, to find some, I don’t know, food or something like that.</span> <span id="s1450">They come back and they’re – and they’re – the train was gone.</span> <span id="s1451">And that’s why yo – a lot of families were lost.</span> <span id="s1452">That’s why there were a lot of children that were without the parents, because either they died, or they simple – there were incidents like that, where the mother was left over, standing in the car, and you know, the train was gone.</span> <span id="s1453">So, of course the – there was no time for washing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: So what about when you got to where – to the first place, the kolkhoz.</span> <span id="s1455">Was there – was there – what were the hygienic facilities like there?</span> <span id="s1456">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: There – there – there – there usually was always a banyo(ph) what they called, or bath, probably bath, you know, where you could take the shower.</span> <span id="s1458">But taking showers wasn’t a weekly occurrence, you know, because they would be closed, and – or – or you were working, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1459">So you – you just had to wash in a little bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: A basin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Yeah, and that’s the way it was, so basically the – the – we – we started being civilized when we ended up in – in Baclevy(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: We were cleaned up, issued new clothing, and we spend there, I think about two weeks.</span> <span id="s1464">And then we were taken by – and my doggie, by the way, was with us all the time.</span> <span id="s1465">Tito was there.</span> <span id="s1466">And so, in about two weeks, we were loading – loaded on a – on a trucks that were driven by the Iranians, and we were taken by these trucks, on a terrible road which was climbing all the – all over the mountains, across the mountains, and in – into the Teheran, which is located on – on the plains, on the – on the south side of the – of the range of mountains.</span> <span id="s1467">And at that time, they were already forming camps.</span> <span id="s1468">And like in Teheran there were three civilian camps, and a military camp.</span> <span id="s1469">So we were in camp number two, and we stayed there for about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Well, that’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Right, and by – my mother then found a job again as a – as part of a – of a quartermaster of the – of the camp.</span> <span id="s1472">So she was working in the camp, and right away they reinstituted the schooling system.</span> <span id="s1473">And the – the camp in which we were was actually an unfinished factory, tha – with number of buildings that were built by the Germans, because Germans had the very good relationship with the Iranians before the war.</span> <span id="s1474">And when the war broke out, th-the Russians, the British and the Americans oc-occupied the country.</span> <span id="s1475">Maybe it – it’s strong wor-word to use, but they moved their military forces –</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Into Iran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: – into Iran to protect the – the oil fields, because they didn’t want to give to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1478">So, at that time, you know, we – all these three militaries were present in – in Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: What about – I mean, how much interaction did – did you and your mother have with any of the British authorities?</span> <span id="s1480">Was there any interaction?</span> <span id="s1481">Did they appear in your lives at all, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: No, th-there were – they – they had administration of the camp, was given to the Polish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: – administration.</span> <span id="s1485">So the British were just on the outside, you know, and we did not have anything to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: So, the hu – the people who were in the camp –when you say you were there two years, your – you’re a child.</span> <span id="s1487">In 1942 you’re 11 years old, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: And you stay there until you’re 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1490">Now – approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Appr – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: What happened to – on that boat coming over, there must have been fighting age young men.</span> <span id="s1493">I mean, the whole purpose of releasing people from – from the Soviet Union, was to be able to form these military units.</span> <span id="s1494">What happened to them, where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: All – all – all the young men that – that were in the – in the military age, they were taken into the army, or the – they volunteered for the army.</span> <span id="s1496">And they were moved to Iraq.</span> <span id="s1497">So the Polish military training bases were formed in Iraq.</span> <span id="s1498">And not only that, but they were also used to protect the airf – th-the oil fields in Iraq.</span> <span id="s1499">So they – they were there until 1943, I think.</span> <span id="s1500">And then they w – they were moved to Egypt, and from Egypt were the second front bes – being opened in Italy, was being invaded by the allied forces.</span> <span id="s1501">They participated in – in that campaign.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: So who – when you were in this camp in Teheran for those two years, who were the other people in the camp with you?</span> <span id="s1503">What kind of people were they?</span> <span id="s1504">Children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: No, there were a lot of children, and of course, as I said before, there were a lot of orphans, an-and this – this – th-the – the camps in – in Teheran were transitory camps.</span> <span id="s1506">So the people from there were being transported everywhere: to – to Africa, to India, to Mexico.</span> <span id="s1507">So there were – as the people were coming in, so were people were leaving all the time, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: So if you were a child, or you were just, you know, a – a young family, I would take it they were not military people, cause the military guys, I mean, the young men were in different places –</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: – they were somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1512">They – so they all – this – so camp number – camp number one was the mili – no, camp number four was the military camp.</span> <span id="s1513">But it was very small camp, because this was also a transitory camp.</span> <span id="s1514">And so wi – whoe – whatever unit came in from – from the Soviet Union, they were just processed and moved to where the training actually had to start, because they had to retrain.</span> <span id="s1515">Many of them were young, and th-they didn’t have any service.</span> <span id="s1516">So they were do –</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: So they were doing what your father would have been training them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: – in – back in Dolina(ph), right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1521">Except now they are – they are not 14 - 17, they were – they were, you know, ready to go into the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: And so these units were trained until 1943, I think, where they were then made ready for – for military service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Were there any transports that came after you, from the Soviet Union that is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Oh yes, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: – their ka – they kept coming, and so my mother would – would receive those then, and put them in the different places where they had – they – not all of them could live in those buildings, and so there were also tents, that the British had given us.</span> <span id="s1528">And so there were – there – there was a kitchen and, you know, the – everybody was being fed from the – the kitchen, and there were the facilities.</span> <span id="s1529">American gifts were coming, because at the time a lot of people were donating things.</span> <span id="s1530">So our clothing was – was American clothing, because that’s what we have gotten from – from them.</span> <span id="s1531">And as I mentioned to – then we started school.</span> <span id="s1532">And there were – there were no books, so every had – everything had to be written.</span> <span id="s1533">You had to remember from what – what the teacher was telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Because we had no books.</span> <span id="s1536">But – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Did you show your certificate from the first grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: No.</span> <span id="s1539">But they also formed scouting organizations in the – and I jon – joined the scouting.</span> <span id="s1540">And, so actually, normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: I mean, from your description of it, my impression is that it sounds to me, if you take away all of the uncertainty of life, and knowing that this is transitory, and that it will end – it also sounds like a wonderful place to not be alone, that there will be people there, that you – you can talk to them, that you could meet other kids, that you could make friends, that – you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Oh yes, you know, yes.</span> <span id="s1543">And – and on – in so – but we had, you know, we – of course we’re free to go, so we could go to town.</span> <span id="s1544">And since my mother started working we had some, you know, some of money, and we were able to go to town.</span> <span id="s1545">And the – the Persians, who are very friendly – nothing like happens right now – and so we – we really started living a normal life.</span> <span id="s1546">We went to movies, American movies that were being played at – at that time.</span> <span id="s1547">And it lasted until about 1943, something like that, and then they started liquidating the camps because all the people were moved away to different – different locations.</span> <span id="s1548">And my mother then received a – a proposal to go into town and work for the Polish unit that was taking care of the – of the refugees and things.</span> <span id="s1549">And so we moved into the city of Teheran.</span> <span id="s1550">We rented actually, an apartment – a – a room in the – in a – in Teheran itself, and my mother was working and I started to go – and I was going to school, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Still a Polish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: – to a Polish school.</span> <span id="s1553">And we lived not too far away from another friend of ours that is right now in San Francisco, and we had great time, because – because we were – the – the camp in which actually the sc – because the – they kept liquidating the schools, and finally ne – and – and that was camp number three.</span> <span id="s1554">And that was located in the mountains, very beautiful area.</span> <span id="s1555">And we’d have a bus that would take us there, and in the evening we would be driven back again.</span> <span id="s1556">And so I went through – through the grade school, and in – in 1945, when we moved to i – to Lebanon, I was already in first grade of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: As 13 -14 – well, right on –</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Yeah, 13 - 14 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: – right on schedule.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1563">Right on schedule, I was 14.</span> <span id="s1564">And so I remember that, you know, we had – we had great time, because several of us lived in – in a city by then, and we c – could get together, go to the movies, and – and you know, and visit the bazaars, and – and really had great time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: It sounds like exotic, and adventurous, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: Absolutely, yeah, show my – my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1567">But absolutely adventurous, because we were – we were taken one time to visit the Shah’s palace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: And I also remember that we were returning one time, and I don’t know what – how – how was it, but we decided to walk.</span> <span id="s1570">It wasn’t that far away, so we were walking on – on the road towards Teheran, and here comes the Shah.</span> <span id="s1571">So we waved, you know, and all that stuff, and he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Was he in a motorcade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Yes, in – in a limousine, you know, motorcades and all that kind stuff.</span> <span id="s1574">So – and he must have realized that – who we are, because he wa – you know, waved back.</span> <span id="s1575">So, you know, he – then – then we absolutely felt like free people.</span> <span id="s1576">A-And our – our – our wrong [indecipherable] was over.</span> <span id="s1577">And so – so – you know, then, towards the end of – almost at the end of the war, in July of 1945, because everything was being liquidated and, you know, the British and the Americans were going to move out of there too, we were taken by train to Baghdad in Iraq.</span> <span id="s1578">And there we had to stay for two weeks because something happened with our visa, transitory visa through – through one of the countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: So this is from Teheran to Baghdad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: To Baghdad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: And then after that, Lebanon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: And then from – from Baghdad we went to Lebanon, and we went in – in buses, all the way to – to Beirut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: How long did that take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: A couple days.</span> <span id="s1585">It was – it was quite the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Do you remember what you saw through the buses, and what kind of landscape –</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Sand and sand and sand.</span> <span id="s1588">It was a real desert.</span> <span id="s1589">Until we came to – to – to – to Lebanon.</span> <span id="s1590">And Lebanon is – is beautiful.</span> <span id="s1591">It’s green, you know, the – the mountains are – are beautiful, and so it was completely different land – you know, landscape once we entered the territory of Lebanon.</span> <span id="s1592">So from – from bay – from Baghdad I remember that we had an opportunity to visit the – you know, the – the marketplaces, the – the – you know, and it was – it was really quite an experience, and I – I don’t know where I have it, but I bought myself a – a – a – one of these knifes, you know, that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Oh, the long knives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: – you see [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: The – the curved knives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yes, the curved knife, I still have it.</span> <span id="s1597">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Was this a – all of these journeys, from Teheran to Baghdad to now Beirut, this was all under the aegis of Polish authorities, and they in turn were under the aegis of the British authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: No, this was already beginning of the international ref-refugee organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Because that was the end of the war, and all of a sudden they had refugees all over Europe, so they formed this international refugee organization, and they took over the administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: So, once we moved to – to Beirut, and we stayed couple – couple weeks in – in a transitory camp in Beirut itself, and then we were moved to a small town called Ghazir(ph), just north of – of Beirut, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1604">And at that time we were given some substis – subsistence money so we could go on our own.</span> <span id="s1605">So we became self-sufficient, and we had to supply ourselves with food and – and – and, you know, and clothing and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: So your mother’s work stopped.</span> <span id="s1607">In other words, her work as being quartermaster stopped –</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">Q: – when – when you left Teheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: And – and in Lebanon, the – one of the – as I understand, one of the agreements with the Lebanese government was that the people that are coming in are not going to become part of the economy of the – of Lebanon.</span> <span id="s1613">But they are – they are going to be self-sufficient.</span> <span id="s1614">So – so that’s we – that’s why we are needing the subsistence, so we can live on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: Until 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Oh, you were there for five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Five years.</span> <span id="s1619">Yes, so I graduated, and I graduated from, you know Polish – Polish educational system is divided into high school, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1620">And high school lasted for years, and then [indecipherable] la-la – was the other – the other two years.</span> <span id="s1621">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: So it was a six year program.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: So it’s a six year program.</span> <span id="s1624">And this is my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Can you show that like this?</span> <span id="s1626">Okay.</span> <span id="s1627">That’s your high school graduation –</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: This is my high school graduation and it says that – the fact that I became a grown-up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1630">And that was in – I can even see the word [indecipherable] down there.</span> <span id="s1631">Something about Beirut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1633">Tha – this was – it was issued by the – by the division of – of – like – like a – like education department of the Polish [indecipherable] in Beirut, on 25th of – of April, 1950.</span> <span id="s1634">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Ten years – 10 years and 10 days after your deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1637">So I – I did get some okay thing.</span> <span id="s1638">Good – good, and some, you know, [indecipherable] what do you call this, like in high school, the – this – the – the best sta –</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Excellent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: Very good, so even from – from chemistry, technical wri – thing.</span> <span id="s1643">Geometry.</span> <span id="s1644">I had a very good [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1645">That’s what forces me to go into engineering in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: What is the application – what’s the piece of paper underneath that one?</span> <span id="s1647">What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Oh, and this is – this is the – this is when I graduated from – from four years of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Ah, so when you’re a little bit younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: And you graduated there too in – was it the same place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Also in Lebanon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Right, but it – this was – this wa – the – the – after people started leaving there, too, they started liquidating different camps, and so we had to move from Ghazir, which is in the mountains, to Zouk(ph), which was on the bay.</span> <span id="s1657">And so this is 1948, plus two years, 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: So, in – when you lived in these places, were you also in an enclosed community, or did you live in town, having your own rooms, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Oh no, we had – we – yes, we rented rooms.</span> <span id="s1660">So we were really on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Were there many Polish people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Yes, well, en-enough to – to form several schools.</span> <span id="s1663">Like there was one in – in Ghazir, there was one in Zouk and there was one in – in the mountains on the other side of Beirut.</span> <span id="s1664">And t-then they started liquidating, and everything was then put into – into Zouk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Did you also have much contact with local people?</span> <span id="s1666">Lebanese?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: Oh yeah, yes, you know, I – in a way that th-they were friendly people, and th-they were – they were really amazingly capable of learning languages, because you know, they had a long history of being traders.</span> <span id="s1668">And so this – so this became a natural with them.</span> <span id="s1669">So most of the people that had any – any shops in like – in Ghazir, they s – they spoke adequate Polish to tell you that, for example, they would c-call, pig missus, pig missus.</span> <span id="s1670">It wasn’t that the missus was a pig, but they killed the pig, and they were selling the meat.</span> <span id="s1671">So – so – but – but they were very, very nice, very polite, and a friend of mine who lives in Australia was telling me years later that she moved to Australia and – and she met a – an Arab from – from Ghazir.</span> <span id="s1672">And so she – the – he emigrated after her, and they got married in – in Australia.</span> <span id="s1673">And then years later, in – in 1980s or something like that, the three sisters that – that lived there decided to make a round world trip.</span> <span id="s1674">And they went from – they went from Australia, first stop was Lebanon.</span> <span id="s1675">And they were walking on the streets of this town of Ghazir and an Arab comes to them, and of course they la – they look different.</span> <span id="s1676">And so the – he says, what are you ladies doing in here?</span> <span id="s1677">And my friend says, well, I’m the wife of, you know, this – this [indecipherable] you know, we are Polish, we lived here.</span> <span id="s1678">Oh, you are Polish.</span> <span id="s1679">So you – stands at attention, and starts singing Polish national anthem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: Oh good God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: He remembered, all these years.</span> <span id="s1682">So they are – they’re really fantastic people.</span> <span id="s1683">And – you know, and we never, never had anything that we would be afraid of.</span> <span id="s1684">We lived among them, being scout, we – we went on – on the trips, you know, just walking trips around Lebanon, and we never had any problem at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Did you ever pick up the local language?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: Some.</span> <span id="s1687">Yo-You know enough to kind of get – get along it, and – but of course, over the years of not using it, it – it – it just disappears.</span> <span id="s1688">I just remember Leban – Lebanese national anthem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: You remember – so if you were to walk around, you’d be able to sing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: But – but you know, it – they were really very friendly people and they were – after the first World War they were under what they called French protectorate.</span> <span id="s1691">So all – almost everyone spoke French.</span> <span id="s1692">There was also American university in – in – in pa – in – in – in Beirut, and some of our older members of the school went to study in there, and – but then, you know, towards the – the 1950 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: What did your mother do for the five years?</span> <span id="s1694">How did she support herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Well, she was – she – you know, we were – we were given the money, but she started working for, you know, with the school, doing all kinds of things, being able to paint, you know, she would – she would take care, and she was really taking care of like a – like a club for children, and they were dancing, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1696">So she was busy all the time.</span> <span id="s1697">You know, she – she had things to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: Did you ever see her, in all of those years, those 10 years, did you ever see her despair?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: No.</span> <span id="s1700">I think after you go through something like that, you could have done all the desperation in two years.</span> <span id="s1701">The rest of it was a wonderful life, basically.</span> <span id="s1702">You know, of course you didn’t know anything about your husband, you were lonely, no family, and – but there are people like you that became, you know, part of your circle.</span> <span id="s1703">And so she never despaired, and – and I think she – she was – she was too busy to – to think.</span> <span id="s1704">And then besides, she could – she could, you know, embroider, so she would embroider.</span> <span id="s1705">She wrote poems, which – which I have, you know.</span> <span id="s1706">And so she was quite a positive type of person.</span> <span id="s1707">So – so anyway, so after – after all this was done and – and told her that – that they were trying to relocate the people as soon as possible so they can start normal life, because this was not a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: So finally in – in a – in 1950, towards the – the end of 1950, in July in fact, Her Majesty the queen decided to accept us as – as being capable of going to the territory of the – of Great Britain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Had you been trying for a long time?</span> <span id="s1711">Had your mother been trying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: No, no, this was all done between the Polish government and the British.</span> <span id="s1713">They – they realized that they have to remove those people from Lebanon because they had – they had an agreement that they won’t work.</span> <span id="s1714">So what do you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Well that can’t happen forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: No, that can’t happen forever.</span> <span id="s1717">So they decided that the best way is to simply bring them to – to real life.</span> <span id="s1718">Really real life, not what we have for life for the last number of years.</span> <span id="s1719">So, we were load – loaded on the shi – on the military ship.</span> <span id="s1720">And you know, on a transport ship in Beirut, and moved across the Mediterranean Sea and up north to – to Great Britain, and we were unloaded with – in the – the port of Hull, h-u-l-l, and then transported to a military camp, a post-military camp in northern England, on the border with Scotland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Oh, I’ve been to Hull.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: The so-called – so-called [indecipherable] district</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Oh yeah, it’s a very pretty district.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Very pretty district.</span> <span id="s1725">We were within walking distance from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1727">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: So it was – it was really something, and there was nothing to do there, you know, I could dig ditches.</span> <span id="s1729">And I was not about to dig ditches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: Well, by now you’re a young man, you’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">A: Right, I was – I was – you know.</span> <span id="s1732">And so my mother called Rilka(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: – in London, and she said, yes, of course he can come to – to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: I’ll take him to see Errol – Errol Flynn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1737">No, that was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Oh, that was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: That was later.</span> <span id="s1740">So – so I moved to London, my mother stayed in the camp, and I started looking for a job.</span> <span id="s1741">And there was a – the Polish [indecipherable] units formed a – like a – like a organization, and one of those things that they were doing was – was employment.</span> <span id="s1742">And so I went to their employment office and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Did you speak any English at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1745">Oh, by the way, I – I – we did learn English in Lebanon.</span> <span id="s1746">We had the Lebanese professor who was teaching us.</span> <span id="s1747">So I-I – I cannot say I was fluent, but I was capable of communicating quite well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: – in – in English.</span> <span id="s1750">Not with a British accent, of course, but – but nevertheless, enough to be able to move about England with no problem.</span> <span id="s1751">And so, when I moved to London, I was with Rilka(ph) for a little while, and then she arranged for me to go to a youth hostel, and I was working in a youth hostel.</span> <span id="s1752">So I started looking for job and – and the – the guy said, well, there’s something that you can – you can do, there is some factory that you can go in.</span> <span id="s1753">So I went for an interview and the gentleman that was interviewing me, he said, what do you want to do in life?</span> <span id="s1754">And I said, what – I would like to be an engineer.</span> <span id="s1755">And he says, oh, I’m sorry, I’m looking for a worker, not for an engineer.</span> <span id="s1756">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: So it sounds like it was a trick question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: I suppose.</span> <span id="s1759">But – so I was – I was – I had to go back, and they said, you know, there is – there is a – an office of a – of a – a Polish American, who was born in – in United States, but was educated in Poland.</span> <span id="s1760">He became an engineer, and he worked in the Polish corps of engineer in – when – during the campaign in – in Italy, and there he met a British engineer who was working for the British corps of engineers, and they formed fre – friendship, and they decided that they liked each other so much that ti – after – after the war, they opened an office.</span> <span id="s1761">And that office was to convert many of the residences of London into flats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: So they were doing this kind of work, and when I – when I went for an interview, the gentleman said yes – and because I – and when I graduated from high school, there was an Polish engineer who taught the boys the drafting.</span> <span id="s1764">So I knew about eng-engineering drawings, I knew about drafting, I know about, you know, things.</span> <span id="s1765">And so he gave me the opportunity to work for them, as my first engineering job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Oh, how wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: And it was really fantastic, because, you know – but my mother told me in the beginning of my career that, just remember to – when you work for someone, take a letter of recommendation from the person.</span> <span id="s1768">And so they – so I – when I was in London mat – from – I think from September or something like that, and we left for the United States in the beginning of February –</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: – of 1951.</span> <span id="s1771">So we were in England only several months.</span> <span id="s1772">And what happened is that my mother had ta – three uncles.</span> <span id="s1773">My – my grandmother came from a family of 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: See, I hadn't that far – back enough, when I was asking you about your parents, your grandparents and so on, I didn’t ask how many children were in those families, or that generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Well, that’s – that’s my – my grandmother had – had 11 siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: And – and three of those siblings, all boys, escaped to the United States in – before the beginning of the second war – or the first World War.</span> <span id="s1778">Because, when you are drafted into the Russian army, your career lasted 25 years, so all your life, basically.</span> <span id="s1779">And so they didn’t want to – to do that, and these – they – they came to the United States, and one of them settled in Baltimore, and the other one settled in – in Ohio, and the third one somewhere in Ohio also.</span> <span id="s1780">And when we – when we left Russia, my mother somehow reestablished contact with him, and – Uncle Miczesław(ph) and he asked her, couple years later, if we would be wanting maybe to emigrate to the United States, and my mother said yes.</span> <span id="s1781">But in those days, they – they had the visa – no-not the visa, but they had like every nationality had a number of places assigned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: A quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: A quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: And so she – the Polish quota was always, you know, taken up.</span> <span id="s1786">So we just simply waiting all this period, from, you know, we – we started doing this in Teheran, and he had to write the affidavits and all that kind of stuff –</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: That’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: That’s like six or seven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Yes, and it still would have taken longer time, but the American government had passed a special law that permitted 18,000 military families to come to the United States for set –</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Polish military families.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Right, from – from the second Polish corps, to – to [indecipherable] units to – to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s1793">And si – again, since my father was counted as a military, we were given the opportunity –</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Excuse me to interrupting here, but you – I – I take it that your mother didn’t have many documents with her.</span> <span id="s1795">Did she have a document that said that her – that your father was in the military, or were there other ways they could substantiate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">A: No, she – there was – there was something that yes, she – she had the substantiation.</span> <span id="s1797">Cause we – we do have some documents of – of my father, and I – see the – here’s the – the – the certificate, he graduated from the – from the officers’ school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: If you could hold that up just a little bit like that.</span> <span id="s1799">Can you zero in on it?</span> <span id="s1800">Yeah, got it?</span> <span id="s1801">Okay.</span> <span id="s1802">Okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: You know, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: So she had documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: So, she had the documentation and you know, several other things that – that she had, you know, so she could prove that my father was – was in the military.</span> <span id="s1806">And so we were – we were granted the visa, as part of the 18,000 permissions.</span> <span id="s1807">And so on – on February – beginning of February, we were loaded onto one of Her Majesty’s ships, and shipped from Liverpool to London – to – to New York.</span> <span id="s1808">So the trip lasted, I think about 14 days or something like that.</span> <span id="s1809">So we arrived in New York on February 14th –</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Nineteen –</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: – Valentine’s Day, and everybody was, you know, saying, oh, Happy Valentine, and we didn’t know what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: What it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: So it was.</span> <span id="s1814">But we learned.</span> <span id="s1815">And my – my – my mother’s uncle’s wife had family in – in New York.</span> <span id="s1816">So they came out to take us from the ship.</span> <span id="s1817">And I still have a business card of the cousin, that he showed them to – so he took us – he took us to his home, and we stayed in New York for several days.</span> <span id="s1818">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">Q: Do you remember – do you remember any first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">A: Yeah, I remember Statue of Liberty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: You do?</span> <span id="s1822">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1823">So you went through Ellis Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: No, we didn’t, we – I don’t know why, maybe because we came from England or something, but we were – the re – released directly into his care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: And so he took us from the – from the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Pier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: – pier, he took us to – to his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: And permitted us to kind of release a little bit after the – after the trip.</span> <span id="s1833">And then loaded us on the – on the train and shipped us to Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: To Ohio, so you didn’t even go to Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: No.</span> <span id="s1836">No, we went directly to Ohio, and my uncle picked us up at the train station in – across the border for – in – in Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">A: In Pittsburgh, and then he took us bri – by car to his house, and we st – we were staying with them.</span> <span id="s1839">Unfortunately, the first experience was not the most satisfactory, because after about four months – and I started working in – in ice cream factory, I was making the Popsicles.</span> <span id="s1840">But this was my – my first job.</span> <span id="s1841">And after about four months, my uncle called my mother and he says, you know, my wife, your aunt, and you just don’t seem to be getting too well together.</span> <span id="s1842">So, he says, you know, you – you have to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Oh dear.</span> <span id="s1844">Oh dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: So, we started looking for a place, you know, since I was already employed.</span> <span id="s1846">We started looking for a place, but then my mother decided to call the uncle that lives in – lived in Baltimore, and maybe they could just take us for, you know [indecipherable] four months, you know, just a new country, everything – so wi – the cousin came in and she looked us over, and she decided we’re okay, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: That must have been hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: That must have been hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Well, ya – hey, once you go through –</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Go through Siberia, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: – hell, it’s – nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s1854">Okay, fine, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: And so, w-we moved to Baltimore, and we stayed with them, I think about a month maybe, maybe less.</span> <span id="s1856">And my – my cousin says, you know, I – I don’t know what to do with you, you know, wh-what am I do – we don’t even know how to help you completely two different worlds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1859">And so she says, but you know, but there is – there is a Polish priest that went through German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1860">He is working in the parish right here.</span> <span id="s1861">Maybe we take you there, and maybe you can – maybe you can find a better communication with him, maybe he can help you better than – than I.</span> <span id="s1862">So she took us – she took me there, and we – I met the priest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Do you remember whos – what his name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: I have it written down somewhere, but I – I didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A2: Fillipovich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Oh, Father Fillipovich(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A2: Father Fillipovich(ph).</span> <span id="s1868">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Fillipovich(ph).</span> <span id="s1870">He was – he was really – you know, he went through different kind of [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: And so he understood.</span> <span id="s1873">And he said, you know, since you were working as a draftsman, we are – we are running a – a bazaar here, you know, and there is a gentleman that – that works for Bethlehem Steel Corporation.</span> <span id="s1874">Maybe he can help you.</span> <span id="s1875">So the next day I – I came in and he to – introduced me to the guy, and the guy says well – he was – he was Polish, second generation, I think, but he spoke Polish and he says well, let me see if there is something I can do.</span> <span id="s1876">And so he gave me the address.</span> <span id="s1877">The next day I went by train or something to what they call the Sparrows Point.</span> <span id="s1878">Sparrows Point was where they had the shipyards, and – and the – the – you know, regular steel company thing.</span> <span id="s1879">And so I – I – I talked to the – to the gentleman that was in charge of engineering office.</span> <span id="s1880">I showed him my document from – from England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Your letter of recommendation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: My letter of recommendation.</span> <span id="s1883">And the next day they – the fellow says, you know, you can – you can come and start working.</span> <span id="s1884">So – so within couple days I – I was already employed [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: What a relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: – in what I wanted to do, you know, so it just fantastic.</span> <span id="s1887">And when I – when I came back, my aunt says, your mother isn’t here any more.</span> <span id="s1888">She rented an apartment and she – she’s waiting for you with – with supper, so you better go over there.</span> <span id="s1889">So I – from that point on we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: On your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: – on – independent, on our own.</span> <span id="s1892">Which was, of course, the best thing that could happen to anyone.</span> <span id="s1893">We – we kept a very good relationship with – with – with the uncle.</span> <span id="s1894">And so I still maintain a relationship with – with his grandchildren, you know, talk to each other and things.</span> <span id="s1895">And I – and I started working at Sparrows Point of the Bethlehe-Bethlehem Steel Corporation.</span> <span id="s1896">And had a fantastic experience, because you know, it’s something that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: It’s what you wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: – some – wanted to do, I wanted to do the engineering.</span> <span id="s1899">And so, soon as possible, I – I signed up for the civil engineering studies, the evening of course, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1900">So I’d work, come back from work, go to school.</span> <span id="s1901">And I completed quite a number of courses, and then in 19 – middle – towards the end of 1954, I got the papers from U.S. military that I’m being drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Were you a citizen yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: That’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: So, I was finally drafted in the beginning of 1955, and after – after the basic training of eight weeks, our regiment was shipped to Germany.</span> <span id="s1908">Because at that time, the regiment that was there – and it was – they had the – the duties of – of – of – of watching the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: East-west border?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: East-west border, yes.</span> <span id="s1911">And that regiment stayed there as – as – regiment as a, you know, unit, all the time from the be – the end of the war until 1955, beginning.</span> <span id="s1912">And then they decided to exchange the units, move second regiment back to sh – to – to the United States, and us, as a whole regiment, ship over there.</span> <span id="s1913">So we were shipped as a regiment to Germany.</span> <span id="s1914">And since I got the job as a – as a regimental draftsman, of course, I was in a headquarters of the regiment in – in Nuremberg, whereas the – the battalions were sh – were s-stationed around the border.</span> <span id="s1915">So it was – it was interesting because it was different kinds of draftsmanship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: What were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Doing military plans when they they were doing their, you know, their exercises, I had to – to – to document where they’re going to be, and what time, and what units and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1918">It got to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1919">So I worked – I was working there.</span> <span id="s1920">And I remember one – one time, the sergeant of – of the S-2 section, which is the intelligence section, comes to – to – to the room that I was occupying, and he looks at me, and he looks at – at the – the plans that I am working on, and he says, are you a U.S. citizen?</span> <span id="s1921">And I said no.</span> <span id="s1922">So he said, oh my God.</span> <span id="s1923">He runs to the colonel, tells him the story, and the colonel does whatever necessary, and within two weeks, I was shipped to Frankfurt, Germany, where the American consulate was, with two sergeants that swore that they knew me since.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: And they had never seen you before, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: No.</span> <span id="s1926">And I was given the U.S. citizenship.</span> <span id="s1927">So – so – so when I came back from the army, I was, you know, I was already –</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: A U.S. citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: – a registered citizen.</span> <span id="s1930">And – and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime later the same sergeant comes in and he says, do you speak a little Russian?</span> <span id="s1931">And I said yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1932">And he says, oh, would you like to go to a refresher course in Russia?</span> <span id="s1933">And I say yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1934">So I was shipped, for three weeks of Russian refresher course, in Oberammergau, Germany, and you probably know Oberammergau is a place where every 10 years they give the – the Easter thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: The Passion Play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Passion Play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: And it is a beautiful, beautiful town where everybody there is a sculptor.</span> <span id="s1939">They sculpt, you know, in wood.</span> <span id="s1940">So I spent three weeks with – with the military intelligence refresher course.</span> <span id="s1941">And it was amazing experience for me because the – the people that were with me, they were from – you know, from private through major.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: And all of them went through the army school of languages, and they want – an-and you know all these people were going – if necessary were going to be used as interrogators of the prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1944">So their basic Russian was based on the military requirements, you know, in other words, what – what do you ask, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: – and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1947">So they – they had to maintain their skill.</span> <span id="s1948">So they were there and the first few days, you know, they were way ahead of me.</span> <span id="s1949">And then, all of a sudden, s-s-started clicking, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Your first grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: My first grade started clicking back.</span> <span id="s1952">And by the time we were e – we were finished, I was way ahead of them, because my pronunciation was [indecipherable] better than th-theirs.</span> <span id="s1953">And – and you know, I had the opportunity to – to visit that wonderful place, and I – since they were doing all these kind of things that my mother always told – told me that, you have to have, in your house, you have to have a picture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: And so I had that remembrance, so I went to one of the sculptors, and I said, did you ever make the sculpture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus?</span> <span id="s1956">And he says, no, but that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1957">He says, come, come, come, come.</span> <span id="s1958">So he took me to his – to his workplace, and he starts pulling out the books, trying to figure out, you know.</span> <span id="s1959">And he finds a – a picture of lady – Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus.</span> <span id="s1960">And he says, you know, I’ll – I’ll – I’ll put you on rock – o-on the rock and – and [indecipherable] this, and she’s going to be feeding baby Jesus.</span> <span id="s1961">Is that – is that what you want?</span> <span id="s1962">Excuse me, ca-can you sneak out and go and get that sculpture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: Can you cut the panel, please?</span> <span id="s1964">[break] And so, what’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: So this is the – this is the sculpture that he made.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s1967">Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: And – and th-there are only two of those like that.</span> <span id="s1969">One painted, and the other one just as in wood.</span> <span id="s1970">And he sent me both, to – to the – to – to Nuremberg, and he says, which one do you want?</span> <span id="s1971">And I bought both, and the other one I send to my cousin in Poland.</span> <span id="s1972">So they have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: But – but all – you know, the only thing that he showed me was this po – upper part.</span> <span id="s1975">And the rest of it, with her putting her li –</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: [indecipherable] on doing – and doing, that was all she – all his interpretation.</span> <span id="s1978">And so, this is what – what I remember from Oberammergau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: From Oberammergau.</span> <span id="s1980">Well, thank you for sharing that.</span> <span id="s1981">That – did you explain to the people where you were taking the Russian refresher course that – how you came to know Russian to begin with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1983">But, you know, that – basically, you know, I – I found out that most Americans are not interested in that, because it’s – it’s so far away from their background, from their pe – that you s-simply do not understand, that how in the heck – excuse me – my English – you can come to somebody’s home at two o’clock in the morning and take him away, and leave everything – you know, you leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s1984">It was just in – incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s1985">And so there – they were not interested.</span> <span id="s1986">And so therefore, you know, I just kept it to myself, and I don’t have anything against it, because it is so different.</span> <span id="s1987">You know, how do you explain to – to people that never experienced any kind of a – of [indecipherable] with authorities, that somebody can come to your house at two o’clock in the morning and take you away, leave all your things behind, and, you know.</span> <span id="s1988">But – but I explained to – to this – to these guys, and they accepted what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: Was there a reason why they would have wanted you to take this Russian refresher course?</span> <span id="s1990">Did they have anything in mind for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Well, because I was wer – working for the regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">A: And the regiment was on the border, so they needed people that were familiar with the language, just in case –</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: – if some – something should happen, each unit had a translator that could interrogate the people.</span> <span id="s1996">And here’s a guy that not only that experienced being there –</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: – and knowing the people.</span> <span id="s1999">And so I was very grateful.</span> <span id="s2000">But then I suffered some – somehow, later on, because whenever we would go to Canada, and I take my citizenship papers with me, I was always stopped on the border, and I – and there was also a telephone call made to Washington, because my – my paper, my – my citizenship paper is not the normal thing.</span> <span id="s2001">It does not have my photograph, it does not have sig – signature of – of – of a judge.</span> <span id="s2002">It has a signature of Consul General of the United States and Frankfurt, Germany, and it just doesn’t sound normal.</span> <span id="s2003">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2005">It wasn’t what they were used to seeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: So it was – it was always checked, and finally I decided, what am I doing, why don’t I just get a passport and be done with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: And you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: And I did and ever since then I was – it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: So, you know, a-all these experiences add up to – to a – I would say a rather interesting life, if you want to call it that way.</span> <span id="s2011">And then, when I was drafted into the army, I decided to move my mother to Chicago, because here we – we have many more friends and people that we – acquaintances that we had from the past.</span> <span id="s2012">And so I moved her, and then I went back and was drafted.</span> <span id="s2013">And when I was released I came back, and I restarted my studies at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I started working as a draftsman for engineering firms.</span> <span id="s2014">And my first firm of employment was a fi – was a firm of – in – in which our chief engineer was Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s2015">And most of the draftsmen were lith – were Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s2016">So, that was my – my beginning of a career in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Well, did they ever – did they ever discuss the [indecipherable] with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: The treaty of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: No, no, and interesting thing is that – that once the Polish army had left Soviet Union, the Soviet Union formed another army, which was the – an – a new government –</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: – of Lublin, and a new army.</span> <span id="s2023">And that army fought with the Soviet Union, and a – you know, participated in the liberation of Poland.</span> <span id="s2024">And of course, the Anders’ Army was a traitor.</span> <span id="s2025">So – but it was – it was, you know, an interesting experience, because I already had something to show.</span> <span id="s2026">That not only that I did get the document from – from the army that I worked as a draftsman, so – and when I – when I came to the – to – to Chicago, I started working for several firms, and the wa – and again for U.S. Steel Corporation, because th – I was already with experience from – from –</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: From Baltimore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: – from Baltimore, from Bethlehem Steel.</span> <span id="s2029">And I worked in different engineering firms until 1978.</span> <span id="s2030">And in ’78, I – I read an advertisement in a civil engineering magazine, a re – and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had been looking for personnel.</span> <span id="s2031">And so I went for an interview, and because my background was civil engineering, and it was also in – in – in dams, because the last firm that I was working for was a firm of Dr. Bauer(ph), who had, you know, his doctorate in hydraulics, and so I worked on – on things.</span> <span id="s2032">And so I was accepted.</span> <span id="s2033">And so in 1978 until 2008, for 30 years, I worked for U.S. un-unit.</span> <span id="s2034">And that was really fantastic experience, too, because we – there were five offices like that, and Chicago office had the Middle East – the mi – mi – middle west.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: Midwest, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: And so we had, you know, a number of dams.</span> <span id="s2037">And so, all these thir – 30 years that I worked, I haven’t visited all the – all the dams.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: So there’s – there’s quite a number, and people always say what?</span> <span id="s2040">Tell me?</span> <span id="s2041">You know, but there are hundreds of dams that are run not only by the Corps of Engineers, but also by private industry, where they have, you know, hydraulic facilities.</span> <span id="s2042">And because they – they are using the waters of the United States, they are obligated to take a license and to fulfill the requirements, and we would go and visit and see if everything is okay, and if not, we would write down what we find that is – needs to be repaired, and they were obligated to do that.</span> <span id="s2043">So, it was – it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Sounds like an interesting – interesting job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Oh – oh, it was – it was very interesting, and you never get tired, because you know, a dam is a dam and a – a – and a plant is a plant.</span> <span id="s2046">No, it’s not.</span> <span id="s2047">Each one is different, each one has separate problems, or arrangements or whatever.</span> <span id="s2048">And – and you know – and to – y-you – like if you going to a different – different – different thing to do every time you go, cause it’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Did you think much about those two years of deportation throughout your life, or do you kind of push it to the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: I try to push it to the past, because I don’t think that – well, it’s not my nature, you know.</span> <span id="s2051">And – and besides, I’ve read so many times when people are reliving their – their past, and especially if the past is not a pleasant one, you are unhappy.</span> <span id="s2052">You are – you are always under this – this influence of this – these horrible years, when you starved to death, when you were beating 200, you know, lice a day.</span> <span id="s2053">When your mother almost died, you know, and where you were just by a – by a miracle, taken away from there.</span> <span id="s2054">Because you know, I do not consider it any different but just miracle, that we just happened to be in the right place, at the right time, so that we could leave that, you know, wonderful life of the Soviet Union, you know.</span> <span id="s2055">And so I – I don’t want to think about it.</span> <span id="s2056">I know I had that experience, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Did you ever wonder why you – why you were able to leave, and others didn’t, couldn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: I asked, but I didn’t get a answer, you know, and – and – but I pray daily, thank Him for that – for that opportunity to be able to leave.</span> <span id="s2059">Because I know that we would not have survived the next winter, you know.</span> <span id="s2060">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: You were too weak.</span> <span id="s2062">Your mother was too –</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: My mother and I. And if we were, the next winter and the next winter and the next winter would have been the same, you know.</span> <span id="s2064">So – and it took the re-remaining of those people that were deported, those that survived, they didn’t have an opportunity to return po – to Poland until 1953.</span> <span id="s2065">And we left 1942.</span> <span id="s2066">So that’s 11 more years of that kind of living, whereas I was saved that/</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: And just to – so that people will understand, can you explain why they would have been able to leave in 1953?</span> <span id="s2068">What event allowed that to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Uncle Stalin died.</span> <span id="s2070">And so –</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: And that meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: – the changes begin – began to – to occur in the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: And at that time apparently, the Polish government in Poland –</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: The communist government.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: – would have been able to – to obtain release for those people.</span> <span id="s2077">And so th-the remnants of those deported – and people are not only deported in – in – when I was deported, there were hundreds of them, thousands of them were also deported, you know, as the Russians moved in the – in the push on Germany.</span> <span id="s2078">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: You mean on the attack on Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: When they attacked the Germany, and then – and then they occupied the Polish territory, all the people from the underground forces, all the politicians, whoever they could put their hands on, were deported again, so that that was in 19 – you know, ’43, ’44, ’45, and later.</span> <span id="s2081">And only after the – the final – you know, when – when – when Stalin died, and changes started to occur, they could manage to release those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Tell us a little bit about your own life, did you get married?</span> <span id="s2083">Did you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Yes, when – when I came back from the army, we started, you know, going back into the Polish neighborhoods and things, and I went to a – to a Christmas party of the Polish scouting orani – organization.</span> <span id="s2085">And I run into a very beautiful woman, and so we start going together, and turns out that she – she lived not too far away from where I was, and so it was – it was beginning of 1957 actually.</span> <span id="s2086">And it took her two years to decide that yes, she wants to marry me.</span> <span id="s2087">Oh, look at the faces she’s making.</span> <span id="s2088">So we – we were married in July of 1959, and in 1961 we moved to this place here in chi – in Arlington Heights.</span> <span id="s2089">And we’re probably one of the very few Poles that live here, because there’s still – Polonia was still located in the – in the city of Chicago.</span> <span id="s2090">And then my – my daughter was born in 1966.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Her name is Beatta(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Beatta(ph), mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: And she attended school here in – in Arlington Heights, Ca-Catholic school.</span> <span id="s2095">And then she wanted to go to – to Saint inga – Ignatius College Prep in downtown, and I was kind of just wondering whether, you know, for her to travel all that, and then she managed to talk to one of the boys that was going to school, and he – he talked to me one time and he says, Mr. Pawlikowski, you are going to commit a grave mistake if you don’t let your daughter go.</span> <span id="s2096">So, what could I do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: And – and she went to school and that – it’s a very good school.</span> <span id="s2099">And she [indecipherable] she studied Latin, she studied Greek, and she met her husband.</span> <span id="s2100">And so, you know, they – and they were married, and now we are happy grandparents of a six year old, Kinga(ph), Kinga(ph) Alexandra.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Kinga(ph) Alexandra.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: A tri-lingual little character.</span> <span id="s2103">She speaks Polish very fluently, she speaks Lithuanian [indecipherable] and now she speaks people’s language.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Which –</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: She speaks the language of the people that walk on the street, which is English.</span> <span id="s2106">So, now we can con – we can conduct conversations in two languages, that is we and – and she, and another two languages with the Lithuanian grandparents.</span> <span id="s2107">So, she’s quite a character.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Have you been back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">A: We went back to Poland first time in 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: With your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: No, my mother went in 1958.</span> <span id="s2112">Her mother still lived at that time.</span> <span id="s2113">And so she spent about three months in – in Poland, and was – she still went by ship, [indecipherable] from – from Canada.</span> <span id="s2114">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Did you ever go back to Dordinna(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: To what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: To Dordinna(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: No, because it was – it was the Ukraine and it – and besides, you know, I – I felt kind of – I think I’ve been there once, and that’s enough.</span> <span id="s2121">I don’t – because you never know what these people can do.</span> <span id="s2122">And you know, there still are wonderful places to visit in – in – in Russia, and – but even now, I don’t think that I would be – there are so many other places.</span> <span id="s2123">And I visited that one, one time, and it’s enough.</span> <span id="s2124">So – and I don’t – don’t expect to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: What about Lódz?</span> <span id="s2126">Did you go back to Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Oh yes, you know, ’79, and then I went back in 2000.</span> <span id="s2128">So I still have – I’ve – I have some cousins that live there and we’re in contact with one of the cousins, Wavia(ph), who came to visit us then – in 1976 she came to visit us here in United States.</span> <span id="s2129">And she was very happy, but she told us later that – she says, I don’t even understand, how do you cover these distances?</span> <span id="s2130">I mean, we get up at six o’clock in the morning, you drive til six o’clock at night, and then we drive again six o’clock in the morning, and, you know, she says, it – it just – just – how do you do that?</span> <span id="s2131">I said, well, you sit in the car, and drive, and – you know.</span> <span id="s2132">But she was very happy because we took her west, and we see the – we saw the Grand Canyon, and you know, things like that, and – in fact, I talked to her last week and I said, what – you know, as soon as you – as you retire, don’t forget that we are going to visit Hawaii, because that she want – she wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s2133">So I hope we can – we can manage to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: So you still have li – a-as you have contact with friends that you made during those years of transition in ira – Iran and Iraq and Beirut, you also still have ties with family – the family that you had left in Poland when you were such a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Well, except that now it’s – it’s the grandchildren of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: – chil – grandchildren –</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: – of the – of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: And not what – you know, i-in fact, it was kind of interesting thing because – because all of a sudden I – I – I get the telephone call from my cousin in – in – in Baltimore, and she says, you know, there’s this woman that – that wrote to me, and she says that she’s cousin of mine, you know, a-and a – and a – y-you know, but she was saying something that I don’t understand, you know.</span> <span id="s2140">Maybe you can get in touch with her.</span> <span id="s2141">So I get in touch with her, and find out that she’s the granddaughter of one of the 12 children of – of – you know, of my grandmother’s brood.</span> <span id="s2142">And so we established a relationship with – with her.</span> <span id="s2143">And we hope to visit Poland next year, and so I hope that I’m going to be able to – to meet with her, she lives in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2144">And it will be interesting, because no vos – all of a sudden, after all these years, you – you find someone –</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Find another relat – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2147">And, you know, it’s – you wish it was here that there was – so I could have larger family in here, but you are thankful that at least they’re all over the place, you know, so they could – you could – you could –</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: – keep in touch with them somehow.</span> <span id="s2150">And of course it’s different worlds, different generations, she’s much younger than I am, you know, and – but – but she was – she sounded very friendly, very wanting to establish a contact.</span> <span id="s2151">So, we hope that we can – can do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: What would you want Kinga, when she is old enough to understand, what would you want your granddaughter Kinga to understand about who you were as an eight year old boy when all of this happened, seven year old boy.</span> <span id="s2153">What would you want her to – to understand about that experience, and to take away from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">A: Well, I suppose just a human part of it, and a – and – and a – and a positive human heart – part of it, that please don’t dwell on it.</span> <span id="s2155">That it happened, and it’s gone, you live different life, and appreciate what you have, cause you never know what life brings you.</span> <span id="s2156">And I don’t – I don’t think I would like to load her and burden her with such things as – as killing 200 lice in – in a day.</span> <span id="s2157">You know, it’s – it’s just inconceivable.</span> <span id="s2158">And why – why pester the – the mind of a young person with – with something like that?</span> <span id="s2159">It – it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: But what does it tell her about you as a person, as her grandfather?</span> <span id="s2161">How does – you know, there’s – there’s something through your life experience that can tell her something about you, and what would you want her to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: About the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: That there is a greater world that one should visit.</span> <span id="s2165">About the people, that you should not be locked up, that you should be open for other people.</span> <span id="s2166">And that – and if you are open for other people, even if the – if there are people that are against you, you can brush them aside because there are other people that will be friendly towards you.</span> <span id="s2167">I think that’s important to know, because I experienced it, you know, the – the – the Cossacks, the Uzbeks, the Iranians, the Lebanese, the British, you know.</span> <span id="s2168">The-These – these are experiences, because all th-thi – all this expands your brain, and makes – makes the world smaller, and larger at the same time, and makes you appreciate different cultures without having to remember the bad things.</span> <span id="s2169">And I think that’s very important that – that you should not carry something that happened 200 or 500 years ago, and you still – you – you still kind of have some hatred tow-towards the new generation that doesn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s2170">And I – I think it’s important, because if you don’t practice that, we’ll always be at war.</span> <span id="s2171">And I think that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: And you’ve been able to bury that for yourself, whatever – whatever pain that you might have felt, it’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: It’s gone.</span> <span id="s2174">No, it – you know, of course you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">A: You remember the – the – that you were just kicked out of your own country.</span> <span id="s2177">But I don’t want to dw-dwell on it.</span> <span id="s2178">I – I – I want it to be as an experience, but not something that I experience every day.</span> <span id="s2179">I think that’s very negative, and – and – and I think it’s – that poisons your – your whole life, you know, your whole outlook at life, you know.</span> <span id="s2180">And you know, i-it’s – it’s – it’s not constructive, because you can live with – with the [indecipherable] you can live with – you know, I mean, like I told you about this story about these guys that were – for hundreds of years they are looking for someone that’s – that’s going to play the anthem for them, to – to liberate them, you know.</span> <span id="s2181">This is the positive experience, and I think these are more important than the other ones, if you have survived them, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: If you have survived them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: If you haven’t, then – then you have a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A: But – but I think – you know, I don’t – I don’t hold it anything against, say, the Russians.</span> <span id="s2186">Because they suffered more than I. I suffered for two years, they suffered for the – all their lives.</span> <span id="s2187">And – and you know, this – this – even during the tsars, there was different kind of situation, but th-they were people th-ther – that were downtrodden, and then they liberated themselves in the name of the communism – and they were downtrodden again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: And so, you know, and you – but you also have to remember – remember I told you about the story about the German officer, that you – sometimes you really wonder, how can it be that people can be so cruel?</span> <span id="s2190">A-And this – can I repeat this story?</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Yes, of course you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: And – and – and the story is, I was reading – I read in a newspape – in – in a – in a ga – in a book that – as – as – as you know, there were concentration camps that were started on the Polish territory by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2193">And most of them were to liquidate people that were undesirables, which was Poles, and the Jews, and there was – there was a story about this transport that was being taken in one of the camps, and the people were led into the camp, and there was a – a Jewish mother, and four or five year old little boy.</span> <span id="s2194">And they were walking in and – and at the gate stands the – the Gestapo officer, dressed up in beautiful uniform, with the ha – with the hat and – and the long boots, and – and – and the [indecipherable] you know, that he was kind of hitting his – his leg with it.</span> <span id="s2195">And he was – for the boy it was – it was a marvelous, wonderful figure.</span> <span id="s2196">So the boy just pulls away from his – from his mother’s hand and runs to the officer and offers him the only thing that he has in life, an apple.</span> <span id="s2197">And the officer smiles at the child, takes the apple, bends over, grabs him by the hands and – and kills him on the spot.</span> <span id="s2198">How do you explain that?</span> <span id="s2199">How do you explain the fact that pole – no, hun – thousands of Polish officers were murdered by NKVD, by killing them with a bullet in his – in the back of their head?</span> <span id="s2200">You know, it was just a very simple thing, right.</span> <span id="s2201">Next, next.</span> <span id="s2202">Then you go home, you have supper.</span> <span id="s2203">You put your child on – on your lap, tell him the story.</span> <span id="s2204">And next day you go and do the same thing.</span> <span id="s2205">Impossible to believe that human beings are capable of that.</span> <span id="s2206">Am I to – to – to remember all these things all the time, and accuse all the people of the – being possible to do that?</span> <span id="s2207">No, it – it was circumstances.</span> <span id="s2208">But circumstances like that, there are hundreds of them, you know, that people can be capable of such barbarity, and it – in a civilized nation.</span> <span id="s2209">You know, to – to kill six million Jews?</span> <span id="s2210">To have special concentration camps that you just do nothing but daily, you know, take them to the bathroom –</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Death rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: – to – to the – to ta – basically take the shower, and instead of water coming out, a gas comes out of the shower things, and you – and you kill them by the hundred.</span> <span id="s2213">You know, and all in the name of an idea that – that these are bad people, and that you have to get rid of them because – because you are looking for lebensraum, which is the space, you know, living space, the Germans were doing it.</span> <span id="s2214">They were going to liquidate the Poles, and they were going to liquidate the Russians, because they were going to take over all this territory and form a thousand year old Reich, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">Q: The idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">A: That was the idea.</span> <span id="s2217">And – and many of them went for it.</span> <span id="s2218">And then when I was in Germany in – in – in 1955 or ’56, it was all gone.</span> <span id="s2219">They were all back to normal people, you know, and you – nobod – nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2220">They just didn’t know that something like that was happening.</span> <span id="s2221">Which is, of course, something else.</span> <span id="s2222">But – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Well, from what you say, it sounds like we’re veering between the need to go forward, and the need to remember, but not to dwell on what you remember.</span> <span id="s2224">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: Yes, you – you – you have to remember.</span> <span id="s2226">And that’s why I think the Holocaust Museum d-does a wonderful thing, and I’m so grateful that they extended their willingness to come to places like – like my home.</span> <span id="s2227">Yes, you must, but not that you have to, you must remember that.</span> <span id="s2228">And you must teach that to the next generation, so they don’t repeat that kind of mistake.</span> <span id="s2229">And I think, if we learned any lessons, then maybe the sacrifices will bear fruit.</span> <span id="s2230">But the – the only thing we have to do is to make sure that somehow we convey it to other generations, you know, and they remember that human beings are capable of these unbelievable atrocities, all in the name of some idiotic idea, or – or in the name of Bachkastani(ph), who – who killed his own – he had the problems in the beginning of – of the – of the war when he waged war against Germany, because before, in the 30s, he killed all the officers’ staff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: You’re talking about Stalin, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: Yes, you know.</span> <span id="s2233">And so – so, you know, because you don’t trust anyone, even the people that were with you all this time, helping you to get to the top of the pile, and then you kill them because you mistrust them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: And – and I think this is the si – this is the something that – that will – we should be able to convey to other generations, that you know, please don’t become one of those.</span> <span id="s2236">Be a human being.</span> <span id="s2237">Be a loving human being and – and don’t persecute your brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s2239">Thank you for sharing your story with us today.</span> <span id="s2240">Thank you for the energy and the time and the attention, and we’re very, very grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Well, tha – and thank you for coming, because, you know, I – I – I wasn’t going to disclose this, what I have disclosed to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: I appreciate that you have.</span> <span id="s2243">I appreciate that you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: Well, thank – tha-thank your museum, really seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: I will.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Witold Pawlikowski on January 19 – excuse me, January 21st, 2015.</span> <span id="s2248">Okay, so Mr. Pawlikowski, now I want to talk to you a little bit about the documents here that you have on your lap.</span> <span id="s2249">Have you ever seen anything like this before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: No, I haven’t.</span> <span id="s2251">Because I d – apparently these were filled out by my mother somewhere.</span> <span id="s2252">I don’t rem – I don’t see the date.</span> <span id="s2253">But it says that it’s a displaced person registration record, which – which shows the registration number, and my mother’s name, place of birth, religion, the father’s name, mother’s name and last place of residency in Poland.</span> <span id="s2254">And okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">Q: And there’s one for her and I believe one for you as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: There’s one for me, which is – which is I’m really grateful for that, but this a – cause I didn’t even know that – that something like that exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">Q: The third page is part of the listing in the list on the [indecipherable] boat that you took to the United States.</span> <span id="s2258">Your names are down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">A: Right, my names are – are here, and my mother’s birthdate and place of birth, and – international ref – refugee organization travel documents are issued in Beirut.</span> <span id="s2260">So this is the – the register of the – on the ship that – that – which we took to – to the United States, which is really something.</span> <span id="s2261">You know, they just simply didn’t share these documents with us, you know.</span> <span id="s2262">Maybe they would have if we asked for it, but – and – and these are also some registration cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: For you and for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Date was 4-9-1950.</span> <span id="s2265">So this was when we apparently are leaving Lebanon to go to England.</span> <span id="s2266">Yes, last occasion Beirut, Lebanon, and destination England, on SS Oxfordshire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: You know, it’s interesting that I fou – I got those documents after I got the questionnaire that you filled out.</span> <span id="s2268">And as I was looking through them I said, this confirms everything that you told me in the questionnaire, everything that you wrote in the que – now, one wouldn’t doubt it, it’s simply –</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: You do have documentation of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: We do have documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2273">So what does it say?</span> <span id="s2274">Does it – does it have a meaning for you when you see something like this, 60 – 70 years after the event?</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">A: Well, it’s just like what you said.</span> <span id="s2276">It – it really shows the documentation that I did go through those things.</span> <span id="s2277">It’s not only the Stalin’s picture that I have to show you, but – but there is actually documentation.</span> <span id="s2278">Of course, we don’t have any documentation from the Soviet Union, but – but this is – is a – a wonderful thing, and this – this is application for assistance, whatever that was.</span> <span id="s2279">And it was 1947, so we were in Lebanon at that time.</span> <span id="s2280">And this must be the – when international refu – refugee organization had taken over, and my mother had to fill this out.</span> <span id="s2281">So – and this also is a recommendation from England, from the Polish hostel in Lothian(ph) Park, Pendred(ph) Cumberland, that my mother has left the camp to go to a hostel in Liverpool, and was due to sail for USA on the following day.</span> <span id="s2282">So this is confirmation that we did travel on Her Majesty’s – because Her Majesty paid for the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Ah, to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: What would you say to other people?</span> <span id="s2286">Would you say that it is worth them making an effort to find out th – you know, about such documents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: Oh yes, I would say this – this is fantastic, and I – you know, maybe it is my fault, maybe I could have inquired myself, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: But you may never have known of its existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: But [indecipherable] of the existence of something like that, you know.</span> <span id="s2290">I mean, something that says that she left in feb – second February for the Danfield Lane Hostel in Liverpool, and then – you know, and – and this is the international refugee organization which – I – I – I have to read it, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: – but it’s a statement of my mother, that she had to sign, that she waives and surrenders any rights and claims of demands of any blah-blah-blah, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Some official language there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Some official language that I would be glad to – to read, but you know, we are really grateful to – to – to the fact that such an organization was formed, and helped not thousands, but millions of people to go back and to start life again, in a normal life.</span> <span id="s2295">Not the place where you see somebody hitting a child’s head on the – on the pavement, but normal life, and you can appreciate that and – and you know, that’s why I want – when I came to the United States, I tried to every – you know, to – to do everything I can not to go against the law.</span> <span id="s2296">I was never arrested.</span> <span id="s2297">I did not use drugs, because life was too dear to me.</span> <span id="s2298">And I – I think that’s important to know, that you just live once, and you live for a very short period of time, and it is much simpler to live a simple life, a normal life, where you have family, where you have – you go to church, where you worship, where you remember that it – it was not your doing that you were saved, it was something else.</span> <span id="s2299">And then I think it’s – that’s very important how, even though you have no proof, cause you – cause you been just, you know, right place in the right time, but something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: And I – and I think it’s im-important to – to know and to acknowledge it, and to thank God for – for this gift of life.</span> <span id="s2302">And now, being grandfather, you know, and having a ni – a young lady that, you know – where’s – where’s my painting?</span> <span id="s2303">Where’s my painting, grandchild’s pa-painting?</span> <span id="s2304">Because you know, the – the grandparents week this week.</span> <span id="s2305">And my – show me – show yours, too.</span> <span id="s2306">And – and we – w-we – we went to visit our daughter over the weekend, and she presented us the roses for the grandpa over there, and grandma got her embroidery of her painting, and grandpa got – got the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s2308">Oh, this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: This is – this is the embroidery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: Oh, that’s so sweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: That’s her – that’s her painting, but embroidery, of course, is mother’s.</span> <span id="s2312">But nevertheless, Grandma got that.</span> <span id="s2313">And this is Jaja(ph) [indecipherable] painting.</span> <span id="s2314">So, you know, you have to remember that your blessing continues.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2316">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Of course – of course [indecipherable] is misspelled, but it’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: That’s part of the charm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: Right, that’s part of the charm, of course.</span> <span id="s2320">And grandma [indecipherable] A2: But this one is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: But you know, that’s – that’s important.</span> <span id="s2323">The grandpa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">A: And apparently, this is the grandpa with the beard, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">Q: Green beard.</span> <span id="s2327">Well, thank you grandpa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">PAGE</span></p>
