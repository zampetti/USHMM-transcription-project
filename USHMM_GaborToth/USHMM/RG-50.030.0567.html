1, 2010</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Romeo Fagiolo, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on March 1st, 2010, at Leisure World in Silver Spring, Maryland.</span> <span id="s12">Mr. Fagiolo, can you tell us a little bit about your background; where you were born; where you grew up; your family, and so on and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Yeah, I was born in Washington, D.C., and I made a historic beginning.</span> <span id="s14">I was born the night that the Knickerbocker Theater in Washington collapsed.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yeah, that – they – the roof collapsed on the 28th, and I was born on the 29th.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: On the 29th of which month and –</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Of January, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And you grew up in Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I grew up in Washington, I went to all school in here.</span> <span id="s21">I went to Central High School and graduated.</span> <span id="s22">And then I was – I graduated from high school in June of ’41.</span> <span id="s23">So you know what I was doing on December of ’42 –</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: k – or ’41.</span> <span id="s26">So I had no education other than a high school education, and I was drafted in February of – of 1943, and I took my basic training at the infas – infamous Fort Hood, or at that time was known as Camp Hood.</span> <span id="s27">And the camp had just opened, as a matter of fact, we slept in the motor pool, because the barracks weren’t ready for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Can you tell us where was this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Camp in Texas, in Killeen, Texas.</span> <span id="s30">And I – I stayed there for about a year.</span> <span id="s31">I took my basic training there, and I was sent to a s-school.</span> <span id="s32">When I graduated from the school, they kept me there as an instructor, and I stayed maybe six or seven months.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: How is it that you came into the army rather than one of the other branches of military service?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Well, that’s my own fault, I wanted to go into the Air Force, and I took the Air Force exam, passed it.</span> <span id="s35">But I was drafted before the Air Force could get to me.</span> <span id="s36">And the rule in that day is, once you’re drafted, you can’t choose your service.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Your service has to be picked prior to your induction.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Are you the only son in your family?</span> <span id="s40">A: Yes, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Were there any girls?</span> <span id="s42">A: Yes, I had one sister, who is now deceased.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And your parents, when you were drafted, how did they respond to it?</span> <span id="s44">Were they upset, were they –</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: No, they weren’t, they – I – I think in those days I – I – we looked at it as an honor to go into the – into the army.</span> <span id="s46">And if you were rejected, or become a 4F, it was really – I’ve seen men cry because they were turned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: But my parents were from Italy.</span> <span id="s49">They were born over there.</span> <span id="s50">They met while they were in the United States.</span> <span id="s51">And the oddity is that two sisters married two brothers.</span> <span id="s52">And they were – well, you know, we just lived here, and my father took me down to Georgetown and put me on the bus, and as he was walking away, I saw him cry, I had – I’d – I’d never – never saw – never saw my father cry too often.</span> <span id="s53">But I guess he was happy.</span> <span id="s54">But they were always good to me, I had a good family.</span> <span id="s55">And so I went to Fort Hood.</span> <span id="s56">And after I taught there for awhile, I tried to get out of teaching.</span> <span id="s57">I – I wanted to get into a – a lion outfit, which was a – not – not necessarily a fighting outfit, but do something other than just teach my whole career.</span> <span id="s58">So I put in for what they called ASTP.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What does that stand for?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I-It stand for Army Specialized Training Corp.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: And the purpose of that was, you would go to some university, get a degree from college, and upon graduation you were obligated to serve two years as an officer in the army.</span> <span id="s63">So I went to Texas A&amp;M, and I was there about maybe four months, and they disbanded –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: The program?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: – the program.</span> <span id="s66">So they sent me back, at that time was Camp Hood, and during the interim, the camp had changed from a – a tank destroyer, to the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Why was it called an infamous camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Well, ni – because of the recent – the recent episode –</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Ah, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yeah, that.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Okay, because of that, okay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: But it – it – it’s one of the largest camps in the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s73">I think from one end of the spectrum to the other is like 26 miles.</span> <span id="s74">That’s why it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s76">So you’re talking about a shooting that took place in 2009, but you were there half a century –</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: – before.</span> <span id="s79">Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: So anyway, I ended up in the infantry, and I did one – I – I was a [indecipherable] for one cycle, training soldiers.</span> <span id="s81">And then I got orders to go to Camp Gruber, Oklahoma, which was the 42nd infantry division.</span> <span id="s82">And I was in that camp, I think July or in August, and we moved out in – in November, probably –</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: How large was the division?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: It was – well, one infantry division usually consists of about 30,000 men.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: That’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: And – and you moved out in –</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Well, then – then – then we were shipped overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: In what time?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: It was in November of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: So, already after D-Day.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s93">D-Day had passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And so where – where was your first European landing with the division?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: In Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: In Marseilles, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: And from there we went up and we caught the lines.</span> <span id="s98">And the reason they closed the ASTP is that they had lost more men on D-Day than – than we’ve advertised or reported.</span> <span id="s99">So they were short of infantry people.</span> <span id="s100">And when we went over, we were only the three infantry divisions.</span> <span id="s101">Artillery, the medics and everything else didn’t come over until January.</span> <span id="s102">So when we got there, they told us we were going to a quiet sector, the whole alliance.</span> <span id="s103">Well, the quiet sector turned out to be the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: At Bastogne.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: So we lo – we were green soldiers and we probably made a lot of mistakes, but we lost a lot of good men.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Can you tell me about what happened to you, what you remember from that time, where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: You mean from –</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: When you were in these battles, when you were in the – you know, when you had landed in Marseilles, your first memories of what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Saw is just going up through France, which we – by that time had already been secured.</span> <span id="s112">And the thing I remember is the civilians, they had soo set – two sets of flags.</span> <span id="s113">They had a white one and – and an American one.</span> <span id="s114">So it depend who was going by, which flag they would wave out of the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s116">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: But we landed, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s118">We landed at what they call CP2, which was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Mm-hm, what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: That was where they organized the – the soldiers at – at – once they co – you leave the boat.</span> <span id="s121">And that’s where we met Bed Check Charlie, that was a German plane.</span> <span id="s122">They would come over every night, and that was a nickname that we gave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Bad check Charlie?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Bal – Bed Check Charlie.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Bed Check Charlie.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s127">He made sure we got to bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Never fired on us, just flew over.</span> <span id="s130">So that was it, and then they – they rushed us to the front, and that’s when we hit the – the Battle of the Bulge, the snow and the freezing weather, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: You were in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yeah, I was in that.</span> <span id="s133">I went over as a corporal, and we lost so many men, that I became a staff sergeant overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Were you – and how long did that battle la – well, th – for you, how long did that battle last?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: That battle last until the end of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So for – for –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: For a month, five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: For a month, five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: And my birthday is the 29th of January, and that was the date that they took us off the front, and that was my birthday present.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Pretty good birthday present.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: I remember when I lived in The Netherlands, there is a cemetery outside the town that I lived, maintained by the American military, and they had bring – brought in a lot of the soldiers who died in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s143">Not only that battle, but a lot of others.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Oh, that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: It was – and th-the hills are just covered, they’re just covered.</span> <span id="s146">And f – very moving, very moving to walk around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: It is, it is, it is.</span> <span id="s148">The first person that I lost when we hit the front, was wit – was an old timer, and he was drafted when he was 30, you know, and that was the upper [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s149">And we became good friends.</span> <span id="s150">He was in the insurance business, my father was also, so we had a little common interest in that.</span> <span id="s151">Before we went overseas, we used to go to the PX –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: [sneeze] Excuse me, excuse me.</span> <span id="s153">I was going to stifle that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Oh, that’s all right, that’s all right.</span> <span id="s155">So anyway, we became good friends, we’d go to the PX and so forth.</span> <span id="s156">And the first night that we were in battle, I had a sleeping bag, it was down.</span> <span id="s157">And I got it on a raffle, cause they only gave one per platoon.</span> <span id="s158">So the first night we tried to bed down, I couldn’t find my bedroll.</span> <span id="s159">And it was common in the army to say it was a midnight requisition, that somebody had acquired it.</span> <span id="s160">So anyway, the next day – his name was Clifford, he came over to me and he says, Romeo, I’m sorry, I grabbed your bedroll by mistake.</span> <span id="s161">Cause he knew it was mine, cause it was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: That was down.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: So I said, that’s okay, Cliff.</span> <span id="s164">But anyway, about three hours later, he was dead, so I always felt that he had his last night on this good earth, in my nice sleeping bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: At least warm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s167">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Do you – were you there when he –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, he was on another si – another gun post.</span> <span id="s170">We were in the anti-tank, and when we got there we were supposed to have three anti-tank guns, and three trucks.</span> <span id="s171">And we got no t – we had no trucks, and two guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: And then we lost his gun, the Germans fired a direct hit.</span> <span id="s174">As a matter of fact, it was told to me later that – that an 88 shell hit him in the head.</span> <span id="s175">And when I went there after it was over, there was a fellow called Valentime(ph), he had red hair, and there was red hair all over the guns and place.</span> <span id="s176">So anyway, that was his last night on earth, with my bedroll.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Was that the first time you had seen such – you had seen –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: – that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: That was the first battle, the first.</span> <span id="s181">So after that, a-after January, after my birthday, we had lost so many men, they took us back and we organized this, and refilled the ranks.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Where did they take you to?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I-It was in France, close to Nancy, France, and we – we were there about three weeks before they got all the men back together.</span> <span id="s184">And so we stayed there until March, the first of March, and then that’s when we tried – had the offensive, that we went through the –</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yeah, well, that was really – the resistance wa-wasn’t too heavy.</span> <span id="s187">But it was buth – y-you’d hit – certain times when you would hit little resistance and then you would go in reserve, and then the next day you might move 20 miles with nothing, no resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And was this already through southern Germany, or was this still in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Th-Th – no, no, we had – still in France, and we didn’t cross the Rhine, and I remember it was Easter Sunday.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: At what point did you cross the Rhine, at what place?</span> <span id="s191">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: You don’t.</span> <span id="s194">But it was a – but probably in the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Oh yeah, it was south Germany.</span> <span id="s196">And then, and from that point on, it was just – we went through – we took v-various th – Daun, we took Schweinfurt, we took – we – we took th – three or four –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: – cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Is it – did you come in contact with German POWs?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: As you were coming along, yeah?</span> <span id="s202">As you were going there.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Well – well, they were surrendering, and the story that I always tell, we were in reserve, and I – they used to give us a chocolate bar to eat.</span> <span id="s204">And I was eating that, and I had a tap on my shoulder and I turned around.</span> <span id="s205">And it was a German soldier, and he had a white flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And he wanted some chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, I guess maybe he did, but that he had a circular from Eisenhower encouraging the Germans to surrender, and that they would be well taken care of, and so forth.</span> <span id="s208">So, he was all alone, and I didn't know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s209">And luckily, there were other Germans coming from the front, quite a few of them, so I just told him to fall in with the rest of them, and that was the last time I saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Did he – was he young, or old?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Ah, ah, n – he – he wasn’t young, but he wasn’t old.</span> <span id="s212">You – I – he must have been 30 or 40.</span> <span id="s213">I tell you, their faces were dirty, they were beard.</span> <span id="s214">Y-You know, it was really to distinguish the age.</span> <span id="s215">And in those days, you know, e-every time we got a German prisoner, they always say, you know, nicht schiessen, you know, Polack, Polack, you know.</span> <span id="s216">Don’t shoot me, boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Don’t shoot me, I’m a Pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I’m a Pole.</span> <span id="s219">And that’s what they would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Did you come in contact with the civilian population?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Oh, a-as you go through the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s225">And was there a difference between the French and the German towns as you were going through them?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s227">First of all, you could tell the – being a German, the civilians were well clothed.</span> <span id="s228">The French had nothing.</span> <span id="s229">Clothes, you could tell the difference, I don’t know about soap and things like that, but once you hit Germany, there was a different class of people, and that they had a better part of the life.</span> <span id="s230">And some of the stories that the Frenchmen tell, it’s a – you know, it’s disgraceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: What did you hear?</span> <span id="s232">What were some of those stories that the – that the French were telling?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Oh, well I got – I got it in here, the – a story that – actually, this was in – in France, a lady that – they were in nor – Norway, and it was a fishing town, and they were sending messages to – to Russia, and Russia would send them to England, and the Germans caught them.</span> <span id="s234">And there were seven of them.</span> <span id="s235">So they took the men out and they want them to dig their own graves.</span> <span id="s236">So one of them was slow doing it, and when the officer, the German officer was pushing him along, he says, I’m in no hurry, I sh – he says, I know what I’m digging.</span> <span id="s237">So the German got mad and spit on him.</span> <span id="s238">And this – and the fisherman, with his spade, turned around and hit him with such force, that he actually decapitated him.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: And of course, when he did that, that was the end of it, and the other Germans had killed the rest of them.</span> <span id="s241">And in retaliation, they took the wives, seven wives, and they took them to – to Germany and this one lady that she had a eight months old baby girl, and when she got on the boat, they took the baby from her, and the put it on a crib, in a box on the deck of the ship.</span> <span id="s242">And when she came out the next morning the baby was gone.</span> <span id="s243">And of course they assumed that – that they just threw her overboard.</span> <span id="s244">And she ended up as a – working fine wires for the German in some factory.</span> <span id="s245">And when they were – when she was liberated – I wasn’t there, incidentally, this was told to me by, you know, another company, that those women were all in cells.</span> <span id="s246">They would open the cells, and they wouldn’t come out.</span> <span id="s247">And they would tell them, you know, you’re free, you’re free.</span> <span id="s248">But they were just scared.</span> <span id="s249">They didn’t know – i-i-i-it makes you cry, it really does.</span> <span id="s250">The people were just scared, they lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s251">They never knew when they were going to be the last day.</span> <span id="s252">They finally coaxed them out, and then the Americans, which I take pride of, the-they really treated those people.</span> <span id="s253">They gave them their own food and clothes, and they were well taken care of.</span> <span id="s254">And s-so it – after that –</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So, as soldiers, you were swapping these stories that you were seeing, you – that you were experience – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, well, you know, after [indecipherable] relates this one lady that they – that they had come across.</span> <span id="s257">And eventually, see, we have a reunion every year.</span> <span id="s258">And one year, they – they brought her over.</span> <span id="s259">She always wanted to meet the – the soldiers that liberated her.</span> <span id="s260">And she came over with her daughter.</span> <span id="s261">And – and she brought with her, she had a quilt – not a quilt, it was a – a blanket.</span> <span id="s262">And in – while in the cell, what she did, knitting, she knitted her family tree on the quilt.</span> <span id="s263">And she brought that with her, and it was old, and oh, but you could tell where she had spent hours just doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Doing it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: But the thing that amazed me, they were scared to come out.</span> <span id="s266">They were scared to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: So do you remember the first time you had contact with German civilians?</span> <span id="s268">Was it memorable, or not really [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Well – well, see, the only ones that you really hit, is that you’re going along, and the people on the street, they were – course, they had the American, and you know, you would wave, and maybe talk to them.</span> <span id="s270">One night I had an experience, I got lost with my squad, and I didn’t know which way to go, and there was a – a German.</span> <span id="s271">So I started to talk to him, and he spoke perfect English.</span> <span id="s272">So I – I was trying to get to ma – back to my line, so he was telling me where to go.</span> <span id="s273">And of course, I was hesitant, because you know, you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Who is he, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: But I asked him, I said, how come you speak such good English?</span> <span id="s276">So he said, I lived in Baltimore for 30 years.</span> <span id="s277">And he says that then he went back to his hometown and the war broke out.</span> <span id="s278">But he led us back to my lines, and he spoke perfect English.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: He really did.</span> <span id="s281">But those are the only ones that you really meet.</span> <span id="s282">I – I sh – I hesitate, because a lot of times I’ve met people afterwards, and not – not during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Yeah, I’m interested in figuring, and getting a picture of, you know, what your – what your experience is as you’re going along.</span> <span id="s284">You know, you’re in France, then you cross the Rhine at – at Easter time, the towns change from poorly dressed people to very well dressed people.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: You know, you find some prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s287">And e – I don’t remember, is April in March or in – was Easter in a – in March or in April that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: I think it must have been March –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: – or probably – maybe the first of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: And so it –</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: That’s when General Patton, you know, made his – he urinated in – in the Rhine.</span> <span id="s295">That was his –</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: His symbol.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah, symbol of success.</span> <span id="s298">But after that it was – the war was – you could tell it was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s299">But then you would hit pockets, there was stiff resistance, so you couldn’t relax, and y-you just had to be alert and watch, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: But you didn’t lose that many men this time, after –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No, no, that I didn’t.</span> <span id="s302">The – the second time, the only ones we lost were minor.</span> <span id="s303">Most of my [indecipherable] was frostbite from – from the snow and all.</span> <span id="s304">And that – that was a miserable life, that – that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: So you’re sleeping in the fields, or your –</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s307">Had no place to sleep, and – and I tell you, I don’t mean to embarrass you, but I tell you the worst part was going to the bathroom in the morning.</span> <span id="s308">I tell you, you pull up your pants and snow all in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: It’s – yeah, I mean it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: I – I don’t want to imagine it, but where – what – what is a soldier’s life?</span> <span id="s312">It’s no fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: No, it isn’t.</span> <span id="s314">You actually become an animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: You felt that way [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Oh yeah, you live like an animal.</span> <span id="s317">You learn things that a civilian, an American civilian wouldn’t recognize, but – you know where to take cover, get under bushes.</span> <span id="s318">A-And you live – you live like an animal.</span> <span id="s319">You just pray from one spot to the other, and it’s a – it’s – it’s a rough life.</span> <span id="s320">And not only worrying about dying, which I never did.</span> <span id="s321">My only fear was losing my legs, I never wanted to lose my legs.</span> <span id="s322">Death would have been –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Preferable?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: As many people in these camps, death would have been a blessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: A real blessing.</span> <span id="s327">And I haven’t gotten to Dachau, I’ll save that for last –</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: – but – but at that time, there was no resistance, occasionally, and then we always had good billets.</span> <span id="s330">If you were reserve, they got you good housing, or decent housing, and – which was real nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did you have – was there any news, or any thought at that point that something special had happened to the Jews?</span> <span id="s332">Was there any kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Nothing at all.</span> <span id="s336">The only thing that I knew, see, I was going to high school, and we used to get a paper, and he would have, you know, how many planes Germany was building every month, and this and the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: When you were still in Washington, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah, still a civilian.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: You know, I was in high school.</span> <span id="s341">And I – and that’s the only thing that I knew, and then the – they read you through the different religious [indecipherable] they would say that they’re torturing the Jews, or doing this.</span> <span id="s342">But it – it – that was remote.</span> <span id="s343">You know, you were a 17 year old kid going to high school, and you did it for current events, you know, as an assignment.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: And – and you re – you didn’t have the feeling of it, as you did just reading it.</span> <span id="s346">And that made a difference, and a lot of them, they go – they got educated very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: So tell me, when you were – you crossed the Rhine, and wa – and it was April, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: It was April.</span> <span id="s350">And so there’s – from the Rhine to Munich, it was – it took a month – took three weeks to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Took, you know, about a month, because we were in – Dachau was taken the 29th of ja – April.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: So, maybe it was in the latter part of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s355">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I’m – you know, I’m – I always hate to give these interviews, because see, I was an infantry person.</span> <span id="s357">I-In our place, we never knew where we were, we never knew nothing, and it – the G.I.s always used to say, you know, someday we’ll have to come back and see where we’ve been.</span> <span id="s358">And that’s – that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s359">And in – in time – you never knew whether it was Saturday, or Sunday, or – or if – i-i-it was just one day after the other.</span> <span id="s360">But in Germany, wi – I was in anti-tank, which are less burdened, because we didn’t have too many trouble with tanks, like we did in France and during the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s361">I mean, the Germans would come at you with eight, 10 tanks, so we were really busy.</span> <span id="s362">But when we started to move, and then the battle fatigue for me, was to stay in one place.</span> <span id="s363">Because the longer you stayed there, you would lose one man today, and another one tomorrow.</span> <span id="s364">And finally after a week you’d – you know, you would get jittery.</span> <span id="s365">But as long as you moving, and you going into new territory, and you just didn’t have that fear that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And were you stalled a lot?</span> <span id="s367">I mean, between the Rhine and Munich, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Oh no, it was a steady, steady movement.</span> <span id="s369">Steady movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Steady movement, steady movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I – I had gotten a – an ear infection, and I tried to get the medics.</span> <span id="s372">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Tried to get to the medics and you couldn’t find a medic, everybody was moving so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: It – it took me three days.</span> <span id="s377">By that time my ear was, you know, it was – it’s worse than an earache, cause I was in some shelling, which – well, that’s another story.</span> <span id="s378">But – but that’s what it was, we were just moving along.</span> <span id="s379">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: But the shelling, nevertheless, happened during this moving along?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Well, ye – well, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What was – tell me about that a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Well, the shelling was that the Germans used to use the p – the Polish men, they were set up the – the line of resistance behind the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s384">So when the German soldiers would retreat, those guys were already set in with guns, and that’s the only thing they had.</span> <span id="s385">So they would fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: On the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: No, they would fire on us.</span> <span id="s388">These were –</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: The Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Well, they were Polish, or at least they claimed to be Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Because the Polish we-were enslaved by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So, I would be – you know, why would a German give a Pole a gun?</span> <span id="s394">He would –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: They – na – no, no, they were firing the artillery, and whether they were actually firing them, I don’t know, but they would dig them in –</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: – and they would get the ammunition ready, and they – they were doing it.</span> <span id="s398">And then, at that time, the Russian – the Germans, yo – I mean, they were desperate, you know, I mean, they took – just like with me with that German person I asked to lead me the way.</span> <span id="s399">I – I didn’t know whether he was leading me right or wrong, but I was desperate.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I had to take a chance.</span> <span id="s402">So I was – I did it right.</span> <span id="s403">And I had nine men with me, which –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: That’s quite some repos – responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: It really is, it really is.</span> <span id="s406">Cause some of them were – they were younger than I was.</span> <span id="s407">Some of them – yo-you know, it’s – it’s disgraceful, but when I was in the hospital just for a day or two, there was a fellow there, he was 18 years old, he’d been in the army, I figured it was less than a year, and he lost a leg.</span> <span id="s408">Hadn’t been in the army.</span> <span id="s409">So – but that’s it – but we went from one town to the other.</span> <span id="s410">If I knew you were gonna ask me that, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: I have sa – detailed map, it really shows where –</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Oh, that would – that would be interesting to have in the future.</span> <span id="s414">You know, that we could have in addition to your interview, that we’d have the map that shows the de – you know, the route.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yeah [indecipherable] Schweinfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: And then, of course, Munich was –</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What would – was – was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: – was that – I mean, Munich’s a huge city, so how – was it bombed, was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Bombed, it was – it was di – it was square blocks of rubbish.</span> <span id="s422">And my first – I had two impressions when I got into Munich.</span> <span id="s423">One was, I couldn’t understand how one man would allow his citizens to go through the hell that they went through.</span> <span id="s424">And some of those civilians really had a hard, hard life.</span> <span id="s425">You know, I’ve had mothers tell me that, you know, they put the babies to bed, get them settled down, the air raid siren goes on, grab the kids, take them to the shelter, get them settled.</span> <span id="s426">All clear came out, take them back home.</span> <span id="s427">And that’s only once, but when you do that every night for months, it’s hard.</span> <span id="s428">It’s very, very hard.</span> <span id="s429">So those – th-the civilians, even though they were Germans, I always respected the Germans, and I always respected the Wehrmachts.</span> <span id="s430">And some G.I.s weren’t as liberal as I was, but I know when the war was over – where was I?</span> <span id="s431">I think it was in Munich.</span> <span id="s432">There, they were marching German prisoners on the street somewhere.</span> <span id="s433">And of course the German civilians all clapped, you know.</span> <span id="s434">And so the G.I. next to me said, what are they clapping for?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Said, well, that’s their men, that’s their citizens, they’re Germans like them, and you know, there’s a certain honor between them.</span> <span id="s437">You know, I would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s438">But I never had any malice toward anybody.</span> <span id="s439">Except, I think if I would have ever captured Hitler, man, I would have –</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: And believe it or not, I really, really hoped for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I really did.</span> <span id="s444">You know, and it was a far fetch, I mean, you know, it’s like the Germans capturing Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s445">It’s a – it’s a dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: He didn’t let that happen.</span> <span id="s447">He made sure that he wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah, he wa – he did the right thing, believe me, cause he would have ended up –</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s450">He knew what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So tell me, when you were in Munich and you’re on your way to Dachau – hang on a second.</span> <span id="s453">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Oh, actually, it’s reversed –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Okay, first –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: [indecipherable] Dachau</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: – Dachau first, before Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: We went – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Dachau first.</span> <span id="s461">And – and Dachau was a two division, 45th and 42nd, and incidentally, there’s a bitter bitterness between the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yeah, they – one trying to claim who was first, who was – so it’s – til this day it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: It’s a controversy.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Which makes no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s469">Can you hold on just a second please?</span> <span id="s470">Okay, tell me what you saw.</span> <span id="s471">You – when you go to Dachau, tell me what you were supposed to do, and what you saw, and what surprised you?</span> <span id="s472">A: Well, I came in from probably the south side, and I actually went though the gates, because the troops had been in front of us.</span> <span id="s473">But our first encounter, of course, was the railroad cars.</span> <span id="s474">And we came down there, and that was a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What’d you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Corpse.</span> <span id="s477">One just loaded, one car after the other, after the other, 50 cars, I think there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: 50 cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Of – of just –</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: – corpses.</span> <span id="s482">And the sad things that you run into is they were coming down and there was – some lady had – who was on a train, had gotten off with her baby, and she no sooner got off the car than she collapsed, I guess, cause what we saw is they were dead.</span> <span id="s483">And she died, and the baby outlived the mother.</span> <span id="s484">And you could tell that she was grabbing her mother’s breast, pulling her clothes away to – for something to eat.</span> <span id="s485">And then you see two of them dead, just sitting there, mother and whatever, they were.</span> <span id="s486">But the thing is, to think that they had to suffer, that’s the part that – that is – that’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s487">And those cars that they rode in, see, I rode in those cars under ideal conditions, and it wasn’t – it wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: It was not ideal conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: It was not, oh no, not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Did you know who those people were, the corpses, did you know who they were by that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Oh, there was no way you could have told one from the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: No, no, no, I mean by – did you know if they were Jews, did you know if they were Poles?</span> <span id="s493">Did you know why – you know, did you know who they were a-at that point, when you came upon them?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No, no, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: But the assumption would be that they’re Jews.</span> <span id="s497">I think the final calculations in their books, they’ll tell you how many Jews were involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: But when you were going through there, and you’re seeing this, you had no idea who these corpses were?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Just dead corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Just dead corpses.</span> <span id="s501">And then when you got into Dachau, was there anybody living?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Oh yeah, there were the – they – they had there – some of – some of the people were dead, living dead.</span> <span id="s503">I don’t know if you ever seen a doctor when he tries to verify if somebody died, they pull the eyelids back to look in his eyes.</span> <span id="s504">Cause you can look in the eye and you can tell whether he’s living [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s505">And that’s the way these people were, they just had a dead eye.</span> <span id="s506">They looked straight ahead, and they’re nothing but skin and bones.</span> <span id="s507">And after we left Dachau, they were losing 200 a day.</span> <span id="s508">After we got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What you – did you talk to any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No.</span> <span id="s511">They were filthy and dirty.</span> <span id="s512">Some of the people come up and they would try to hug you, and I push away.</span> <span id="s513">And one thing that really bothers me, some lady, she must have had a bottle of wine, and she wanted to gi-give it, part of it to me.</span> <span id="s514">And she’s starving, you know, and she wanted to give me part of it.</span> <span id="s515">And I-I – I ca – I mean, I couldn’t drink out of it.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, it was just the filth, the smell, I mean, y-you just couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: No way.</span> <span id="s519">And some of them, I guess they fa – you know, they tried to hug you, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: And you – you just had to push them away, push them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: But what I did, after we walked, this was the other part of our division, they had to secure the re – the camp.</span> <span id="s524">There were some prisoners who were in good shape – not good shape, but they were better shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Better shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Course, the – all they wanted to do was get out.</span> <span id="s527">And they had to contain them, which wasn’t an easy job to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Why would they had to be contained?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Because they were all diseased, there was a lot of disease in the camp.</span> <span id="s530">They didn’t want the prisoners running around in the streets of Munich, in – in a diseased state.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And I can imagine that the prisoners couldn’t understand, now if you’re liberated us, how come you don’t let us go?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s533">But – but what they did, th-they [indecipherable] they came in with blankets, they came in with food, and – and they took care of them.</span> <span id="s534">And they weren’t there that long.</span> <span id="s535">They weren't there that long.</span> <span id="s536">I got a –</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Were there any guards that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Oh yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Were there any Germans that you found?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: – oh yeah, yeah, they – well, I didn’t – our division didn’t hit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: The 45th division, they hit the barracks.</span> <span id="s543">And they killed – they killed – I think there was 35 SSs, they never lived to tell the tale.</span> <span id="s544">And they had electric fence around the camp, that wasn’t turned on, which made it easier for their – the troops in front of us.</span> <span id="s545">And then, the pride I take getting – walking down by those railroad tracks, the G.I.s in front of me, they heard a moan.</span> <span id="s546">And they climbed up, and they literally had to walk on corpses, I mean it.</span> <span id="s547">They finally get to this one fellow, and they pulled him out and he was still alive.</span> <span id="s548">And imagine just being in with a bunch of dead people, you know?</span> <span id="s549">And – but they got him on a Jeep, I saw that, and they took him away, I guess they took him to the medics.</span> <span id="s550">And the joy part of [indecipherable] is that in ’95, which is 50th anniversary of the liberation, I went to it in – in – in Munich, this fellow that they pulled out came to that reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: And I tell you, he was a hero.</span> <span id="s553">I think everybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: – and he – he had become a very wealthy person, doing – I don’t know what he did, but he got involved in some business or something.</span> <span id="s556">But he was living, and you would never know that he came out of a –</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Pile of corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: A pile of corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: And my – you know, you ge – i-i – it’s destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: You know, it’s like in the army, you know, you – you advance, and this fellow gets shot, this one da – and you keep walking, you know.</span> <span id="s563">You – you can’t explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: What did you – what did you think, or do you remember what you thought when you were walking through here, because I don’t – you know, you weren’t expecting to see this, right?</span> <span id="s565">You weren’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Oh no, you – we didn’t expect to find a – a – th-the magnitude that it was.</span> <span id="s567">It was just – there was just corpse everywhere.</span> <span id="s568">And the thing I remember is that lady with the baby in her arms.</span> <span id="s569">I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s570">And the other ones in the crematories, I went in there, and the soil had so much blood in it, that i-it had a purple brownish color.</span> <span id="s571">It just didn’t look like dirt, but just from the saturation of the – of the blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Of the blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: It’s just that, and the other one that I always remembered was the – the – the – the inmates had a – to wash up, if you want to call it that, it’s like an umbrella opened up, and at the top, the water would come from the top, and come down and then it would all wash.</span> <span id="s574">But the dirt, the stench, the – ye – I-I mean, how could you go there and clean up?</span> <span id="s575">I mean, it was so filthy, you know, just oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: About how many people, do you know, were in the camp when – when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Close to 30,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: When you guys walked into it, there still were about 30,000 people in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s580">They – I tell you, this book give it all – I mean, I – this is where I get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: But th-they broke it down – they broke it down by, you know, different people.</span> <span id="s583">But the Jews were always the most.</span> <span id="s584">They were the largest number.</span> <span id="s585">I have to –</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s587">How long were you there in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Dachau, I went in there that Sunday afternoon, and I stayed in the – we left, and I stayed in a building, it was an office building.</span> <span id="s589">And the two things I remember in there were – you know, they used to have red ink and black ink on the desk.</span> <span id="s590">And the G.I.s as they go through there, get the ink and throw it against the wall.</span> <span id="s591">And then they had a bust of Hitler standing there, and I think everybody that went by shot it.</span> <span id="s592">I-It was just perforated with –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: – holes.</span> <span id="s595">So [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s596">And then I left that morning, and that’s when they were bringing the – the – the people from the city of Dachau.</span> <span id="s597">Which people don’t understand, but that’s a very intellectual city.</span> <span id="s598">There’s colleges there, and so forth, and being associated with the camp didn’t help them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: But anyway, that morning they were bringing people in.</span> <span id="s601">Somebody – you – you want to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: No, no, no, no, hang on a minute.</span> <span id="s603">Well, let’s see.</span> <span id="s604">All right.</span> <span id="s605">But – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: But anyway, they – they brought them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: They brought them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: They brought them in, and the women, you know, they would get their coats and walk through the place, and course they all denied that they knew anything about it.</span> <span id="s609">Nobody in Germany was a – was a Nazi, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span
