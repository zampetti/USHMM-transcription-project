we wasn't allowed to go there - to walk.</span> <span id="s192">And at night, we couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s193">How did they call this?</span> <span id="s194">I don't remember how they said this.</span> <span id="s195">We couldn't go outside at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A curfew?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Curfew, yes.</span> <span id="s198">We couldn't walk at night but we was still in our house, it was difficult, we didn't have everything like before.</span> <span id="s199">Before, my father and my brothers worked and we had pretty good to eat and everything - we had everything.</span> <span id="s200">But after that, when they came in - it was completely different, My father used to make his own shoes and sent them to market to sell.</span> <span id="s201">And then he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s202">So, it was a little different.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Were these leather shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Leather shoes.</span> <span id="s205">Good homemade shoes.</span> <span id="s206">Good shoes.</span> <span id="s207">I wish I would have now a pair of shoes like this.</span> <span id="s208">So, it was different then when the Germans came in and they used to grab to work.</span> <span id="s209">They took my father, he was away like for six weeks -

like, "tonight they are going to grab boys."</span> <span id="s211">So everybody was hiding, so they took girls.</span> <span id="s212">So it was pretty bad.</span> <span id="s213">And then finally, one day, they chased us all out from the house.</span> <span id="s214">That was already in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">How did you get food during this three year period?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Haah, it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s217">It was very hard but somehow we ate.</span> <span id="s218">I can't remember everything, you know, my father used to work for the Polish people and they used to come in and bring potatoes and some different things and somehow we ate.</span> <span id="s219">And he worked but not like before - I said before that he used to work and go to markets and sell in different towns.</span> <span id="s220">And when the Germans came in was very difficult.</span> <span id="s221">And then one day, they came and they chased us all out from the house.</span> <span id="s222">We left everything and we went to this one place and they start picking and they picked me and my younger sister, which the two of us survived and my two older brothers they took.</span> <span id="s223">And they separated the boys separate and the girls separate and my parents they send back somehow and my younger sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s224">The very youngest stayed with my grandfather at home, because my grandfather was still alive.</span> <span id="s225">And I never, never saw them since that day.</span> <span id="s226">We were separated, I - we went to a different camp.</span> <span id="s227">We went to Skarszisko, they called it, in Poland.</span> <span id="s228">We walked, as a matter of fact to this place.</span> <span id="s229">We worked ammunition there.</span> <span id="s230">They called it vitfornya ph 210.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">You made ammunition?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">We made ammunition.</span> <span id="s233">I stayed by two big machines and I made the ammunition and you had to work twelve day shifts for the shells, you poured in the shells like small, and they came out this long.</span> <span id="s234">You had -- that was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s235">These machines went on soap water.</span> <span id="s236">You had to pour in the water -
