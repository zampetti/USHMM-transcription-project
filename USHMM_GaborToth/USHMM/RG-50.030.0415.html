secretly, you know, at that location.</span> <span id="s153">The cattle wagon, you know, went through all Europe, during the day we were delivered to Auschwitz, and nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s154">And we have a great big faith in Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s155">We talk about him and think about him like a -- a -- I should say a god, a savior, you know.</span> <span id="s156">And when we came back, we find out that he did this opposite.</span> <span id="s157">You know, is -- same thing was with Switzerland.</span> <span id="s158">We admired that little country, you know, that in the middle of Europe it can be neutral.</span> <span id="s159">And turn out to be they just did opposite, they serve Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So let’s -- let’s try to go back to your growing up days.</span> <span id="s161">You -- you were in this -- in this place in Hungary, was it a -- give me a sense how large is that city, and what kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Which one, my [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: -- your hometown, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: It was a relatively large city, let’s see, about a -- Budapest, Szeged, Debrecen, Nyíregyháza, about the fourth city after Budapest, you know?</span> <span id="s165">Especially, you know, when we went back, it was very nicely fixed up, you know?</span> <span id="s166">Actually, I never went to see it.</span> <span id="s167">We arrived to the station, took a cab and went to the cemetery and back.</span> <span id="s168">But even the railroad station, you know, was very nicely kept.</span> <span id="s169">I went to high school there for awhile, and in the -- it was different, the thinking of the Jewish youngster that time, you know?</span> <span id="s170">We all very stadious, you know, talk about the world and Hitler, what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s171">And we were organize, somebody organized a movement, a [indecipherable] movement, and I belong there.</span> <span id="s172">Almost all of my friend yo -- belong there, you know?</span> <span id="s173">And they were talking about to [indecipherable], to Israel, and after the German occupied Hungary I lost almost -- I thought I lost almost all of them.</span> <span id="s174">Later on I find out some of them’s living in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So you got involved at about what age, how -- how young were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I was about 14 - 15, and were very, you know, excited about it.</span> <span id="s177">We loved it, our idea.</span> <span id="s178">In fact, one year -- I had a friend who belonged to that, her husband has a -- some kind of land owner.</span> <span id="s179">So, they let us go and they like a [indecipherable], you know, you understand?</span> <span id="s180">And we were working there, you know, and the payment went to Israel.</span> <span id="s181">After the -- when I got back, my friend I mentioned before, he already left.</span> <span id="s182">He went to -- you know, to there, and still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So would you say when you were going to school in this town, did you interact with a lot of non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes, we have -- you know, it was that opened anti-Semitisms, we knew it, we felt it.</span> <span id="s185">But the high school where I went, it was mixed, you know?</span> <span id="s186">And [indecipherable] there was a girl my age who went to the same high school.</span> <span id="s187">So we were friend, but that was it, they don’t save any Jewish.</span> <span id="s188">When I hear, you know, a lot of people, Christian people save Jewish, I don’t know anybody in -- in Hungary what did this.</span> <span id="s189">Maybe they did, but I don’t know -- I won’t know anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Do you -- do you remember any anti-Semitic incidents that you had to undergo as a youngster, not -- you know, before the war, and before --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: As a youngster, it was in high school, it was the Hitler and Mussolini era already, and we have the -- in high school, yelling after the -- before the [indecipherable] in Hungary, they had Hitler and Mussolini.</span> <span id="s192">And I was quiet, and there was a girl who reported to the teacher that I’m not saying anything, and h-he wasn’t very -- he just said, next time, do it.</span> <span id="s193">So I wasn’t any punishment.</span> <span id="s194">Later, when I went home, after the war I saw that girl, and I thought I could report her to somebody, but I did not.</span> <span id="s195">I -- I didn’t want to make a case about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: So did you go along with this, and say --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I just went -- kept ki -- quiet, I didn't go along, I just kept quiet.</span> <span id="s198">Maybe I shouldn’t, but it was a real anti-Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So you felt a certain kind of anti-Sem -- Semitism in the air, you could just feel that people were --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: We all knew, you know, Jews, who lived in Hungary at that time, that all the Hungarian were anti-Jewish -- you know, anti -- anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s201">And they, during the war, after -- especially when the deportation happened, they overdo everything wa -- they try to overdo even what the German wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How, like politically aware were you once the war started, how -- how much did you follow the events --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: When th -- when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: In 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: 1939, just about average, but later on it became more of, you know, more obviously we more -- we wer -- ger -- youngster were more serious about it, you know.</span> <span id="s206">Not like the youngster here, you know.</span> <span id="s207">It was -- it was like when I went to the other city [indecipherable] I became very good friend.</span> <span id="s208">We very seriously [indecipherable] and were [indecipherable] the grown-ups what happening, and very interested what will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: When did you start to feel more interested, or maybe even more threatened about your own safety?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: It was slowly but surely the government, the Hungarian government became more and more -- the people became more and more anti-Semitic, and the anti-Jewish people get in Poland more and more.</span> <span id="s211">So we -- we know that we are not too safe, but until, you know, the German actually occupied Hungary, we can walk, you know, I kind of -- I was studying cosmetic at that time.</span> <span id="s212">I could walk to the street, you know, I wasn’t free to -- at night, we’re not going out, but we were listening, before the Germans, the American radio -- the secret radio, and the European secret radio, and we -- you know, we were very optimistic that Hitler wo -- it looks like Hitler didn’t win the war -- can’t win the war, but you know, the allied, they si -- they didn’t won yet, and that was the attitude, you know?</span> <span id="s213">It just -- it just a -- time.</span> <span id="s214">It will happen that, you know, he will lose completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Now, did you -- did you know at that point any refugees from -- Jewish refugees from other countries?</span> <span id="s216">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s217">Yeah, I do.</span> <span id="s218">One or two years before, they came over, you know, they fled from Czechoslovakia and -- and Poland, and we were -- we were so shocked to hear, you know, what they said to us.</span> <span id="s219">We couldn’t believe it, you know, it was so terrible, we -- you know, just whispering, we were just whispering, we thought what will happen to that people?</span> <span id="s220">And we believed that it couldn’t happen with us, you know, the -- it was a [indecipherable] in Hungary, not, you know, and it was a rumor that his wife has some Jewish background somewhere, so it was obvious to us that he wasn’t really, you know [indecipherable] Hitler.</span> <span id="s221">It couldn’t happen -- we feel -- we didn’t feel -- we felt, you know, safe.</span> <span id="s222">It couldn’t happen to us, what will happen.</span> <span id="s223">First of all, the Hungarian Jews, unfortunately, now I know, was first Hungarian and then we felt Jewish, you know?</span> <span id="s224">And we thought it -- it won’t happen to us.</span> <span id="s225">It was a very surprise, was suddenly, without any warning, Hitler ca-came, you know, and occupied Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: What were some of the stories that you heard from other refugees at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: First I war -- I had a friend, her name was Eva, we went to, as I mentioned, to learn cosmetic together.</span> <span id="s228">And we -- we -- and they -- they were very well-to-do family in Debrecen, and they came [indecipherable] we called him, [indecipherable] was his, you know, [indecipherable] name, but he -- he got false papers, and he was eating [indecipherable] different Jewish [indecipherable] family.</span> <span id="s229">And he got a story from -- y-you know, from him, he was [indecipherable] with -- with other two brothers, they lived in the ci -- in the city, they -- separately, you know?</span> <span id="s230">With separ -- different names, all over, you know, they didn't even meet, basically.</span> <span id="s231">And he told us, you know, what happened over there.</span> <span id="s232">And they were lucky, because he was liberated he -- o-over there in the city, as a -- you know, as a Christian boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Where did he come from first?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s235">Later on he came back, I will tell you later.</span> <span id="s236">Anyway, he suggested when -- when the German occ -- occupied Hungary that me -- he is getting us papers.</span> <span id="s237">Eva, my friend and myself, and we supposed to go to another city, and live there, and you know, one of us [indecipherable] because Eva parents was, as I said, well-to-do, and in that time, you know, it doesn’t come, you know, everybody was willing i -- i -- to spend -- sell and spend everything.</span> <span id="s238">So we have, you know, money to go.</span> <span id="s239">And finally we -- he gave us the papers, and we went to Trovald.</span> <span id="s240">The plan was that we go to the station at night, because we -- we already was mandatory to wear the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: You were hearing -- you were wearing the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Sure, that time.</span> <span id="s243">And we removed the star when we went to the station.</span> <span id="s244">But the reason was that we went at night because we want somebody to recognize us, you know, Christian, without a star, walking.</span> <span id="s245">Not to mention there was a curfew for the Jews.</span> <span id="s246">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: What time was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s249">Six, seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s250">That time there, they just planning the ghetto, it wasn’t, you know, the retto -- ghetto ready.</span> <span id="s251">And we walked to the station and we wait for the, you know, the train to come, and we -- to be traveling to Szeged.</span> <span id="s252">So nobody [indecipherable] you know, in the train.</span> <span id="s253">I remember we -- we arrived and bought a newspaper, with advertisements, you know, and we saw -- we were looking for a room, and we find one with -- without [indecipherable] you know?</span> <span id="s254">Sounded good.</span> <span id="s255">And we went over there, it was the older lady, and she rented us the room.</span> <span id="s256">We told them that we coming from Budapest, because the bombardment started oder -- over there, and the parents send out -- send down to the city, and then we have the paper, according to the paper, we were sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Now, when was this?</span> <span id="s258">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: It was 1944, March 19 it came, the German occupied Hungary, and we left about April, the beginning of April, or the middle of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So let’s go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s261">Before the Germans occupied, there were -- there were more laws passed restricting the freedoms of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Tell me about those, and -- and what you experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Like Jewish kid can’t go to higher school.</span> <span id="s265">They were certain rule hiring Jewish man or woman, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did you f -- did you -- were you very aware of those laws, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: -- what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Did it --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Every day new -- a new law came out against the -- you know, against the Jews.</span> <span id="s272">And they -- you know, it was obvious, it was after when the German came in, you know, that they pal -- planning to build a ghetto, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And with those laws, did you start to get more and more worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: We weren’t worried, but -- worried, but we were very optimistic about the end of the war, how could it happen, you know?</span> <span id="s275">Maybe that’s what we had was, you know, to getting -- you know, our survival [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s276">We were sure that, even in Auschwitz, you know, in spite of fact my friend didn't come back, we -- we were -- couldn’t imagine that we -- we’ll die over there, you know?</span> <span id="s277">We always thought that war will be over, and -- very soon, and we will always come some [indecipherable], you know, that -- especially one time when there was a [indecipherable] against Hitler, and they wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s278">So we thought maybe -- we always was praying in the lager that they will bomb the -- the railroad, which is not what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Had you heard about Auschwitz already?</span> <span id="s280">When did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No, never, never until we got there.</span> <span id="s282">I think nobody knew about it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: So, now tell me where you were, which city, and tell me a little bit more about the day that the Germans arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I was in Debrecen as I remember.</span> <span id="s285">I remember the day very well because it was, you know, a big surprise for us.</span> <span id="s286">I went to a meeting at --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Oh wait, there’s a plane overhead.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: I can hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: The microphone picks up very well.</span> <span id="s292">Okay, maybe you could start over.</span> <span id="s293">So where were you and tell me about that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: With -- you talking about when -- when the German occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s297">I came back -- it wa -- I was in a school, a elementary school, it was the meeting, you know, it was a underground meeting, naturally, nobody knew about it.</span> <span id="s298">I came out around, and sa -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Edith Csengeri.</span> <span id="s300">This is tape number one, side B. Okay, sorry to ask you again, but we got interrupted on the other side.</span> <span id="s301">So now, tell me again that day, the day the Germans arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s303">As I said, it was a terrible shock.</span> <span id="s304">I was coming -- come from a -- a [indecipherable] meeting, and when I got home, my relatives already know, everybody was, you know, very scared, and what will happen now.</span> <span id="s305">And wa -- a -- I’m -- I remembered a [indecipherable] when we went to sleep, we want to be sure that we locked the door all over, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Was that unusual?</span> <span id="s307">Were --</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: It was unusual because it was a -- like a apartment building, but the door, the -- the [indecipherable] goes to the street, it was open, we never locked it.</span> <span id="s309">So from that point we locked the -- that door, too.</span> <span id="s310">But the following night, I went to -- back to work, and you know, my boss was -- were Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s311">It was unbelievable, you know, for everybody.</span> <span id="s312">We -- what happen -- what will happen now?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So you didn’t know anything about this happening the day before it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, no, no, it just happened.</span> <span id="s315">In fact, I understand that time Hitler called hi -- Horthy, the governor name was Horthy, to his headquarters to talk it over or something.</span> <span id="s316">And he wasn’t even home in Hungary when they occupied Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: So you saw this as now a greater threat, a greater worry?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s319">We th -- expected to happened, you know, but let me -- [indecipherable] I think was okay [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s321">So now we’re back and I -- I want to continue of course, asking you, in terms of the chronology of your experiences, but I wanted to take a moment now, before we continue with your experiences, and just ask you about the fact that this is the first time that you’ve been interviewed, right?</span> <span id="s322">This is the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeah, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: And just tell me what that’s like for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: It is a -- I -- you can see it’s very emotional.</span> <span id="s326">You know, all of my friends have the same -- basically the same experience, not exactly the same because all of them was different places.</span> <span id="s327">Everybody knew about it, but just to say my experience, you know, as it is happen, going all over it, you know, it is -- it’s -- it is the first time.</span> <span id="s328">We’re talking about episodes, you know, with my husband, and my friend, but not -- not the whole, you know, not -- not all the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s329">It is a little emotional, what can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And you did write about your experiences at one point.</span> <span id="s331">Was that emotional, very emotional to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes, but not -- not as telling.</span> <span id="s333">You know, I ne -- when I -- ma -- when my daughter was small, I always refused to tell her anything, because I wanted to grow -- to her -- to grow up, you know, without any handicap, how they say it, you know?</span> <span id="s334">But I don’t have to tell her because she picked up here and there, and she know -- she knew the whole thing.</span> <span id="s335">And now when my -- ask my grandmother -- granddaughter to type it for me, you know, and I was dictate it to her, it was the first time to her, too, to hear it.</span> <span id="s336">And I saw, you know, she was -- wasn’t even look up, she just tried to, you know, how you say, on the -- you know, it -- it -- I can tell that she was very, you know, affected by it, as my -- you know, in my opinion, later on the day that the second generation, li-like my daughter, was affected indirectly, I was the same as we [indecipherable] we went through.</span> <span id="s337">My daughter is a very smart girl, but she never ask me, and I never tell her anything.</span> <span id="s338">And now, when it was typed on, I ask her, you want a copy?</span> <span id="s339">She said no.</span> <span id="s340">Save it for -- somewhere, maybe somewheres, I know everything.</span> <span id="s341">And she does.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Now why -- why do you think you were ready to talk now?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I tell you what, three years ago, as I said, Frank called me up, she saw ma -- you know, when -- how could I go from where I started in -- in Debrecen to -- you know, to go that collecting camp, it’s call -- called Sharvar.</span> <span id="s344">It’s a big, big distance.</span> <span id="s345">And I told him over the phone, you know, just what happened, and he said why don’t you let them, you know, tape it down.</span> <span id="s346">I said I do not go through it again.</span> <span id="s347">I -- I -- it just too -- it would be too much, and I wasn't even want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s348">But later on my grandchildren ask -- was asking, you know, me questions.</span> <span id="s349">They went to the movie, they read in books, you know, and they were asking me my experience, and then I started to think that it time to tell them.</span> <span id="s350">I don’t think, you know, I never saw that movies, I never go to see the movies, not because it’s affecting me, I don’t think it’s -- it’s just a movie.</span> <span id="s351">They -- it can’t be the same.</span> <span id="s352">It’s no offense [indecipherable] but I don’t think anybody can understand, only people who was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: How often do your memories come up of those days?</span> <span id="s354">Is it frequent, is it every day?</span> <span id="s355">How often?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: You know what, since I mentioned to you we came to -- coming together with people, friends, since [indecipherable] here specially, all of them si -- most of them survivor.</span> <span id="s357">Some of them was hiding, but most of them survivor.</span> <span id="s358">It was unavoidable that w -- you know, is not come up, some ways, with some -- with -- you know, with -- we always -- some of them [indecipherable] not always the tragic way, you know, just as a fact, that’s what it happened, that’s -- and we went -- we went, you know, over it, and so it almost a -- you know what?</span> <span id="s359">I think that people who went through on this, they could be a millionaire, or a worker, or whatever, it’s impossible that their life wasn’t affected if they went through, in some way.</span> <span id="s360">I don’t think it’s -- you know, money could make it easier for anybody.</span> <span id="s361">And, is a tragedy if, you know, people will forget.</span> <span id="s362">And they does, sometimes.</span> <span id="s363">I have a problem in my [indecipherable] you know, and I seeing a doctor regularly.</span> <span id="s364">She’s a -- he’s a real nice man, and a very good doctor, and [indecipherable] he was a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s365">And he -- he knew what we are survivors, so as he is talking about that he is, you know, [indecipherable] and so on, and what terrible thing was it, as it -- unspeakable and so on.</span> <span id="s366">And after the [indecipherable] when, you know, what happened, after that I saw him, and he said it’s a terrible thing what happened here, which I agree.</span> <span id="s367">They just came, they don’t care if they die, and killed -- drive away, 6,000 people is -- is just -- he said, you know, what you went through, the Holocaust was a terrible thing, but it was worse.</span> <span id="s368">I said -- I didn’t say nothing, because he is a very nice man.</span> <span id="s369">But this time they killed 6,000 people, and you know, we are still in shock because we like that country.</span> <span id="s370">But they -- Hitler killed six million people, and I don’t think it -- if even, you know, they can compare.</span> <span id="s371">I don’t know what will happen here in the future.</span> <span id="s372">As I said, you know, we -- we like that country, you know?</span> <span id="s373">We are -- I must say we have a -- we worked -- we let -- they let us work here, they never ask we -- you are Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s374">We got job, we let the -- my daughter, you know send to school, and my granddaughters.</span> <span id="s375">This is a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s376">And what happened is terrible, but I don’t think it -- it’s -- you know, it’s comparable what happened then.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: So now let’s -- let’s try to go back to what we were talking about, you were still telling me about the early moments of German occupation, and I was wondering, just so we make sure and get your chronology right, if you could explain how long you lived with your grandmother, and -- and where you went after you moved from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s379">She passed away 1941, and I went to live with my relatives in Debrecen, so I’m -- the other city, so I lived there approximately three years.</span> <span id="s380">So it was 1944 when the, you know, when the German came in and changed everything.</span> <span id="s381">The -- the -- in that three years I was, you know, studying -- I mean, start to learn cosmetic.</span> <span id="s382">It was a relatively very busy place, and it was nice.</span> <span id="s383">They were nice people over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And how old were you when the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s386">17.</span> <span id="s387">I became 18 in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So now, before you left Debrecen, what -- what were you doing, and what was it like with the Germans around?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, I wasn’t with them that time too mu -- too long time, because, as I said, we were preparing to leave, and we -- you know, constantly were talking about it at their house, and planning, and we had to wait until the papers are ready, which was supposed to be very good papers, but it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s390">We -- we don’t have to use it.</span> <span id="s391">And we -- we were talking about the -- the distance, I mean, that time, your situation every day new and new, you know, law came out against, you know, against the Jews, the Jewish business, you know, they take over th-the business.</span> <span id="s392">And they were planning the -- to, you know [indecipherable] of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s393">They said which -- from which part of the city will, you know, will extended, you know?</span> <span id="s394">There was a li -- ha -- the limit there.</span> <span id="s395">And happens to be my -- my relative’s house, you know, it was right there.</span> <span id="s396">So they had to take different people in their [indecipherable] you know, their -- their place.</span> <span id="s397">By that time I wasn’t there already.</span> <span id="s398">When I came back from the camp, I went over there.</span> <span id="s399">It was some -- nobody was there in the apartment, and I went down the basement, you know, looking for some paper or something she’s left, I find nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: That’s in your family’s home?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: It was, you know, for a few years.</span> <span id="s402">The first time when I got back from the camp, I went to Nyíregyháza where I came from.</span> <span id="s403">I have a very extended family, cousins and aunts and uncles, lot of them, you know.</span> <span id="s404">Nobody was there, nobody, not a soul.</span> <span id="s405">Then I went back to Debrecen because I heard that time that some of the people went to Austria, so there are more chance to meet, you know, maybe friend or somebody.</span> <span id="s406">But in the meantime in Auschwitz, you know -- I don’t know, I’m going back and forth.</span> <span id="s407">If you want me to continue, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Yeah, well let’s -- let’s go in an -- the order of how things happened.</span> <span id="s409">So -- so you were preparing to leave with these false papers, and you got these false papers through a friend of yours, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Through that boy who was a -- you know, fleeing from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s411">So we went to Szeged, to the city, to the second largest city in Hungary.</span> <span id="s412">As I said, we rented a room, and we moved there.</span> <span id="s413">And for a few weeks we don’t have any problem, the woman was very nice to us, you know, because we said we was -- you know, we came from the bombardment.</span> <span id="s414">And -- but later on they started to bombard the Szeged, the big city, and everybody has to go and went down to the shelter.</span> <span id="s415">And we were afraid to go down, you know, we were afraid to from the [indecipherable], we were not ready, you know -- you know, maybe say something, or turn out to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s416">And we decided not to go down.</span> <span id="s417">We thought it’s less dangerous than go down.</span> <span id="s418">But later on they start to tell our landlady why these young girl not coming down and so on.</span> <span id="s419">So we decided that we going [indecipherable] to Budapest.</span> <span id="s420">It’s a big city and we, you know, somewhere, get around.</span> <span id="s421">And we traveled safely, but when we got down there was a big police quota, pick up the Jews, you know?</span> <span id="s422">With the yellow star too, was traveling.</span> <span id="s423">And they pick u-us too, and when they saw the paper, you know, it was brand new do -- you know, and we were very nervous probably.</span> <span id="s424">They find out, they ask question and yes, so they took a -- took us to the police station with a lo -- with all of the Jews, you know, who were wearing stars or not wearing stars.</span> <span id="s425">And when we got there, the police -- chief wa -- chief of the police said we will get one week from the -- that place, the [indecipherable], and after that we will go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s426">But after more than one week, you know, went by, and more and more people came to that place, or was taken to that place.</span> <span id="s427">In fact, my friend, her name was Ava, find a lady who was traveling to Budapest to her daughter, gave birth to a first grandchild.</span> <span id="s428">Her husband was already in forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s429">And he was very nice, you know, to a young girl.</span> <span id="s430">It was a terrible experience, it was a [indecipherable] room, a [indecipherable] crowded room with all different kind of people beside the Jews, you know?</span> <span id="s431">And I think [indecipherable] the toilet was in the middle of the room, without any wall or nothing.</span> <span id="s432">It was the first, you know, demonizing experience.</span> <span id="s433">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Wa -- what was your -- what was your name on the false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Elizabeth [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s436">And Ava was Julia -- Julian [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: And so the two of you --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: It’s a Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And the two of you were already very close by now.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Close friends, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yeah, close friends, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And you helped each other a lot during this, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: We tried to help each other, the fact that we were not alone, first of all, we were friend, we were not alone, you know, we belong together.</span> <span id="s445">Sp -- and specially came this lady who was a -- you know, some friend of her mother, and she was about 45 years old and a very nice lady.</span> <span id="s446">In fact, that time she told us that we left her place -- she was a [indecipherable], and he said her treasure, how -- how you say that, jewelry and everything, you know, where he get, you know, ex -- exactly explain it to us in case something happen to her that we tell her daughter whatever -- which is happen later on.</span> <span id="s447">And we went together too from there, after a few weeks.</span> <span id="s448">We were sad we were taken in a different camp.</span> <span id="s449">And we were -- we were walking to the ra -- the station and it was a big camp.</span> <span id="s450">A kapo was there who was the manager, I don’t know what was there before, but we knew that before that it just -- it was a collecting camp.</span> <span id="s451">Not only that one, we know there are two more of us in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: And what was it called?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Sharvar.</span> <span id="s454">It was very far from my original, you know, city, Nyíregyháza, other side of the country.</span> <span id="s455">And we were, you know, we have a little -- we felt a little bit better there because we could, you know, put some curtain up and wash ourself, our -- we have the toilet, you know.</span> <span id="s456">I don’t know how many people was there, but at least there was a toilet.</span> <span id="s457">And we were waiting what will happen, we -- we thought something will happen, you know, we can’t be here forever.</span> <span id="s458">And aft -- we stayed there at least a month.</span> <span id="s459">Oh, and that place, it was under -- the police [indecipherable] was standing under the -- it was a so called gerdarmes?</span> <span id="s460">You know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Gendarmes?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Gen -- yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s463">They are very [indecipherable] you know, they don’t tell us anything, you know, whatever we asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: What kind of confrontations do you remember having, either when the Germans had occupied, or the police along the way?</span> <span id="s465">Was that very frightening to you?</span> <span id="s466">Do you have confrontations directly with these sort of police types, or soldiers, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Not really personally, no.</span> <span id="s468">No.</span> <span id="s469">We were a crowd, you know.</span> <span id="s470">It was just -- we were no -- when we got to Sharvar already, I -- the -- the camp, we felt like, you know, they were -- we were not treated like a person, just like a number or something, you know?</span> <span id="s471">Nobody talked to us, we don’t know what will happen.</span> <span id="s472">We can get questioned.</span> <span id="s473">At the door was th-this gendares, you know?</span> <span id="s474">And we were there at least a month when they came, the manager, or -- I don’t know how you call him, and told us that we’re taken now for a different camp, and it will take a few days, and there -- there was a counting over there in that -- in Sharvar.</span> <span id="s475">Everybody who has money can buy some food for the road.</span> <span id="s476">And every time it was some change we were glad, maybe this time we will have a chance to talk to somebody, we know what will happen to us, you know?</span> <span id="s477">And when we got to the station -- from that we were walking, and we got -- and we got to the station, there were cattle wagons all over, and there were SS standing at the door.</span> <span id="s478">And very fast they put as much as they can in one wagon.</span> <span id="s479">We had hardly any space to sta -- sit like this.</span> <span id="s480">We were sitting on the floor, on the -- our legs.</span> <span id="s481">It was really crowded, and they put the two pails in it, you know, one for toilet, one for we -- water.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: They put two what -- pots, you mean, or wa -- or pail, pail.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s484">And naturally the water never was enough.</span> <span id="s485">We were not hungry, we were always very, very thirsty.</span> <span id="s486">Sometimes when we went, the wagon -- the trains da -- stopped for some reason, and peasant women was all around, and gave us some water, and they changed another woman, the SS changed the pails.</span> <span id="s487">And we continue.</span> <span id="s488">We -- we went through beautiful area.</span> <span id="s489">We -- I heard a place, you know, like a [indecipherable] but I heard a place before, and you know, we looked out with this small window, and somebody recognized the place, it’s called -- I don’t know how you call it English, in Hungarian mogo shtatra.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: What did it look like?</span> <span id="s491">It was some sort of beautiful scenery, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Beautiful scenery with the mountains.</span> <span id="s493">It was a -- a resort area before -- I heard that, you know, it was la-later on, too.</span> <span id="s494">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s495">So we -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: And so you knew a little bit about the direction that the train was going in?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yeah, we -- we went through this one.</span> <span id="s498">I just remember this one, you know?</span> <span id="s499">This is the Czechoslovakia, I think now.</span> <span id="s500">There are some area which sometimes belong to Hungary, sometimes to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s501">This -- this time it was Czechoslovakia, and -- and I think still it is.</span> <span id="s502">And we went a few days when the s -- when the train stopped.</span> <span id="s503">And we looked out, and we saw, you know, the barracks, with barbed wires all over it.</span> <span id="s504">And when they opened the door, a lot of SS soldier, and yelling to us, get out, schnell, schnell, out.</span> <span id="s505">And everybody keep the small thing what they had, you know, package, because they -- it will send after us.</span> <span id="s506">We knew that this can’t happen, there was na -- no name on it, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: What did you have with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Maybe one sweater, or -- of -- when I was in the [indecipherable] house, I had a cousin in Budapest, and you cou -- [indecipherable] up and came in, and I gaved her everything.</span> <span id="s509">So is everybody else.</span> <span id="s510">This a na -- this lady [indecipherable], who called [indecipherable], she called her daughter, they came.</span> <span id="s511">She gave her the package, and pocketbook, or whatever.</span> <span id="s512">So we left just, you know, what was on us, a sweater, or whatever, not much and some food.</span> <span id="s513">But we [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: And you were wearing a Jewish star again, right?</span> <span id="s515">You were forced to, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I don’t think so, no, no.</span> <span id="s517">They know we are Jewish now, on that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And you were on this transport with now both of the women that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Oh, with everybody, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: I mean, well th -- with your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: With my friends, and that [indecipherable] and the -- all of the ra -- rest of the people I don’t know.</span> <span id="s522">The rest of the people I don’t know, and they were the one who were taken to the concentration camp -- I mean the death camp, the Hungarian camp.</span> <span id="s523">And before the [indecipherable] you know, we went together, that’s -- as much as they can put that together and deliver it to the station and the wagons.</span> <span id="s524">So it -- I didn’t know anybody else beside [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: How long was the journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: It’s -- I can’t imagine, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s527">It was days, maybe a week, maybe less.</span> <span id="s528">Sometimes we stopped for different reason, to change the [indecipherable] beside it, I don’t know why they stopped the -- stopped the wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: What did you -- what did you talk about during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: It was really sad.</span> <span id="s531">It was -- we -- we -- we were very uncomfortable, I don’t have to tell it.</span> <span id="s532">We can’t sleep, we can’t eat, we were thirsty and naturally everybody had to use that toilet, very har -- it was -- it was terrible smell, terrible smell because of the toilet and because of the people, you know, [indecipherable] you know, putting together.</span> <span id="s533">It was a terrible, terrible smell.</span> <span id="s534">So, it wasn’t a -- I don’t even know where we going.</span> <span id="s535">We just think that time it was somehow so hopeless.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s538">We couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s539">We had some food, you know.</span> <span id="s540">But as I remember back, everybody was very, very thirsty, and a -- we have -- we could -- we were thought that everybody can drink only three sip from the pail, you know, that went from one to another.</span> <span id="s541">It was -- it was not much, you know, so I don’t know if we can even think, it was just a very sad and desperate situation.</span> <span id="s542">I remember a baby with a -- excuse me, you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: She was a very small baby and she fe -- she [indecipherable] her in the wagon.</span> <span id="s545">Sometimes I remember faces, but I think I made the remark about that it -- I don’t think anybody could -- a-at least not too many people came back from that wagon.</span> <span id="s546">Not the baby with the mother, not the old men.</span> <span id="s547">Not the [indecipherable] who we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Were people praying?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I remember that old man I mentioned, every mor -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Edith Csengeri, conducted by Amy Rubin on October 30th, 2001, in Great Neck, New York.</span> <span id="s551">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s552">So maybe you could just finish telling me your memory of this man, this older man who was praying every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: He was praying every morning, and when I, you know, thinking back, that’s sad that maybe this affected me that much that I am not religious any more.</span> <span id="s554">He was praying to who?</span> <span id="s555">And hundred percent that he was -- went right away to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: He was an older man?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: He was an older man.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Did religion have a real role for you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, I -- no, nothing.</span> <span id="s560">I don’t think -- even think about religion, neither one of us.</span> <span id="s561">We just, you know, couldn’t believe it, especially after that you know, we couldn’t believe it, what happened.</span> <span id="s562">It wasn’t real.</span> <span id="s563">And when we stopped finally, and the SS soldiers, you know, start yelling us, everybody schnell, schnell, everybody get out in one line, one after the other, and I remember the front of us was this Alma, Namey we called her.</span> <span id="s564">Namey means Aunt Alma.</span> <span id="s565">And then, you know, my friend and me, and the front of the line there was this German so -- not German how you call -- officer, Mengele, we didn't know that.</span> <span id="s566">And we saw that the younger people go one side, the oth -- the older people with children go to other side.</span> <span id="s567">So that time we thought this the [indecipherable] working people and older one on the -- the child -- mother with children, you know.</span> <span id="s568">They put in -- in different place.</span> <span id="s569">So we were talking about it, as soon -- you know, slowly as we went, and ish -- we knew that is better maybe, for us, do -- working for them.</span> <span id="s570">And when we reached this [indecipherable] I mean, officer, he was looking on [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s571">She wasn’t more than 45, but she has grayish hair and long shoes, you know, for the traveling, she was wearing.</span> <span id="s572">And she to -- y-you know, waved her to go this side.</span> <span id="s573">And she knew that is not a good thing going with the older, and the ki -- and the kids.</span> <span id="s574">And she was speaking in German, and she -- she told him, [indecipherable] I can work, I am able to work.</span> <span id="s575">And she look at him, and -- you know.</span> <span id="s576">She was in that -- he [indecipherable] her again that go that side.</span> <span id="s577">I remember I looked at her, you know.</span> <span id="s578">He went -- she went like this, like somebody she knew that it doesn’t, you know, it’s not good what will happen to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Did you have a chance to say good-bye at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: No, it was just, you know, a matter of second.</span> <span id="s581">Later on her daughter visited me, came to Debrecen, because I-I send a message that I was with her mother, and you know, I told her really that she find a thing what she told us.</span> <span id="s582">And after that, her father -- her husband came too.</span> <span id="s583">She asked me to go to the rabbi and make a statement that I saw her to go to the other side.</span> <span id="s584">She wanted to get married, it was very shortly after the thing.</span> <span id="s585">So I went to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s586">He send me a big bucket of flowers, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: So when you arrived, first of all, you knew German, right?</span> <span id="s588">You could understand, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Not really, I si -- I study German in the school, in the high school, you know, but it wasn't much.</span> <span id="s590">It wasn’t much.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you have to pick up much more while you were there, while you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No, beca -- in the camp?</span> <span id="s593">No, because all of the people around me, it was, you know mostly Jewish -- maybe they spe -- spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s594">Unfortunately Hungarian Jew very rarely speak Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So what were the languages you knew?</span> <span id="s596">Hungarian --</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Hungarian.</span> <span id="s598">And when I got to the camp finally, [indecipherable] I lefting out some -- how I got there -- anyway, I find out that the people from Nyíregyháza, my original city where I was born, all of them th -- one lager, in the same -- it was the C lager, in one barracks.</span> <span id="s599">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: So I have -- I just want to make sure I understand where you were.</span> <span id="s601">So there’s a couple maps here of -- of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: You -- and I thought I’d ask you just to -- of course, this is -- you know, it’s considered that there are three separate areas, Birkenau --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: -- Auschwitz one, Monowice, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: We were here, Auschwitz-Birkenau, I was here.</span> <span id="s607">Who made this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: This is from “Encyclopedia of the Holocaust.”</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Oh, I see, okay.</span> <span id="s610">We b -- I been here, Birkenau-Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s611">I never saw the big town.</span> <span id="s612">Here’s the station, you see?</span> <span id="s613">This was a camp, supposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: And in this page it shows -- this is actually -- and -- and when did you arrive to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Exact date?</span> <span id="s616">I’m not sure, you know, because we been in Sharv -- we been first at the -- the [indecipherable] house, then Sharvar -- about a week, in Sharvar about maybe four weeks.</span> <span id="s617">So it could be May, around May.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So this map is a plan of Birkenau in late October of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I was in [indecipherable] until October --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So I don’t know if you recognize anything here.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: You know what?</span> <span id="s622">I was spending time almost all the barracks, because as -- you know, the selecting of people, Mengele, every day, we always stay behind.</span> <span id="s623">We went through -- from barracks to barracks, finding out.</span> <span id="s624">This is the -- we have a [indecipherable] there, you know, and the -- it wasn’t regular toilet, it was call -- so-called -- I don’t know how to say English, latrina?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: The latrine.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: That’s the [indecipherable] here.</span> <span id="s629">This is the -- which lager is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: This says --</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: I was in the si -- la -- C, lager C. Behind us there were the B. I -- I -- I remember, it was here, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Now these, for instance, these say -- in fact there’s one here that says, Hungarian women’s camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah, that was it, yeah, where is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: This says B two -- the Roman numeral letter two and then C.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: The C. I was in the lager C. I was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: This is B two, and I guess somewhere in here would be the letter --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: The whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: The C?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: See, right here?</span> <span id="s643">B two A, B two B, B two C.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, I was here.</span> <span id="s645">I was here somewhere, la -- lager C.</span> <span id="s646">In fact, they called the lager C the farnichtenslager, you know, because everybody either went for work, or the rest of them went to the camp -- I mean, the gas.</span> <span id="s647">So -- I don’t know about wa -- oh, when we arrive, I like to go back there.</span> <span id="s648">We went in stripe uniform or what -- I don’t know how to call it, men took us over.</span> <span id="s649">Then we went for awhile, and ja -- and Polish woman took us over, and I was told get the -- undress, everybody.</span> <span id="s650">And the men was walking around us, you know?</span> <span id="s651">They don’t pay any attention to us anyway.</span> <span id="s652">They were very, very rude to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Are these --</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Later --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Are these the SS at this point, or are these --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: No, they are the ja -- and -- later I understand, you know, because they were there three, four years already in the camp before we got there.</span> <span id="s657">Hitler occupied Hungary that -- for the last country, and they -- we were told several times, the Hungarian ladies, they were, you know, at home in the -- comfortable and nice when we were already here.</span> <span id="s658">And as I understand later that these people has to put their own family to the gas chamber and the cremat -- crematorium.</span> <span id="s659">So when we got there already, they were not human being.</span> <span id="s660">At first this was shocking you know, when they yell at us, and sometimes they slapped people on the face, and they very rude.</span> <span id="s661">But later on I thought I’m not surprised they -- I’m not human being any more.</span> <span id="s662">They were not human being any more.</span> <span id="s663">They were survive -- few, not too many, but they paid the price.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Were there lots of conflicts between one group of prisoners and another group from one country to the next, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Like -- between us?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Yeah, were there --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: The hu -- no, it wasn’t, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: From wa -- from Hungarian, you know, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Not only that, you know.</span> <span id="s670">When we finally get to C lager, after you know, the certain procedure what they did for us, what we got for -- for -- let’s see, for breakfast, a big plate, was black coffee, which was medicated already.</span> <span id="s671">And we constantly sleeping, so it was one reason nobody was fighting.</span> <span id="s672">The other -- and we realized was we saw me-medication in it, because the women stopped menstruating, you know?</span> <span id="s673">But it was when we got the borax already.</span> <span id="s674">Before that, you know, we had to -- you want me to go back?</span> <span id="s675">The -- he -- they told us to get undressed, and one woman cut all the hair on your -- all -- all of the body.</span> <span id="s676">And they -- we got some disinfectant on our body, and everybody got some piece of dress, it wasn’t a dress, sometimes a skirt or a blouse, or whatever, it’s fits, not fits.</span> <span id="s677">And most of the time it not -- doesn’t fit.</span> <span id="s678">And finally we were tol -- we were, you know, put in a line again, but I remember back at that time -- I couldn't even think.</span> <span id="s679">I was like a -- foggy, you know?</span> <span id="s680">It couldn’t happen.</span> <span id="s681">I couldn’t believe it, what happening, you know?</span> <span id="s682">I -- it was just unreal.</span> <span id="s683">So we went to the barracks, and everybody was told to climb up, it was wooden barracks, wooden bunk bed.</span> <span id="s684">Five people up, five people down.</span> <span id="s685">And we climb up and we -- we just [indecipherable] thing to sleep, they were so tired.</span> <span id="s686">But the thing was, if somebody want to turn, everybody has to turn.</span> <span id="s687">And, you know, like -- like a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s688">And in the morning when we were given coffee, we were told to go and sit down in one line, and the front of us, the first one, got the big dish with black coffee.</span> <span id="s689">And he di -- he d -- he was told, drink a few, drink and give it back until it went all the way.</span> <span id="s690">At first it was terrible, you know, drinking after so many people.</span> <span id="s691">But it wasn’t later, we don’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: How many people were you around at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: You mean the whole barracks?</span> <span id="s694">As I remember correctly, it was 800, a thousand people in one barrack -- barracks.</span> <span id="s695">Maybe I’m wrong, but I think that was the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Were you still next to your friend, were you able to stay with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes, yeah, I was with my friend, and three other people, and it was little, we thought, maybe better the other place, so we went -- nobody cared, we went from barracks to barracks to try out.</span> <span id="s698">But during the day we were sleeping constantly.</span> <span id="s699">That was the only time we could sleep [indecipherable] on the floor out -- outside, because on the bunkbed, you know, it was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: What were you eating each day?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: We got in the morning black coffee and some kind of soup for lunchtime, I think.</span> <span id="s702">And at night -- first we -- at the morning, s-standing appelle.</span> <span id="s703">You probably heard about it.</span> <span id="s704">The lageralteste came and counted with her [indecipherable], and then the SS came and counted us, and naturally, it n -- it never s -- never was all right, the number never was all right.</span> <span id="s705">So they started again, it takes hours.</span> <span id="s706">And we thought, and is probably true, it was one kind of torture.</span> <span id="s707">You standing there on the sun, or -- or rain, or whatever.</span> <span id="s708">And the same thing happened at night, too.</span> <span id="s709">And when we standing in the appelle at night, we got a piece of bread, and something went into the piece of [indecipherable] it’s cheese or something.</span> <span id="s710">Was piece of salami [indecipherable] probably, I don’t know what was it.</span> <span id="s711">Most of the people make very small slices, you know?</span> <span id="s712">They make it for the whole day, like paper, try to make it.</span> <span id="s713">And me and my friend we eat it at -- right away.</span> <span id="s714">We thought maybe we feel like eat something -- eat something.</span> <span id="s715">And then I went to visit my friend I mentioned before on the lager, where the Nyíregyháza, you know, most of the people, all of the people of -- from Nyíregyháza.</span> <span id="s716">I find a cousin there, and she had a -- about 13 - 14 years a daughter with her.</span> <span id="s717">They survived.</span> <span id="s718">They came home.</span> <span id="s719">Unfortunately my cousin, after a few years, passed away in cancer.</span> <span id="s720">And the girl who was with her, still in Nyíregyháza, I ha -- I never saw her since then, alone, completely alone.</span> <span id="s721">She got married, but she lost her husband and sh -- first she lost her mother at home.</span> <span id="s722">And she’s completely all alone, and sh-she is not even healthy.</span> <span id="s723">She’s a heart trouble, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: How -- how did you -- how did you make it through each of these days there?</span> <span id="s725">I mean, what were you thinking and how did you approach that?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Every day came Mengele to select people for work, and we always hoping, my Ava and me, to go, you know, to -- we were hoping that he select us, because you know, the rumor was that [indecipherable] stay here, going to the gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: How much were you hearing about the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: A lot, almost every day.</span> <span id="s729">We can see the smoke, you know, we can see this, you can smell this, you know, odor, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s730">And we were reminded by the lageralteste this -- you will go over there, where to see where your parents and relatives are.</span> <span id="s731">They don’t -- they don’t care any more, because you know, they went through.</span> <span id="s732">You know, it was first unbelievable for us to -- I thought he just -- she just talking, but she wasn’t talking.</span> <span id="s733">And we always left behind because Mengele came every day, we were very, very skinny, both of us.</span> <span id="s734">17 years old, on [indecipherable] was hungry and -- and he selected us, you know, send back always.</span> <span id="s735">So it happened one time that -- there was a so-called child lager, child oc -- they were put over there, I don’t know what is, and l-later they disappeared.</span> <span id="s736">And it was empty, and that day Mengele came and selected a group, and for some reason, I never know why, they put the older people in that barrack and we find out that they coming for it the following day.</span> <span id="s737">But this time they said, as always, he separated friends, or sisters, or mother and child, or whatever.</span> <span id="s738">And they were crying and begging her to stay there.</span> <span id="s739">They rather stay there than going away and left them.</span> <span id="s740">But o -- of course it was nothing to him.</span> <span id="s741">So during the night, at least one-third of the people fled somewhere.</span> <span id="s742">They were locked in and lageralteste all over, and they somehow got out.</span> <span id="s743">Windows, and -- you know, they don’t care if they beating them, or what.</span> <span id="s744">They get out.</span> <span id="s745">And they -- we saw the, you know, the problem what the lageralteste has.</span> <span id="s746">They had to have the number to -- the -- the right number.</span> <span id="s747">So my friend and me, and a lot of other people run in, you know?</span> <span id="s748">We were even more than it needed, and they li -- they put out -- after they got the -- counted, they put out the -- which are not -- don’t needed, to the [indecipherable] and we s -- we stay inside.</span> <span id="s749">Can I stop [indecipherable] [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: All right, so we’re back again, and so we’re talking more about Auschwitz and the time you spent there, and first can you just tell me the period of time, the length of time you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: It was probably from May to October.</span> <span id="s752">October, it was, you know, four already, and at least three-quarter of the lager, the camp C lager, was out already.</span> <span id="s753">We were just the so-called leftovers.</span> <span id="s754">And for awhile seemed to us it’s hopeless, but as I mention before, it happen that a selected group was staying in a -- was locked for the night in a former chi -- children barracks.</span> <span id="s755">And you know, some people run out, and we went, you know, we thought, with my friend Ava to try to get in.</span> <span id="s756">And we were successful for awhile.</span> <span id="s757">It was a following day Mengele came, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: An-And did you at this time when you were there, did you know his name?</span> <span id="s759">Had you --</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Mengele, yes.</span> <span id="s761">Mengele we knew already.</span> <span id="s762">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: It wasn’t -- it wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: He was a very handsome man.</span> <span id="s765">Looking back, I wouldn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s766">Very handsome, very good looking.</span> <span id="s767">And ha -- very mean.</span> <span id="s768">I mean that.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Did you have like direct interaction with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Not personally, but every selection, almost every day, you know, we saw him -- a saw us, and you know, selected our -- our -- us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Did you speak with him at any point?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So you were saying -- so he -- he came --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: He came, but that time he was just interested about the numbers, you know, that the number is the same.</span> <span id="s775">But my friend Ava has a lot of bug bite on her stomach, and you know, she -- it was itchy, and it was bloody.</span> <span id="s776">And she hi -- he notice right away, so he put her aside -- put him aside.</span> <span id="s777">And we were taken out very fast, so the [indecipherable] was okay, so we taken off very fast.</span> <span id="s778">We are taken to the lager B.</span> <span id="s779">We didn’t know that time that that is the crematorium or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s780">And we were put in a barrack -- barrack, and later I find out that Ava, -- that was informally in the B lager -- B lager, and she was taken there, too, to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s781">Later, somebody saw her in berge -- Bergen-Belsen, so evidently she was taken from there too.</span> <span id="s782">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: And do you know if she survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: No, she’s not.</span> <span id="s785">She’s not.</span> <span id="s786">I went back to the city, I met with her parents and I live with them [indecipherable] parents, I waited for hi -- her to come back.</span> <span id="s787">And she was very friendly before we left with the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s788">She came back after the liberation looking for her.</span> <span id="s789">I was corresponding with him, but he was -- he [indecipherable] find out that he is there or not.</span> <span id="s790">Anyway, I’m going back to the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: So did the two of you get a chance to say good-bye, even?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Not good-bye, I met her once more.</span> <span id="s793">When we were in that barrack, we were closed in in the bay -- B lager, lager B. And this time everybody was very careful, even the haftlings, you know?</span> <span id="s794">Nobody can -- got in or out because everybody want to get out from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s795">We thought -- and we -- we were told that we going for work.</span> <span id="s796">So it was impossible to get in.</span> <span id="s797">So some day Ava heard about it we are there [indecipherable] and came to the window.</span> <span id="s798">And we are talking, and right away, you know, that was around us, that -- because I ask, you know, maybe she can come in over the window, it was y -- no, they said no, not really, no, they don’t let her in.</span> <span id="s799">But it wasn’t a good-bye because we knew that -- we didn’t know that time which day we are going, maybe she will come back again, but she never did.</span> <span id="s800">That was the last time I saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: When you -- even -- even before this point when you’ve been -- when you were in Auschwitz, did you have a lot of fear about being sent to the crematorium?</span> <span id="s802">Did you think --</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Not really, no, no.</span> <span id="s804">First of all we took -- the first time, and later on, for awhile, we couldn’t believe it, you know, we couldn’t believe it, but the lageralteste told us.</span> <span id="s805">She was very mean, and she was right, you know?</span> <span id="s806">It was -- I didn’t mention we were standing in the appelle, staying up, a -- and one of the girls start to saying her favorite recipe, a food, and everybody was listening, enjoying it, everybody has different recipe, and we enjoyed it, you know, that we spend time with this cooking.</span> <span id="s807">And one time, or more than one time, the lageralteste came, and he said, don’t plan, you will go there while your parents [indecipherable] they were -- we were reminded constantly by them.</span> <span id="s808">And specially remember a gir -- girl, a lageralteste, he was a Czech origin.</span> <span id="s809">Her name was Vera Fisher, a large, heavy-set woman with a very bad complexion.</span> <span id="s810">She was very mean.</span> <span id="s811">She was -- she was nothing to sl -- you know, slap somebody on the face or kick her, whatever.</span> <span id="s812">And she was speaking Hungarian, you know, because the -- most of the Czech at -- at the border, you know, is Hungarian Czech or Slovakia’s neighbors.</span> <span id="s813">So wa -- she was said -- spre -- speaking very well Hungarian.</span> <span id="s814">She was the meanest.</span> <span id="s815">There’s the only one who I remember by name and by face, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What were some of the things that she did that really bothered you, disturbed you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Nothing really.</span> <span id="s818">She was just -- she was just a mean person, you know?</span> <span id="s819">She was there for years [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: And you felt that she just wasn’t even sensitive any more to --</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: -- to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: No, definitely not.</span> <span id="s824">As I said before, they were not human being any more Amy, no, not even close.</span> <span id="s825">And I understand why not.</span> <span id="s826">It was terrible what they went through.</span> <span id="s827">Not just what we went through, but before us, they were the one who put their parents and -- and families in the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So how did you pass time during those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: In -- in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: First of all we were sleeping during the day, because we couldn’t sleep at night, you know, we were so crowded together, and during the day we just went one spot and lay down and sleep.</span> <span id="s832">But we don’t have too much time because we -- at the morning we were standing appelle for hours, on the -- around, you know, four, five o’clock, I don’t remember exactly what time, we started again, you know?</span> <span id="s833">So we went to the -- we went to the -- there was a bath over there, we could wash.</span> <span id="s834">Not every lager, the C lager happens to be -- has a bath.</span> <span id="s835">We have enough water.</span> <span id="s836">They mention to me, my friends, one of the B lager, they don’t have enough water, they were delivering the water to them.</span> <span id="s837">And yes, I remember once when I was -- Ava and me standing in appelle, the other three girls, was three sisters who I know from Nyíregyháza, we were very good friend one -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Edith Csengeri.</span> <span id="s839">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s840">So you can continue telling me the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: As I said, there were th-three sisters, and one of my was very good friend who w-we both belong to the same organization, a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s842">Anyway, we later -- they -- we were standing five of us, and always the -- one of the sister get at the front.</span> <span id="s843">First we don’t realize what happening, then they -- here was the bread, and the piece of water, what they gave us, to us.</span> <span id="s844">They always choosed -- it wasn’t cut exactly the same, but every bite was counted, you know?</span> <span id="s845">So we realized finally, all -- we always getting the smaller one.</span> <span id="s846">So after awhile we went to somewhere to stand, you know?</span> <span id="s847">It was a small episode, but I remember back -- didn’t -- they didn’t come back, either of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Do you feel like, you know, the women you were around, was it mostly that you were -- all were helping each other, or was it just too hard to even help each other through each day?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: You know, that was a new meaning the lag -- lager sisters.</span> <span id="s850">And one of -- no, a few groups, you know, went together, especially was working for me at the slave labor camp, were three of us, very close, you know, we were helping each other in every way.</span> <span id="s851">We watch each other, you know, that he is okay, she is okay.</span> <span id="s852">And yes, there was.</span> <span id="s853">In Auschwitz, you know, there sometimes, by accident, like my cousin and daughter, they took her there, you know, they were together.</span> <span id="s854">Or sisters, like my friends, these sisters.</span> <span id="s855">So it means a lot, you know, it’s -- it’s means life, too, because one of them was, you know, something happening with one of them, that was helping hand right away.</span> <span id="s856">If not real sisters, you know, as we called there the lager sisters.</span> <span id="s857">It was -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: And what did you talk about together during the days?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Probably as ever, food.</span> <span id="s860">Most of that time.</span> <span id="s861">I remember in the slave labor camp, av -- one of the girl was sitting with me who was my lager sister, and she was a married woman, a young married woman, and she was telling me her life story constantly.</span> <span id="s862">She has [indecipherable] and I enjoyed it, you know?</span> <span id="s863">E -- do -- did the work and she was talking, that she was married, but not the real love of her -- his life, a other one, so on.</span> <span id="s864">And in the slave labor ca -- I -- slave labor camp, the fa -- half of the room was French political prisoners.</span> <span id="s865">They were not supposed to talk to us, you know?</span> <span id="s866">But some of the girls got even friendly with them, just -- you know, just whatever, during no -- sending notes all around.</span> <span id="s867">We -- we could hear the -- the news why -- from them, they -- you know, they drop paper or they send letters.</span> <span id="s868">And a few of the girls got some food from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: While you were back in -- in Auschwitz, did you learn more news about the war and what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Just rumors, you know, not -- not too many news.</span> <span id="s871">We just know when -- the time when we got there, it was -- always looked like it almost over, you know, even when we got there.</span> <span id="s872">It lasted about a year more, but we felt it very soon has to be over, if we have just has a opportunity to leave from there, because to stay in there, it means, you know, death.</span> <span id="s873">We are -- you know, could be safe.</span> <span id="s874">Well, wa --we got the slave labor camp, we have to work at least two months to the working place --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Did you know you were going to leave, or how did that happen when you left Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Oh, they were told we going for work, everybody happy we got that piece of dress, and a coat and shoes, and we got -- everybody got a loaf of bread and a piece of margarine.</span> <span id="s877">And we thought it will be a long way to get wa -- somewhere.</span> <span id="s878">And I did the same thing that -- as usually before, eat the whole thing at once.</span> <span id="s879">I was so sick on that, that I paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: And you were very weak and thin at this point in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I was very weak and very -- I started to say, when we were walking to the working place, which was the telephone cam -- factory, I think it still exists.</span> <span id="s882">And it was harder and harder.</span> <span id="s883">Not only me, for everybody.</span> <span id="s884">So we went, you know, arm in arm, having [indecipherable] but I don’t think we could do it too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: But you weren't worried.</span> <span id="s886">As weak and thin as you were, you were not worried before that you would be sent to the crematorium, right?</span> <span id="s887">You weren't worried too much about that in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: In Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s889">Not really, we -- we always hoping that someday we will free, we -- I don’t know, it wasn’t really [indecipherable] believe me, because a lot of people went over there.</span> <span id="s890">It was a -- by accident.</span> <span id="s891">That’s why I -- sometimes I was asking, why me, when everybody, my family, my friend, everybody was killed around.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Could you actually smell something from the crematorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Oh yeah, it was a terrible odor.</span> <span id="s894">And you saw the smoke and everything.</span> <span id="s895">It wasn’t far from us.</span> <span id="s896">We -- one -- you know, at the morning when I stepped out from the barracks -- they already were putting out the dead people.</span> <span id="s897">I don’t know, I just -- I remember stepping over, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Did you have to get desensitized yourself as well, to make it through?</span> <span id="s899">You know, were you -- it sounds like you somehow kept some kind of optimism.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: And at the same times, did you have to lose some of your sensitivity to what you saw, to make it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: I’m sure we did, but we got -- we were medicated, too, you know.</span> <span id="s903">That’s why we were sleeping constantly.</span> <span id="s904">We were medicated.</span> <span id="s905">In the meantime, I don’t know, we had -- not some hope.</span> <span id="s906">For sure we were some hope we would get out from there, especially when -- until my friend was alive.</span> <span id="s907">We were -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s908">We saw that a lot of people were taken to work.</span> <span id="s909">We didn’t see the people taken to the gas chamber, because they left it there.</span> <span id="s910">Finally there wasn’t too many.</span> <span id="s911">I mean, relatively too much.</span> <span id="s912">But we’ve just heard of what the lageralteste told us, we saw the dead people, and to one side -- we were standing outside, a big van passed by with ma -- with naked bodies, dead bodies.</span> <span id="s913">Very shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Were there people -- were there women who died in -- in your barracks, in your area, on a regular basis?</span> <span id="s915">Around you, right around you, did -- were women dying there from --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: You know, I wa -- I wasn’t staying in the barracks from Nyíregyháza.</span> <span id="s917">We were st -- I was staying with -- I was staying with my friend, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s918">Not -- for Nyíregyháza, nobody w-went back, except my friend and my cousin, a-as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s919">Th -- a -- very, very few people, because the whole [indecipherable] city was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s920">In Debrecen was a difference.</span> <span id="s921">A few -- a few -- not a few, this one third of people went -- are sent to Austria.</span> <span id="s922">At Nyíregyháza everybody went.</span> <span id="s923">And when I was going through there, you know, to the cemetery, there is not even one face who I know.</span> <span id="s924">No Jewish face, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: So now tell me a little more details w-when you left Auschwitz and how you got to the next place, and where you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: As I told you, we went -- we were told we were going f -- to work, so we went over there, that place.</span> <span id="s927">It was a big, large stone barracks.</span> <span id="s928">I don’t know what was it before, but we were locked in.</span> <span id="s929">On the basement was a kitchen.</span> <span id="s930">They were the lucky one, you know, who were working in the kitchen, they always have enough food.</span> <span id="s931">I remember once I sold one of the women -- I had a coat, a -- it was a summer coat, actually, but the lining, I take it out.</span> <span id="s932">They made a blouse out of material for -- on it, and I got I think three or four e-extra plate of soup.</span> <span id="s933">And what can I tell, we were walking over there, SS woman -- this time woman was si -- st -- staying with us, and escorted us to the working place.</span> <span id="s934">We don’t -- we don’t see any more, it was a -- it was supposed to ba -- be -- we -- we saw it later on, a beautiful factory, beautiful place, but we saw only one room.</span> <span id="s935">We went over there, we got your work, which wasn’t very difficult.</span> <span id="s936">We have to check the -- how you call it -- part of the airplane [indecipherable] we have to check you know, the -- the wire on it, which was nothing.</span> <span id="s937">They didn’t use that part [indecipherable] the Germans later on.</span> <span id="s938">And we were talking.</span> <span id="s939">We weren’t -- were not supposed to talk while somebody came, you know.</span> <span id="s940">She -- we were quiet that.</span> <span id="s941">That was -- it was the only entertainment.</span> <span id="s942">We thought, you know, she was talking, I was just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: How far away is this place from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: [indecipherable] Auschwitz is in Poland, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: This is Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s947">So we went about a week, I guess.</span> <span id="s948">I -- I am not sure how far was it.</span> <span id="s949">We went about a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And that was also on a -- a train, a cattle car again, or how did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Cattle car.</span> <span id="s952">That was the same thing, we were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: And very, very uncomfortable conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Right.</span> <span id="s955">It wasn’t that bad than the first time I went, you know, from Sharvar, it was different.</span> <span id="s956">First of all, there wasn’t kids.</span> <span id="s957">Wasn’t old, very old people.</span> <span id="s958">We were, you know, younger.</span> <span id="s959">And later on in the camp, the sl-slave labor camps, were [indecipherable] the name, a few people got typhus, you know, and they passed away practically before the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Did you -- did you feel like when you left Auschwitz that you were going to something better?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Bet -- yeah, right.</span> <span id="s962">We were very hap -- happy.</span> <span id="s963">We were, you know, looking forward to that.</span> <span id="s964">We felt maybe we survived.</span> <span id="s965">If we going to work for them, you know, they won’t kill us right away.</span> <span id="s966">But they don’t have a chance.</span> <span id="s967">In fact -- and one time I find out that there are people here in United States from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s968">I got these letters, and I called up the registration.</span> <span id="s969">I talked to Meagan, okay.</span> <span id="s970">She told me there are -- oh yes, there are a lot of -- I says, how many?</span> <span id="s971">She said about 49.</span> <span id="s972">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s973">She didn’t tell me any name or nothing.</span> <span id="s974">She said, if you want to get contact, send me a letter, and I send back to them, which I did.</span> <span id="s975">I get a lot of response, telephone and letters and even I find somebody who is in Jersey.</span> <span id="s976">Unfortunately -- she is about my age, she got a stroke or something, she hardly could speak.</span> <span id="s977">A very good looking girl was.</span> <span id="s978">Anyway.</span> <span id="s979">And a-all of them was very happy to hear some -- from somebody.</span> <span id="s980">They talked, they -- we should meet, and I find out in that place where I thought we were alone, 200 women, we were 200 taken from Auschwitz, that not far on that area, there was 300 other women.</span> <span id="s981">We never saw them, they never saw us.</span> <span id="s982">They just heard about it through that people, was taken there to -- in the stone barracks.</span> <span id="s983">And I was in contact with them for awhile, and I had the accident where I wa -- we used to live in Suffolk, Long Island.</span> <span id="s984">Every morning I was walking around about two miles, you know, I had to walk.</span> <span id="s985">And I didn't notice [indecipherable] cement block was sunk, and I tripped, and I fell.</span> <span id="s986">I broke my arm, my face was broken, and I hurt my neck, which was already ma -- damaged.</span> <span id="s987">So I was in very bad condition, and I stopped the connection.</span> <span id="s988">Since then we moved, and you know, I -- I always think maybe I should call.</span> <span id="s989">I even talked to that girl who is in Jersey that we will meet.</span> <span id="s990">I invited them to our house.</span> <span id="s991">She said why don’t -- we are going because she is sick.</span> <span id="s992">I just remember her, you know, a very good looking young girl, exactly about my age, and got a stroke about a few years back.</span> <span id="s993">She said the only thing which she has no -- hard to si -- talk, you know, damage of talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Now, any of the people here, any of the women you got in contact with, were they women you -- you knew back then?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: This one.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: This one is.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: This one we were in the same barracks and we were talking over the telephone, she knew a few of them, she passed away, she was her friend over there.</span> <span id="s998">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Was it -- was that meaningful for you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Oh yeah, it was.</span> <span id="s1003">I just feeled bad, you know, after two or three years.</span> <span id="s1004">It was my accident I hardly get over, you know.</span> <span id="s1005">This year I had an other surgeon on my foot, so I have had a problem, and I still have with my -- ce-cervical spine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Let me check my questions, make sure.</span> <span id="s1007">So maybe you can paint a little more of a -- a picture of what it’s like to have been in this forced labor situation, how difficult it was, what the daily routine was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: At the morning, you know, we got some black coffee and a piece of bread, and we were -- we have to walk over there to the factory.</span> <span id="s1009">And as I said, it was every day harder and harder.</span> <span id="s1010">I mentioned to you before that letter which came from the city or town [indecipherable], a teacher wrote me when they find out, you know, for -- at the registration that I was there.</span> <span id="s1011">And he -- she ask me to write it down, my experience, she were a teacher in the school.</span> <span id="s1012">And I felt bad, at -- I never answer either of the [indecipherable] because we were walking there four times a day.</span> <span id="s1013">Nobody ever come and give us a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1014">Maybe they couldn’t because the SS woman was there.</span> <span id="s1015">But even there, you know, nobody noticed us, or seems to me nobody noticed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Did you see people out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Yes, we saw people, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: So these would be Czech people?</span> <span id="s1019">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1020">Walking around and they making their work.</span> <span id="s1021">And -- oh, I have to mention too, my last few days after the liberation, it was -- it was just a nice end, you know, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1022">We’re sitting -- after the Russians were [indecipherable] Russian ha -- soldiers liberated us, they went through on the village, and the most of the girls -- as I said, there about 200, a few less because they passed away, went to the town to look around, but begging for food, and I think they went to see [indecipherable] later, you know, there is a big town too.</span> <span id="s1023">And m-myself and other five or six girl -- oh -- were sitting outside, this is a very nice -- it was May, very nice day.</span> <span id="s1024">And a German came, a civil, and he ask us about her -- his coat, that somebody stole his coat.</span> <span id="s1025">Which wasn't impossible because we -- there was a restaurant around the corner, and my f -- I -- other girls and myself, we went to where the -- nobody was there, they left -- they fled from the ger -- Russians.</span> <span id="s1026">So, but [indecipherable] so, we [indecipherable] the top.</span> <span id="s1027">But she wa -- he was looking for the coat, is no wa -- none of us knew about that.</span> <span id="s1028">And he has a gun, and he said, if you don’t give us my coat back, I kill you.</span> <span id="s1029">And turn to the [indecipherable] and I felt funny, you know.</span> <span id="s1030">Here is the liberation and we will die now.</span> <span id="s1031">So he sent somebody oh -- with her -- him to the barracks, he will [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1032">So one of the girls runs inside, he -- you know, looked every bed.</span> <span id="s1033">And naturally he didn’t find nothing.</span> <span id="s1034">And we thought [indecipherable] he left, but it was a -- it was just a funny finish for that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Was it hard to believe that -- that you were truly liberated, that the war was truly over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: No, we are -- we were very happy.</span> <span id="s1037">We believed it before this happened, or after.</span> <span id="s1038">Oh yes, we knew that.</span> <span id="s1039">We are very, very happy.</span> <span id="s1040">We are -- we have only one problem, how we get home.</span> <span id="s1041">We don’t have money.</span> <span id="s1042">We tried to get on the train until, you know, the -- the conductor came, we don’t have money, right away he send us down from the train.</span> <span id="s1043">Sometimes the people, you know, went against him and told him let u-us stay, but most of the time we have to come off.</span> <span id="s1044">And after a few days some were walking, and this way I get to Budapest, and we were told where we can go to get some help, Jewish organization and so on.</span> <span id="s1045">And I had the uncle in Budapest, I went looking for them.</span> <span id="s1046">And they place was too in the ghetto area and I was told that the -- it was bombarded, the house was bombarded, and my aunt, and my cousin, who was married, but he was that time alone, her husband was taken away on the forced labor, she had two kids.</span> <span id="s1047">One of them was sitting her lap, the other one the grandmother lap, and they got the bomb -- bombed, you know?</span> <span id="s1048">She and the little girl passed away and the grandmother with the other girl stay alive.</span> <span id="s1049">And that time, because of the situation, there is only one big temple in Hungary, maybe you heard about it [indecipherable] is still the only, and the nicest Jewish temple.</span> <span id="s1050">And the [indecipherable] there are -- she is -- she was buried over there with her daughter.</span> <span id="s1051">She is still there, you know.</span> <span id="s1052">And the grandmother passed away later, and the little girl is live somewhere over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: What did -- what did you know about your -- your parents at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: My mother -- later on, I was married already, she came to the United State with my brother.</span> <span id="s1055">I had an aunt and uncle here.</span> <span id="s1056">They, you know, they [indecipherable] her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Did you know -- did you know where your mother was at the very end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1059">She was hiding in Paris, around Paris somewhere.</span> <span id="s1060">My brother, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: And when did you have contact with her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: After the war she came once to visit that I was wum -- I was married already, as I mentioned, we were not in -- we were not -- how you say it in English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: You weren't really close, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: No, we were not.</span> <span id="s1065">She was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Is that very difficult for you, or have you accepted it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: It was dif -- no, it was very difficult for me, and she doesn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1068">And later on, when my -- I -- we were here, after ’56, whenever she visited, and it was my same attitude, she was really angry with me, and you know, we stop talking.</span> <span id="s1069">And that -- my attitude, my brother, too, why you know, I hardly know, he hardly -- he hardly know me.</span> <span id="s1070">She just knew that I have a nice family, grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1071">She never -- he never married.</span> <span id="s1072">You know, sometime it was, after my mother passed away here, my brother la -- lived alone, and he became sick, he got a -- he was taken to the hospital and emergency room.</span> <span id="s1073">He -- he wa -- has nobody except this, you know, the stepfather family.</span> <span id="s1074">And I was called up, but I went and turn out to be he needed a bypass surgery.</span> <span id="s1075">And I was there every day, and after 10 days that he was told that he wa -- he has to go to the convalescent home, and she was very u -- he was very upset, and I took him home, and you know, we gave him a room, and sometimes at night he has -- we have to take him back to the emergency room.</span> <span id="s1076">Actually, I ki -- feel I took good care of him.</span> <span id="s1077">And after that, he moved to -- shortly after that he moved to Florida and he became sick again.</span> <span id="s1078">We went down to Florida just for the wintertime, we were there, and I thought this very funny because the doctor, the emergency room told us, you’re not supposed to have this kind of pain, you had surgery.</span> <span id="s1079">He -- he was taken -- I called the ambulance, he was taken to the hospital over there, and they make tests again, and they find out that -- that chur -- surgery was -- as -- they say that a butcher job.</span> <span id="s1080">Every artery was closed.</span> <span id="s1081">Actually, it was done, maybe you know the North Shore hospital, the surgery was done here, probably by student, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1082">Anyway, they needed a other surgery over there, after five months, in Florida.</span> <span id="s1083">And we were -- took care of him, with my husband and myself.</span> <span id="s1084">I thought maybe I have only one relative, but I don’t think one as f -- as -- soon as he got well, he said he doesn’t even remember to be that sick.</span> <span id="s1085">So I [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1086">I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Do you -- do you feel very hurt nowadays, thinking about your parent and them having -- to me it’s so unusual they left you, and I just wondered --</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: It is unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: -- wondered how you think about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: I felt very bad when I was young and younger.</span> <span id="s1091">And I felt even worse when I came here and we met.</span> <span id="s1092">And I can’t suppress, you know?</span> <span id="s1093">I -- I just can’t.</span> <span id="s1094">And sh -- the -- she knows, and she doesn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1095">It was the circumstance and so on.</span> <span id="s1096">I just can’t imitate something which I don’t feel ar -- I feel the opposite.</span> <span id="s1097">You know what?</span> <span id="s1098">Now, thinking back, I feel lucky that I was raised my -- by my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1099">I got a lot of love and everything.</span> <span id="s1100">She was a nice woman and I’m go ba -- when will I going back, I’m going to the cemetery and be sure -- make it sure that a -- it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1101">No, I don’t feel bad about that she didn't raise me.</span> <span id="s1102">And my brother is very -- very, very jealous, because, as I said, beside -- she thinks I am a millionaire.</span> <span id="s1103">We -- both of us, my husband and myself, we worked very hard since we are here, and our first priority was to send me -- my daughter to school, you know?</span> <span id="s1104">We thanks God we have a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s1105">Is enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: So let’s just go back to liberation, and what you specifically remember about the Russians arriving, about the Germans leaving.</span> <span id="s1107">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Days before the Russian came, the French workers already, you know, let us know that they coming closer.</span> <span id="s1109">And about two days before they reach us, every German left, around us, you know?</span> <span id="s1110">The rumors all disappeared, and we went out, we find there was a barracks beside us, frozen potato, a lot of fro -- frozen potato what we already right away took and with a little oven in the room, which was heating over, we made potato, and a lot of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: -- yellow -- how you say that, pea?</span> <span id="s1113">You know, yellow -- not green pea --</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: So that’s -- oh, split pea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Split pea, yeah, and we eat it, and we right away became sick already, very sick, because we’re not used to regular food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: And where did you get that food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: It was over there, we -- we didn’t get it from the German, you know, we just get almost empty soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Edith Csengeri, conducted by Amy Rubin, on October 30th, 2001, in Great Neck, New York.</span> <span id="s1120">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1121">So continue, if you will, to talk about liberation and more of the details of that la --</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Liberation was unbelievable, you know.</span> <span id="s1123">I can’t even find a word -- jubilant?</span> <span id="s1124">We realize we are free.</span> <span id="s1125">And as I said, beside that incident, what happened the other end, we have only one problem, to get -- how to get home.</span> <span id="s1126">It was a long -- you know when sometimes we got the station and we -- they don’t let us in, few of us went to the top of this train, and we have a [indecipherable] or something, and we traveling there.</span> <span id="s1127">Sometime the Russian soldiers who was there in the station, you know, don’t let us stay there.</span> <span id="s1128">They -- you know.</span> <span id="s1129">We climb down and when they left we climb back.</span> <span id="s1130">And many times we took the ride home on the top of the train.</span> <span id="s1131">It wasn’t unusual.</span> <span id="s1132">Every train was crowded.</span> <span id="s1133">And when we -- as I said, when I finally reach Budapest, I don’t stay too long.</span> <span id="s1134">The same --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Were you -- were you by yourself, did you travel with others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: I travel with others until Budapest.</span> <span id="s1137">That point, every do ve -- everybody left, looking for ri -- a friend or s -- relatives, or somebody, which I did, too.</span> <span id="s1138">And when I didn’t find nobody and I heard what -- I went to my relatives, the same way I went home to Debrecen, what I originally arri -- you know, started.</span> <span id="s1139">And I heard there that some people was taken to Austria, so I had more chance to see somebody.</span> <span id="s1140">But after a long time, nobody was there, you know?</span> <span id="s1141">So I decided to go to Nyíregyháza.</span> <span id="s1142">Even less people, completely.</span> <span id="s1143">But, as I [indecipherable] ghost town.</span> <span id="s1144">No Jewish face, nobody.</span> <span id="s1145">And I was very upset later on and I went back to Debrecen and my friend’s family came back.</span> <span id="s1146">My -- Ava ha -- her father was taken the same way as my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s1147">So he, and she had a sister, was taken to Austria after that.</span> <span id="s1148">And her mother was hiding in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1149">So after the war they -- you know, everybody was there except Ava.</span> <span id="s1150">So I told her -- told them what happened.</span> <span id="s1151">But that -- that time, people just started to know about Auschwitz, nobody knew about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1152">And -- but more and more people came home and you know, told the same story, l-like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1153">I remember I was sitting one day at their house, and a common -- not friend, a man came by and ask, when I told what happen, he -- how come you came back and Ava didn’t?</span> <span id="s1154">And I was so shocked, you know, because as I said, for a long time they di -- nobody realize what happened.</span> <span id="s1155">And I had this -- my conscious, you know?</span> <span id="s1156">Why did I came back, really?</span> <span id="s1157">How come everybody else beside her, stays.</span> <span id="s1158">For a long time I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s1159">Even now sometime wondering, you know?</span> <span id="s1160">So many [indecipherable] they killed everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Had you already given up on God at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: I didn’t give it up, I looking for it, so far.</span> <span id="s1163">I couldn’t understand how come -- I just couldn’t understand how come God let kill so many innocent people.</span> <span id="s1164">I don’t talking about now the people who should have.</span> <span id="s1165">I know there is a saying in the very religious people, you know, [indecipherable] maybe you heard, you’re not supposed to ask why did let this happened.</span> <span id="s1166">But I -- I -- I still asking, how c -- how could this happen?</span> <span id="s1167">I don’t know how they explain that, simply they ignore it.</span> <span id="s1168">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: So there was a lot of pain when you went back to these cities and couldn’t find people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1171">I [indecipherable] that.</span> <span id="s1172">I usually not going, as I said.</span> <span id="s1173">I’m sitting the cab or taxi, going to the cemetery and back.</span> <span id="s1174">I never go back to Nyíregyháza, to the city.</span> <span id="s1175">We once slept over -- we came back and on the way back we stopped Debrecen is, you know, in the [indecipherable] way, and we had to sleep over there.</span> <span id="s1176">And I came out one -- in the morning, looking around, you know.</span> <span id="s1177">Not one Jewish face.</span> <span id="s1178">Because there are some Jews now, who came from the vicinity, you know?</span> <span id="s1179">But the people who were there either was killed or left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: When have you been back after -- after you moved to the U.S., when have you been back to Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: My si -- father-in-law was alive, you know?</span> <span id="s1182">He got married again.</span> <span id="s1183">So we went back, three of us.</span> <span id="s1184">Ava was -- I think he was in college that time, the first time I went back.</span> <span id="s1185">And then my husba -- he -- he became sick.</span> <span id="s1186">My husband went alone.</span> <span id="s1187">And then every few years we went back, because -- I especially went back to the ci -- beside the cemetery, I have this friend over there in Budapest, they moved to Budapest with a big family and they always waited for us, you know, with so much love, and -- and just like the war time, I remember she was always so nice to me.</span> <span id="s1188">And now I think I’m -- I -- I -- I -- I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s1189">So, in that case we -- I don’t think we ever go back again.</span> <span id="s1190">We have nobody, nothing to look for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: How di -- how did you piece together your life after liberation, after the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Well, when I got home, as I said, people who came by piece by piece from Austria, are some of my friend, who was at the cosmetic, at the other one.</span> <span id="s1193">She came back with her mother and the lager friend, too.</span> <span id="s1194">And we came friends with the girl who I know before, and sh -- I mentioned she got mar -- married before they left the camp, and she was expecting a child, she lost that child finally.</span> <span id="s1195">So she beca-came very good friends of me.</span> <span id="s1196">So, you know, people lost so many friends, they tried to make friends with, you know, somebody who had the same ex -- ex -- experience, and -- and [indecipherable] we came here, too.</span> <span id="s1197">We have about eight or 10 couple who has the same back -- background, same past, most of them who were, you know, I se -- unfortunately half of them is gone, mostly the mens.</span> <span id="s1198">I still have a friend, we talking every day, meeting every week.</span> <span id="s1199">She’s a widow, and another one who lost her husband, all of them survivors.</span> <span id="s1200">We have a few around here.</span> <span id="s1201">That was one of the reason that we moved here.</span> <span id="s1202">They not driving, and we said -- they came together once over there, and they said, I should understand it’s very, very far from everybody.</span> <span id="s1203">My daughter is came every week over there, but it must [indecipherable] here, too.</span> <span id="s1204">And my gr -- one of -- grandson lives here in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: So you -- you -- you stayed in Hungary, you thought that you would continue living there?</span> <span id="s1206">You didn’t plan to move, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Up to -- that time, no.</span> <span id="s1208">Because you know, they started to go back to old lifestyle, you know?</span> <span id="s1209">There wasn't enemy, you know.</span> <span id="s1210">And they were, you know, they started a new -- to make a -- sorry, it’s a cramp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: You -- you want to -- you okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: I’m okay.</span> <span id="s1213">They started to build a new life, getting married.</span> <span id="s1214">One of the uncle getting married -- got married, he -- his father got married, we got married.</span> <span id="s1215">So we started a new life, and after awhile it was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: You met your husband in what year, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Right after when I got home.</span> <span id="s1218">Actually, he -- he used to go out before me with a girl who went to Auschwitz, for awhile, and you know, didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1219">He came -- you know, we went out together.</span> <span id="s1220">We got married -- 1956 we started, and ’57 -- ah, ’46, and ’47 we got married.</span> <span id="s1221">And we lived there for awhile peacefully, until you know, the Communist regime.</span> <span id="s1222">But there wan -- wasn’t any way to leave the country that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: So when did you leave, and how did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: 1956 there was a big revolution, and the borders was open [indecipherable] and every kind of people, you know, who were not allowed from the -- from the -- anywhere, th-the most -- lowest people, you know, came around and they hanged people and -- and so on.</span> <span id="s1225">And they started to talk again -- against the Jews, everything -- the Jews was the reason this happened and so on.</span> <span id="s1226">So my daughter was about seven years old, and I was thinking it’s just can’t happen to her again, what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1227">So it was -- we decided to leave.</span> <span id="s1228">And this girl I mentioned who was my friend, who was -- came back from Austria with her husband and that was a [indecipherable] and the [indecipherable] my husband, we decided together to leave the country.</span> <span id="s1229">So we just walked out, left everything,
