id="s2">by Leilani Sprague) One Videotape, In English Taped October 27, 1999</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Abstract Judge Norbert Ehrenfreund was a reporter at the Nuremberg Trial War Crimes Trial.</span> <span id="s4">He chose to interview Lou Dunst, a Holocaust survivor, in a form that would have resembled a questioning session at the trial.</span> <span id="s5">In 1940, Lou was living with his family in Yasinya, Czechoslovakia when the Hungarians occupied his town and forced his father into to slave labor.</span> <span id="s6">Lou and several of his peers were also forced into slave labor at a nearby camp.</span> <span id="s7">In 1944, Lou, and the other Jews from his town, were packed into boxcars and sent to a ghetto in Mátészalka, Hungary.</span> <span id="s8">They stayed there for several weeks until they were again packed into boxcars and deported to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Upon arrival, he and the others underwent a selection headed by Dr. Mengele.</span> <span id="s10">Lou never saw his mother again after the selection, and his father was soon gassed as well.</span> <span id="s11">Lou was able to stay with his brother and was placed into a barrack in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s12">He was soon transferred to Mauthausen with several other young men.</span> <span id="s13">While there, they were put into a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s14">They thought they were about to die but survived the experience and were sent to Ebensee to “disappear.”</span> <span id="s15">They lived under difficult conditions in Ebensee and witnessed several brutal tortures.</span> <span id="s16">Lou even considered suicide on several occasions, but his brother helped him to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">By the springtime of 1945, the war was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s18">On May 6th, 1945, Lou was placed on a pile of those who were dead or dying.</span> <span id="s19">However, the American Army liberated the camp later that day, and his brother was able to remove him from that pile.</span> <span id="s20">After liberation, Lou was taken to Linz, Austria and eventually on to a hospital in Prague.</span> <span id="s21">Lou later came to America, where he lives today.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Transcript Judge Norbert Ehrenfreund: When the trial of the Nazi war criminals began in Nuremberg, the story of the Holocaust was about to be told for the first time.</span> <span id="s23">There were many who hoped that the trials might bring some sense of closure to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s24">But we know now from the trial’s evidence that there can never be closure to the Holocaust, for it is like a black pit where the bodies of six million Jews lie at the bottom along with millions of others deemed undesirable by Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s25">The war ended in 1945.</span> <span id="s26">I fought in that war.</span> <span id="s27">I was a soldier in that army.</span> <span id="s28">I fought in France, Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s29">And when the war was over in that year of 1945, thousands of GI’s started going home—back to the states and back to their jobs.</span> <span id="s30">I had no job to which to go back.</span> <span id="s31">I was a young man in my early twenties, so I took a job with the American newspaper in Europe The Stars and Stripes.</span> <span id="s32">And one of my first assignments was to cover the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial.</span> <span id="s33">Some have called it the greatest trial in history.</span> <span id="s34">There were many questions in our minds, among those of us that were in the press, as the trials got underway—questions that still remain unanswered.</span> <span id="s35">How could a nation—perhaps the most cultured nation on earth—how could it have suddenly turned so barbaric?</span> <span id="s36">How could it have organized its people to participate in those atrocities?</span> <span id="s37">Questions like those we are still asking today.</span> <span id="s38">I can not recreate all of that trial to you of course.</span> <span id="s39">The trial went on for eight months, and it had many dramatic periods.</span> <span id="s40">But there is something that I can do, and I will do.</span> <span id="s41">I am going to call to the stand, as it were, a man who might have been called to the stand at the Nuremberg Trials.</span> <span id="s42">He wasn’t called—he was too ill at the time, and they could not find him.</span> <span id="s43">But his testimony is typical and much like the testimony we heard at the Nuremberg Trials.</span> <span id="s44">This is not a play.</span> <span id="s45">This is not an act.</span> <span id="s46">The man you are about to hear—his story is very real, and I will call to the stand now Lou Dunst.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Judge: Would you state your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Lou Dunst: Lou Dunst.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Judge: Would you spell your last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Lou Dunst: D-U-N-S-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Judge: And how old are you Mr. Dunst?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Lou: I am 73 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Judge: Mr. Dunst—I want to take you back in time to when you were fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s54">That would have been about the year 1940 or 1941.</span> <span id="s55">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Lou: That is correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Judge: Where were you living then?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Lou: In Yasinya, Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Judge: And who were you living with?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Lou: With my parents.</span> <span id="s61">Mother, father, sister, and brother.</span> <span id="s62">I am the youngest of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Judge: Yes, and what did your parents do?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Lou: My parents had a retail store.</span> <span id="s65">A general merchandise retail store.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Judge: And what happened then?</span> <span id="s67">Tell us what happened in that year when you were fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Lou: In that year they took away all the Jewish men to slave labor, where they worked them very hard under very bad conditions as far as freezing, starving, beatings, and torture.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Judge: Just a minute, you said, “They took…” Lou: Yes, at that time we were occupied by the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Judge: Yes, and did they take your father also?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Lou: Yes, they did—all Jewish men including my father.</span> <span id="s72">They called it munkatabor.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Judge: What happened?</span> <span id="s74">What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Lou: They had to go to slave labor, and they worked them very hard under very rough conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Judge: Did they tell you why they were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Lou: They did not say why.</span> <span id="s78">They… Judge: They just came into your house and took him away?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Lou: Well he had to go.</span> <span id="s80">That was the law.</span> <span id="s81">They all have to go—all Jewish men.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Judge: And this was a time when the war was on is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Judge: And what did you do during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Lou: They took us teenagers to a slave labor camp called Levente.</span> <span id="s86">And we had to load and unload Military equipment.</span> <span id="s87">They worked us all day, all night—whenever they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Judge: Did you still live at your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Lou: Yes, we were at home.</span> <span id="s90">The children were at home.</span> <span id="s91">The father was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Judge: Well who were your bosses?</span> <span id="s93">Who told you to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Lou: Well it was the Germans and the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Judge: And why did they do this to you—to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Lou: Because we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Judge: So how long did this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Lou: That went on until we were taken away to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Judge: When were you taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Lou: Prior to that they rounded up Jewish people from other countries and brought them into our place—about 14,000 men, women and children, and they were starving.</span> <span id="s101">They brought them in boxcars, and they were crying for food and water.</span> <span id="s102">We shared with them whatever we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Judge: You mean, in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Lou: Yes, in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Judge: You saw those people gathered in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Lou: Yes that was an end station because it was a border town.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Judge: What was the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Lou: Yasinya.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Judge: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Lou: At that time they changed it to Körösmezö.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Judge: Alright.</span> <span id="s112">And how old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Lou: I was fourteen, fifteen years… fifteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Judge: And when they brought all these people into your town.</span> <span id="s115">How old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Lou: Fifteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Judge: And when was it you were taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Lou: In ’44.</span> <span id="s119">The beginning of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Judge: And how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Lou: I was eighteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Judge: Okay, you were eighteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Lou: Eighteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Judge: Tell us exactly what happened when you were eighteen and how you were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Lou: They knocked on the door one early morning, and we all had to get ready real quickly in a hurry.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Judge: Yes, who knocked on the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Lou: The Hungarian Gendarms, and beside them they had Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Judge: And who was in you home at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Lou: We were all at home.</span> <span id="s130">My Parents, my sister, and brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Judge: How old was your sister at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Lou: My sister is four years older than I am, and my brother is two years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Judge: And did they come at night or day?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Lou: No, it was early in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Judge: Did you know they were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Lou: We had no idea.</span> <span id="s137">We did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Judge: Had your father returned from this slave labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Lou: At that time he was back from the slave labor.</span> <span id="s140">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Judge: And did they tell you why they were taking you away?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Lou: They did not tell us why.</span> <span id="s143">All they told us was that the Jewish people have to do what they say, or else they will be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Judge: So tell us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Lou: Well we had a synagogue in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s146">There were three Torahs.</span> <span id="s147">We brought those Torahs back nice and neatly in our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Judge: Yes, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Lou: We were all taken downtown to the center of the village and were put into a large building.</span> <span id="s150">At one time it was a theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Judge: Well what happened when you were taken away?</span> <span id="s152">What happened to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Lou: We had to leave it just the way it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Judge: Was it a house or an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Lou: A home.</span> <span id="s156">We had a home.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Judge: Yes, and what happened to your father’s store?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Lou: It was given away to the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Judge: Alright, so you were taken to the center of town.</span> <span id="s160">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Lou: Yes, we were at the center of town in a large building.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Judge: Were there other people gathered together?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Lou: All the Jewish people from that town at that time were all there, and we didn’t even fit because the building wasn’t large enough to hold us.</span> <span id="s164">So some of us had to stay outside in the rain and… Judge: When you went out this way, did you take your belongings with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Lou: They told us that we didn’t need to take anything.</span> <span id="s166">We were only going to the downtown area.</span> <span id="s167">To the center of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Judge: Did you have any idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Lou: We had no idea.</span> <span id="s170">They didn’t tell us anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Judge: These people who took you, were they Hungarian or German?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Lou: Hungarians, and some Germans, and local Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Judge: Were they in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Lou: Yes, some of them were uniformed, some were civilian, and some wore black uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Judge: Did they have guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Lou: Yes, they had machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Judge: Did they threaten you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Lou: At that time they did not.</span> <span id="s179">They just told us.</span> <span id="s180">Umm, then they took us up to the Jewish cemetery, and before you get to the Jewish Cemetery there is a flat piece of land, and we were told that we were going to have to dig our own graves, and we will be machine gunned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Judge: Why did they tell you?</span> <span id="s182">Why did they make it such a threat?</span> <span id="s183">Why were they going to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Lou: The only thing they knew is because we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s185">That was the only answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Judge: Alright.</span> <span id="s187">You were still in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Lou: We were in our town by the cemetery waiting to… Judge: This would have been what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Lou: ‘44.</span> <span id="s190">The beginning of 1944…</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Judge: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Lou: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Judge: The war was still on?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Lou: Yes, the war was on—very well on, in fact, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Judge: Was your town occupied by foreign troops at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Lou: No, except the Germans were there and the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Judge: Alright, and the Germans and Hungarians were working together?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Lou: Yes, they were working together.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Judge: Alright, and what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Lou: Something changed.</span> <span id="s201">They rounded us up.</span> <span id="s202">We couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s203">But something changed, and they took us to the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Judge: How did they walk you down the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Lou: Yes, we were walked.</span> <span id="s206">We were marched from the cemetery to the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Judge: And your family was… Lou: All together.</span> <span id="s208">We were all together.</span> <span id="s209">All the Jewish people from the whole town.</span> <span id="s210">There was not one Jewish person in town that was not there.</span> <span id="s211">We were all there.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Judge: They marched you all to the railroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Lou: To the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Judge: Is that right.</span> <span id="s215">And then what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Lou: We were put in boxcars.</span> <span id="s217">Packed tight, and they did not have any facilities as far as toilet facilities.</span> <span id="s218">There was a bucket on one end.</span> <span id="s219">The one that had to go to the other end would never make it.</span> <span id="s220">By that time we already had diarrhea and other illnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Judge: Well okay.</span> <span id="s222">They packed you all as I understand into these boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Lou: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Judge: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Lou: Yes Judge: And the boxcars had no facilities, no water, no….</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Lou: No water, no food, not enough air.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Judge: Did you have any food with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Lou: No, no.</span> <span id="s229">They did not give us any food.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Judge: Alright.</span> <span id="s231">So when you were in the boxcars did they tell you where you were going to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Lou: They locked the doors from the outside, and off we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Judge: Was their any air coming in at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Lou: Very little.</span> <span id="s235">A lot of people had trouble breathing because the openings were just small openings on top on those boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Judge: Were there children?</span> <span id="s237">Were there babies?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Lou: There were children, there were babies, there were pregnant women, there were old people, and there were sick people.</span> <span id="s239">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Judge: Alright.</span> <span id="s241">Then what happened after you were locked in the boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Lou: Off we go.</span> <span id="s243">The machine gave a whistle.</span> <span id="s244">Like a happy whistle we were ready to go.</span> <span id="s245">And we were traveling day and night.</span> <span id="s246">We did not know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Judge: You did not know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Lou: We had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Judge: So what happened in those boxcars?</span> <span id="s250">How did you exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Lou: Well it was very hard because some people soiled their clothes because they couldn’t get to the bucket.</span> <span id="s252">Many of us had diarrhea.</span> <span id="s253">Some people, excuse me, were vomiting.</span> <span id="s254">It was a bad trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Judge: And the doors would not open?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Lou: The doors would not open.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Judge: How long was this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Lou: Day and night.</span> <span id="s259">I don’t remember how many days or how many nights, but it was several days and nights till we came to our last stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Judge: What was the condition of the people that were in the boxcars?</span> <span id="s261">Did any of them die?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Lou: No, not at that time.</span> <span id="s263">I don’t remember anyone dying as of yet.</span> <span id="s264">Later on they did, but at that time, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Judge: Well you came to the last stop.</span> <span id="s266">Where were you?</span> <span id="s267">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Lou: They opened up the doors, and we were in Hungary.</span> <span id="s269">A town called Mátészalka.</span> <span id="s270">We were put into a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Judge: That was a ghetto in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Lou: A ghetto in Hungary.</span> <span id="s273">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Judge: So you got out of the boxcars… Lou: Out of the boxcars.</span> <span id="s275">Into a ghetto—a small space.</span> <span id="s276">Too many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Judge: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Lou: We had no room to lie down.</span> <span id="s279">There were threats: If you go here you were shot, if you go here a pregnant woman will get shot, if you do this you get shot.</span> <span id="s280">Everything was under threats.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Judge: When you say a ghetto, what do you mean—a building or a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Lou: It was a section of a town, and it was marked “This is the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s283">Judge: And you can’t go outside right?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Lou: No, you step over, and you get shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Judge: Did anyone step over?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Lou: Not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Judge: And there were people guarding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Lou: There were people guarding us all of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Judge: With guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Lou: With machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Judge: Yes, and were they wearing Nazi army badges of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Lou: Yes, they wore German uniforms: SS German uniforms and German Gendarms and Hungarian Gendarms.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Judge: So what happened when you were in this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Lou: We were, several days later, taken to a cemetery in Mátészalka.</span> <span id="s295">And we were told to give up everything we had in our pockets like a pen, a pencil, a notebook, or a watch, and we were told that if we don’t give up everything that they will search our bodies.</span> <span id="s296">We will be shot, those that don’t give up everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Judge: So is that what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Lou: Yes, we gave up everything.</span> <span id="s299">And when they said they would search the body, they included human cavities.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Judge: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Lou: And they are brutal.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Judge: So how long were you in that ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Lou: A couple of weeks or so.</span> <span id="s304">Something to that effect.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t remember the exact time element.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Judge: Was it outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Lou: Yes.</span> <span id="s308">Well there were houses there.</span> <span id="s309">Now some people were able to get in to the attic, in the basement, or in the house.</span> <span id="s310">It was a closed-in area.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Judge: So how did you eat?</span> <span id="s312">How did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Lou: There was very little food—maybe just enough to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Judge: Alright.</span> <span id="s315">Did they tell you?</span> <span id="s316">Did they ever tell you why they were doing this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Lou: They didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s318">They did not tell us.</span> <span id="s319">They just told us to be nice and quiet and behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Judge: Alright, so you stayed there for several weeks in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s321">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Lou: We were marched off to the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Judge: Back to the railroad again?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Lou: Put in boxcars.</span> <span id="s325">Same procedures as far as food or other facilities.</span> <span id="s326">Off we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Judge: And then you went on another trip in the boxcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Lou: We were locked in the boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Judge: Did they tell where you were going then?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Lou: They did not tell us.</span> <span id="s331">They did not tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Judge: And what happened on this trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Lou: Well off we go day and night, back and forth.</span> <span id="s334">They hooked on other trains and other boxcars, and we traveled several days and several nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Judge: How crowded was this boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Lou: It was very crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Judge: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Lou: Very crowded because they pushed us in.</span> <span id="s339">They, by force—they forced as many of us as they could in standing up like this.</span> <span id="s340">(He uses his hand to show that people were forced to stand right up against one another.)</span> <span id="s341">Judge: Well at night were you able to all lie down and sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Lou: No, there was no room to lie down.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Judge: Alright, and this went on during the trip for several days and several nights?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Lou: Several days and several nights.</span> <span id="s345">Yes, stop and go, for several days and several nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Judge: Did people suffer?</span> <span id="s347">How did they live?</span> <span id="s348">How did they exist?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Lou: Well they were just suffering, and most of us didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s350">We didn’t know what to say or to whom to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Judge: You’re still together with all your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Lou: Still together, still together.</span> <span id="s353">All families.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Judge: You stayed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Lou: All the families were still together, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Judge: Again, were there babies or children?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Lou: Little babies, children, sick people.</span> <span id="s358">Yes, all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Judge: Alright.</span> <span id="s360">Where did you stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Lou: Last stop, the doors opened up, and everybody went out.</span> <span id="s362">At that time there were some that were lying there in their own excrement, and they couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s363">Some were dying, some were dead, and some lost their reasoning.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Judge: That is when they opened the boxcars?</span> <span id="s365">And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Lou: We were told to get out.</span> <span id="s367">So those that were able got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Judge: Where were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Lou: That was Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Judge: In what country?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Lou: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Judge: That was the Auschwitz—the famous Auschwitz Concentration Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Lou: Auschwitz Concentration Camp.</span> <span id="s374">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Judge: When you got out of the boxcars, where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Lou: We didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s377">We asked the inmates that worked where we were.</span> <span id="s378">They told us Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s379">We didn’t know what Auschwitz was or what it meant.</span> <span id="s380">So they told us that we were going to be gassed and cremated.</span> <span id="s381">We did….</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Judge: Who told you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Lou: The inmates that worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Judge: You mean other…</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Lou: Other inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Judge: Other Jewish inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Lou: Other Jewish inmates.</span> <span id="s388">There were ninety-five percent Jewish inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Judge: As soon as you got out of the boxcars you had contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Lou: Yes, we talked with them, yes.</span> <span id="s391">Our own language in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Judge: And they told you that you were going to be gassed and cremated?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Lou: That’s what they told us, and we did not believe them.</span> <span id="s394">We did not.</span> <span id="s395">They said, “You see the chimneys.</span> <span id="s396">You see the smoke.”</span> <span id="s397">Judge: What did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Lou: The chimneys and the smoke.</span> <span id="s399">And they say can you smell it?</span> <span id="s400">Yes, we did smell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Judge: What did you smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Lou: It smelled like burned hair.</span> <span id="s403">If you take hair and burn it, that’s what it smelled like.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Judge: So okay, you’re out of the boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Judge: You were told you were going to be gassed and cremated.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Judge: And where did all of your family go?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Lou: It was chaos.</span> <span id="s410">You were chased.</span> <span id="s411">You go here.</span> <span id="s412">You go there.</span> <span id="s413">You go here.</span> <span id="s414">You go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Judge: Just a minute.</span> <span id="s416">You were with your mother, your father, your sister, and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Lou: We were still all together, but then we were being separated because my mother and sister went this way (He puts right hand up and points to the right).</span> <span id="s418">That was the last time I saw my mother (He begins to cry).</span> <span id="s419">And my father and my brother went this way (He points to the left).</span> <span id="s420">Shortly, we were separated from our father, and he was murdered… Judge: Just a minute Mr. Dunst.</span> <span id="s421">Are you okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Lou: I am okay.</span> <span id="s423">I can continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Judge: Are you okay to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Lou: Yes, we can go on…my father was murdered either in Auschwitz or Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Judge: Now just a moment.</span> <span id="s427">I want to make sure that I get the picture.</span> <span id="s428">You got out of the boxcars.</span> <span id="s429">You were still with your family, and you were marched somehow to a place where people told you where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Lou: Yeah, there was Dr. Mengele with his entourage.</span> <span id="s431">And everybody had a stick, and if you did not follow what they wanted you to do, they hit you, and the dogs were biting you in the legs, and this is how…</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Judge: The dogs…</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Judge: …were chasing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Judge: And when you came up you came up to a group of doctors in white coats?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Lou: They were doctors.</span> <span id="s438">No, they didn’t have white coats.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t remember seeing…</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Judge: Uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Lou: Uniforms, Uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Judge: And you’re still with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Lou: At that time we were still with our mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Judge: And then someone, you said someone… Lou: Yeah, separating you go here, you go to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Judge: Who said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Lou: The SS, the doctors.</span> <span id="s447">Dr. Mengele was there, but he was not by himself.</span> <span id="s448">He had a whole entourage.</span> <span id="s449">There were many of them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Judge: So they decided at that point to separate your family.</span> <span id="s451">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Lou: Yes, Yes.</span> <span id="s453">All the families were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Judge: How were they separated?</span> <span id="s455">I mean, what was the reason?</span> <span id="s456">What was the criteria for separating them?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Lou: They did not give us any reason or why and how.</span> <span id="s458">Now the inmates were saying that mothers who had little babies should give them away for the baby to survive.</span> <span id="s459">So can you imagine them taking away a baby from the mother—a newborn baby?</span> <span id="s460">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s461">The expressions on their faces were horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Judge: Try to describe it for us.</span> <span id="s463">I know it’s hard.</span> <span id="s464">Try to describe what happened to those mothers with those babies.</span> <span id="s465">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Lou: Well we had our own problems because they had to go this way (He points towards the right) and we were already (He points towards the left)… Judge: Who had to go that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Lou: The women, the children, whoever.</span> <span id="s468">They were separating us.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Judge: Women and children went one way?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Lou: One way, yes.</span> <span id="s471">Probably those were the children, and they probably went straight to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Judge: Why did they separate the women and the children from the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Lou: They didn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s474">They said that the women are going to do the cooking, and the men are going to go to work.</span> <span id="s475">And everything is going to be alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Judge: And the women and their children were sent in one direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Lou: Some of them went straight to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Judge: And well, did they decide in some way?</span> <span id="s479">Wasn’t there any questioning or any interviews?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Lou: There was no questioning, no interviews.</span> <span id="s481">They just looked here, here, here.</span> <span id="s482">At that time Auschwitz was a very busy place because the transports were coming in those trains.</span> <span id="s483">Thousands of people came in each train, and they probably had a hundred people in each boxcar and forty or fifty boxcars to each train.</span> <span id="s484">They were exterminating as many as twelve to fifteen thousand people in twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s485">They did not play around.</span> <span id="s486">Everything was fast.</span> <span id="s487">Whatever we did was no fast enough for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Judge: When they told your mother to go on one way and you to go the other—that was the last time you ever saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Lou: That was the last time I saw my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Judge: As far as you know, she went straight to the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Judge: What about your… Lou: I spoke with my sister, and she doesn’t want to talk about what exactly happened.</span> <span id="s493">The details she does not care to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Judge: What about your father—what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Lou: My father was separated from us, and he was murdered in either Auschwitz or Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Judge: And what happened to you?</span> <span id="s497">Tell us what happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Lou: We were marched on top of a huge pile of clothing, and we were old to undress.</span> <span id="s499">And we inquired, “What happened to the people who once wore this clothing?”</span> <span id="s500">We were told they went through the chimney.</span> <span id="s501">That was the expression—if someone was cremated, or whatever, they were going through the chimney.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Judge: So what happened?</span> <span id="s503">Did you take off all of your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Lou: We took off all of our clothes.</span> <span id="s505">They picked out the strong, young men, and they took them to the sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s506">The sonderkommando were those that carried the bodies from the gas chambers to the pits, where they burned them, or the crematoria, and they had to work under a very fast tempo.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Judge: They picked out certain young men?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Lou: Strong ones.</span> <span id="s509">The strong ones, the strong ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Judge: The strong ones, and their jobs were what?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Lou: That’s what they did.</span> <span id="s512">They dragged the bodies from the gas chambers to the crematoria or to the fire pits.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Judge: Did you see this happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Lou: Yes it was right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Judge: And then what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Lou: We went into a barrack next, and all the hair was clipped off from the body, and we were put in a barrack in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Judge: Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Lou: Birkenau, that’s right next door.</span> <span id="s519">It’s part of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s520">Actually, they call it Auschwitz II.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Judge: Where were the gas chambers?</span> <span id="s522">Were they at Auschwitz or were they at Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Lou: Most of them were in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s524">The biggest slaughter-place was Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Judge: But there were there also gas chambers at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Lou: Yes, there were some in Auschwitz, but most were in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Judge: As I understand it, you were taken to Birkenau, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Lou: Yes, we were in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Judge: Is that about a mile or so away?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Lou: Yeah, a short walk from where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Judge: And when you were in Birkenau, where were you placed there?</span> <span id="s532">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Lou: We were in Birkenau in a barrack, and across from our fence was the Gypsy camp, the Sygona Lager, as it was called in German.</span> <span id="s534">Today they were here, and the next morning they were all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Judge: So these Gypsies were also in a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Lou: Yes, they were right across the fence from us in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Judge: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Lou: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Judge: So tell us.</span> <span id="s540">Continue.</span> <span id="s541">What happened at Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Lou: In Birkenau, we were in those barracks.</span> <span id="s543">We were on quarantine.</span> <span id="s544">We were told we were going to be gassed because we were not tattooed.</span> <span id="s545">So we were going to be gassed several days later.</span> <span id="s546">We were taken to the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Judge: To the railroad in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Lou: To the railroad in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Judge: You were never taken into a gas chamber yourself in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Lou: Not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s551">Not in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Judge: Did anyone ever tell you why they were doing this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Lou: They did not.</span> <span id="s554">The only thing was that it was well-known and self-understood because we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Judge: That’s all that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Lou: That’s all now.</span> <span id="s557">When they took us to the railroad the second time, there was a big change.</span> <span id="s558">There were no children, no elderly people, and no sick people.</span> <span id="s559">Only strong young men…</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Judge: Like yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Lou: Within a certain well… Judge: You were seventeen or eighteen at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Lou: I was eighteen at the time.</span> <span id="s563">Yes.</span> <span id="s564">Let’s say they probably had people from seventeen to eighteen years old on up to forty.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Judge: And am I correct in saying that those mothers and children and sick people all went through the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Lou: At that time they were all gone.</span> <span id="s567">Yeah, they were all cremated at that time, and some of us envied them because we thought that they were all done and over.</span> <span id="s568">We thought that they were better off than we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Judge: Did you ever see your father there?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Lou: I have never seen my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Judge: How about your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Lou: My sister—I saw her after we were liberated, and several months after the war ended we found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Judge: Your brother—what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Lou: My brother was together with me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Judge: So your brother was with you.</span> <span id="s576">And then your bother went into the boxcar with… Lou: Yes, off we go from Auschwitz locked in the boxcars, and we were traveling day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Judge: When were you at Auschwitz during this period of time?</span> <span id="s578">By the way, how long were you there before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Lou: It was probably several days—maybe a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s580">Some were.</span> <span id="s581">I can not recall or say exactly how many days—probably a couple of weeks or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Judge: Were you put to work?</span> <span id="s583">Did you do any work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Lou: No, no work we did not work in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Judge: What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Lou: Well just in the barracks.</span> <span id="s587">We could only go to the toilet once every twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s588">If somebody had to do it in between, they were in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Judge: Were you fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Lou: Some, very little.</span> <span id="s591">We were given some water.</span> <span id="s592">It wasn’t even warm but dyed dark.</span> <span id="s593">It looked like tea, but it was not tea or coffee or anything like that water.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Judge: Did you receive any type of medical treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Lou: No medical treatments at all.</span> <span id="s596">Nobody even talked about medical treatments.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Judge: Did anyone ever try to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Lou: People tried to escape—not from our group, but they did try to escape, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Judge: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Lou: They were not very successful.</span> <span id="s601">Only a few were successful in escaping from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Judge: So when you left Auschwitz in the boxcar, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Lou: We didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s604">The last stop was Mauthausen in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Judge: That’s a town in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Lou: A town in Austria.</span> <span id="s607">Mauthausen, called Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Judge: How long was that trip from Auschwitz to Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Lou: Also several days and nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Judge: There were just young men in the boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Lou: Only young men.</span> <span id="s612">Young men I think—young men, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Judge: Did they ever tell you why you were going to Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Lou: No, they did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Judge: And who guarded you?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Lou: We were guarded by German SS in uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Judge: In uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Judge: And what happened when you got to Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Lou: Mauthusen is a camp on top of a hill.</span> <span id="s621">There were steps.</span> <span id="s622">There were close to two hundred steps there to go up—liked 190 steps.</span> <span id="s623">And we had to run up.</span> <span id="s624">Those who could not run fell down, and they were stepped on, so some of us made it up there, and some of us did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Judge: It’s hard for me to understand.</span> <span id="s626">You said you had to run?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Lou: Yes, because we were chased.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Judge: Who chased you?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Lou: The Germans.</span> <span id="s630">The SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Judge: Chased you with what?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Lou: With the dogs, with the sticks—sticking bayonets in our ribs.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Judge: So they made you run up these steps?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Lou: Run up those steps.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Judge: Were there any women with you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Lou: No, no women there.</span> <span id="s637">Only just those men that left from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Judge: Okay, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Lou: Well Auschwitz was very famous or infamous—whichever way you want to label it.</span> <span id="s640">They were famous for torture, extermination… Judge: Just tell us what happened to you first.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Lou: We were put into—the whole group was—put into quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Judge: What do you mean by that: in a room or in a building?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Lou: In a barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Judge: Were you told what was going to happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Lou: We were told we were going to be gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Judge: Who told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Lou: The blockaltester.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Judge: Did he tell you when?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Lou: No, no just that we were going to be gassed.</span> <span id="s650">In the mean time, night came around, and he said everybody is going to sleep, and every one of us will take up this much room (He holds up his hands to show the space between his thumb and index finger).</span> <span id="s651">We didn’t know what he was talking about.</span> <span id="s652">And he knew that, so he goes like this and this (He touches his left shoulder and right hip).</span> <span id="s653">Of course we had to sleep like this (He puts his hands one behind the other).</span> <span id="s654">He said “like Portugal sardines.”</span> <span id="s655">We had somebody else’s feet in our faces.</span> <span id="s656">And you couldn’t just turn around just on your side.</span> <span id="s657">You had to stay straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Judge: So you understand that while you were in that barrack, you were going to be taken to a gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Lou: That’s what we were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Judge: Did you see crematoria there?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Lou: No, no didn’t see it from the place where we were.</span> <span id="s662">We didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Judge: Did you hear that people were being gassed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Lou: Oh yeah, that was going on there all of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Judge: What did you hear?</span> <span id="s666">What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Lou: They didn’t tell us when, or how, or what.</span> <span id="s668">They told us we were going to be gassed.</span> <span id="s669">And we were taken to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Judge: And you were still with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Lou: Yes—with my brother, and the whole group was taken at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Judge: How was your brother?</span> <span id="s673">How was he taking all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Lou: Well he seemed to be a little stronger than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Judge: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Lou: He held up a little better than I. I wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s677">So we were taken into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s678">The doors locked, and nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Judge: And this was at Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Lou: That was Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Judge: And you were put into a gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Judge: What was the gas chamber like?</span> <span id="s684">Describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Lou: It is just a room like any other room, like a hall, and there were even… Judge: Like the room you’re in now?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Lou: Like the room—yes, it could be if you close this hermetically, and you drop Cyclone B.</span> <span id="s687">This is a gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Judge: You understood that you were going into that room to be gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Judge: And how many people were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Lou: I don’t know how many—probably several hundred.</span> <span id="s692">I don’t know how many fit in that room at that time.</span> <span id="s693">Maybe one hundred at a time or one hundred fifty; maybe two hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Judge: It was crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Lou: Yes, crowded, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Judge: And you’re all just waiting to die?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Lou: All waiting.</span> <span id="s698">We didn’t know what we were waiting for.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Judge: But you were told you were going to be gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Lou: Yeah, we were told we were going to be gassed, but nothing happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Judge: Did anyone try to fight against it?</span> <span id="s702">Or be against it in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Lou: No, we had no strength to fight or anything, or…no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Judge: Then when you’re in the gas chamber, then you’re still with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Lou: Yes, we were still… Judge: And were the doors closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Lou: The doors were locked.</span> <span id="s707">From the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Judge: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Lou: We were there, and a few minutes later—I don’t know how many—it was five or ten or fifteen or twenty minutes, I can not judge—the doors opened up.</span> <span id="s710">Everybody ran out in a hurry quickly to the Appelplatz.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Judge: And nothing happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Lou: No, no, so we went out to the Appelplatz, and the commander of the camp said that the fuel to burn our bodies is too expensive—that he would send us to a place where we are going to vanish without any cost to the Third Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Judge: Well did he tell you what he meant by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Lou: No, just simple language.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Judge: So then tell us what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Lou: Well we were given numbers: a metal plate number, one here (left wrist), and one here (left chest), and one here (right thigh).</span> <span id="s717">My group was the size of sixty-eight thousand.</span> <span id="s718">My number is 68,122.</span> <span id="s719">My brother’s number is 68,123.</span> <span id="s720">We were taken to the railroad.</span> <span id="s721">Off we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Judge: By the way did you keep those metal plates?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Lou: I still have that metal plate.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Judge: With your number on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Lou: Yes, I do have the original metal number.</span> <span id="s726">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Judge: So tell us what happened next.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Lou: We were taken to the railroad.</span> <span id="s729">Off we go—the last stop was at a new place where a camp was being built.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Judge: What was the name of that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Lou: Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Judge: That was nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Lou: That was a branch of Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s734">It was probably, maybe fifty miles or something from Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Judge: Alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Lou: We were transported there by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Judge: Again, did they tell you why they were moving you to Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Lou: They never shared any information with us at all.</span> <span id="s739">It was just, “you do this quickly and in a hurry,” and if you don’t do it fast enough, you were beat, or the dogs grabbed your legs, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Judge: You said that you were on the verge of committing suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Judge: Did you ever try to commit suicide?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Lou: I tried to figure out how to do it yes.</span> <span id="s744">And I figured the best thing was to throw myself in front of a train when the train comes.</span> <span id="s745">But it was not so easy—the facilities were not there.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Judge: Did you talk to your brother about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Lou: No, once a little bit I talked to him about it, and he detected it.</span> <span id="s748">I also tried to put it on the scale of not committing suicide, for I would be working and making bullets that would kill me.</span> <span id="s749">If I commit suicide, I will violate the commandment “thou shall not kill.”</span> <span id="s750">So I couldn’t come to a real decision.</span> <span id="s751">I had problems making the real decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Judge: So you’re at Ebensee now?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Lou: Yes, we are at Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Judge: And that’s in Austria correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Lou: It’s in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Judge: Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Lou: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Judge: And this is still the year of…</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Lou: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Judge: We’re still in the year 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Lou: 1944—we’re still in the year 1944.</span> <span id="s762">In the summer time—late summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Judge: And what happens in Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Lou: Ebensee was a very bad place.</span> <span id="s765">Conditions were hard there: starvation, beatings, and torture.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Judge: Why do you say that?</span> <span id="s767">What’s your basis for saying that?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Lou: Because that’s what was going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Judge: Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Lou: I felt it because they were beating me or my next door neighbor—whoever they were beating us.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Judge: What do you mean when you say they were beating you?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Lou: Okay…</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Judge: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Lou: We had to work in the daytime in the Steinbruch, which were the underground factories, and in the nighttime we were building the camp because the camp was just being built.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Judge: That was at Ebensee?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Lou: Yes, and they were hitting us with the roots from the trees.</span> <span id="s777">Just picked up the roots and hitting everyone anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Judge: Hitting you to do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Lou: To work faster.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Judge: And what kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Lou: We were cleaning the place, so they could put up the barracks.</span> <span id="s782">And then we had to build a crematorium because there were already bodies lying around.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Judge: And you saw those bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Lou: Yes, they were right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Judge: So these were dead bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Lou: Dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Judge: From the crematorium lying around?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Lou: Lying around.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Judge: Someone had to come and take them away?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Lou: We had to build a crematorium, so they could be cremated.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Judge: How did that feel?</span> <span id="s792">How did it feel that they were going to make you build a crematorium to kill other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Lou: They kept us under conditions where we had no time to think about what was going on.</span> <span id="s794">We were demoralized and dehumanized.</span> <span id="s795">To give you an example of the torture, the commander of the camp had specially trained dogs to attack inmates.</span> <span id="s796">So you take a group of inmates and get the dogs after them.</span> <span id="s797">The dogs were tearing them apart, and we had to look at them, and we were told, “This is what happens to people who don’t obey.”</span> <span id="s798">They hung people and said, “This is what happens to people that try to escape.”</span> <span id="s799">So they kept us scared all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Judge: Just a minute—I am sorry to make you recount this, but I want everyone to know what actually happened.</span> <span id="s801">You said they showed your people being torn apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Lou: Yes, yes—we had to look at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Judge: What did you see?</span> <span id="s804">What did you look at?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Lou: The dogs attacking the group.</span> <span id="s806">One was tearing here (He points towards the left), and one was tearing here (He points towards the right).</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Judge: They tore a body apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Lou: Yes.</span> <span id="s809">They tore their clothes and their bodies, and they bit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Judge: And then you said you saw people hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Lou: Yes, They hung them.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Judge: How many did you see hung?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Lou: Several—maybe six, eight, ten lined up, and they said, “this is what happens to people that try to escape.”</span> <span id="s814">Judge: So what happened next?</span> <span id="s815">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Lou: Well, we still had to go to work.</span> <span id="s817">As I say, they worked us day and night.</span> <span id="s818">If you work in the day time here (He points to the left), you work in the nighttime over there (He points to the right).</span> <span id="s819">Starvation was bad.</span> <span id="s820">We were freezing in the winter time, and as we got closer to winter, we didn’t have the proper clothes or proper shoes.</span> <span id="s821">We had wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s822">The bottoms of our feet were frost bitten, where they got blistered.</span> <span id="s823">We still had to go to work the way we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Judge: You worked day and night.</span> <span id="s825">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Lou: They worked us all the hours that they possibly could.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Judge: Were there any women there?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Lou: No women there.</span> <span id="s829">No women inmates.</span> <span id="s830">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Judge: Alright and how long did this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Lou: It goes on and on, day after day, week after week.</span> <span id="s833">At that time, they didn’t need any more crematoria or gas chambers because there were dead bodies all over.</span> <span id="s834">Starvation was so bad that cannibalism became stylish.</span> <span id="s835">I myself, like many others, became what they called a “musselman”—no flesh and no muscles on the body, and no desire to live.</span> <span id="s836">So we were hauled off to piles by the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Judge: How much did you weigh then?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Lou: I can not estimate how many pounds—but there were no muscles, no flesh.</span> <span id="s839">I could not even stand up.</span> <span id="s840">I was not the only one.</span> <span id="s841">We were put on piles of those who had already been dead for a number of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Judge: What part of the year was it when you were put on these piles?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Lou: This… Judge: Was that ’44 or already ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Lou: This was already springtime of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Judge: So you had stayed at Ebensee doing this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Judge: From ’44 until the spring of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Lou: Yes, until May when we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Judge: Until May of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Judge: You just said something, and I want you to describe it for us.</span> <span id="s852">You said you were placed on a pile?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Judge: Of bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Judge: Of corpses?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Lou: Yes, dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Judge: How big was this pile?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Lou: Huge.</span> <span id="s860">There was more than one pile—there were several piles—but they were huge.</span> <span id="s861">They just piled them up one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s862">Some were dying, and some were already dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Judge: Some of the bodies were moving?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Lou: Some were moving up, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Judge: Were they saying anything?</span> <span id="s866">Were they crying out?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Lou: They were crying.</span> <span id="s868">They didn’t even care to live any longer.</span> <span id="s869">This is what they call a “muscle man”—where you have no more desire to live.</span> <span id="s870">For what?</span> <span id="s871">What for?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Judge: And your brother was still with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Lou: No, my brother was in the camp, but he was not around there.</span> <span id="s874">He knew that I was taken there.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Judge: Did you and your brother ever try to help each other and give each other some emotional support?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Lou: My brother helped me quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Judge: How did he help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Lou: If not for him I would not be here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Judge: How did he help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Lou: At one time he had it a little easier because he was in a different Steinbruch, and he shared some of his food with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Judge: How did he do that?</span> <span id="s882">Was he allowed to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Lou: Well, if we met at a certain time.</span> <span id="s884">He made it his business to meet with me.</span> <span id="s885">At times, I didn’t want to take it from him because I was worried we both would die.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Judge: Did you see other family relationships, like father and son, and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Lou: Yes, there were fathers and sons, and the father would say to his son, “Well my stomach is hurting me.</span> <span id="s888">Here, you take the little food I have received.”</span> <span id="s889">He gave it to his son just to make sure that the son would survive.</span> <span id="s890">The father didn’t care about himself.</span> <span id="s891">But he worried about his son.</span> <span id="s892">So he gave him his food hoping he would survive.</span> <span id="s893">Just like my brother did with me—he gave me some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Judge: So you worked through the winter of ‘44 and ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Lou: Yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Judge: And you’re doing the same kind of work all the time right?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Lou: Well no, I was placed in different places.</span> <span id="s898">I worked in the Steinbruch.</span> <span id="s899">I worked in the smaller Steinbruch.</span> <span id="s900">I worked in Autobrookhime (?)</span> <span id="s901">.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Judge: What happened if you didn’t want to work?</span> <span id="s903">What happened if you got sick or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Lou: If somebody did not get out to the Appelplatz in order to go to work, they took them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s905">They took them in Ebensee because they had a special hospital for the Jewish, which they called the “Yiddish Yerden.”</span> <span id="s906">And in there it was a slaughter-house.</span> <span id="s907">Whoever went in there never got out.</span> <span id="s908">It was a slaughter-house.</span> <span id="s909">They called it a hospital, but it was a slaughter-house.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Judge: And tell us now about the time you were placed on this pile of bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Lou: At that time, the American Army was getting closer to the camp.</span> <span id="s912">The commander of the camp got on the loud speakers and made an announcement for everybody to go into those underground tunnels, where we were safe because the American Army was going to bombard.</span> <span id="s913">They were going to shoot their machine guns.</span> <span id="s914">So for those who were able to get into those tunnels to save their lives, they made sure to go in there.</span> <span id="s915">But what he didn’t tell us was that he had everything mined with dynamite and other explosives.</span> <span id="s916">They even pulled up a locomotive to the main opening of the camp, which was also the same as the exit.</span> <span id="s917">A locomotive filled with dynamite—all he had to do was push the button, and of those of us in there would die.</span> <span id="s918">At that time, the camp was holding around twenty-five thousand people.</span> <span id="s919">All he had to was push the button, and everybody would be buried alive, and no one would ever know what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Judge: So what happened?</span> <span id="s921">You were placed on this pile of bodies right?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Judge: And you knew the Americans were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Lou: I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Judge: You didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Lou: You had no word like that?</span> <span id="s927">I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Lou: I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s929">No, I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Judge: They took you and just placed you on this pile of… Lou: Many of us—hundreds and hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Judge: And you were placed on the top?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Lou: Yeah—well whoever was the last one was on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Judge: Were you dying at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Lou: Yes, yes if this would have lasted for another two or three hours, I would not have survived, and I didn’t care.</span> <span id="s935">I didn’t want to survive anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Judge: So what happened?</span> <span id="s937">Tell us what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Lou: Well, the American Army liberated the camp.</span> <span id="s939">That was May 6th, 1945.</span> <span id="s940">My brother came looking for me, and he shook me and said that the American Army liberated the camp.</span> <span id="s941">I couldn’t figure out what he was saying, so he said, I saw them with my own eyes!</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Judge: You were on these bodies at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Lou: Yes, I was still on that pile.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Judge: Your brother came over to talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Lou: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Judge: And did you somehow get off the pile?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Lou: Yes, I got off the pile.</span> <span id="s948">He pulled me off, and he told me that the American Army liberated the camp.</span> <span id="s949">He told me that he saw them with his own eyes—those are Americans, and we will get something to eat, and we will be free to go home.</span> <span id="s950">He even told me that he went on top of an American tank that had come into the camp and stepped on it to make sure that I believed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Judge: So how did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Lou: Well at that time I didn’t try to think about it, but looking back, I said to myself, “Where the world was I, and where was mankind?”</span> <span id="s953">Judge: And the Americans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Lou: The Americans came.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Judge: You were saved?</span> <span id="s956">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Lou: We were saved, and we were taken to Linz.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Judge: That’s a town in Austria right?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Lou: Yeah, a town in Austria.</span> <span id="s960">And from Linz on to Prague, and we were put into a hospital called the Podoli Sanatorium.</span> <span id="s961">They tried to cure us, and they told us just to eat what they gave us because some of us died from eating.</span> <span id="s962">Eating too much or too fast or whatever.</span> <span id="s963">So they cured me and many others.</span> <span id="s964">Of course I went back there fifty years later to tell them thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Judge: And eventually did you come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Lou: Yes, eventually I went to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Judge: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Lou: The best country in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Judge: After eight months of collecting evidence, the first Nuremberg war crimes trial was held.</span> <span id="s970">The trial of the main twenty-one came to an end.</span> <span id="s971">The judges representing the four Allied nations found eighteen of the twenty-one guilty.</span> <span id="s972">Three were acquitted.</span> <span id="s973">Eleven were sentenced to death by hanging, but only ten were hanged.</span> <span id="s974">One man Herman Goering, second-in-command to Adolf Hitler, cheated the gallows by committing suicide.</span> <span id="s975">When they went to get him in his cell that night they found him dead from a cyanide pill he had somehow smuggled into his cell.</span> <span id="s976">And now fifty-five years later one may well ask, “Well what did the Nuremberg Trials achieve?</span> <span id="s977">Are they of any value today?</span> <span id="s978">Did they stop war?”</span> <span id="s979">Well no.</span> <span id="s980">Of course not.</span> <span id="s981">Did they stop the atrocities of war?</span> <span id="s982">No they didn’t do that either.</span> <span id="s983">We know that from countries like Cambodia and Iraq and Rwanda and now Kosovo.</span> <span id="s984">They didn’t stop the atrocities.</span> <span id="s985">But they were still of great value.</span> <span id="s986">They were a triumph of good over evil.</span> <span id="s987">They brought to justice the worst criminals in history.</span> <span id="s988">They showed that the rule of law could be applied to punish, if not prevent, war crimes, and they set an ethical standard for all war crimes—a standard of justice and due process.</span> <span id="s989">And they set a rule that for all courts everywhere—a simple rule—but so important that no matter how heinous the crime charged may be, the accused is entitled to a fair trial.</span> <span id="s990">And the trial showed how low a richly and highly civilized nation can sink under ruthless leadership.</span> <span id="s991">And they prevented those war criminals from becoming martyrs, which they would have done had there been no trial.</span> <span id="s992">And something else—one other thing—they did something that’s very important to people like Lou Dunst.</span> <span id="s993">I have read from reliable studies that up to twenty percent of Americans still do not believe that the Holocaust ever occurred.</span> <span id="s994">That the murder of six million Jews was a myth.</span> <span id="s995">Well the record at the Nuremberg Trials stands forever.</span> <span id="s996">The record is bold and clear of what the Nazis’ did—for all to see.</span> <span id="s997">And had there been no trial that figure of twenty percent who still do not believe might well be higher.</span> <span id="s998">Before I close I would like to ask Mr. Dunst just one more question, not as lawyer to witness, but just as man to man.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Judge: Mr. Dunst…</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Lou: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Judge: There is one more question I would like to ask of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Lou: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Judge: You are a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Lou: Yes, I am religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Judge: A religious Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Lou: A very religious Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Judge: You have a strong belief in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Lou: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Judge: You have always attended synagogue.</span> <span id="s1010">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Lou: And I always will attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Judge: Let me ask you this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Lou: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Judge: In those darkest days at Auschwitz and Mauthausen, particularly that last day when you were lying on top of that pile of bodies, some dead and some dying, and you felt that you were dying yourself, did you ever wonder if God had forsaken you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Lou: God has never forsaken me.</span> <span id="s1016">He was always there.</span> <span id="s1017">We were dying—many of us.</span> <span id="s1018">Those were the darkest and saddest of days in this story of mankind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Judge: Did it ever shake your belief though?</span> <span id="s1020">Whether God existed or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Lou: My belief changed from better to better, from strong to stronger, and it does continue to change to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Judge: And nothing you saw, nothing you experienced in any way shook that belief?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Lou: No, it never did.</span> <span id="s1024">Not in me, and not in many others.</span> <span id="s1025">For thousands of others, even the atheists started to pray to God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Lou: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">End of
