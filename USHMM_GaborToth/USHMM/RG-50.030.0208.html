and my father should rest in peace, he was just like a helpless father.</span> <span id="s18">It hurt him.</span> <span id="s19">But he says, " ?"</span> <span id="s20">-- "What can I do?</span> <span id="s21">I can't go to the authorities because we are Jews, and we have to suffer."</span> <span id="s22">It's no use to go to authorities to complain that this boy, this and this boy hit me, or this boy cursed me.</span> <span id="s23">It was of no use.</span> <span id="s24">So we just had to go alone.</span> <span id="s25">And there was no other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What...what was your family life like?</span> <span id="s27">What were your parents like?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Hard working people, and they tried their best for us, like sending us to school and providing us with the best like a Jewish parents, but they also had their difficulties on account, because...because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s29">And specially after 1940 when all the Jews between 18 and 60 had to report to labor camps and I..</span> <span id="s30">.</span> <span id="s31">and my brother and I, the middle one, we had to take over my father's duty which was to deliver...uh...seltzer to our town and two, three towns around us, surroundings...more towns.</span> <span id="s32">And we had to do as I was at that time 13 years old and I had to do my father's work because we still had to live on to survive, and my father was away in labor camp.</span> <span id="s33">So we had to do work which was not for a 13 year old.</span> <span id="s34">Definitely!</span> <span id="s35">In the winter time which in Hungary is very tough winter, the snow comes down in November and it goes away in March.</span> <span id="s36">And we had to deliver the soda...seltzer with the horse and carriage.</span> <span id="s37">And sometimes, lot of times, the seltzer bottles busted from the...it was frozen, but...so I had to go down from the horse and carriage, step down...had to run, otherwise I would be frozen.</span> <span id="s38">So it was very hard.</span> <span id="s39">Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Before 1940...uh...when events were taking place all over Europe that were so terrible, in your small town what did you and your family know about these things and how did they affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: The outside world did not affect us too much.</span> <span id="s42">All we did is we heard things, but it was...what we heard, it was like unbelievable because nobody could imagine it's true, but we heard.</span> <span id="s43">And naturally...naturally, the Hungarian newspaper didn't write about it, but we heard as...specially it was very hard because by the time it came down to a small town like us from the big cities, you know, it's...uh...but people were talking, talking, but nobody had proof until a few hundred Polish Jews run away from Poland, first to Czechoslovakia and from there to Hungary because they figured the Germans not going to come into Hungary.</span> <span id="s44">And they told us stories which was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s45">They just said they just take people near the water and they shoot them in the water, just like that, and they're killing...taking ...taking fathers and they just killing and killing and killing.</span> <span id="s46">But who wanted to believe such things...that could happen in a civilized world?</span> <span id="s47">But then we had firsthand information that it is true, because they took away one family from our town.</span> <span id="s48">Our town consisted of 35 Jewish family...families.</span> <span id="s49">And from that 35 family, one was a family who came about 20, 25 years ago.</span> <span id="s50">That means...uh...25 years ago, that was in 1915, 1920, that from Poland.</span> <span id="s51">And they were considered as Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s52">And they were taken away, the whole family, in '40.</span> <span id="s53">And we didn't know nothing about where they were taken.</span> <span id="s54">We knew a year later.</span> <span id="s55">One person from the family somehow escaped, and he made it back to our town.</span> <span id="s56">That time the man was...I don't know exactly, but in the 30s.</span> <span id="s57">And then what he told us what's going on.</span> <span id="s58">But still we...uh...we're helpless.</span> <span id="s59">What can we do?</span> <span id="s60">We couldn't run away, and we had to take what he said for granted.</span> <span id="s61">But (ph) we said this could never happen in Hungary; because the Hungarian Jews...most of them...were assimilated, and they didn't consider themselves as Jews.</span> <span id="s62">They considered themselves real Hungarians.</span> <span id="s63">So why should we worry?</span> <span id="s64">Polish Jews, and Austrian Jews and this and that--there're all kind of...but could never happen by us, that's why and all...we didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s65">And that went...went on for 4 years from 1940 'til March 1944.</span> <span id="s66">We heard people said this, that, but we don't...did not believe what's going on until the Germans came into Hungary.</span> <span id="s67">And that was March 17...March 19, I think when the Hungarian...the Germans came into Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And then can you describe the changes that occurred as soon as the Germans did come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s70">First of all, we...well it took them a week or two to get organized cause they came...they worked on how to organize the Hungarian Jews to do what they did to the rest of the countries Jews.</span> <span id="s71">So it took about 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s72">First they gave an order that every Jew had to wear a yellow... yellow star.</span> <span id="s73">And then a week later, which happened to be Passover...happened to be Passover holiday... You know, in our small towns in Hungary...in Europe, people didn't read no newspapers.</span> <span id="s74">Well, the intelligent people did, but most of them didn't know how to read newspaper.</span> <span id="s75">So there were ...if there were some news, any news, a guy used to go around and poke...you know what I mean, so when...when all the people come around, let's say in radius of a tenth of a mile or a twentieth of a mile and when everybody got together, then he told the news.</span> <span id="s76">The news was that no Jew is allowed to leave town.</span> <span id="s77">Anybody gonna caught be killed right away.</span> <span id="s78">So that went on for another 2 weeks, and then came the deportation.</span> <span id="s79">How the deportation was?</span> <span id="s80">First, what they did is they got together all the Jews in the synagogue...in the synagogues of the town, because every town had a synagogue.</span> <span id="s81">From there, they got horse and carriage and they took us to the next big town to Nyíregyháza.</span> <span id="s82">It's called Nyíregyháza, where also they took us to the big synagogue over there.</span> <span id="s83">And we were there during the night and like in every big city, they made one area of the city as a ghetto where most of the Jews lived because usually in Europe in big cities there are special Jewish quarters you know where the Jew concentrated, you know, so that's...and they put in a couple of families in each apartment, Jewish apartments, and we stayed there for 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s84">And then they took us to a farm, but no more carriage.</span> <span id="s85">No more horse and carriage.</span> <span id="s86">That was only from the small town to the big town.</span> <span id="s87">From...from the big town...big city, they took us to a farm and they took us barns, big barns, you know where they used to dry the tobacco and all these things.</span> <span id="s88">And that's where we stayed another 2, 3 weeks before the deportation started.</span> <span id="s89">Well.</span> <span id="s90">.</span> <span id="s91">uh...we walked back from the...from the farm to the train station of Nyíregyháza.</span> <span id="s92">And the wagons...the wagons or the trains...I mean the train...I don't know how many...uh...wagons were waiting for us...naturally, cattle wagons, not trains where people ride, and they put us in as many people as they could put in.</span> <span id="s93">And they close the door from outside.</span> <span id="s94">There was only a small window with iron gates just to get a little air.</span> <span id="s95">For sanitation purpose there was only a pail.</span> <span id="s96">Man, woman, together!</span> <span id="s97">And that lasted 3 days.</span> <span id="s98">I'm never gonna forget there is city by the name of Kassa.</span> <span id="s99">It's called Kassa.</span> <span id="s100">K-A-S-S-A.</span> <span id="s101">But in Hungarian it's pronounced Kassa.</span> <span id="s102">And we stayed there, because that was not far from the border of Hungary and Poland.</span> <span id="s103">And my mother should rest in peace, through that window...she got up so she can reach the window.</span> <span id="s104">And she saw people outside --naturally, Gentiles--and she begged for a little water.</span> <span id="s105">And they were laughing.</span> <span id="s106">I'm never gonna forget that moment in life.</span> <span id="s107">When my mother asked for a little water, and they would...instead of saying yes or no, they were just laughing.</span> <span id="s108">On the way to Birkenau, I think that was special purpose what they did is when the train went through... uh ...wide water...with a bridge, the train special stopped.</span> <span id="s109">Somehow, for some reason, we stopped.</span> <span id="s110">And we are over the water.</span> <span id="s111">I'm never gonna forget, my father should rest in peace he said, not yelling, just quietly, "I think this is it."</span> <span id="s112">He was sure that we are going to be thrown in in the water.</span> <span id="s113">The train stayed there for 5-10 minutes; and we were continue the travelling.</span> <span id="s114">We don't know where we going, naturally.</span> <span id="s115">After 3 days, we arrived to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s116">People call it Auschwitz because it's two separate...but it's only, I think, 2 miles separate from one place to other.</span> <span id="s117">We arrived.</span> <span id="s118">We don't know where we arrived, but we were happy.</span> <span id="s119">I mean, let me put it this way--I was fifteen years old, I did not realised.</span> <span id="s120">But the grown up said, "At least we see baracks and people around."</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q.</span> <span id="s122">The whole family went with you ?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A. No my older brother, David stayed in Hungary in the labor camp.</span> <span id="s124">We arrived in Birkenau four of us: my father, my mother, my brother and myself.</span> <span id="s125">When we arrived, everybody had to go down from the train.</span> <span id="s126">Naturally, there were a lot of old people, sick people had to be taken off because they had no strength to go down from the train, specially those wagons.</span> <span id="s127">They have no steps, you know, where to jump.</span> <span id="s128">And right away, there were SS, also inmates, from the concentration camp with striped clothing.</span> <span id="s129">They...they did their dirty work.</span> <span id="s130">Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s131">And right away, they said, "Ladies, one side.</span> <span id="s132">Men, other side."</span> <span id="s133">And then there came the selection.</span> <span id="s134">That time I didn't know who that man is with the white gloves.</span> <span id="s135">But after the war, I found out.</span> <span id="s136">That was Mengele, because he was famous that he always carried white gloves.</span> <span id="s137">What happened...when they made a selection among the male population, my brother and myself said we go right.</span> <span id="s138">And my father should rest in peace, he showed us we should go left.</span> <span id="s139">And we didn't know what that time...nobody knew what means that right...right or left.</span> <span id="s140">But my father saw that his two sons are one side, and he's on the other side.</span> <span id="s141">What can be good about it?</span> <span id="s142">So when he thought that Mengele won't see it, he run over to our side.</span> <span id="s143">I'm never gonna forget, and I don't how, but he noticed it.</span> <span id="s144">He went to my father and he knocked with his white gloves on the shoulder and he showed him...go back.</span> <span id="s145">And naturally the result he went straight to the crematorium and we stayed in Birkenau for 3 days and then we were taken for to work in a concentration camp in Silesia, Poland.</span> <span id="s146">We didn't know what happened with my mother that time.</span> <span id="s147">We didn't know if she went straight or she went to a labor camp, but after the liberation a girl came home to our town and we hoped that my father gonna come home, my mother gonna come home.</span> <span id="s148">And one day she said, "I'm gonna tell you.</span> <span id="s149">Don't wait for your mother.</span> <span id="s150">Your mother died 4 weeks after the liberation in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s151">She made through the whole year working and they took her into Krakow, from Krakow to another camp and from another camp to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s152">But, like thousands and thousands of people, men and women, their stomach couldn't take the food.</span> <span id="s153">They were so weak.</span> <span id="s154">And they ate so much, they couldn't take it and they died.</span> <span id="s155">And that's what happened with my mother.</span> <span id="s156">She's...she's resting in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s157">I don't know where because I went...after I found out that she died in Bergen-Belsen and 6 months after staying home in January of 1946, I made my way to Germany...back to Germany.</span> <span id="s158">I mean at that time the borders were still like almost like free.</span> <span id="s159">You could go and I made my way to travel to Bergen-Belsen to find out where my mother is resting.</span> <span id="s160">I arrived, but Bergen-Belsen became...uh...DP camp, like a lot of these camps.</span> <span id="s161">And the Rabbi said, "Mr. Schwartz, I would gladly help you, but I want to tell you four weeks after liberation, they still buried thousands and thousands of inmates without name, without any list, who is buried where.</span> <span id="s162">It was...we couldn't handle it because too many...too many died.</span> <span id="s163">I can show you, he says, places.</span> <span id="s164">Here a place 500 inmates.</span> <span id="s165">Here a hundred...two hundred... So what I did, I went to look the place and it was like another place in and I went back...I ran back to my DP camp in Pocking, which was near Mannheim in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Can we go back to...when you were in Birkenau only 3 days days, you said, and then you went to Silesia.</span> <span id="s167">Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">Yes.</span> <span id="s170">In Silesia, they took us to a camp.</span> <span id="s171">It's called Wolfsberg.</span> <span id="s172">When we arrived, we found 20 Jewish inmates from Poland.</span> <span id="s173">They became...one became an lageraltester, and a couple of them became kapos, you know.</span> <span id="s174">And to tell you the truth, they were very rough on us.</span> <span id="s175">Why?</span> <span id="s176">Because they were Polish Jews and they yelled at us.</span> <span id="s177">You know, we suffering already 4 years while they were staying from and eating the good stuff and all these things.</span> <span id="s178">And they put together not regular barracks but in a real emergency, it was like heavy cardboard, round...round like shacks, you know.</span> <span id="s179">And we were sleeping in...on wood, one near the other, about 25 in a shack like this.</span> <span id="s180">And many came....October or November...I don't know exactly the month, and we say that they're starting to build regular barracks from wood.</span> <span id="s181">We know that we have to be prepared to stay there winter time.</span> <span id="s182">We worked...I worked night shift in tunnels.</span> <span id="s183">We...we made tunnels because there were big mountains and the mountains consisted inside of stones.</span> <span id="s184">And we made tunnels over there because that's where they were hiding machineries.</span> <span id="s185">Matter of fact, that tunnel what we were building, they told us openly that they're bringing...there was a big machinery factory in Budapest, and they bring machineries from there.</span> <span id="s186">Plus they wanted the German soldiers...they knew that the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s187">I mean 1944, they knew that the war is lost for them.</span> <span id="s188">But they wanted to kill as many Jews as possible in a hurry.</span> <span id="s189">And they wanted to hide over there in the tunnels and when the Russians come to use all kind of heavy artillery to shoot from that...from the tunnels.</span> <span id="s190">Matter of fact, my job...you see, I was still not 16 years old.</span> <span id="s191">So they had pity on me, the kapos, and I was...I was riding the locomotives because they were little wagons what carried the stone from the tunnel out.</span> <span id="s192">And I was driving the locomotive.</span> <span id="s193">It was simples ones, you know, so you didn't have to learn how to...and we carried the stones.</span> <span id="s194">We dumped it and went back for more stones.</span> <span id="s195">And one day I went back to the camp in the morning and I found out the bad news.</span> <span id="s196">My brother got hurt.</span> <span id="s197">Because he wanted to put together two wagons.</span> <span id="s198">Not with the train what I was driving.</span> <span id="s199">Somebody else was driving it.</span> <span id="s200">And he didn't realize it, and the two trains...one was fill up with stones catched...the two bumpers catched his leg.</span> <span id="s201">And that was bad news and I tell you why.</span> <span id="s202">Because any little thing happened to a person like got very bad injury on the hand or on the leg, they didn't play too much.</span> <span id="s203">They amputate.</span> <span id="s204">And the next day I came back to the camp from work and that was the news what they told me that your brother's leg.</span> <span id="s205">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s206">I think it was right leg was amputated.</span> <span id="s207">But still he was in hospital.</span> <span id="s208">So I went to visit him every day.</span> <span id="s209">He never told me.</span> <span id="s210">That's something I never gonna forget.</span> <span id="s211">He never told me what happened to him.</span> <span id="s212">He never showed me that his leg was amputated.</span> <span id="s213">He never told me.</span> <span id="s214">I knew.</span> <span id="s215">I didn't talk about it and he didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s216">And that went on for a..</span> <span id="s217">.4 weeks.</span> <span id="s218">But then the Russian came every day closer and closer to the camp.</span> <span id="s219">And the camp had to be liquidated and they took away all the people from the hospital.</span> <span id="s220">Came wagons, trucks, horse and carriages, and all the people in the hospital was taken away...uh...and it was like a district in that neighborhood which has a crematoria, because by us in the camp was no crematorium.</span> <span id="s221">And they took them away, all of them from the hospital and they got killed in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s222">And after they left...a couple of days later, we started to march to march from the camp.</span> <span id="s223">The camp has to be empty.</span> <span id="s224">Matter of fact, sometimes we even heard with our ears the noise from the fighting...the Russians and the Germans, you know.</span> <span id="s225">Bombs or heavy artillery or something.</span> <span id="s226">We heard it.</span> <span id="s227">And they...we marched a full day, and we came again to a farm with a big barn and...uh...that barn could take normally...I'm talking about standing, never mind sitting or lying down, standing I would say about 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s228">The other thousand because we have three thousand.</span> <span id="s229">The other thousand was pushed in with a bayonet.</span> <span id="s230">You know, put in to the stomach and pushed in.</span> <span id="s231">The noise, the crying what went on all night, this was unbearable because... uh...anybody couldn't have no strength to stand fell down.</span> <span id="s232">People stepped on it.</span> <span id="s233">They opened the barn door 8 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s234">That time we realized what kind of night it was because they were carrying out from the barns dead people...stepped on the body and dead.</span> <span id="s235">Anybody couldn't...didn't have no strength to stand, they were just dead and taken away.</span> <span id="s236">We marched another day and we came to a strain...train station.</span> <span id="s237">Their policy, the German policy, was, and that was general not particular but general policy of theirs was all the inmates...concentration camp inmates, summer time was carried in...in closed wagons, in winter time open wagons.</span> <span id="s238">By that time it was winter and snow was coming down and we traveled for 3 days.</span> <span id="s239">We were sitting, laying, the snow was coming on us.</span> <span id="s240">No food.</span> <span id="s241">Uh...we were passing by a big hill.</span> <span id="s242">The train was below the hill, and somehow...I don't know...a couple of people, civilians, knew...I don't know how...but some trains...some wagons, they threw in pieces of bread, but that was not enough for three thousand people.</span> <span id="s243">I mean.</span> <span id="s244">And matter of fact, we arrived to a train station Mauthausen; but we didn't know what Mauthausen is, because... Let's put it this way.</span> <span id="s245">There are two kind of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s246">There are concentration camps where people worked and they gave...they gave them food.</span> <span id="s247">You worked your 12 hours.</span> <span id="s248">You go home to the camp, and they let you to rest; you know, nobody bothered you.</span> <span id="s249">And food...it was not enough, definitely; but at least it was enough to sustain you.</span> <span id="s250">But Mauthausen, Ebensee, and Majdanek and these concentration camps was just put up for killings.</span> <span id="s251">You know, the crematoriums on the spot.</span> <span id="s252">So we didn't know what Mauthausen is, but all these places--Ebensee, Gunskirchen... All these...you see, that's the neighborhood where the Russians and the Americans got together because they're pushing from two sides, and that's the area where they got together.</span> <span id="s253">And every time from one side...other side, they always emptied camps and they were bringing them to Mauthausen, to Ebensee.</span> <span id="s254">Mauthausen was a very, very big camp...concentration camp, but they couldn't kill so fast the people...as many people came...arrived.</span> <span id="s255">So we're staying in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s256">The train...train station, SS with big dogs watching on us...they...we shouldn't jump down, you know, because it's still open train.</span> <span id="s257">And we stayed there for about 2 hours and and we traveled further and we arrived to Ebensee.</span> <span id="s258">After a 3 day traveling with an open...an open train and snow felling on us, naturally, we stayed...it's called an appell.</span> <span id="s259">You know, we stayed in the line over there in the...on the...they take...they took us in a barrack.</span> <span id="s260">And I'll never gonna forget... Naturally, we had no strength, so a lot of people sit down on the snow.</span> <span id="s261">And next to me was a man who laid down...and there was lot of dead people at that time among us...and one SS and two inmates was going around like a you call in English, a cart, you know, with...a cart to put on the dead people and take them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s262">And when they came to pick up the man laying next to me, the two inmates said to the SS, "He's still alive."</span> <span id="s263">The SS made a with the hand..."Forget about it.</span> <span id="s264">Take him."</span> <span id="s265">"Forget about.</span> <span id="s266">Take him."</span> <span id="s267">Uh...He's alive, but forget about this.</span> <span id="s268">He's finished.</span> <span id="s269">And then they took us inside the barrack, but we so many people we couldn't lay on our back.</span> <span id="s270">We had to lay sideways.</span> <span id="s271">They gave an order we should have to lay sideways because there's not enough room to lay on our back.</span> <span id="s272">And we are laying there...I remember, but then they took us to other barracks and over there we went also to work in tunnels.</span> <span id="s273">Also Ebensee is surrounded big, big mountains.</span> <span id="s274">The city is like in a valley.</span> <span id="s275">All around mountains, and we worked over there.</span> <span id="s276">I had no privilege already, like running the trains.</span> <span id="s277">I had to work with shovels to throw stones.</span> <span id="s278">One evening another guy and myself we went out to the tunnel.</span> <span id="s279">It was dark.</span> <span id="s280">And I say...we're gonna take in a little fresh air, and take a rest for 5 minutes and gonna go back.</span> <span id="s281">An SS catched us.</span> <span id="s282">And he says, "What you doing here?</span> <span id="s283">Why aren't you working?</span> <span id="s284">And why're you talking to each other."</span> <span id="s285">I says, "Well, with that little bread what we got, I lent him half of it and I want he should give it back to me."</span> <span id="s286">And they took us in...in a SS barrack where they were headquartering, you know, watching the people.</span> <span id="s287">Actually, they were not in the town.</span> <span id="s288">They were outside.</span> <span id="s289">They had there barracks.</span> <span id="s290">And first they took in the other guy.</span> <span id="s291">And I heard yelling and the yelling stopped.</span> <span id="s292">And they took me in.</span> <span id="s293">And I was prepared, you know, because I heard the other guy.</span> <span id="s294">The SS somehow he...he got pity on me because I was not 16 years old.</span> <span id="s295">He says, "Listen.</span> <span id="s296">We're gonna give you 10 lashes, if you gonna keep quiet.</span> <span id="s297">But if you're gonna yell, you're gonna get 20."</span> <span id="s298">I don't know where I took the strength, but I didn't yell and I got 10 and they send me back to a tunnel to work.</span> <span id="s299">About 2 weeks before the liberation!</span> <span id="s300">You see, they...the way they operated so that nobody could figure out what they have in mind.</span> <span id="s301">What happened...two weeks before the liberation, three SS came into our barrack and they said everybody has to stay in the line.</span> <span id="s302">And we knew right away that those people who still able to work, they're gonna take them to work.</span> <span id="s303">And those who are not able to work, they're gonna take them to the gas chamber or the crematorium and kill them.</span> <span id="s304">I'll never forget when it came mine...next, I begged them.</span> <span id="s305">I showed it that I'm still able to work....they should take me.</span> <span id="s306">I begged them like a kid could beg somebody.</span> <span id="s307">And they did not take me.</span> <span id="s308">So I was prepared that I'm going to get killed.</span> <span id="s309">But after we found out, it was just a opposite way.</span> <span id="s310">Because they knew the American are coming, and those who they think will die anyway, why...why bother to kill them.</span> <span id="s311">They're going to die anyway.</span> <span id="s312">Those who figured they could last more than two weeks, they took them...took them out, and they killed them.</span> <span id="s313">That's how I survived.</span> <span id="s314">When I got liberated...it was a Sunday, 2 o'clock, and that time...not that time, a couple of days later, the Americans, you know, they started to take care of us.</span> <span id="s315">And they weigh us.</span> <span id="s316">I weighed 70 pound.</span> <span id="s317">70 pound!</span> <span id="s318">But it looks like God wanted I should stay alive.</span> <span id="s319">What happened is Sunday afternoon they put up a big kitchen in the open...the Americans.</span> <span id="s320">And all we had to do is stand in the line, and they didn't care how many times you are standing in the line.</span> <span id="s321">You finished eating, if you want to stand in line again, you get again hot soup.</span> <span id="s322">So by...one day I had a little strength and I went in to the city.</span> <span id="s323">It was...uh...I don't know exactly...you had go over a bridge...I would say about a mile...a mile and a half.</span> <span id="s324">And I didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s325">A lot of people...they went in with friend, robbed, uh...the German families, you know, what they found.</span> <span id="s326">Me, I was a kid.</span> <span id="s327">I didn't need nothing.</span> <span id="s328">What do I need?</span> <span id="s329">So what I did is I went from one house to another eating.</span> <span id="s330">Whatever they gave me, I was eating.</span> <span id="s331">And about 10 o'clock I went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s332">And I was lucky.</span> <span id="s333">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s334">Why?</span> <span id="s335">Because I lay down.</span> <span id="s336">I lay down and while I was laying...excuse for the expression, I vomited the whole thing out.</span> <span id="s337">If that would have staying in, that would finish me.</span> <span id="s338">So that's in general what I went through in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s339">Naturally, there's stories I can tell you.</span> <span id="s340">And matter of fact, you ask me the story, but I can tell you...uh...you know, we have a book which it says if all the oceans would be ink and all the forests would be pencils, wouldn't be enough to tell the whole story.</span> <span id="s341">But that's the general.</span> <span id="s342">Then I stayed in that camp about 4 weeks until a couple of us, we got liberated...uh...three people from our town.</span> <span id="s343">We decided we're going home.</span> <span id="s344">We don't know what we're gonna find, whom we're gonna find.</span> <span id="s345">But we're going...we decided we're going home to Hungary.</span> <span id="s346">There was no train.</span> <span id="s347">There was no transportation.</span> <span id="s348">We...when I say we...is a friend of mine...it just happened he died last year...and myself.</span> <span id="s349">We knew the train is going that direction toward the border, and we sit...within two wagons, there's a round thing which locks together, you know, between the two trains, and we are sitting... He was sitting one one side, and I was sitting on other side.</span> <span id="s350">We traveled 24 hours like that.</span> <span id="s351">During the night, our job was every half minute to watch on each other we shouldn't fall asleep because if we fell asleep, we fell down, and that's a goodbye.</span> <span id="s352">We came after a whole night traveling like this...we came to a station.</span> <span id="s353">I don't know which station.</span> <span id="s354">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s355">I don't remember it was still Germany or it was already Austria or Hungary....I don't remember.</span> <span id="s356">I remember one thing.</span> <span id="s357">When it got...the light came on, it was day...daylight and the train was staying in the station, and I said to my friend, "I'm going to wash my face a little bit so freshen up a little bit."</span> <span id="s358">And I didn't know there was another train, full of SS, by the Russians taking...they took them to Russia.</span> <span id="s359">And Russians, they were so violent.</span> <span id="s360">They didn't care SS, inmates going home, you know...they so...people in that...in the station...middle of washing and a Russian soldier came over.</span> <span id="s361">He grabbed by the neck, and he showed me I should go in the wagon.</span> <span id="s362">When I saw the wagon with the SS, it...my eyes blackened...what is this?</span> <span id="s363">I am just coming from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s364">And I start crying and matter of fact, I showed him that piece of paper what I got when I got liberated by Americans.</span> <span id="s365">And usually the Russian soldiers, you know, if they would see a paper like this they don't...they don't care.</span> <span id="s366">Somehow the Russian soldier, he didn't know how to read it; and he gave it to one of the SS in the wagon, and he somehow explained to the Russian soldier that I'm just coming home from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s367">And he said, "Go."</span> <span id="s368">It didn't took...it wouldn't take not too much that I would wind up in Siberia with...uh...with SS, you know, together with...with those people who killed us.</span> <span id="s369">Because the Russians...matter of fact, a lot of Hungarian Jews after the liberation, they took them to Siberia...Siberia.</span> <span id="s370">Because if they wanted 100 people, they didn't care who the 100 people is, as long as 100 people go.</span> <span id="s371">So after traveling...uh...nice couple of days, we arrived to Budapest.</span> <span id="s372">And by that time...you see...uh...Budapest was liberated in January of 1945.</span> <span id="s373">Because you see, the Russians coming from Hungary, they're going to Austria and then to Germany.</span> <span id="s374">So it took to May and the war...the second world war ended May 8.</span> <span id="s375">I got liberated 2 days before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s376">Like I mentioned before that's...that's where the area where they got together, the Russians and Americans.</span> <span id="s377">And when I arrived to Budapest, naturally, the first thing we did, my friend and myself, we found out there any Jews alive.</span> <span id="s378">Or something.</span> <span id="s379">Anything.</span> <span id="s380">So they telled...they told us, "Yes, they's a..</span> <span id="s381">.</span> <span id="s382">by the Jewish synagogue there an organization where they're getting money from the United Jewish Appeal.</span> <span id="s383">And everybody who goes there and say they are just coming from Germany gets a couple of pengö...--like a dollar, you know.</span> <span id="s384">And we can continue our destiny wherever we wanta go (cough) go and...uh...we did continue and...uh.</span> <span id="s385">.</span> <span id="s386">and I arrived in the town where I was born.</span> <span id="s387">I found my brother in the station.</span> <span id="s388">He wanted to travel somewhere.</span> <span id="s389">With the same train as I arrived, he wanted to take the same training going further...the same direction where the train was going.</span> <span id="s390">When he saw me, naturally, he didn't take the train anymore.</span> <span id="s391">You know, the happiness was unbelievable that I'm alive.</span> <span id="s392">And later on, 5 months, but...I got home the end of June.</span> <span id="s393">The communism in Hungary got stronger and stronger by the day.</span> <span id="s394">And by November of 1945, they called in my brother, questioning him.</span> <span id="s395">From what he see, living, he's not working.</span> <span id="s396">Where is he taking the money to live on?</span> <span id="s397">And the anti-Semitism was very bad.</span> <span id="s398">All we heard from the Gentiles...from neighbors where we lived together all our lives, they said to us, "How could it be...how could it be so bad?</span> <span id="s399">You came back more people than they took you.</span> <span id="s400">We came back from 35 families...we were together 105 people got deported, and we came back I think 6.</span> <span id="s401">And they had the nerve to say, "How could it be so bad if you came...came back more people than they took you?"</span> <span id="s402">So I saw there's no future, and I went up to Budapest and over there they organized transport to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s403">I didn't know that time what's in Germany, but I know here's no good.</span> <span id="s404">Here's no good so I have to leave.</span> <span id="s405">I didn't...besides my brother I didn't find...our house was bombed from the Germans.</span> <span id="s406">My parents never came...didn't come back and my brother.</span> <span id="s407">So I went to Germany.</span> <span id="s408">I stayed there 2 years.</span> <span id="s409">But my life was...on the road to Germany, we stopped in Austria...in Vienna, and I wrote a letter to my brother.</span> <span id="s410">I said, "Look, they're helping us.</span> <span id="s411">Get up.</span> <span id="s412">Come.</span> <span id="s413">I don't know what's the future, but there's no future there.</span> <span id="s414">Come."</span> <span id="s415">Matter of fact.</span> <span id="s416">.</span> <span id="s417">uh.</span> <span id="s418">.6 months later, he joined me in Germany.</span> <span id="s419">I forget to mention to you...it's very...also a very tricky thing what they did to Germans.</span> <span id="s420">When we arrived to Birkenau, they had...uh...sand...a pile...a big pile of sand.</span> <span id="s421">And we were...they gave us cap...round cap.</span> <span id="s422">In the cap, we had to take the sand, the whole pile of sand, carry...uh...like a quarter of a mile.</span> <span id="s423">Filled...everybody had to fill in the cap, empty it, and come back, empty it again...I mean fill it up again and carry it, and we had to make it fast because slow is no good.</span> <span id="s424">Fast...we had to make it fast.</span> <span id="s425">And next day in Birkenau, they gave us post cards.</span> <span id="s426">And we were so naive, so...we didn't know what's what, they gave us as many post cards we wanted to write to our parents, to our brothers, to our sisters.</span> <span id="s427">Our parents are dead already, but they give us...they gave us post cards to write.</span> <span id="s428">How...this how tricky they were, you know, just to fool people.</span> <span id="s429">You never know what they were up to.</span> <span id="s430">And I stayed 2 years in the DP camp and it was...maybe I didn't know how to approach, but it was very hard to get a visa to come to the United States because there were too many applicants.</span> <span id="s431">Not only Jews, Gentiles....there was other camps with Gentiles also.</span> <span id="s432">They said they're also refugees.</span> <span id="s433">Polish, Russians, Hungarians.</span> <span id="s434">So after staying for 2 years, I..</span> <span id="s435">.</span> <span id="s436">somebody told us there is a way somehow.</span> <span id="s437">The way is to go west to France, and from there we can take...we can apply for a student visa, going, studying.</span> <span id="s438">So I stayed 2 years in Paris.</span> <span id="s439">Matter of fact, one of the Rabbis in a small town gave me a paper that he's asking the American Embassy to let me go to the United States to study for a year and he's giving me a position as a assistant Rabbi in the town.</span> <span id="s440">And I got the student visa.</span> <span id="s441">Naturally, I never went back.</span> <span id="s442">Well, I got the visa for 1 year and after a year I didn't go back.</span> <span id="s443">I'm not supposed to work, but...in the United States because I'm a student and I loved to work.</span> <span id="s444">So what shall I do?</span> <span id="s445">I have to eat.</span> <span id="s446">I have to pay where I stayed for the lady.</span> <span id="s447">So I took up a false first name.</span> <span id="s448">And I took out a Social Security Card.</span> <span id="s449">And I went to work.</span> <span id="s450">5 minutes.</span> <span id="s451">Alright.</span> <span id="s452">Can you give us 5 minutes?</span> <span id="s453">Uh...you can help me?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: You were talking about going to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yal.</span> <span id="s456">One evening...one evening I came home from work and this was around 6 o'clock and one lady who lived on the same floor because I lived in an apartment house, she run...she was waiting for me to come home.</span> <span id="s457">And she was so excited she didn't know to tell me.</span> <span id="s458">I said, "Tell me what happened?"</span> <span id="s459">She says, "Mr. Schwartz, what happened with you?"</span> <span id="s460">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s461">"The FBI is looking for you."</span> <span id="s462">The FBI!</span> <span id="s463">So I knew right away.</span> <span id="s464">I says...I forget already her name, Mrs. King.</span> <span id="s465">Yal...Mrs. King.</span> <span id="s466">I said, "Mrs. King, Don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s467">I guarantee it.</span> <span id="s468">Believe me.</span> <span id="s469">I didn't kill nobody.</span> <span id="s470">I didn't steal, and I know why they're looking for me."</span> <span id="s471">So 10 o'clock that evening the FBI showed up and they took me to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s472">But this Ellis Island, I tell you the truth was my second trip because when I arrived with the boat as a student, they also took me there.</span> <span id="s473">So I knew.</span> <span id="s474">Ellis Island, it's...I..</span> <span id="s475">.</span> <span id="s476">you can't call it a prison, but you were still locked up.</span> <span id="s477">So they took me to Ellis Island, and next day I had the right to call somebody so naturally, I called my brother and he got in touch with a gentleman who was doing this kind of work, putting up bails for people like me whom they took to Ellis Island, you know, as a student.</span> <span id="s478">So he posted a $500 bond.</span> <span id="s479">And I went...and I got freed from Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s480">I went back to my house, and I went back to work because I had no other...no other way than to work.</span> <span id="s481">I called up somebody from the Democratic party in Brooklyn, and he...they gave me a lawyer to take care of my papers.</span> <span id="s482">"Yes, Mr. Schwartz, I'm gonna work in behalf of you.</span> <span id="s483">But we have to go through a hearing on Ellis Island."</span> <span id="s484">I went through a hearing 4 hours.</span> <span id="s485">The 4 hours consisted from 10:00 to 12:00 and from 2:00 to 4:00.</span> <span id="s486">They questioned me very hard.</span> <span id="s487">Mine answer was, "Listen, I can't help myself.</span> <span id="s488">I have no where to go.</span> <span id="s489">I have no where to go."</span> <span id="s490">You see, that time there was not...not even an Israel.</span> <span id="s491">Israel was established 1948.</span> <span id="s492">I says, "You can...you can't throw me out because I have no where to go."</span> <span id="s493">And I was still young.</span> <span id="s494">And so they told me that I have to go to any three embassies, representing three countries, and make application they should take me.</span> <span id="s495">And I..</span> <span id="s496">.</span> <span id="s497">I did made application, and... So we had to go back to the second hearing, and I told them nobody wants me.</span> <span id="s498">And I cannot go back to Hungary; because if I go back to Hungary, I facing the second concentration camp.</span> <span id="s499">They questioned me all kind of questions...uh ... if....</span> <span id="s500">They figured maybe I'm sympathizing with communists, and they asked me mine opinion about communism.</span> <span id="s501">And I told them mine opinion is the Germans used to wear green shirt and...uh... communists wear red shirts, but they are the same.</span> <span id="s502">And I got permission to stay in the United States.</span> <span id="s503">After 2...2, 3 years I got mine green card.</span> <span id="s504">After that I got my citizen papers, and I'm thankful to the United States to give me a place.</span> <span id="s505">And I growed up a family...a nice family, and I make a nice living.</span> <span id="s506">I would say about an average, and besides everyday troubles, I'm happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: That was very well done.</span> <span id="s508">Can you tell me about the last few weeks in Ebensee?</span> <span id="s509">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: There's no word for it...to describe it.</span> <span id="s511">The cruelty and what we went through, because their function...when I'm talking about their function...the SS function, was the more people to kill because every day thousands and thousands of other inmates arriving to Ebensee because that was the area where the Russians and American meet each other.</span> <span id="s512">You see, we were liberated May 6.</span> <span id="s513">Two days later the war was over.</span> <span id="s514">So it...that's where they met, the Russians and the Americans.</span> <span id="s515">So their function was to kill as many people...as many people they brought in from all other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s516">But with all their technic...with all geniuses what they put in how to kill more Jews, they couldn't kill as fast as they were coming in.</span> <span id="s517">And there was no food whatsoever.</span> <span id="s518">Even the SS were going hungry.</span> <span id="s519">Even they were getting very little food.</span> <span id="s520">And naturally the human nature, those people who are still have a little strength to walk and we still went to work, and because we knew those people who are gonna say I have no strength to go to work gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s521">Without food.</span> <span id="s522">We got in the morning a little...I won't call it coffee...a little black colored water.</span> <span id="s523">And people were so desperate, they were chewing coal, sucked coal, eating grass.</span> <span id="s524">And I have to say it that they lost all humanity whatever you call it, and those people who died during the night and few of them they still had on their lower part some meat...some meat, when we got up in the morning, we saw those people dead.</span> <span id="s525">But the way they were carrying them, we saw that pieces of the body were missing.</span> <span id="s526">And during the morning or after work, they made somehow a little fire, and they put it on like they say in the United States, they barbecued and they ate it.</span> <span id="s527">I am very fortunate to say I never touched it.</span> <span id="s528">But there was a lot of them eating it.</span> <span id="s529">And it was...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s530">We got liberated May 6 in 1945 which came out a Sunday.</span> <span id="s531">Saturday, they hanged 12 people in middle of the camp on the gallows, and all those people who stayed who can still walk had to go march in front of them to see how they were hanging from the gallow.</span> <span id="s532">Another thing...very interesting thing happened.</span> <span id="s533">Looked likes there was some...couple...not some, but a couple Germans who still couldn't take it what's going on.</span> <span id="s534">What happened is we got liberated Sunday.</span> <span id="s535">Friday evening before we went to bed, there was a message from the Mayor of Ebensee.</span> <span id="s536">And the message was that we gonna go tomorrow morning...that means Saturday morning...from appell...appell it's called, you know, where you have to stand in the line.</span> <span id="s537">And the SS gonna tell us that the Russians are very close and in order to get saved, we shouldn't get hurt, we all should go in the tunnel.</span> <span id="s538">And the tunnel was prepared...the gate, you know, after you go in to bomb the gate and we all gonna die there.</span> <span id="s539">So the Mayor sent a message that he don't know if it's gonna help or not, but when we gonna stand in appell Saturday morning and we gonna hear that speech, we should all start yelling with one voice, "We don't care if we gonna go....if we gonna get killed, we're not gonna go nowhere.</span> <span id="s540">We're staying here."</span> <span id="s541">And it looks like they have got the strength...they didn't have the strength or the willingness to force us anymore because they know it's 1 day or 2 days left and we didn't go.</span> <span id="s542">And that was fortunate who had still...uh...had to stand, stayed alive.</span> <span id="s543">But it was prepared to kill, and that was the easiest way to kill us, to go in the tunnel and...uh...bomb the...uh...gate, you know, so all the stones would fell down from the mountains, and we couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s544">That's all.</span> <span id="s545">And they...maybe they would never find us.</span> <span id="s546">That we are there.</span> <span id="s547">I don't know how many thousands people buried alive.</span> <span id="s548">But somehow the Mayor from Ebensee sent us a message Friday evening that we shouldn't go.</span> <span id="s549">So that's the story of
