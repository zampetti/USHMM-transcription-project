id="s2">NL: This is Nora Levin, August 17th, 1987, interviewing Mr. Milton Harrison.</span> <span id="s3">Good morning.</span> <span id="s4">Good morning, Mr. Harrison.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">MH: Good morning, Dr. Levin.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">NL: Now, if you'll be good enough first, Mr. Harrison, to tell us a little about the areas where your particular army unit was just prior to your coming into the Buchenwald area.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">MH: Prior to coming into the Buchenwald area, it was actually the mornings of April 10th and 11th while we were in an assembly area just outside of Mühlhausen, Germany.</span> <span id="s8">The purpose there was to reorganize, get our orders, and then move out to accomplish new missions that had been assigned to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">NL: And what unit was that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">MH: I served with the Ninth Armoured Infantry Battalion of the Sixth Armoured Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">NL: Of the Sixth Armoured Division.</span> <span id="s12">Very good.</span> <span id="s13">And, had you been directed to go into the Mühlhausen area?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">MH: Well, we ended our line of march there, and were waiting for further orders.</span> <span id="s15">At that time we supposed that we were going to head for Berlin.</span> <span id="s16">There were rumors that there were orders to that effect.</span> <span id="s17">We found out that those orders had been changed, and that we were to proceed due east.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NL: Due east.</span> <span id="s19">So you were in the Mühlhausen area on the 10th and 11th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">MH: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">NL: This is obviously 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">MH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s24">MH: No, that's 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">NL: '45.</span> <span id="s26">This is after, oh, just before the victory, the Allied victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">MH: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">NL: I'm sorry, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">MH: It was shortly before the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">NL: Shortly before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s31">Were you at all aware of what had been happening to Jews in Europe prior to this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">MH: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s33">Because I received a lot of communication from home, from my mother, from the members of the congregation that I belonged to.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">NL: What congregation was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">MH: That was Beth El, in West Philadelphia, 58th and Walnut Streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">NL: And you had heard in '44 or '45, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">MH: In '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">NL: In '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">MH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s40">I had received some notes from my mother, some notes from the people in the congregation about stories that were trickling back to the States about the atrocities going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">NL: Did they include...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">MH: Actually, in the army itself we heard nothing about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">NL: Nothing in Stars and Stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">MH: Nothing in the Stars and Stripes that I can recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">NL: And, in your letters from home, do you remember if your folks quoted any sources?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">MH: Now that I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NL: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">MH: But I do remember, you know, hearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">NL: They had had some word.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">MH: They had some words, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">NL: They had some information.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">MH: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NL: All right, and so, what happened then on April 11th?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">MH: Well, about dawn on April 11th we had orders to proceed east from where we were, with no time objectives, but to reach the Saale River.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NL: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">MH: I believe it's S-A-L-L-E.</span> <span id="s57">[actually it is S-A-A-L-E] And...</span></p> <p><span id="s58">NL: That's due east from Mühlhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">MH: From Mühlhausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">NL: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">MH: And establish a bridge there across the river there, which was the Weisse Saale River.</span> <span id="s62">And we proceeded to move from there, and we were moving very rapidly.</span> <span id="s63">Our division was splitting to different columns, and we were in the southern most column, on the front that we were covering.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">NL: And why are you mentioning that particularly, was that of some importance in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">MH: Yes, because the troops in our division and those supporting us were strung out for some 60 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: Oh my.</span> <span id="s67">How many men were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">MH: Well, in our battalion there were 980 men.</span> <span id="s69">In the division there was over 10,000.</span> <span id="s70">We...</span></p> <p><span id="s71">NL: Now this--excuse me, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">MH: We met little or no resistance in our advance and sometime around mid-day, we by-passed the city of Weimar, for a number of reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">NL: And in this stretch out of 60 miles were some of the men then aware of Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">MH: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">NL: Not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">MH: We passed Weimar, and we were moving a little slower than we had been all day, but still advancing very fast.</span> <span id="s77">And at that time our battalion was at the furthest east penetration that had been made.</span> <span id="s78">And we came to a town, it must have been close to 2:00 in the afternoon, of Hadelb--Hadels--I'll give you the name of it [pause] Haddelstadt [phonetic].</span></p> <p><span id="s79">NL: Haddelstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">MH: And when we got into Haddelstadt we met a little resistance and captured some S.S. troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NL: Had you seen any German civilians on the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">MH: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s83">We bypassed many little villages and towns and crossroads with two and three houses.</span> <span id="s84">But there was no indication at all of anything like Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NL: What was the reaction of the German civilians as you were marching through?</span> <span id="s86">Did you detect any special expressions or indications of welcome or anger?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">MH: There was both.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">NL: Both.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">MH: The children were excited, because they--I can still see them standing on the sidewalk and by the houses, shouting, "Panzer!</span> <span id="s90">Panzer!"</span> <span id="s91">which is, "Tank!</span> <span id="s92">Tank!"</span> <span id="s93">The Germans seemed to be enthralled with tanks.</span> <span id="s94">We didn't get a chance to talk to any of the civilians because we didn't stop.</span> <span id="s95">We just kept moving.</span> <span id="s96">When we slowed down for any reason, [chuckling] I have to mention this, the only reason we left the tanks or the half tracks or the Jeeps was to relieve ourselves and then to hop back into the vehicle we were assigned to, and take off again.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">NL: Did you encounter, or did you expect to encounter any other military units in this drive east?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">MH: From the intelligence information that we had, there was troops in front of us.</span> <span id="s99">We weren't sure as to what type of troops or the numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">NL: American?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">MH: No .</span> <span id="s102">I'm speaking of German now.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">NL: German, I see.</span> <span id="s104">Wh-...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">MH: We knew at this point that the nearest American troops to us were 60 to 80 miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">NL: Behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">MH: Behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">NL: [unclear.]</span></p> <p><span id="s109">MH: Yes, following us.</span> <span id="s110">Our column, our battalion was stretched out at that point over maybe 20 or 30 miles, in length.</span> <span id="s111">I was with the point of the column.</span> <span id="s112">I was the medical NCO for the outfit.</span> <span id="s113">I was the acting First Sergeant of the Medical Detachment.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NL: And are we still on the 11th now?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">MH: We are still on the 11th.</span> <span id="s116">As I said, around one to two o’clock we came to Haddelstadt, where we encountered some S.S. troops, and overpowered them, and started to question them.</span> <span id="s117">And this was the first that we had stopped since about five or six o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s118">We got nothing from them as to any information.</span> <span id="s119">They just wouldn't talk.</span> <span id="s120">They gave, they invoked the Geneva Convention, which was a joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">NL: Hmm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">MH: And wouldn't say anything further than that.</span> <span id="s123">When suddenly out of the woods Russian soldiers appeared.</span> <span id="s124">And we were quite surprised by this.</span> <span id="s125">They had German arms, and began shooting at the POWs that we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">NL: The S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">MH: The, shooting at the S.S., yes.</span> <span id="s128">We overpowered them and disarmed them.</span> <span id="s129">And kept...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">NL: You overpowered the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">MH: The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">NL: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">MH: Yes.</span> <span id="s134">And we began interrogating them, to find out where they came from.</span> <span id="s135">And this was the first that we heard of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">NL: From the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">MH: From the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">MH: They began telling us stories of horror, of hangings and killings and starvation, burnings and incinerators and the officers and men that were there couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s140">And since we were so far and communications were difficult--our battalion executive officer was Captain Bob Bennett--and Bob was in charge of the two columns that we were in, decided to send our recon and intelligence crew into the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: To Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">MH: To Buchenwald, to verify the stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">NL: Now excuse me.</span> <span id="s144">Did the Russians say they had liberated the prisoners at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MH: The, no, the Russians were POWs there.</span> <span id="s146">They had been captured...</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">MH: ...from a period of maybe three to four weeks prior to that to maybe a couple of months before that and were sent there.</span> <span id="s149">They were in a separate section.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">NL: Separate from...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">MH: From, yes, from what they...</span></p> <p><span id="s152">NL: From other prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">MH: From the other prisoners, from what they told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">NL: Do you know if there were any Jewish prisoners of war among them?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">MH: No, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">NL: And they, these prisoners of war had escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">MH: Yes, prior to their escape, they and some of the healthier inmates in the camp overpowered what S.S. troops remained in the camp, because the majority of the German troops had fled.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">MH: And they told us that they had prisoners back there, but they went out to see how close the American troops were and didn't realize that we were as close as we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">NL: Where had they gotten their arms?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">MH: From the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">NL: From the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MH: From the Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NL: ... at Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">MH: ... at Buchenwald...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NL: Did they kill...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">MH: ... that they overpowered.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NL: ... some of the S.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">MH: Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">NL: And you stopped them?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">MH: Uh, well they, the immediate group that we were with, they wounded some of them, but they hadn't killed them.</span> <span id="s172">We stopped them from shooting.</span> <span id="s173">Now there were other bands, they told us, roaming through the countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">NL: People who had escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MH: People that had escaped.</span> <span id="s176">Mostly the Russian POWs.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">NL: POWs.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">MH: They explained...</span></p> <p><span id="s179">NL: And what...</span></p> <p><span id="s180">MH: ... that the people in the camp weren't in too much of a shape to do anything but stay there.</span> <span id="s181">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s182">NL: How did they look to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">MH: The Russian soldiers didn't look too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">NL: They...</span></p> <p><span id="s185">MH: They were undernourished, but they weren't at the, any place near the point of starvation.</span> <span id="s186">I'll get into that as we...</span></p> <p><span id="s187">NL: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">MH: ... proceed.</span> <span id="s189">With the reconnaissance section on its way to Buchenwald with two of the Russian POWs, the others had been sent to the rear for further interrogation and for processing.</span> <span id="s190">We were passing them back along the column.</span> <span id="s191">We proceeded to our objective that was some 30 miles still ahead of us.</span> <span id="s192">We were way ahead of schedule, because they figured it was going to take two to three days for us to get to the Saale River.</span> <span id="s193">About a half an hour later, and this is approximately around four o’clock, five o’clock in the, no, it could--approximately about six o’clock in the afternoon, Captain Bennett suddenly realized that he'd sent a tank, with four men in it, with no support.</span> <span id="s194">And I got a call on the radio to take two medical jeeps and two half tracks of infantry and proceed back along the line of march and pick up at the point where the recon crew took off for Buchenwald, and to follow them and catch up with them, and support them.</span> <span id="s195">Well, we proceeded back along that route, back to the--back to Haddelstadt.</span> <span id="s196">Went down the road that Captain Kiefer had taken and came to a crossroad and didn't know which way to go.</span> <span id="s197">We choose one road--we chose one road and proceeded down it, and we ran into small arms fire.</span> <span id="s198">Our orders had been to avoid any combat, so we called for smoke to cover us so that we could get away and almost immediately smoke grenades were fired in and we took off.</span> <span id="s199">We proceeded down the road for about three or four miles and we came to a camp.</span> <span id="s200">In this camp were nothing but children.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">NL: Excuse me, was this Buchenwald all, you're just...</span></p> <p><span id="s202">MH: Now this was part of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s203">This was called Little Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">MH: And in this camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s206">NL: Nothing but children.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">MH: There was nothing but children.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">NL: About how many do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">MH: Dr. Levin, there was so many of them that I don't remember what the number was.</span> <span id="s210">It was considerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">NL: It was a large mass.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">MH: It was a large mass of children.</span> <span id="s213">The average age was maybe about ten, twelve, fourteen years of age.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">NL: You imagine these were Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">MH: They were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">NL: They were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">MH: They might be German, but I didn’t talk to them.</span> <span id="s218">Seven-eighths of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s219">The other eighth were the children of political prisoners, Communists, and in some cases orphans who...</span></p> <p><span id="s220">NL: Can you describe what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">MH: Well, the children weren't in too bad of a shape.</span> <span id="s222">They were very hungry and they were very tired, because they were worked at gathering wood in the forests and some of them worked in factories.</span> <span id="s223">And we were only there for about ten, twelve minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">NL: Could you leave anything for them?</span> <span id="s225">You didn't have any food...</span></p> <p><span id="s226">MH: We didn't have anything to relieve them.</span> <span id="s227">We told them to stay where they were, and that someone would get to them as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s228">We did ask if anybody there spoke English, and quite a few of them did.</span> <span id="s229">And we told them what we were looking for, and they gave us directions...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">NL: To the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">MH: To the main camp.</span> <span id="s232">We had to back track to the crossroad and follow their directions.</span> <span id="s233">I don't remember which way they told us to turn...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">NL: Do you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">MH: ... at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">NL: Excuse me, do you have any idea from which countries these children came?</span> <span id="s237">Could you detect?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">MH: They were from all of the European countries--France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, I don't know if there were any Ukrainian or Russian kids there.</span> <span id="s239">The few that we spoke to were from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">NL: From France.</span> <span id="s241">And they knew enough English to be able to communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">MH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s243">It's quite possible that Robert Clarey was one of these children.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">MH: But in speaking with him a few years ago, very briefly, he said that he didn't remember speaking to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">NL: Did any of them look as though they were on the point of perishing, or were they functioning?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">MH: The children were functioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">NL: They were.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">MH: They weren't on the point of functioning...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">NL: I..</span> <span id="s251">.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">MH: In that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">NL: In that, yes.</span> <span id="s254">I ask because Buchenwald was supposed to be quote, a “privileged” camp as you probably know.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">MH: Privileged?</span> <span id="s256">They were privileged to do two things: work and die.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NL: I'm saying that in quotation marks, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">MH: So am I.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s260">Yes.</span> <span id="s261">So, you only stayed for a bit and then you went on to...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">MH: A bit, and then we proceeded to the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NL: And how far away was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">MH: About five, six miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">MH: On the way, it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s267">NL: This was quite isolated then.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">MH: ... separated.</span> <span id="s269">It was quite isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">NL: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s271">Any signs of Germans within the range of your...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">MH: The only--at that time, we didn't know whether the small fire arms fight that we ran into on the way to Little Buchenwald were from German sol, the firing was from German soldiers or from Russian soldiers that were roaming the countryside.</span> <span id="s273">Sporadically we heard outbursts of fire.</span> <span id="s274">And on the way to Little Buchenwald and from Little Buchenwald to the main camp it could have been S.S. troops, it could have been the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s275">It could have been the two groups shooting at each other.</span> <span id="s276">But we encountered no further resistance from Little Buchenwald to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s277">When we got to the gates of Buchenwald, we broke the gates down.</span> <span id="s278">There was no resistance, and in front of us we saw these rows on rows of barracks.</span> <span id="s279">The sergeant in charge of the infantry and I determined that the best thing to do would be to sweep through the barracks and see what was going on, and when we opened the barracks doors it was our first indication and our first sight.</span> <span id="s280">And it was a devastating sight.</span> <span id="s281">What we saw were human skeletons walking around.</span> <span id="s282">People were sick, lame, maimed, undernourished to the point their bellies were swollen.</span> <span id="s283">Upon closer examination by me and my three other medics that were with me, there were people with body sores, ulcers from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s284">We didn't go through all the barracks because we didn't have enough men to do that.</span> <span id="s285">There were 28 of us.</span> <span id="s286">There were the 24 infantry men and the four medical personnel that Captain Bennett had dispensed.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">NL: Excuse me for interrupting.</span> <span id="s288">Were there several buildings in the main camp or many or...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">MH: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s290">It was like a good-sized little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s292">And you went through just...</span></p> <p><span id="s293">MH: We went through maybe a quarter or so of the barracks.</span> <span id="s294">Then we went outside, and when we got outside we didn't see Captain Bennett's tank and we start looking around for German soldiers around.</span> <span id="s295">We found some, that the inmates of the camp and the Russian POWs had staked down to the ground.</span> <span id="s296">We told the people in the camp to keep them under guard and hold them there, and that help would be on the way.</span> <span id="s297">In the meantime I tried to get a radio message out that there was nothing that I could do, that the medical situation was far beyond our comprehension and we didn't have the facilities even to begin to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">NL: So you had some communication with some of the inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">MH: Well, we put a message out but we weren't sure that anybody was going to receive it at that point because we knew how fast everything was moving and how far everything was spread out.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">NL: But I mean you were able to talk to some of the inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">MH: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s302">There were people there that spoke English and I could manage to talk to some of them in the broken Yiddish that I spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">NL: Do you think...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">MH: But they were surprised to find that there was a Jewish soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">NL: Were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">MH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">MH: Among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">NL: These were mostly or all Jews do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">MH: These were mostly all Jews.</span> <span id="s311">There were a couple of Luxembourgers and Belgians.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">NL: Non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">MH: Non-Jews, that were there, that had been in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">NL: Political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">MH: Political prisoners sent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">NL: But they were thrust into the same...</span></p> <p><span id="s317">MH: They were thrust into the same thing.</span> <span id="s318">There were some gay people there and I'm not sure, but I think there were even some people there that had been connected with the churches.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">NL: Jehovah's Witnesses, possibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">MH: Well, it's possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">NL: Because they were persecuted too.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">MH: Yeah, they were another denomination.</span> <span id="s323">And I didn't have the time to find out, nor did any of the men who were with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">NL: Were any of them able to walk about and did they seem functional, or were they all in this quite dreadful...</span></p> <p><span id="s325">MH: There was varying stages of--we'll call it health, for lack of anything else.</span> <span id="s326">From the people that were on the point of dying, up to people who were in fairly good shape.</span> <span id="s327">No one was in really great shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">NL: Had they told--any of them told you that they had been working?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">MH: Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">NL: Or didn't you have time to...</span></p> <p><span id="s331">MH: We didn't have time really to determine that.</span> <span id="s332">There was fast communication.</span> <span id="s333">We were more interested in the appraisal on a military situation because we were out on a limb too.</span> <span id="s334">The heaviest weapon we had with us was a fifty caliber machine gun.</span> <span id="s335">The rest was all small arms--rifles and side arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">NL: Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s337">MH: When we were getting ready to leave...</span></p> <p><span id="s338">NL: Could I just interrupt you for another minute, please?</span> <span id="s339">When you say you were, you sent out a message, and then you said you weren't sure anybody picked it up, did I understand that correctly?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">MH: That's right.</span> <span id="s341">We didn't know, because of the type of radio that we had with us, that the range was sufficient for anybody to pick it out.</span> <span id="s342">And, the radio that we had with us was a battalion channel radio.</span> <span id="s343">And it had one outside channel for the combat command that we were in, which was CCA, Combat Command A.</span> <span id="s344">But we weren't sure that anybody would have picked up the message that we sent out.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">NL: Do you think you were, do you know if you were indeed the first military, American military unit to see...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">MH: Unequivocally.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">NL: Unequivocally.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">MH: Unequivocally.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">NL: This was...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">MH: I can state...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">MH: ... that the first American soldiers there were Captain Kiefer and his reconnaissance crew, which consisted of four men, and the 28 men that were sent by Captain Bennett to support and to look for him.</span> <span id="s353">We were the first American soldiers there.</span> <span id="s354">In fact, until we were relieved, with one exception, the crew that had fired the smoke that covered us was from an engineer heavy weapons company.</span> <span id="s355">And they were totally lost.</span> <span id="s356">They were miles ahead because of the confusion with the rapid advance on the front.</span> <span id="s357">They had become lost.</span> <span id="s358">They couldn't find the unit that they were supposed to be attached to, which was not the, any part of the Sixth Armoured Division.</span> <span id="s359">It was one of the other divisions that were following us.</span> <span id="s360">But they had gotten so far ahead of where they were, they had a multi-channel radio, and when we asked for the smoke, and gave the coordinates on the maps that we had, they fired it.</span> <span id="s361">Now, they came in after we left Buchenwald, oh, maybe a half an hour later.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">NL: Were they able to help the inmates in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">MH: They stayed there exactly ten to fifteen minutes, and they left, because there was nothing they could do.</span> <span id="s364">They were scared, because they knew at that point that they were out on a limb, someplace way out on a spearhead thrust.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">NL: Were they able to send messages to other...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">MH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">MH: They backtracked the way they came in and attached themselves to one of the other Infantry Battalions in our division until they could locate their unit and return to it.</span> <span id="s369">But back to the Buchenwald story.</span> <span id="s370">Just as we were preparing to leave--and we had told the people to stay in the camp, guard the prisoners that they had--two men approached Jimmy Paust [phonetic], who was my driver, and myself, and said that they had something to show us.</span> <span id="s371">I'm going to backtrack from this point a little, to Captain Kiefer.</span> <span id="s372">When Captain Kiefer and his crew got into the camp and he dismounted from the tank and walked in, there was about maybe five to seven thousand people in the, what we'll call, the parade ground area.</span> <span id="s373">The only thing that these people knew about armour, and the only name that they knew, was Patton.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">NL: Patton.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">MH: And they assumed that Captain Kiefer was Patton and had come to, you know, liberate them, take care of them, what have you.</span> <span id="s376">And they began tossing him in the air and carrying him around on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s377">Kiefer, being of German extraction, could speak German, and he had an interpreter with him and he told the people that he wasn't Patton and that he just came to the camp to see what was going on and that other help would be coming.</span> <span id="s378">And they left.</span> <span id="s379">Now the two men that came up to me and Jimmy Paust, my driver, took us over to the hospital in the camp.</span> <span id="s380">And, when we got in there, they opened the door to a room off of the side of it and I got sick.</span> <span id="s381">Because in front of me I saw a lampshade sitting on a desk made of human skin, with a tattoo of what appeared to be some kind of an angel on it.</span> <span id="s382">And on the wall behind the desk were rows and rows and rows of bottles with human parts in them--fingers, ears, noses, hands, feet, genital organs...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NL: Ohhh.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">MH: These were the souvenirs and toys of Ilse Koch.</span> <span id="s385">Now Paust and I told these two men to- Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s386">NL: Side two, continuing our interview with Mr. Patterson.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">MH: Harrison.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">NL: Excuse me, Harrison.</span> <span id="s389">I beg your pardon.</span> <span id="s390">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">MH: O.K.</span> <span id="s392">As I said, we told the two men to stay there, and guard the place with their lives, because I realized that it had some significance and would be important to the civilian affairs people.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">NL: Were there any inmates in the so-called hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">MH: Dr. Levin, at this point I don't recall whether there were or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">NL: Any sign of Ilse Koch?</span> <span id="s396">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">MH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">NL: Know at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s399">MH: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">NL: What had happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">MH: Ilse Koch had left, according to these two men, with her staff, even before the S.S. deserted the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">NL: About how many German prisoners were there, do you suppose?</span> <span id="s403">Could you tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">MH: Some 20 to 21,000...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s406">MH: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">NL: The inmates were able to guard them?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">MH: I don't know what the size of the S.S. guard was originally at the camp.</span> <span id="s409">When they fled on the morning of April 11th in the early hours, which was probably around ten or eleven o'clock in the day, they left maybe 50 to 60 guards there.</span> <span id="s410">The--when the Russians broke out of their POW compound, and got some of the healthier men to help them, they overpowered, and there were some people wounded there.</span> <span id="s411">The inmates, there were a couple of the inmates that were wounded there, and my other two medics took care of them.</span> <span id="s412">I didn't have anything to do with that.</span> <span id="s413">There were about 15 or 20 S.S. prisoners that the inmates and a couple of Russian soldiers, who stayed in the camp, had when we were there.</span> <span id="s414">At that point we left, because we felt that we had to rejoin the column and I felt that I had to report to a medical officer what I saw so that he could advise Division and Division could advise Corps and Corps could do something about getting some medical assistance and food and clothing into that.</span> <span id="s415">Incidentally, the ovens were still hot when we were there.</span> <span id="s416">We did see the gassing room and the oven area.</span> <span id="s417">And the ovens were still hot.</span> <span id="s418">As I said, I took sick.</span> <span id="s419">My stomach went into knots and I got, I wound up with the dry heaves.</span> <span id="s420">I was so sick from what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: What was the reaction of Captain Kiefer?</span> <span id="s422">Could you describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">MH: Well, Captain Kiefer and his crew didn't actually, other than seeing the emaciated people that were there, they didn't see too much.</span> <span id="s424">And when he got, when Captain Kiefer got back to the column, he reported to his superior officers and by that time to Division and Corps officers who had come up to evaluate the information that was going on.</span> <span id="s425">But he had no idea really what the true situation there was.</span> <span id="s426">It was only when the 28 of us rejoined the column and began telling Captain Bennett and Captain Dudas, the medical officer, what we encountered and what we saw, that the true, you know, the story came out.</span> <span id="s427">Then when the...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">NL: When was that, Mr. Harrison?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">MH: This was about eight o'clock, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">NL: That same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">MH: It was that same day.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">NL: And what was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">MH: Their reaction was that they really didn't--they believed it because we reported it--but they couldn't understand the inhumanity of man to man in the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">NL: Were they...</span></p> <p><span id="s435">MH: But we were all hardened combat soldiers.</span> <span id="s436">We weren't novices any of us to battle, and death and destruction was--wasn't a stranger to us.</span> <span id="s437">But what the 32 of us saw there, I don't know, it's just really indescribable.</span> <span id="s438">The pictures that you see in books and magazines and Civil Corps pictures from the Army, they're pictures, they're flat, and it's hard to put into words, really.</span> <span id="s439">You have to remember that I was a 19-year-old at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">NL: 19 at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">MH: Right, 19.</span> <span id="s442">And for days I felt like somebody had kicked me in the stomach.</span> <span id="s443">That's how sore my stomach was.</span> <span id="s444">My outrage was something else.</span> <span id="s445">But you know, being a civilized person, even though you're a soldier, when I saw German prisoners, the feeling was I'd like to go over and slit their throats or shoot them.</span> <span id="s446">But, while I was trained that way, I wasn't raised that way.</span> <span id="s447">[chuckles] I can laugh about it now, but there's tears in my eyes as you can see.</span> <span id="s448">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NL: Can we again, excuse for the interruption.</span> <span id="s450">I wanted to make sure I followed this particular thread.</span> <span id="s451">This group that you alerted later on in the evening, they came back to the camp and did they bring with them...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">MH: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s453">NL: Some food and medical help?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">MH: Because of the military situation and the length of the lines of the tank columns, it was about midnight, or shortly after, when two officers from our Division headquarters arrived at the camp and at the same time as they got there--do you want their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">NL: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">MH: They were Captain Ed Coates who was the Assistant G-1 of the Division, and Captain Davison, who was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s457">NL: When did they arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">MH: Civilian Affairs officer.</span> <span id="s459">They arrived around midnight, at the same time that Captain Rabbi Herschel Schacter arrived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">NL: All three?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">MH: All, yeah.</span> <span id="s462">Now, Captain Schacter had some people with him, his Chaplain's assistant, a driver, and I don't know who else, because the information that I'm giving you now is information that I have gotten over the years.</span> <span id="s463">My position now is the--I'm one of the historical officers of the Buchenwald Information Committee of the Sixth Armoured Division Association.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">NL: These three men, did they bring some help?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">MH: No, they didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">NL: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">MH: Captain Davison was there to appraise, to see what type of troops he would have to draw in to really assist the people.</span> <span id="s468">Captain Schacter was sent there by 20th Corps to--because it was my reporting that most of the inmates were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">MH: Now, very shortly after they got there, the German troops that were--and they were mostly S.S.--caught between our armoured columns, decided to go back to Buchenwald and wreck some havoc and make a last stand there.</span> <span id="s471">They were WaffenS.S.</span> <span id="s472">and they didn't know what the word surrender meant.</span> <span id="s473">So they attacked the main camp at Buchenwald with small arms and mortar fire.</span> <span id="s474">Captain Davison put a call out.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NL: Excuse me, were there any American troops at the main camp at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">MH: No, just the men that I had mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">MH: They put a call out for assistance, and a, part of our reconnaissance squadron responded to the call.</span> <span id="s479">And they came there, and they put out a call for more troops.</span> <span id="s480">And my sister battalion, the 44th Infantry Battalion that was way behind our advance, sent troops over to assist, and they fought a battle there that lasted through the 12ADVANCE \u 6thADVANCE \d 6--because we're into the 12th of April now--and ended some time around noon on the 13th.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">NL: My word.</span> <span id="s482">That was quite a stand.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">MH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s484">They overpowered the S.S. and forced them to surrender, and other, a few other troops from our Division came into the area--the 25th Engineer Battalion, and one of the Tank Battalions, the 68th Tank Battalion participated in the battle and one of their tanks was hit and destroyed sitting next to the hospital.</span> <span id="s485">But fortunately they got the fire out in the hospital.</span> <span id="s486">We lost the tank and the men and the crew, but they were able to get the fire out and preserve Ilse Koch's laboratory.</span> <span id="s487">I'm not sure which day it was, whether it was on the 13th or the 14th, the men of the 44th Infantry Battalion captured Ilse Koch and some of her people in the city of Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">NL: Were there any inmates who were killed during this battle, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">MH: Yes, there were, and a soldier who was in the 86th Recon Squadron, a medic by the name of Simon Elias who lives in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">NL: E-L-I-A-...</span></p> <p><span id="s491">MH: A-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">MH: gave aid and assistance to the troops and to the civilians that were wounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">NL: And he's in Willow Grove now?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">MH: He's in Willow Grove.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">NL: I'll try to interview him.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">MH: Well, you want to shut this off for a second?</span> <span id="s498">[tape off then on] O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">NL: So, you said that a medic in Willow Grove...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">MH: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">NL: Did offer some assistance.</span> <span id="s502">We'll try to get in touch with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">MH: Yeah, well...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">NL: And now...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">MH: There were other men too.</span> <span id="s506">I know of Si because Si and I have been friends over the years.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">NL: Excuse me, I think I'm going to [tape off then on]...</span></p> <p><span id="s508">MH: As I said, the battle ended late in the day on the 13th when the troops of the 6th Armoured were relieved by Company E of the 417th Infantry Regiment of the 76th Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s509">Now a man by the name of Morris Resnik, who lives in Roslyn, Pennsylvania, was with them.</span> <span id="s510">They cleaned up around the camp, captured some prisoners and took over until Civilian Affair units arrived a few days later.</span> <span id="s511">Now, on the 14th of April, our commanding officer, General Robert Groh, toured the camp.</span> <span id="s512">With him were some staff officers of the 4th Armoured Division and the 80th Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s513">Now the area around Buchenwald was declared a non-combat zone on the 14th of April.</span> <span id="s514">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s515">NL: Excuse me, do you know what the staff officers' reactions were to their tour?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">MH: Absolute horror.</span> <span id="s517">General Groh died this past year, and it's unfortunate that you can't get his actual words.</span> <span id="s518">I will try to get his memoirs on this for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">NL: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">MH: And I'm quite sure that I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NL: We'd, we'll make copies if...</span></p> <p><span id="s522">MH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">NL: You don't want to lose the original.</span> <span id="s524">We'd be very, very glad to have those...</span></p> <p><span id="s525">MH: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">NL: Mr. Harrison.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">MH: So, 20th Corps and 12th Army Group Headquarters moved into Weimar.</span> <span id="s528">Now General Groh ordered the people in Weimar out, to start burying the dead.</span> <span id="s529">And our graves registration platoon from our medical battalion, the 76th Medical Battalion, tried to record as many of the names as they could get from survivors, among the, you know, from the dead corpses.</span> <span id="s530">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s531">NL: Is that available in some documentation?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">MH: So far we have not been able to locate any of those records.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NL: This would be in the Graves Registration...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">MH: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NL: Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">MH: We have not been able to, we don't know where they were turned over to, whether it was to a civilian agency or the army, and we're still looking to find information because we feel they'd be vital...</span></p> <p><span id="s537">NL: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">MH: ... to the Holocaust story.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">NL: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">MH: Now, on April the 15th, General Patton came to tour the camp.</span> <span id="s541">And he was so overwhelmed with what he saw that he couldn't finish the tour.</span> <span id="s542">He left.</span> <span id="s543">Totally aghast, shaken, and General Groh continued the guided tour of Patton's staff that remained behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">NL: Excuse me, were any, did any of these units bring any medical aid in or food or clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">MH: The medical assistance began arriving in the camp on the 14th and 15th.</span> <span id="s546">Now [unclear] what these units were, I don't know, and the records are not very clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">NL: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">MH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s549">It's unclear to me.</span> <span id="s550">It’s unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">NL: Do you understand why that’s the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">MH: We are still looking, and trying to find out as much information as we can, so that we can pass it on to people who are interested in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">NL: Do you think it's possibly because the Russians also had a hand in the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">MH: Well, actually the Russians had no hand in the liberation except their POWs who were...</span></p> <p><span id="s555">NL: Well, they claimed that...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">MH: Now, Russians, the Russians have claimed...</span></p> <p><span id="s557">NL: They claimed to have liberated the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">MH: The official ruling of the United States Army is, and I quote, "Buchenwald was liberated by the inmates of the camp, and the Russian POWs on April the 11th, 1945.</span> <span id="s559">Combat Command A

id="s562">NL: Word.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">MH: Ruling by the United States Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">NL: Yes, but the documentation is still very fragmentary apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">MH: Yes it is.</span> <span id="s566">In fact, it's very hard to--difficult.</span> <span id="s567">As you know, I showed you a Summary After Battle report and it's just a brief sentence in there as to the camp and all it says is we overran the place.</span> <span id="s568">But we make no claim, that's the 6th Armoured Division and any of the men involved in it, we make no real claim to being liberators of the camp.</span> <span id="s569">The historians and scholars have handed out the title of liberator.</span> <span id="s570">We overran the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">NL: You discovered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">MH: We discovered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">NL: And you are witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">MH: And we are witnesses.</span> <span id="s575">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">NL: Well that's an extremely important kind of documentation.</span> <span id="s577">But I must say I'm puzzled about the fact of your having trouble getting this documentation.</span> <span id="s578">This, it sounds suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">MH: Well, there are references where CCA of the 6th Armoured Division is noted as "Liberators" of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s580">Yaffa Eliach in the Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust on page 256 makes reference to us.</span> <span id="s581">The book by [Yaffa] Eliach and Bonnie [Brana] Gurewitsch, The Liberators, on pages 16 to 25 mentions us: "The Liberation of Concentration Camps by Armed Forces."</span> <span id="s582">And this is to believe, believed to be an army publication.</span> <span id="s583">On page six there's a picture of Rabbi Herschel Schacter conducting Shavuot services at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s584">And in the caption it says, "Liberated by the 6th Armoured Division, U.S. Army photo and caption."</span> <span id="s585">In Never to Forget: The Jews of the Holocaust, by Milton Meltzer, we're mentioned, and I take the liberty to quote Elie Wiesel from this book.</span> <span id="s586">He says, "At 6:00 in the evening, the first American tank stood at the gates of Buchenwald."</span> <span id="s587">The tank that Elie Wiesel saw was Captain Fred Kiefer's, of the Ninth Armoured Infantry Battalion, of the 6th Armoured Division just prior to its departure.</span> <span id="s588">It was the only tank there at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">NL: Important.</span> <span id="s590">Correct</span></p> <p><span id="s591">MH: Well, do you want this in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">MH: As further information and proof of the Sixth Armoured Division's involvement in Buchenwald, on Wednesday, May 23rd, 1984, the Mayor of Beaufort, Luxembourg, Leon Bartheims, presented the Honoris Causa Medal of the Council, La Resistance of Luxembourg to the Sixth Armoured Division Association for freeing the members of the resistance of that country from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s594">A similar award was given by representatives of the Belgian resistance.</span> <span id="s595">Mayor Bartheims was a prisoner in Buchenwald at the time of liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">NL: Very important verification, yes.</span> <span id="s597">Now, could you just add another word about what you did after you left the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">MH: Well, after I left the main camp, we proceeded to find our column, which by that time was some thirty miles away.</span> <span id="s599">And we rejoined the column.</span> <span id="s600">I and Sergeant Michael Weiss, who was in charge of the infantry with us, sought out Captain Bennett, and we reported to him what we saw in the camp.</span> <span id="s601">And I reported to Captain Roger Dudas who was my immediate commanding officer and gave him an evaluation of what I saw.</span> <span id="s602">We conferred with Captain Kiefer briefly, and told him what he didn't see there.</span> <span id="s603">And at that point, information in detail was sent back to our Division rear with the facts, you know, on it.</span> <span id="s604">Now, in our Division history, because it would become such a massive thing if every body's individual story was told, and it became our habit, more or less, in our history to report only the primary details of any battle or operation, the story that's listed in there is “Kiefer's patrol into Buchenwald,” since he and the three men with him were actually the first American soldiers to see Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s605">The 28 of us that arrived there seeking actually Kiefer to support and aid him, the few of us that are left or that we know of, call ourselves The Fifth Man.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">NL: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">MH: Because we were the fifth man, you know, to--we were the second group, but we figure that...</span></p> <p><span id="s608">NL: Were there, there were four?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">MH: The 28 of us were only five.</span> <span id="s610">We're only the fifth because there were four...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">NL: Four originals.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">MH: before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">MH: Now out of all of the men that were involved in the first group to get to Buchenwald before the battle, there are only six or seven of us left that we know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">NL: After you returned to civilian life, obviously you wanted to pick up the threads of your old life, but you obviously had these images imprinted on your mind.</span> <span id="s616">When did you start thinking about recording this information or making it available?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">MH: Oh, Dr. Levin, we started very early to have reunions, after we came home from the service.</span> <span id="s618">And I can tell you, I haven't been to all the reunions that we've had, but at every reunion that we go to, we rehash battles and go over things and--but this isn't all we do.</span> <span id="s619">But one of the things that always comes up in the discussions is Buchenwald, and what we saw and what we experienced.</span> <span id="s620">And whether it's Jew or Gentile, and we have a couple of Buddhists because we had a couple of Chinese fellows in the Division too, the horror of what we experienced, those of us that were there.</span> <span id="s621">Now, not all of the men in the Division participated in the action.</span> <span id="s622">It was segments from different outfits and different units were there.</span> <span id="s623">But, in every one of our CP rooms where the individual battalion men assemble, I can assure you, because we roam from room to room and we talk, because we have friends all over, Buchenwald is always in the discussion.</span> <span id="s624">And if somebody new comes along, we find something else out.</span> <span id="s625">We find out something new about it.</span> <span id="s626">We're a unique group of men.</span> <span id="s627">We were a unique group of men in battle, and we're still a unique group of men.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">NL: When did you last meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">MH: Last year, in San Antonio, Texas.</span> <span id="s630">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s631">We're meeting September 9th, 10th, and 11th in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s632">And already that I know of, we have about 600 men, their wives, and children, attending.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">NL: My.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">MH: We have put 55 of our children and grandchildren through college, through scholarship funds.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">NL: Marvelous.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">MH: We're one of the largest supporters of the Patton Historical Museum in Fort Knox, Kentucky.</span> <span id="s637">We've tried to participate where we can in Holocaust Gatherings, although not successful in a great many of the cases, because as I told you, we seem to be an ignored part of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">NL: Well, you're not going to be any longer if I can do anything about it.</span> <span id="s639">I was wondering, just as a last thought...</span></p> <p><span id="s640">MH: Now, I spoke for a number of years when I came home at synagogues and a few of the colleges around the area.</span> <span id="s641">And then Captain Kiefer took over those details for the organization and I sort of got out of it, until eight years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">NL: Have you ever spoken at the Youth Symposium here at Gratz in March?</span> <span id="s643">We have several...</span></p> <p><span id="s644">MH: No, I haven't.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">NL: Hundred students.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">MH: I've spoken at the University of Pennsylvania a few times.</span> <span id="s647">Four years ago I spoke there.</span> <span id="s648">I spoke at Temple University at the Newman Center four years ago.</span> <span id="s649">I have spoken recently through the Holocaust Awareness Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">NL: If I give your name to the people in charge of the symposium, which will be held next Spring, would you consider speaking to students?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">MH: Yes, I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">NL: Because I think you have an extremely important message, not just your witnessing, but the fact that you are a mixed unit, ecumenical in the best sense of the word, and you're a person who's been trying to reclaim our humanity after this dreadful, dreadful history.</span> <span id="s653">Are there any further words, any messages you'd like to convey on the tape, Mr. Harrison?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">MH: [pause] Yes, there is a message I would like to convey on the tape.</span> <span id="s655">And it's to the historians and the scholars.</span> <span id="s656">It's not meant in a detrimental way, but the authenticity of people who claim to be liberators should be checked.</span> <span id="s657">Because in every camp that was overrun or liberated, the only liberators were the first handful of men that got there.</span> <span id="s658">The other people that got there were sightseers, some were observers, and some were sent there as service personnel.</span> <span id="s659">And when these people are interviewed and they speak, they should be identified by what they were.</span> <span id="s660">And as a classic example, I give our Division and the men from our Division that were involved in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s661">In forty-some years, being almost totally ignored when we have,--we're the only ones who can really tell the story.</span> <span id="s662">Not the sightseers, not the observers or the service people that were there.</span> <span id="s663">But the first men in there that were struck with the awesomeness of the situation.</span> <span id="s664">By the time the other people got there… Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NL: ... two, side one, continuing our interview with Mr. Milton Harrison.</span> <span id="s666">Would you be good enough to repeat this last sentence that the camps were in the process of being cleaned because I don't think that got on.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">MH: At the end of the previous tape I had stated that there were three categories of men that came to Buchenwald, or any concentration camp: the actual men who were there, the combat men who were the liberators; people that were sent there to service the camps; and then sightseers and observers.</span> <span id="s668">And distinctions should be made between them.</span> <span id="s669">When a great many of these people got to these camps, even if it was three, four, five days later, the camps were already in the process of being cleaned and the people fed and reclothed.</span> <span id="s670">And their observations are second hand.</span> <span id="s671">The only true observations are the men that went in there with the tanks and the rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">NL: On the 11th.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">MH: Well, in the case of Buchenwald it was on the 11th.</span> <span id="s674">The men that fought the battle there on the 12th and 13th and, Dr. Levin, General Patton could have considered himself a liberator of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s675">He never made claim to that.</span> <span id="s676">In his memoirs, if some- one wants to take the time to go through them in the section on Buchenwald, it tells of the horror that he saw and that he had to leave.</span> <span id="s677">But there is no word of him as being a liberator or the first soldier there.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">NL: Well, Mr. Harrison, thank you profoundly and sincerely for the time you've taken to come and make this important revision and correction in the historical record.</span> <span id="s679">I will definitely recommend that you come and speak to the Youth Symposium and to children in the classrooms and elsewhere.</span> <span id="s680">And our gratitude to you for this material.</span> <span id="s681">Now…</span></p> <p><span id="s682">MH: Dr. Levin, everything that I have stated here and in the material that I have given to you can be authenticated either through the officers that are still alive from my Division and my Unit, the men that were with me that are still alive, the Army records at the Pentagon and at the Military Historical Library at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, at Carlisle Barracks.</span> <span id="s683">Some are in the Archives and are classified, but everything that I have stated is the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">NL: Thank you.</span> <span id="s685">I truly believe that.</span> <span id="s686">Now, just one last word.</span> <span id="s687">Do try to make contact with others in your group who might be interested and willing to either record their own experiences, to send us any written material and documentation they may have.</span> <span id="s688">We'd be glad to make copies of that.</span> <span id="s689">Or if people are far from Philadelphia, of course we'd be very glad to send them blank tapes and the questionnaire.</span> <span id="s690">I'll now give you a copy of the questionnaire and perhaps you'll be able to give copies to those men who you'll see.</span> <span id="s691">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">MH: Thank you, and I'll--we have a reunion coming up September 9th, 10th, and 11th, and I will interview... [talking in background]</span></p> <p><span id="s693">NL: Excuse me, come in, [unclear].</span> <span id="s694">I'll be right with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">MH: Any of the men that were involved there, and see if I can get some reaction and interviews and...</span></p> <p><span id="s696">NL: Any documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">MH: Any documentations for...</span></p> <p><span id="s698">NL: Thank you.</span> <span id="s699">Thank you very much indeed.</span> <span id="s700">We appreciate your coming in.</span></p></body></html>
