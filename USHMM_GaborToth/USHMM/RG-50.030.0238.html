And as I mentioned to you, big family, they were.</span> <span id="s20">Now, what else would you like to know?</span> <span id="s21">What my father did?</span> <span id="s22">My father was photographer, and he was the official photographer for the Hapsburg family, was the king that time.</span> <span id="s23">And after that he was the official photographer of Admiral Horthy whom he knew from World War I, from Vienna.</span> <span id="s24">They were together in the so‑called “war minisztérium.”</span> <span id="s25">And he had a very well known photography studio in Budapest, at that time, for the upper class, princes and barons and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">01:03:06 And besides it also, he was a high society photographer, let's put it, in short.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did you learn photography with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s31">I grew up in photography, and I had a brother of mine who was also a photographer, and – but he was 11 years older than I am.</span> <span id="s32">And I learned photography from my father, which his famous saying was, "I'm not teaching you.</span> <span id="s33">You just watch me."</span> <span id="s34">I was just watching him.</span> <span id="s35">And when he died, he was right, because I knew most of it from him.</span> <span id="s36">Naturally, I had studying, but the actual photography I learned from him; just watching.</span> <span id="s37">Besides, speaking about photography, he was mostly doing portraits, studio portraits, and he wanted to – me to go out and do outside work, which I loved to do.</span> <span id="s38">As a matter of fact, I didn't want to be a photographer until I was 15, and that's when I – excuse me – that's when I had the feeling that I want to be a photographer.</span> <span id="s39">And he also had a photography shop; small, elegant photography shop with cameras.</span> <span id="s40">And I decided I want to be a photographer.</span> <span id="s41">And I took the first camera, which was a Leica from the shelf.</span> <span id="s42">And he wasn't there, but he just came in and he said that, "What are you doing?"</span> <span id="s43">I said, "I want to be a photographer.</span> <span id="s44">I took this camera I'm starting with."</span> <span id="s45">He took the camera out of my hand; he put it back on the shelf.</span> <span id="s46">He took the oldest camera that exists which – not with films, with plates – and he said, "That's where you start, with the oldest camera."</span> <span id="s47">He said, "If you want to know photography, you have to start from scratch."</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What kind of photography did he do for Admiral Horthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: He sent to do Admiral Horthy – I don't know if you've ever seen his pictures.</span> <span id="s50">They were done by him and he did his portraits.</span> <span id="s51">Also, he did all the new – well, that wasn't personal for Admiral, or the new Secretary of State or Secretary of War or this or that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">01:06:00 The official photography for the cabinet.</span> <span id="s53">Later on, I was quite young, he sent me up to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What was the impact, then, given the Horthy's position obviously changed with the Nazi movement into Hungary?</span> <span id="s55">What happened in terms of his work and the relationship to Horthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s57">It was going on until quite – the end of the war.</span> <span id="s58">I mean, end of Horthy.</span> <span id="s59">I have a funny story to tell you if – I don't know if it belongs here or not, but as I said, every time there was a new cabinet member, he was called up until maybe I was 16 or 17, he started to send me up to the palace to do the picture.</span> <span id="s60">So one morning, he got the call, and that was during the war already, maybe in the mid– around 1943, I would say, which was close to the end of the war – but we didn't know that then – that the new Secretary of War will be coming.</span> <span id="s61">They changed, because Hungary was starting to get slowly out of the war.</span> <span id="s62">So anyway, he got the phone call to send – to go up.</span> <span id="s63">So he said, "In the afternoon you have to go up to the palace to do the new Secretary of War."</span> <span id="s64">I said, "I cannot do it."</span> <span id="s65">"Why not?"</span> <span id="s66">I said, "Because" – it's hard to explain it, at that time in Hungary from the early '20s, there was a so‑called paramilitary.</span> <span id="s67">It was a paramilitary organization which you had to go.</span> <span id="s68">It was a must.</span> <span id="s69">And they were practicing every week outside the outskirts of Hungary, no Budapest.</span> <span id="s70">So I said to him, "Because I have this obligation."</span> <span id="s71">He said, "The hell.</span> <span id="s72">You don't go there."</span> <span id="s73">I said, "I have to, because – Okay.</span> <span id="s74">Then ask the head of there what you have to do and he will release you."</span> <span id="s75">All right.</span> <span id="s76">So I went out there, and there's a train, tram, and at the beginning you had to – is it interesting at all, what I'm saying?</span> <span id="s77">At the beginning you had to go to him and ask for permission to leave.</span> <span id="s78">He said, "What is the reason?"</span> <span id="s79">I said, "Because I have to take the picture of the new Secretary of War."</span> <span id="s80">He looked at me and said, "You."</span> <span id="s81">I said, "Me."</span></p> <p><span id="s82">01:09:00 He said, "Well, I let you do it, because that's the biggest lie I have ever heard.</span> <span id="s83">I'll let you do it.</span> <span id="s84">But you bring me a paper where you have been Tuesday afternoon between 3:00 and 5:00," because that's – So I went.</span> <span id="s85">I did the pictures.</span> <span id="s86">And after the picture taking, I knew he was the head of the cabinet, minisztérium for PR and so forth, and I went to him in the building, and I said, "I need the paper that I – he was laughing, and he gave me the official paper of the Hungarian cabinet stating that Thomas Veres was, between 3:00 and 5:00, taking picture of the new Secretary of War.</span> <span id="s87">Next time I showed it to him, and he flipped.</span> <span id="s88">That's the end of that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Tom, could you give me some sense, then, of the first impact of the Nazis when things began to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Well, certain things did begin to change, and don't call it "the Nazis," because actually – wait.</span> <span id="s91">You call Nazis the German Nazis or the Hungarian Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: That's a good question.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: I know.</span> <span id="s94">That's why I'm asking.</span> <span id="s95">Which one do you want?</span> <span id="s96">Because that was two different period.</span> <span id="s97">Because Hungary not necessarily was on the German side, and the historical background comes out now in today's days because of World War I mistake when the biggest part of Hungary was taken away.</span> <span id="s98">And Hitler was the only one who was supporting, because he himself was Germany's leader, to get back what was taken away.</span> <span id="s99">Now, I don't in history – I have to give you the historical background, which I think it's important because that made Hungary on the side of the Axis.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">01:12:03 And that made Horthy on the side of the Axis, because Hungary's part was taken most.</span> <span id="s101">Now, today, and in recent history, when Yugoslavia's breaking apart, one and a half million Hungarians were living there, then the Rumania, the Transylvania was taken away when two million Hungarians lived there, and just two days ago when Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, the upper part of Slovakia was – the lower part of Slovakia was mostly Hungarian, a million and a half.</span> <span id="s102">And that was the reason.</span> <span id="s103">And they were not Hungarian.</span> <span id="s104">It was a first only rightist government, and then it became more sliding to the right, more to the right, and at the end it became a Nazi government.</span> <span id="s105">But it was not a Nazi government until October – even then it wasn't called, because the Germans occupied Hungary in March 19th, 1944.</span> <span id="s106">And from March 19, '44, Horthy lost his power.</span> <span id="s107">He was just a figurehead.</span> <span id="s108">And in October 15th, when the government was taken over, those are the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s109">Then it became actual Nazi government.</span> <span id="s110">Does it answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: It's a good background to it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So you came from a Jewish family; correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So there must have been some danger at some point that had an impact on you or your photographic activities were not exactly normal, I presume.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No.</span> <span id="s116">In all honesty, you know, there were Jewish laws which started in 1939, I think.</span> <span id="s117">But there were one, two, three different kind of Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s118">But, personally, I was not affected by it direct.</span> <span id="s119">Not the photography, and not in personal life.</span> <span id="s120">But you knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s121">At least you thought you knew what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">01:15:00 And, let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s123">My brother, who was 11 years old – 11 years older than I am, he married an American which was accidental.</span> <span id="s124">It had nothing to do with Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s125">And he came to the States in 1939.</span> <span id="s126">And two days later or three days later, actually, he was called up for labor camp, to serve in labor camp.</span> <span id="s127">But he wasn't there.</span> <span id="s128">I was there.</span> <span id="s129">Except the bad rumors.</span> <span id="s130">There were people who were affected; but, personally, I wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Were you ever called in to labor service?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s133">It was after the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s134">1944, they came, 19 – March 19, and I was called up April 7th, 1944.</span> <span id="s135">I went.</span> <span id="s136">What happens is a long story, but I went to the upper part of Hungary, and I – I was sent to the huge camp for – which was for only putting together the different outfits and sending either to Russia or Yugoslavia or – I had the luck of the fate that I was sent to a city, which was – Miskolc is the name, and I was there from March – no, from April to August.</span> <span id="s137">And in August, another luck of fate was that I was sent – the whole outfit was sent to Budapest.</span> <span id="s138">And I worked in a – it's a wood factory making ammunition boxes until – and that was from August till October when the Hungarian Nazis took over.</span> <span id="s139">And that's when this outfit was – the word came that the outfit is sending – was sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s140">And I said goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: How?</span> <span id="s143">I knew the captain, and by then we had – I don't know if you read it or – we had exemption for my father and his whole family for the Jewish laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">01:18:07 And I was in the labor camp but not as a Jew.</span> <span id="s145">Exempt and with different armband, and I was in very good friendship with the captain.</span> <span id="s146">And I said to the captain, "Goodbye.</span> <span id="s147">I'm not going to Germany."</span> <span id="s148">And I was stepping down to the left.</span> <span id="s149">And that's when I went to Wallenberg, who I didn't know it exist, to the Swedish legation.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s151">How did you come into contact with Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: My father's studio, which I told you, did also foreign legations, people and so forth.</span> <span id="s153">And he, at least three years before, two years before, he took picture of Per Anger, who you mentioned.</span> <span id="s154">And—</span></p> <p><span id="s155">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s157">So let's just start again with how you came to make contact with Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s159">My father took his family pictures.</span> <span id="s160">He was a young man then, Per Anger, and his wife and little baby and it's about.</span> <span id="s161">I would say, two years before, this happened.</span> <span id="s162">And he also bought a Leica camera at that time, and I was teaching his wife how to use the camera because of the new baby and so forth.</span> <span id="s163">And then, I have seen them weekly as – not friends, but in a friendly atmosphere.</span> <span id="s164">I – every week I – we used to live in the – it's a well‑known building in Budapest, the Gerbeaud palace, or the Gerbeaud building, which was the most famous confectionery in all of Budapest.</span> <span id="s165">And in the war, naturally, there was not too many chocolate, and I got a box of chocolate every week, which I gave to his wife, wife, because she loved it.</span> <span id="s166">And when I actually – and it was an escape from the labor camp, though I took it easy and I call it I just stepped aside.</span> <span id="s167">I, you know – all I knew, my father also had the Swedish passport because he had Swedish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">01:21:00 And very little, because I wasn't too much in contact by then with them, but I was able to go home.</span> <span id="s169">And he told me about it.</span> <span id="s170">He told me, "You have also Swedish passport."</span> <span id="s171">And that gave me the idea that I go, when I escape the labor camp, to – right away, next morning, to go to the Swedish legation and look for Per Anger.</span> <span id="s172">Now, the way it actually happened was there were hundreds of people, that was on the Buda side, hundreds of people waiting in front of the legation asking for the Swedish passport.</span> <span id="s173">But the policeman didn't let them in.</span> <span id="s174">So somehow I worked my way to the policeman, and I asked him, "Would you please send a message to Per Anger that Thomas Veres is here and would like to speak to him."</span> <span id="s175">In about a half an hour, somebody came out, two other policemen, and said – made on the loud speaker announcement that everybody should immediately leave the territory of the Swedish legation, immediately, except Thomas Veres.</span> <span id="s176">And a cold sweat was coming down.</span> <span id="s177">And they let me in.</span> <span id="s178">And I met Per Anger, and he said, "What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s179">I said, "Look, I just left the labor camp, and I'm asking you what you could help."</span> <span id="s180">"Oh, I introduce you to Raoul."</span> <span id="s181">And a young man came in.</span> <span id="s182">"Raoul," he said, "this is Thomas Veres, friend of mine, photographer."</span> <span id="s183">"Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s184">You will be my photographer."</span> <span id="s185">And in ten minutes the official paper was made out that Thomas Veres is the official photographer of the Swedish legation of Hungary.</span> <span id="s186">And Wallenberg signed it, and he gave it to me.</span> <span id="s187">I never used that paper because it wouldn't mean anything at all.</span> <span id="s188">But he said, "From now on, you will be my photographer, and you will do documentary what we are doing here for the outside world to show what's happening.</span> <span id="s189">You will report directly to me" – not to the usual people who were working on the passports.</span> <span id="s190">And that's how I became his photographer.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Do you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Did I know what?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What you were getting into?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s195">I did not.</span> <span id="s196">As a matter of fact, I was a little bit skeptical – not a little bit.</span> <span id="s197">I was quite skeptical to – “how am I going to take pictures?”</span> <span id="s198">And slowly, I learned my lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">01:24:00 First I did, as I told you before, many of the actual passport pictures of people who needed it for him, not for direct, not for the people.</span> <span id="s200">What we did when he did save people and they didn't have the Swedish papers, we reversed the action.</span> <span id="s201">I did the pictures.</span> <span id="s202">In the meantime, the officers did the passport, and the two were together.</span> <span id="s203">It was a post‑issued passport, which didn't say it, but that's how it happened.</span> <span id="s204">When the actual – Can we stop here?</span> <span id="s205">I'd like to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did Wallenberg tell you why he wanted a photographer with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s209">Remember, I told you that he said for documentary to show to the outside world what's happening, in his words, as a documentary.</span> <span id="s210">Now, I started saying if I remember that one morning, which is November – end of November, I think it was either 27th, 28th or 28th, 29, in the morning, because at that time my parents were still in the Gerbeaud house in our old home.</span> <span id="s211">And I went home to sleep.</span> <span id="s212">During the day I was with the Swedish legation, what I told you doing passport pictures until then.</span> <span id="s213">And then one morning, early morning – he used to start early morning, so did I. Even up to today.</span> <span id="s214">I was there before seven o'clock or 6:30.</span> <span id="s215">And a small, handwritten note wait for me.</span> <span id="s216">And his secretary said, "Tom, Wallenberg sent this note to you."</span> <span id="s217">And the note said that "Wait" – "Come out to the – meet” – no, I'm sorry, "Meet me at the Józsefvárosi Pályaudvar," which is the train station at the outskirts of Budapest, and it's a freight station, not for the public.</span> <span id="s218">I have never been there.</span> <span id="s219">And I went out by train, and I get there and the whole train station was surrounded by Hungarian gendarmes, and there I was with a camera in my pocket with Wallenberg's note.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">01:27:00 He was quite, I call it naive, of those dangers.</span> <span id="s221">Even if he realize it, he tried to somehow minimize it.</span> <span id="s222">So I went to the first gendarme and I started to say half German, half English, half Hungarian, trying to imitate I'm from the Swedish legation and I want to go in.</span> <span id="s223">And the guy looked at me like, "Who wants to go in this place?"</span> <span id="s224">So I talk my – I had to talk my way in there.</span> <span id="s225">I didn't show them any paper.</span> <span id="s226">That would be the worst.</span> <span id="s227">My mouth took me in there.</span> <span id="s228">And the train station had about 10,000, 15,000 men, Jews, ready for deportation.</span> <span id="s229">They were the ones who were surrounded from Budapest, the labor camps, who were still at that time, end of November, sent to Germany by train.</span> <span id="s230">Later on, it was on foot.</span> <span id="s231">This time it was by train, for deportation.</span> <span id="s232">And Wallenberg was there and set up a little table.</span> <span id="s233">And I went to him and he whispered in my ear, "Tom, take as many pictures as you can."</span> <span id="s234">I didn't want to ask him "Will you pose for me" or, you know, "How?"</span> <span id="s235">So I had my coat on me and I had a shawl, and I always have a pocketknife with me, and I made a slit in the shawl and prearranged the camera setting on my Leica, and I just – through the shawl I did bring just the lens out and started, through the shawl, shooting.</span> <span id="s236">Sometimes I was sitting in his car and shooting from the car, and sometimes I just went around looking left or right like nothing happened and take the pictures.</span> <span id="s237">Up till – first of all, somebody was yelling to me, "Tommy, Tommy."</span> <span id="s238">It was not my best, but one of my best friends with whom I was in school from first grade until the end of my schooling.</span> <span id="s239">We were sitting next to each other.</span> <span id="s240">So I didn't want to be recognized, and I whispered to him, you know, "Do something."</span> <span id="s241">And I kicked him in the butt, and I said, "Dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s242">Go over there," in Hungarian; that the line was standing for information to give that you have Schutzpass or not, because that's what Wallenberg in a big book had to verify it, “yes, no, yes, no.”</span></p> <p><span id="s243">01:30:15 And he was trying, naturally, also for the ones who didn't have it, to say “yes,” and go to the left, go to the right, go to left, go to right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">End Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s246">02:00:53</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Tom, as you pick up on your description of that, could you mention something about the kind of danger that you faced and what the danger of taking photographs was.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: That's self explanatory.</span> <span id="s249">What I wanted to follow‑up, the next thing I heard, again, "Tommy, Tommy."</span> <span id="s250">And this was a first cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s251">And the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s252">I went to him.</span> <span id="s253">The idiot start, "Tommy, Tommy."</span> <span id="s254">I said – I kicked him in the butt, too.</span> <span id="s255">"Dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s256">Go over there."</span> <span id="s257">And the third one, which I remember, I can recall, I saw in the line.</span> <span id="s258">He was a very well known Hungarian actor, theatrical actor.</span> <span id="s259">And usually he played farmers.</span> <span id="s260">He was a Jew, but he played farmer, Hungarian farmer.</span> <span id="s261">He was very good.</span> <span id="s262">He was standing in the line.</span> <span id="s263">And he didn't have – I went to him, and I whispered to him.</span> <span id="s264">He didn't have the passport.</span> <span id="s265">So I went to Wallenberg, and I whispered to him, "That's a famous Hungarian actor, well‑known Hungarian actor.”</span> <span id="s266">He let him go, you know.</span> <span id="s267">He looked at the book; “yes.”</span> <span id="s268">The interesting part of that one was that maybe two or three years later the same actor who was again in the theater came to my photo shop.</span> <span id="s269">And naturally he never saw me before.</span> <span id="s270">And I said to him, "Have you been in the Józsefvárosi Pályaudvar?"</span> <span id="s271">And he said, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s272">And I said to him, "Do you know who was the one?"</span> <span id="s273">He didn't – He looked like he didn't believe me, that I was actually the one who saved his life.</span> <span id="s274">But he was nice, but then, nothing special.</span> <span id="s275">You asked me about if there was any danger.</span> <span id="s276">So that was the second – I was there two days, and then this kind of deportation start.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">02:03:06 From then on they started taking people on foot.</span> <span id="s278">And on the second day, there was a friend of mine, too, in the car.</span> <span id="s279">And while the procedure was going on, and taking picture, "Let's see what's happening behind the train."</span> <span id="s280">And we slid behind the trains, and they were already ready and closed.</span> <span id="s281">All you saw in those little cattle wagons, you had clear windows with wrought iron.</span> <span id="s282">And hands were sticking out and yelling and crying, "Help, help."</span> <span id="s283">You heard people, "Help me out.</span> <span id="s284">I give you 100,000 pengo," and this and that, and "I own a coffee house here."</span> <span id="s285">So it was a terrible thing, because you only heard it.</span> <span id="s286">So with my friend, we slip closer to the wagon and start – it opened amazingly easy.</span> <span id="s287">It opened up.</span> <span id="s288">Started to open one door, and people slowly – the wood panel which they walked up was still there, and slowly they started to come out.</span> <span id="s289">And we were trying to tell them to go to the other side; that's where the procedure is going on.</span> <span id="s290">And didn't notice in the big excitement that slowly whispering, "Hungarian police officer."</span> <span id="s291">I'm saying "Hungarian police officer," because in the whole thing there was only one German involved, and his name was Dannecker.</span> <span id="s292">He was the right‑hand of Eichmann who wasn't there that time.</span> <span id="s293">The rest of it was Hungarian gendarmes.</span> <span id="s294">The German, Dannecker, he just stood there silently like he's not doing the whole thing.</span> <span id="s295">And the couple of Hungarian higher‑up, and he was a captain, and he noticed me and started yelling in Hungarian, "Stop immediately."</span> <span id="s296">And then pulled his revolver, aiming.</span> <span id="s297">Meantime, Wallenberg came over too, somehow, luckily.</span> <span id="s298">With the car, they pulled over and pulled up and said, "Jump.</span> <span id="s299">Tom, jump!"</span> <span id="s300">I would have gotten the Olympic record for this, because I jumped so fast that I jumped in the car.</span> <span id="s301">And we closed the door and pulled out.</span> <span id="s302">They were yelling after us, and that was the last time we went there.</span> <span id="s303">Wallenberg said jokingly, "We cannot come back here."</span> <span id="s304">So that was the – that showed a little bit of danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">02:06:00</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Next, your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: How long had you been working with Wallenberg by then?</span> <span id="s308">I mean, it's hard for us to understand.</span> <span id="s309">This is compressed into a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: My whole affiliation, in lifetime, it's very short.</span> <span id="s311">But it was somehow one of my – one of my longest time.</span> <span id="s312">It was actually, I can tell you, October 17 when I met him first – I think it was 17.</span> <span id="s313">Either 17 – I know.</span> <span id="s314">I can tell you another danger that has nothing to do with the legation.</span> <span id="s315">Yeah, it was October 17, until I have seen him the last time January the 14th.</span> <span id="s316">Yes.</span> <span id="s317">And that's the whole period.</span> <span id="s318">You asked me that; right?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s320">And from the time that you met with him in the middle of October to the end of November you were talking about at the railway station –</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Uh‑huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: – was that the period of his most intense activity of – of going to the places of deportation and pulling people back from –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Not only that.</span> <span id="s324">Other instance, which just give you one idea – First of all, the Swedish legation had a place under somebody's command which was called Schützlingsprotokoll, which is in German.</span> <span id="s325">I don't know if you speak any German.</span> <span id="s326">It's called Schützlingsprotokoll.</span> <span id="s327">In that young men were having all kinds of uniforms starting from priest to soldier to Nazi.</span> <span id="s328">And when they came in for help, these young men have been going out like – as I said, depending on the situation, in certain uniforms and trying to bring people out.</span> <span id="s329">Now, that was not Wallenberg's personal, but it was under his command.</span> <span id="s330">It happened that one of the houses – I did many things, you know.</span> <span id="s331">When, for instance, the International Ghetto was built, I'm sure you heard about it, it was called the International Ghetto, where not only the Swedish but different other legation who had imitated the Swedish success, Swiss, Vatican and so forth.</span> <span id="s332">And was – a certain part in Budapest was called the International Ghetto which was under protection of different legations.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">02:09:06 And when there was need for it, I was there for a day to try to get people in, because all the people who lived there, had to go out if they were Christians, and the Jews were coming in under Swedish protection or any other protection.</span> <span id="s334">There were – because the plan of the Nazi government was – Hungarian Nazi government was, up till then, from March 19….</span> <span id="s335">Look, if I'm telling something you heard before, then stop me.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Tell us everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Up till March 19, start – they did not put the Jews in ghettos.</span> <span id="s338">They named certain houses yellow‑star houses which was mostly occupied by Jews.</span> <span id="s339">But that was all over Budapest.</span> <span id="s340">Certain house was, the next house wasn't, and they were called yellow‑star houses.</span> <span id="s341">Now, the plan of the Hungarian Nazi government was, at the end, to empty all those houses and put them in the actual ghetto, which there was a ghetto which was not done and not established, actually, by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s342">It was its own ghetto like in every European city.</span> <span id="s343">Mostly for the very orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s344">And they lived there for years and years.</span> <span id="s345">But as I said, they were concentrated – it was concentration by little.</span> <span id="s346">First in houses, and then to put them in the ghetto and then to kill the ghetto.</span> <span id="s347">That was the plan.</span> <span id="s348">Now, the Swedish or International Ghetto was these people with passports.</span> <span id="s349">And not in those, but in one of the houses which was a yellow‑star house, I was with Wallenberg, and the phone said that one of the yellow‑star houses had been taken away by the Arrow Cross, which is the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s350">So Wallenberg said to me, "Let's go."</span> <span id="s351">And I went too, not as photographer, but as interpreter.</span> <span id="s352">With him I spoke either German or English.</span> <span id="s353">I knew a little English.</span> <span id="s354">And we arrived to the house, and the house was empty.</span> <span id="s355">And I don't know what floor.</span> <span id="s356">There was one Arrow Cross officer who was not only Arrow Cross, but he was – it is hard to translate it from Hungarian.</span> <span id="s357">It was a – a certain organization of the Arrow Cross, to put it this way, who was designated strictly for killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">02:12:03 So this captain was there from the Arrow Cross, and Wallenberg told me – I was the interpreter – "Ask him where are the Jews," because there was nobody in the house.</span> <span id="s359">He said, "In the Danube."</span> <span id="s360">"Ask him why."</span> <span id="s361">He said it as natural as he can, "Because they were dirty Jews."</span> <span id="s362">He also said, "They were swimming in the Danube," yeah.</span> <span id="s363">So he did not only go out – when he got – there was help here needed, he went out.</span> <span id="s364">Now, he said to me that, "There is nothing we can do here," and we left.</span> <span id="s365">Next question.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did he go to the Danube?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Did he go to the Danube?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No.</span> <span id="s370">Why?</span> <span id="s371">For what?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s374">That was over.</span> <span id="s375">No.</span> <span id="s376">He said to me, "We cannot help here," so .....</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: It strikes me that you were all actually very young, younger than we think looking, say, at Wallenberg's pictures.</span> <span id="s378">Could you talk something about your – the youth of the people involved?</span> <span id="s379">How old was Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: He was born in 1912, so thirty – can you count?</span> <span id="s381">He was born in 1912.</span> <span id="s382">So 32.</span> <span id="s383">Yeah.</span> <span id="s384">Yeah, he was 32.</span> <span id="s385">Now, the people involved, except that organization which I told you that – the Schützlingsprotokoll, they – all of them were older than I was; yes, quite older.</span> <span id="s386">And the technicality, because it was a big organization and a fantastic organization; very well organized, issuing the passports.</span> <span id="s387">Now, his idea was to make them, because the Germans – and that was not with the Hungarians; mostly with the Germans – they like legality, and he wanted to make it real legal.</span> <span id="s388">And all his speaking with the Hungarian Nazi government or with the Germans, he was proving – in other words, it wasn't just a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s389">It was all the documents behind it.</span> <span id="s390">Like if it called – it was needed – excuse me – Swedish connection.</span> <span id="s391">The Swedish, the letters, proving the Swedish connection have been all documented with each passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">02:15:00 Against that was the Swiss legations organization who had issued to anybody, without any paperwork background, which that's why it took away a lot from the Swedish organization in legality.</span> <span id="s393">And – and also, it was not recognized.</span> <span id="s394">Or if it was, it was not recognized like the Swedish.</span> <span id="s395">And the reason for that was, that he was a good man, but he did not take as part in it.</span> <span id="s396">His name was Lutz, who was the Swiss legation's – head of the Swiss legation.</span> <span id="s397">And he did not take part just – as Wallenberg did, bodily and in mind.</span> <span id="s398">So the Swiss legation was called the Baross utca, and anybody – and there would be crowds there.</span> <span id="s399">When there was – sooner or later, they just started up without any paperwork.</span> <span id="s400">Now, to some people this was right; to some people this was wrong.</span> <span id="s401">I don't know if I under– I make myself understand why, but behind the Swiss legations, which was not in the Swiss legation building – it was in the Baross utca, it was called – was mostly the Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s402">They were under the cover of Swiss legation doing – they were mostly Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: It strikes me that a lot of what Wallenberg did, because he was acting so quickly and improvising actions all the time –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: – depended a great deal on, as it must have for all of you, speaking different languages, taking each day or each hour as it came.</span> <span id="s406">And also what you're referring to, it seems to me that he understood the nature of the Nazi respect for bureaucracy–</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: …and he took advantage of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Will you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s412">You said it right.</span> <span id="s413">Now, you're mentioning with all different languages, as I said, mostly it was either German or English.</span> <span id="s414">And most of the people around him – I forgot to tell you when I met him first he asked me, "Do you speak any other language?"</span> <span id="s415">And I told him, "Yes, German."</span> <span id="s416">And that's when he said that, "You'll be my photographer."</span> <span id="s417">The organization had, as far the office work, they were people mostly–</span></p> <p><span id="s418">02:18:00and there was a big electrical and light bulb and radio factory in Budapest, and they were the head of that company.</span> <span id="s419">Because they were one of the first ones who – because it was partly Swedish owned, if I remember right, the factory.</span> <span id="s420">They were the first ones who received Swedish passport.</span> <span id="s421">Now, those passports were actually original Swedish passport, like you say an American passport.</span> <span id="s422">The Schutzpass idea came only after that.</span> <span id="s423">So there was a difference.</span> <span id="s424">And then I – one day I took pictures of that group.</span> <span id="s425">He asked me, and he told me, "This is for P.R. purpose.</span> <span id="s426">I want to send it."</span> <span id="s427">And I – it was very legitimate because he wanted to show his co‑workers.</span> <span id="s428">And I think you have that picture.</span> <span id="s429">That was people I still remember the names, and they were from that factory.</span> <span id="s430">And they were head of this – it was a big organization.</span> <span id="s431">And as I said before, I don't want to be repetitious, it was well organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: What was it like to work with Wallenberg?</span> <span id="s433">What was he like?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I'm saying it now, and I'm saying that for years, and somehow I – just the other day I found out, and I was amazed, because my idea of him was, and is, that he was like the Scarlet Pimpernel.</span> <span id="s435">Even his manners was Leslie Howard; were very low key, not ostentatious.</span> <span id="s436">Sometimes [gesturing].</span> <span id="s437">He was a very low key, very good looking – not great, but good looking young man.</span> <span id="s438">But to me he was always the Scarlet Pimpernel.</span> <span id="s439">And just the other day – I don't want to go into the source, but his sister is saying that, and I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s440">I'm still puzzled because it happened a few days ago.</span> <span id="s441">His sister, I don't know if you heard about her, they were in the movies in the early '40s in London, and he had a problem always, he wasn't doing what he liked to do.</span> <span id="s442">And they saw the Scarlet – it wasn't the Scarlet.</span> <span id="s443">The second, Mr. Smith?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">02:21:00 You know, the second, which Leslie Howard played when he was going to Germany with a crew.</span> <span id="s445">You never heard of that movie?</span> <span id="s446">And he is a British professor, and he's helping Jews out from Germany.</span> <span id="s447">Pimpernel Smith, that was the movie's title.</span> <span id="s448">And supposedly he came out from the movie with his sister and said, "You know, this is what I would like to do."</span> <span id="s449">And in just a few days later, I experience that.</span> <span id="s450">So, that says how he was; right?</span> <span id="s451">That's how he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did he give –</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: But he was, at the same time, very firm in his – in his saying what he is believing, but not bossy.</span> <span id="s454">Firm.</span> <span id="s455">And I still didn't make up my mind what to call it.</span> <span id="s456">Was he brave or naive?</span> <span id="s457">Because it looked like that he did not know fear.</span> <span id="s458">To give you an example – That was not the last time.</span> <span id="s459">It was beginning of January.</span> <span id="s460">I think it was the eighth.</span> <span id="s461">Almost at the end, because finally Russian troops came in Budapest on 15th, whatever.</span> <span id="s462">He told me one afternoon that, "Tom, let's go up to the Buda side to the mountain and let's see where the Russians are," just for fun.</span> <span id="s463">All right.</span> <span id="s464">He sat in the car, and we had three paid gendarmes who were paid by the legation.</span> <span id="s465">You know, they were our people, with machine guns on the side sticking out of the car.</span> <span id="s466">And the siege was going on.</span> <span id="s467">I mean, all over, bloody soldiers and shooting.</span> <span id="s468">And we go over – it had to be the eighth because after the third the bridges were blown up a day later.</span> <span id="s469">And we can go over to the Buda side up to the mountain, and we step out from the car, and the Russians were on the next mountain shooting over here, and we were at the guns shooting over there.</span> <span id="s470">And we stepped out and we took pictures.</span> <span id="s471">I took pictures of him, which I never had because it was gone.</span> <span id="s472">And like – you know, like a tale, a fairy tale standing there.</span> <span id="s473">He said, "Let's take pictures," and we took pictures.</span> <span id="s474">And in the meantime the war was going on around us.</span> <span id="s475">Now, if that was braveness, I don't know; or naivete, I don't know.</span> <span id="s476">The fact is that while I was there, I didn't think of the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">02:24:00 He took you with his kind of thinking.</span> <span id="s478">Took you with him.</span> <span id="s479">And we're just trying to give a little picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did he ever talk about his reasons for his actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span> <span id="s482">That was obvious.</span> <span id="s483">But, for instance, he liked small jokes.</span> <span id="s484">And he had a friend with me there, and we're sitting in the car.</span> <span id="s485">He said, "I feel like I was kidnapped in the States."</span> <span id="s486">And I thought he was joking.</span> <span id="s487">Right after the war, in his life history, I learned that he was here in – going – in the States going to university; I don't know which one, Chicago, or whatever.</span> <span id="s488">And he was not actually kidnapped but he was robbed on the way of the – and he said, "I feel like."</span> <span id="s489">And I thought he was kidding, and he wasn't.</span> <span id="s490">Now, about his work, why no, there was no question about it.</span> <span id="s491">It would have been just lost time to speak about it.</span> <span id="s492">Not to me, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: He seems to have given a lot of courage to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes, he did, for instance, to me.</span> <span id="s495">Can we stop a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Or you said six minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: No, that's okay.</span> <span id="s499">That was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: That was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Do you need a drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Just a little relaxation.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">02:25:31 End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s505">03:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: You were asked whether you were sleeping in your own home during part of this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I have been sleeping in my home all – all right.</span> <span id="s508">I have to think back.</span> <span id="s509">First of all, it happened just the day when, after – hold on a second – after the Nazis took over and I was still in that labor camp.</span> <span id="s510">And I wanted to know, because I had the right from my captain, as I told you, to go home and sleep.</span> <span id="s511">And that weekend, when the Nazis took over, I was home.</span> <span id="s512">And then I had to go back to the camp, and I was there for two days, or a day.</span> <span id="s513">But I was quite concerned what's happening to my parents because the Nazi government took away the exemptions which Horthy gave.</span> <span id="s514">They nullified it.</span> <span id="s515">So I – another officer with whom I was well, friendship, I told him and he said, "I'll come with you.</span> <span id="s516">I do have, anyway, some pictures to develop and that will be a good excuse."</span> <span id="s517">So we went to the – my parents' home, and I started to develop.</span> <span id="s518">He came with me in the darkroom, looking at this and that.</span> <span id="s519">And suddenly, the bell started non‑stop ringing, the doorbell.</span> <span id="s520">Now, that was a big place, you must understand.</span> <span id="s521">It wasn't only the studio.</span> <span id="s522">It was the darkroom.</span> <span id="s523">It was the living quarters are all in a big place, like top penthouse or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">03:03:00 And I was in the dark in the darkroom and I heard voices, "We are looking for the Jew who came in."</span> <span id="s525">That was me.</span> <span id="s526">Now, nobody would call me a Jew because I didn't have my armband, so somebody in the house who knew me reported it.</span> <span id="s527">So in the dark I was still developing.</span> <span id="s528">I took off my ring, I took off my [gesturing].</span> <span id="s529">I knew they came for me, particularly.</span> <span id="s530">And it wasn't a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s531">So when I finished up the development, I didn't want to ruin, but my heart was pounding.</span> <span id="s532">So I go out and there is my friend, the officer, Hungarian army officer he was, and three Hungarian Nazis from the Arrow Cross dressed in Arrow Cross uniform with machine guns, with hand grenade, with revolver; name it.</span> <span id="s533">They were armed to the [gesturing].</span> <span id="s534">And they started to question me.</span> <span id="s535">So my friend the officer, army officer, pulled his revolver and said, "He's with me and nobody is harming him.</span> <span id="s536">He's doing work for the Army."</span> <span id="s537">And then I recognize.</span> <span id="s538">One of them was working downstairs in that confectionery store.</span> <span id="s539">And he came to me quite – he recognized me.</span> <span id="s540">Said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know him.</span> <span id="s541">He's a good Hungarian boy."</span> <span id="s542">And he left because my friend pulled his revolver.</span> <span id="s543">They were playing with the hand grenades like this.</span> <span id="s544">After the war, a year later I was just shooting in my studio, and a detective came with somebody.</span> <span id="s545">He said that this guy was arrested; that he killed I don't know how many Jews, and "He is calling that he saved your life, and he wants your help."</span> <span id="s546">I went down.</span> <span id="s547">It was the Hungarian Arrow Cross guy.</span> <span id="s548">And I said, "How many people?"</span> <span id="s549">He said, "Hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s550">He was taking them down to the Danube."</span> <span id="s551">What would you do now?</span> <span id="s552">I'm asking you the question.</span> <span id="s553">What would you do in my place?</span> <span id="s554">Because he was calling me as a witness that I save his life.</span> <span id="s555">Answer me.</span> <span id="s556">What would you do?</span> <span id="s557">That's one occasion I'm asking you a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">03:06:00 And I saw – Whether I was right or wrong, I said, "I never saw him before."</span> <span id="s559">I figured he may have saved me – he was not the guy.</span> <span id="s560">It was my friend, the captain, who saved my life because he pulled his – how do I know how many hundreds of other people he killed?</span> <span id="s561">Okay.</span> <span id="s562">That's – I wanted to tell this because ever since, if it comes up in me: Did I do right or wrong?</span> <span id="s563">I could have saved the life maybe, but my testimony, I cannot go against the other people who he killed – that's number one.</span> <span id="s564">Number two, he was not actually the one.</span> <span id="s565">He came to me, because many times I went through this, after I was already saved, after he pulled the gun, after he said then "Get out of here," my friend.</span> <span id="s566">So the question was – Yeah, I slept home then.</span> <span id="s567">Now, after the train story, Wallenberg told me that, "I need this very fast because I want to send it with the next pouch, diplomatic pouch, to Sweden."</span> <span id="s568">"When do you need it?"</span> <span id="s569">"Tomorrow."</span> <span id="s570">So I went home, sleeping.</span> <span id="s571">During the nighttime I print it.</span> <span id="s572">And this is why I don't know how many – I know I printed 12 prints of each.</span> <span id="s573">And there were a lot of pictures.</span> <span id="s574">And I took the pictures and the negatives, and it was already getting dark, and I knew he was – Wallenberg was waiting for me at the legation.</span> <span id="s575">And I was, at that time, mostly dressed not exactly, but similar to the Nazi uniform.</span> <span id="s576">I had boots, I had black riding.</span> <span id="s577">So – I didn't wear the armband.</span> <span id="s578">So I had the pictures, and I went, naturally, on foot to the legation from my parents' house.</span> <span id="s579">It was getting dark, and on one part of the trip was a narrow street, and I have seen people asking for identification over there, and they were Arrow Cross people.</span> <span id="s580">So I went to the other side.</span> <span id="s581">I was zigzagging until I reached the big square, and by that time it was really dark.</span> <span id="s582">And that Arrow Cross guy was also asking for – but I was too late.</span> <span id="s583">He was that close, as you to me now.</span> <span id="s584">And with a lamp, he was putting the lamp – you know, small lamp with batteries.</span> <span id="s585">Flashlight.</span> <span id="s586">You see?</span> <span id="s587">Flashlight, and asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">03:09:00 And there was somebody just showing his identification.</span> <span id="s589">So I had to make up my mind.</span> <span id="s590">If I stop and go this way, he would shoot after me.</span> <span id="s591">So I kept going, and when I reached him, the pictures were in my left hand, I said the Hungarian Nazi salute – like “Heil Hitler,” “Éljen Szálasi.”</span> <span id="s592">And he greeted me back like this [gesturing], and I kept going.</span> <span id="s593">And when I told – I reached the legation and I told Wallenberg what happened.</span> <span id="s594">I was still out of breath.</span> <span id="s595">And he told me, "Tom, this is getting really dangerous, so from now on you give me all the negatives undeveloped and we'll take care out there."</span> <span id="s596">So that was the last time I saw these pictures and the negatives, and all the other negatives that I did later.</span> <span id="s597">Now, I still didn't answer the question how long.</span> <span id="s598">So one day shortly after this, which had to be the beginning of December, the fighting was – and the air raids were so heavy that I – but the phones were up to the last moment on.</span> <span id="s599">So it was so heavy fighting that I called my parents.</span> <span id="s600">"I can't get through."</span> <span id="s601">It was really very dangerous.</span> <span id="s602">"I'm going to sleep here."</span> <span id="s603">And from then on I was sleeping at the Ülloi út legation.</span> <span id="s604">And that's where, later on – I don't know if you know that story, which was January the 10th, two days after the mountains, when we were up in the mountains.</span> <span id="s605">One night, it was a snowy night, and one night the Arrow Cross came and the whole legation was taken to the Arrow Cross place, a department of one of the Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s606">So I knew this is the end again.</span> <span id="s607">And I had some false identification with me.</span> <span id="s608">I told you, I didn't believe in them.</span> <span id="s609">That was for the Red Cross, and it had red canvas binding.</span> <span id="s610">Very nice papers they were, stating that I worked for the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s611">And on the way to the Arrow Cross house, I ate it.</span> <span id="s612">It tasted very badly, but I ate it little by little.</span> <span id="s613">And I didn't want them to find it on me.</span> <span id="s614">And there were too many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">03:12:00 Everybody from the whole legation was taken out.</span> <span id="s616">So a lot of people.</span> <span id="s617">Don't ask me how many, because – well over a hundred.</span> <span id="s618">So when we got to one building where they wanted to put us in the cellar, I heard the Arrow Cross yelling at each other, "Put them on top of each other.</span> <span id="s619">They're going to die anyway."</span> <span id="s620">And then they didn't put them because there wasn't place for us, so they took it to their house and started to – They liked my boots.</span> <span id="s621">Right away I found customer.</span> <span id="s622">They said, "This is mine."</span> <span id="s623">And we were standing next to the wall, hands up, and there was an old little guy there who was always very – he was a very nice person, but he always asked questions.</span> <span id="s624">And as we were standing next to the wall ready to go to the Danube for, you know, he is asking me, "Mr. Veres, do you know which way is the Danube?"</span> <span id="s625">So I think I didn't lose my sense of humor.</span> <span id="s626">I told him, "Once the shooting starts, you know we'll be there."</span> <span id="s627">And the next moment a truckload of Hungarian policemen came with Wallenberg heading.</span> <span id="s628">What happened that the Arrow Cross did not note is on the other floor there was a phone connection.</span> <span id="s629">The whole room was phones, the woman who was doing the phones, who was the daughter of the head of the department, phoned Wallenberg and reached him.</span> <span id="s630">And he collected a truckload of Hungarian policemen, and they came with their truck.</span> <span id="s631">And they came in and he said that, "These are my people.</span> <span id="s632">You cannot touch them," and took everybody out.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Did Wallenberg sense that a point would come when he couldn't get away with these demands –</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: – anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Yes, after that.</span> <span id="s637">He had to hide himself, and he was hiding in one of the big bank's bank-vault, which was just a block away from where – I knew it from this woman.</span> <span id="s638">This building was one block where my parents' home was, and he was hiding in the bank-vault.</span> <span id="s639">Only with a password you could go in.</span> <span id="s640">And that was the last time I met him,</span></p> <p><span id="s641">03:15:00 when I got the phone from the super from the house that the Arrow Cross took away the whole cellar, Christians and Jews, everybody, where they lived, because they discovered a big, huge food supply from the confectionery, and they wanted the food take away.</span> <span id="s642">Now, the owner of that whole building and the confectionery, which wasn't just a little confection – now it's called the same name – was Swiss, originally Swiss owned.</span> <span id="s643">And one of the families started to yell to the Arrow Cross, "You can't take this away.</span> <span id="s644">This is Swiss owned."</span> <span id="s645">And the Arrow Cross, as much as they knew, "Swiss?</span> <span id="s646">That has to be Jews."</span> <span id="s647">And they were not Jews.</span> <span id="s648">And they took everybody from the cellar, Jew and not Jew alike, and emptied out the whole building.</span> <span id="s649">It was full of chocolate and sugar and you name it, sardines, and they took it.</span> <span id="s650">And they took everybody to that department of the Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s651">And the people who they let out who were friends from the building told me that they were – last time they saw them, they were also hands up next to the wall, and they took them down to the Danube the next night to kill them.</span> <span id="s652">And the interesting part, besides that is, is that – I don't know if you know that statue – the original statue of Wallenberg which is standing – was standing in the little square where the International Ghetto was, and I don't know if you know the story.</span> <span id="s653">The Russians stole the statue.</span> <span id="s654">In any case, interesting part, if you want, I'll tell you, that little park where that statue – and I have that picture – which used to stand about maybe a hundred yards from them, that was the Danube and that's where they killed my parents, 200 yards from his statue which was raised later.</span> <span id="s655">Now, the story of the statue, shall I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: I'd like to ask you something else about the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Ask me a question.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: The photographs that you have which we're using –</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: They're just minor.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: – those people pulled out – pulled out from deportation –</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: – could you describe something about that scene and what those people – what the effect on them was of the sudden change of fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: It was not to believe it, almost, you know, this could happen.</span> <span id="s664">And then those pictures, Wallenberg was in another car, and I took pictures while the car was following them, went to the left and to the right, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">03:18:08 I took some pictures there, some of, and they thought of me that Wallenberg is here.</span> <span id="s666">But they never called him Raoul, and anybody would tell you that they knew him that well.</span> <span id="s667">Now, if that was out of respect or – but he was not called Raoul.</span> <span id="s668">Nobody that I knew called him Raoul.</span> <span id="s669">So they said, "Wallenberg is here.</span> <span id="s670">Wallenberg is here."</span> <span id="s671">And that gave them some courage.</span> <span id="s672">And I took pictures.</span> <span id="s673">I wasn't Wallenberg, but I was sticking out from the car, and while the car was going slow, I took some pictures.</span> <span id="s674">Yes, that feeling was a relief.</span> <span id="s675">But it is hard to explain.</span> <span id="s676">That friend of mine who called me, "Tom, Tom," you know – excuse me – I took him to one of the buildings, safe buildings, and he didn't, naturally, have papers because I told you that I took him out without papers.</span> <span id="s677">And I told him, "Look, this is where I have the little place – studio where I took the passport pictures.”</span> <span id="s678">I said, "I'm going to take your pictures now, and stay here.</span> <span id="s679">You have food, you can sleep here, and I'll be back when I arrange for you with the ready papers."</span> <span id="s680">Two days later his mother, who I know from schooling, comes to the legation that, "Tommy, please help now.</span> <span id="s681">They took him away."</span> <span id="s682">"What do you mean?</span> <span id="s683">I told him he was safe there."</span> <span id="s684">"Yes, but he went down because his fiancée was living two blocks from there and they caught him on the street."</span> <span id="s685">I said, "I'm sorry, I – I– this way I cannot –" And he never returned.</span> <span id="s686">He was taken care.</span> <span id="s687">So he was saved there, and then died there.</span> <span id="s688">You never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: And that group of people who were pulled out of the actual scene of deportation, they were taken to the Swedish houses for protection?</span> <span id="s690">Is that – They were housed, then –</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: First, I'm trying to explain it to you that issue.</span> <span id="s692">I told you the legality was important.</span> <span id="s693">So first they had to supply them with papers, the ones who didn't have paper.</span> <span id="s694">The ones who had the paper were taken to the international houses, Swedish houses.</span> <span id="s695">The ones who didn't have the papers, they were not put in there.</span> <span id="s696">Not to endanger the others, they were in other houses owned by the legation waiting to have their passports ready.</span> <span id="s697">In order to have the passports, first I had to take passport pictures of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">03:21:00 And then it went on a procedure; three, four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s701">Tom, could you tell me something about what use Wallenberg made of these pictures even while you were all still working?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: No, except that he sent them out.</span> <span id="s703">There was no use there to use them.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: I thought I'd read somewhere that they – a few pictures were taken and put in front of the Hungarian Nazi –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s706">You read in a book.</span> <span id="s707">I don't know; I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s708">So I can tell you only, in all honesty, what I have seen.</span> <span id="s709">The use – well, I also did – actually, they were not the pictures.</span> <span id="s710">I had, for instance, Xeroxed – now I'm using Xerox, my God – photocopied, all the Schutzpässe and he had them in a book.</span> <span id="s711">You had to read them too.</span> <span id="s712">So that was an immediate use besides my passport pictures.</span> <span id="s713">And then it was – my parents had been taken away January 12th.</span> <span id="s714">It had to be January the 10th – no.</span> <span id="s715">It was – in any case, I think it was the 10th when I was with him, and he was speaking – I wasn't in the room, but I was waiting outside with the head of the SS troops who had been surrounding – the defense of the surrounding of Budapest who were, I don't know Ober– Obersturmbannführer [inaudible], whatever.</span> <span id="s716">His name I don't remember, but they exist.</span> <span id="s717">And he gave a paper to Wallenberg after a long conversation approving with Wallenberg's conviction that what he should do.</span> <span id="s718">He gave a paper that the head of the surrounding SS troops, "Obersturmbannführer," whatever, "is guaranteeing the ghetto" because it was ready to blowup, and in the personal life of every Jew in Budapest.</span> <span id="s719">And when he came out, he told me that, "Tom, I need copies on these, as many as you can do."</span> <span id="s720">I said, "There is no –" at that time everybody is living already in the cellar.</span> <span id="s721">He said, "Do the best you can."</span> <span id="s722">And he drove me to my parents' home.</span> <span id="s723">And everybody was in the cellar, but I told you two days later, they – and in one little closed – enclosed place, I took developer down and the necessary chemicals, and all night – I don't know how much you know about photography with the old‑fashioned way that you put it in between two glasses, but there was no electricity.</span> <span id="s724">I used candlelight, and doing it under the candle I made about a hundred prints of that paper, which – And he came for me the next day, and that was the last time I saw my parents, and I gave them one of these papers, but didn't help any.</span> <span id="s725">And that was a very – that was the last time.</span> <span id="s726">But that was one of a kind, you know, that under – no electricity.</span> <span id="s727">But he didn't say to me, "How did you do that?"</span> <span id="s728">He didn't even ask.</span> <span id="s729">For everything, this gives – his mind was set at the end to say it.</span> <span id="s730">But "how" and "when" and "why" and "how did you," that doesn't interest him.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Had you ever seen him scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No.</span> <span id="s733">Again, I don't know if that was braveness or naivete.</span> <span id="s734">No, I haven't.</span> <span id="s735">I told you stories of him which – no, definitely no.</span> <span id="s736">And even if he was, I didn't see him showing it.</span> <span id="s737">Next question.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: I take it he kept very calm and cool through most circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: Always, always.</span> <span id="s740">Not one time have I seen him excited or – you know, that – showed – showing any kind of emotion like this.</span> <span id="s741">Joking, yes, which I told you when we have been going up to the mountain, but not – He was a calm, cool man.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Just for the record, would you tell me what became of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Would you just tell us for the record what became of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I told you.</span> <span id="s746">I told you that they were killed at the Danube.</span> <span id="s747">I told you before; remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">03:27:00</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Right at that time; right.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Very close to the time that they were taken from your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s753">That night.</span> <span id="s754">I didn't know at that time.</span> <span id="s755">It took me about a half a year to know it and to sink in.</span> <span id="s756">They were shot in the Danube.</span> <span id="s757">It's –</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: And your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: My brother was here in the States.</span> <span id="s760">He was here since 1939.</span> <span id="s761">He's not alive, he died of cancer but – in 1974.</span> <span id="s762">And even he, when I told him stories, he did not realize the full weight of the history of it.</span> <span id="s763">And when I came here, I, I wanted to come here for a long time, and I sent papers, my uncle who lived here in Los Angeles since the mid‑thirties, and I gave him the original book on Wallenberg which I have to write, and I gave him papers; among them, one which stated that I am the official photographer of the Swedish legation.</span> <span id="s764">And nobody knew about Wallenberg in 1956.</span> <span id="s765">And when I started to try to tell stories, you know, either they didn't understand or they didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s766">They thought I'm making it up.</span> <span id="s767">If they believed it, it sounded too strong, until I mentioned it much earlier that – in 1980 or '81, I have met one Sunday morning in the Sunday Times magazine my pictures and his story.</span> <span id="s768">And it was an up and down.</span> <span id="s769">For a while it was interesting, and then it again became a non‑person, and then again something happened.</span> <span id="s770">I believe that in 19– I think it was '56 that I read about him, that Gromyko, the Russian foreign minister, admitted that he died in Russian prison, which nobody believed, but it was in '47.</span> <span id="s771">That was the first time that they have spoken about him.</span> <span id="s772">I told you the last time I saw him in that vault.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s775">4:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s777">When you're ready, would you describe the last time you saw Wallenberg and what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">03:29:52</span></p> <p><span id="s779">04:01:23</span></p> <p><span id="s780">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: What happened afterward?</span> <span id="s782">Okay.</span> <span id="s783">When I got the phone call from the super in the building where my parents were, I was trying to get through.</span> <span id="s784">Knowing Wallenberg's hiding place, I wanted to speak to him.</span> <span id="s785">But the fighting was so strong, I couldn't get through.</span> <span id="s786">I mean, really.</span> <span id="s787">You can imagine that I was trying.</span> <span id="s788">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s789">Took me two days to get through.</span> <span id="s790">And I know the password.</span> <span id="s791">And as I have mentioned it, the bank-vault was a block away from the Gerbeaud house.</span> <span id="s792">They had been taken away.</span> <span id="s793">So I went to the bank-vault, said the password, and then he was coming out.</span> <span id="s794">And I told him what happened.</span> <span id="s795">He said, "Tom, you know it's too late now.</span> <span id="s796">I can't do anything."</span> <span id="s797">So a few other people came out.</span> <span id="s798">There were just a few people in the bank-vault.</span> <span id="s799">And we went to the big – it was like a – it's a bank, you know, with all the windows there.</span> <span id="s800">And we were standing there in a round circle with the people who came out who were with him.</span> <span id="s801">They were important people for the legation.</span> <span id="s802">And his chauffeur, Vili.</span> <span id="s803">And we were standing in a circle, and the fighting outside is going on, and he started saying that, "I'm going to Debrecen to pick up the, the new Hungarian – with new Hungarian government to plan for the future."</span></p> <p><span id="s804">04:03:15 I don't know if you know it.</span> <span id="s805">There was a big plan of his.</span> <span id="s806">He wanted to – the plan was almost ready.</span> <span id="s807">After the war, relief, and help to people.</span> <span id="s808">And it wasn't only for Jews.</span> <span id="s809">It was for the whole country.</span> <span id="s810">It was called the “Nansen Plan.”</span> <span id="s811">And as we were standing there – And he also asked me if I want to come with him, and I said, "I can't, you know.</span> <span id="s812">I'm looking –" I didn't know what happened to my parents, because I told you it took me a half a year.</span> <span id="s813">And so I said, "No, I can't.</span> <span id="s814">I'm looking for my parents, to help."</span> <span id="s815">And as we were standing in that circle, one of them was about that size [gesturing], he went flat on his stomach and down on the floor.</span> <span id="s816">As it turned out, from a stray bullet, he was shot in the heart, just as we were standing there.</span> <span id="s817">And that was the last time I have seen him, which was – it had to be either 14 or 15 of January.</span> <span id="s818">Now, about the statue, which you didn't ask me, and you said you don't know.</span> <span id="s819">Do you know about the statue?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">[Technical conversation] Many years after, they raised money to raise a statue for him.</span> <span id="s821">And I know the artist and the people who were involved, and they asked me to take the little – it's called maquette of the statue and I was working.</span> <span id="s822">On the pedestal of the statue was his profile, and the last eight or ten pictures, I was working with the artist, was done after – in the photography, what I did on him.</span> <span id="s823">That remind me; I never saw those pictures again.</span> <span id="s824">So I worked for a while with the artist; you know, in telling, showing pictures, this and that.</span> <span id="s825">And that was – the statue itself was a big snake with a man killing the snake.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">04:06:12 And on the side on the pedestal was his name and saying thanks for him from the Hungarian people.</span> <span id="s827">And they called me that – I don't know what day.</span> <span id="s828">Maybe it was a Friday, that the statue is up; "We just finished it," in that park I have told you, "and take some pictures before the official unveiling on Sunday."</span> <span id="s829">And that never came because the statue disappeared in the thin air.</span> <span id="s830">Now you have to live those times; that was already the Russians, the Communists, the everybody.</span> <span id="s831">Why?</span> <span id="s832">Everybody knew that they didn't like him.</span> <span id="s833">So obviously it was stolen by the Russians.</span> <span id="s834">Now, you don't – that was a big statue from here to there [gesturing].</span> <span id="s835">A year later, I go to one of the exhibitions, art exhibitions, in Budapest, and the statue is there without his profile and without the inscription, and the statue's name was "Fight Against Fascism."</span> <span id="s836">Years later, I was already here, and I was reading – somebody sent me a Hungarian magazine, and I see the statue there.</span> <span id="s837">Said that – what was his name?</span> <span id="s838">The Indonesian head – Sukarno.</span> <span id="s839">Sukarno was in Budapest and fell in love with a picture which – which title is "The Snake Killer," and he bought it for his garden many moons later.</span> <span id="s840">And obviously, supposedly, right now it's standing – they must have different versions.</span> <span id="s841">Cannot be the same.</span> <span id="s842">But the same statue is one of the – in front of the pharmaceutical company – you're shaking your – you heard it?</span> <span id="s843">No.</span> <span id="s844">Okay…pharmaceutical companies in Hungary; standing there.</span> <span id="s845">I don't know if it has a title or not, but I had the – I read it also, and I know it's true.</span> <span id="s846">So that's the story of one of his – And then they raised statues today, which has nothing to do with that one, and doesn't remember Wallenberg to me at all, so....</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: I wanted to go back to in the times that you were with Wallenberg and you were photographing him when he was–</span></p> <p><span id="s848">04:09:05</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: …confronting the deportation attempts, what's the most surprising thing that he did?</span> <span id="s851">What surprised you or astonished you the most in his actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Nothing astonished me; nothing.</span> <span id="s853">Because I don't know how to explain it to you, but the whole thing was like a smooth operation.</span> <span id="s854">It, it, it was natural.</span> <span id="s855">You didn't question why it happened; what is it.</span> <span id="s856">No.</span> <span id="s857">I don't know if it gives you an explanation or not, but there were no surprises.</span> <span id="s858">Your whole concentration was to help to people.</span> <span id="s859">But that was not surprising.</span> <span id="s860">Surprising was the day by day happenings that they called you from here or for there.</span> <span id="s861">They taking people here and come out from the big factory or – that was surprising.</span> <span id="s862">It wasn't surprising.</span> <span id="s863">It was a thing that you worked on it, but not surprised.</span> <span id="s864">I cannot tell you one incident which I would call that surprising.</span> <span id="s865">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: And yet what he did was so unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s868">That's surprising.</span> <span id="s869">That's the surprising.</span> <span id="s870">Unique and still taking it as nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Do you think anyone else could have done similar things?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Well, you're asking me that.</span> <span id="s873">I don't know.</span> <span id="s874">It took a special man to do it.</span> <span id="s875">But how many special men are coming up when the time comes and stand up.</span> <span id="s876">Well, maybe there are lots of them, but they are not there when it's needed.</span> <span id="s877">Is it surprising that it's not surprising?</span> <span id="s878">It is the most natural, I cannot give you any other description than it was just so natural, so smooth.</span> <span id="s879">And it was a great deal – deed, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Can you give us the picture of any other interactions he had, you know, before that end of November railway station?</span> <span id="s881">Any other scenes of that kind you could describe for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Well, I gave you the – that house when everybody was taken.</span> <span id="s883">I can – For instance, when I told you the head of the SS group, they were going on the street.</span> <span id="s884">Nobody was on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">04:12:05 Nobody asked, "How come we are all alone on the street."</span> <span id="s886">I'm trying to visualize it.</span> <span id="s887">And it was he – you wouldn't know because you have to go deeper.</span> <span id="s888">Somebody who had the connection between the Budapest and – that we had people built in, who were working for us but they were outside, either Nazis or – and, and his chauffeur, that's when we were….</span> <span id="s889">No, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s890">That happened when we were stepping out from the car and going to make the copy, copy negatives.</span> <span id="s891">You know, when I told you….</span> <span id="s892">Something wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: We're getting a high‑pitched tone somewhere.</span> <span id="s894">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s896">Where were we?</span> <span id="s897">We were on the street, stepping out.</span> <span id="s898">And I'm just trying to give you that nobody dared to go out on the street, and there we were, walking on the street.</span> <span id="s899">Now, this is nothing because you walk on the street every day, but that was some kind of special event, you know.</span> <span id="s900">And came three; two of them Arrow Cross uniform, and then other one, a streetcar conductor with his streetcar uniform, and – but with the Nazi armband.</span> <span id="s901">So they came ahead, and we just went by.</span> <span id="s902">And after that, we were just talking.</span> <span id="s903">“They could have stopped us.</span> <span id="s904">They could have stopped us.”</span> <span id="s905">Now, this is true.</span> <span id="s906">That happened quite late, before the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s907">Maybe two weeks later, I was passing by – as a matter of fact, Genya showed me a picture.</span> <span id="s908">The Communist party's headquarter, I passed by, and they had armed guards in the doorway, guns, and the Russians were already in two weeks later.</span> <span id="s909">What do you think?</span> <span id="s910">Who was the guy standing in the – with the Communist, red armband?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">04:15:00 The streetcar conductor I saw two weeks before with the Arrow Cross band.</span> <span id="s912">That's – I know it's not easy to believe, but I remembered his face.</span> <span id="s913">I'm very good with faces; very bad with names.</span> <span id="s914">I didn't ask his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Did you understand the power your photographs could have?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: You know what?</span> <span id="s917">I think I did.</span> <span id="s918">As a matter of fact, not only photographs.</span> <span id="s919">I did movies.</span> <span id="s920">I mean, today, home movie.</span> <span id="s921">I had a little Kodak.</span> <span id="s922">At that time it was a big thing, but eight millimeter movie.</span> <span id="s923">Now, many of the films never reached anywhere because, as I mentioned to you, in the last days he was hiding, so I had movies, and I was all the time with a – I don't know why, but – and he was going, too, all the time.</span> <span id="s924">In German it's rucksack, when you go to – back knap– backpack.</span> <span id="s925">I had all my things in there.</span> <span id="s926">Backpack; cameras, undeveloped films.</span> <span id="s927">And when the biggest fight was going on where the legation was, we were in the cellar, certain part, a few of us, and suddenly a Russian comes in.</span> <span id="s928">Here we are.</span> <span id="s929">The Russians occupied us.</span> <span id="s930">He was standing at the top of the stairway.</span> <span id="s931">He said – don't tell me how we understood it, but he said, "I'm going to stand here to stand guard."</span> <span id="s932">Let's say this is over there.</span> <span id="s933">Half an hour later, on the other side the wall opens and the German head comes in and says, "Anybody here?"</span> <span id="s934">you know.</span> <span id="s935">And we told him, "Hey, get out of here.</span> <span id="s936">The Russian's are over there."</span> <span id="s937">No, he is going to collect the Germans, and he did.</span> <span id="s938">So we knew there will be a big fight going on there.</span> <span id="s939">And we broke through the wall which has a certain spot in it just for this purpose, and went, which was connected with other big cellar where at least a hundred people, women and children were.</span> <span id="s940">Good enough.</span> <span id="s941">Fifteen minutes later, the German comes in with machine gun, and that was deliberate up high, you know.</span> <span id="s942">We had to go – And on the other side, the Russian.</span> <span id="s943">And they started to shoot each other above our head.</span> <span id="s944">And in the short period it was so full of gunpowder, smoke; children cried, and women.</span> <span id="s945">So we said, "Let's try, and try to get out from here."</span></p> <p><span id="s946">04:18:05 And slowly we broke out the next wall, and trying the children and women.</span> <span id="s947">And my knapsack was in my way, and I gave it to somebody, friend, and I said, "Look.</span> <span id="s948">I'm helping the women and children.</span> <span id="s949">You come after us anyway."</span> <span id="s950">And we – took us a day to go about ten houses from cellar to cellar to cellar.</span> <span id="s951">Two hours later, this friend of mine showed up.</span> <span id="s952">I said, "Where's my knapsack?"</span> <span id="s953">He said, "The Russians took it."</span> <span id="s954">There went my films, my cameras, everything.</span> <span id="s955">What was not developed, what was not given to him yet; everything.</span> <span id="s956">Ask question.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Was it known really directly there in Budapest what was happening in Auschwitz with the Hungarian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: You mean at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: The intense rate of killing that was taking place.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Wait.</span> <span id="s961">Are you speaking after the war or during the –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: In '44, during that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s964">You heard the stories, but it wasn't accepted or – or – or proven as a known fact.</span> <span id="s965">They was speaking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Did Wallenberg know, clearly?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s968">I really don't know.</span> <span id="s969">I never spoke about things – what happened after.</span> <span id="s970">But for instance, when I was in Miskolc, that was before Wallenberg, which I told you, in labor camp.</span> <span id="s971">As you know, the countryside was almost clean from Jews by the time he came, which was in July.</span> <span id="s972">And half of the outfit was from Miskolc, and the parents – parents were in the ghetto, and we help them to pack and – you know, because they were deported.</span> <span id="s973">And the trains were going next where we had our outfit.</span> <span id="s974">And one morning next to the train there were handwritten signs to the boys, some of the boys, "Goodbye.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">04:21:08 I don't know if I'll see you."</span> <span id="s976">And we were picking up and giving whoever it belonged to.</span> <span id="s977">And a few weeks later, postcards were coming for the boys, and it said – I don't know if you ever heard the name Waldsee.</span> <span id="s978">That was the code name of Auschwitz, and saying it was – as the location.</span> <span id="s979">Do you speak any German?</span> <span id="s980">It sounds like a resort area, you know?</span> <span id="s981">Waldsee.</span> <span id="s982">And they stereotype.</span> <span id="s983">They said, "We are feeling good, we are working; we are feeling good, we are working; we are working, we are feeling good.</span> <span id="s984">Everything is fine."</span> <span id="s985">And that was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s986">But we didn't know it.</span> <span id="s987">And they were boys who thought, "Oh, that's all right," you know.</span> <span id="s988">They are working.</span> <span id="s989">And the name was – you never heard?</span> <span id="s990">Waldsee, but there was no talk about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s991">Waldsee was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s992">If he knew it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s993">I don't – maybe.</span> <span id="s994">I don't know.</span> <span id="s995">I'm trying to give you only what I know without any question.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Are there any other people who worked directly with you with Wallenberg that stand out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Well, there were the – who was with him in the vault.</span> <span id="s998">Hugo Wohl who was the head of the electrical factory, and Forgács who was his – they were all connected with that factory, and their sons.</span> <span id="s999">I was in good.</span> <span id="s1000">And then there are people whose name I don't mention because I know they have nothing to do with it in their life.</span> <span id="s1001">It turned out that they don't want to be heard.</span> <span id="s1002">I wanted to say something.</span> <span id="s1003">I interrupted myself, but I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1004">Yeah; that – Remember when I told you when I was introduced to him, he said that "You will report direct to me."</span> <span id="s1005">And for good reasons I kept my distance, and with his thoughts also, that I did not mingle too much.</span> <span id="s1006">First of all, you didn't know – what I was doing was undercover even there, because you didn't know who is squealing on who and what – you know, to be caught.</span> <span id="s1007">So I had to be very careful telling people this I'm taking pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">04:24:09 So I had a special place there.</span> <span id="s1009">I was in connection with many people, but many of them didn't even know that I exist.</span> <span id="s1010">And as I told you, I just – I know not many, maybe two or three names, which I can't mention because I know that they wouldn't want.</span> <span id="s1011">Why, don't ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Did Wallenberg change your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: First of all, he was life.</span> <span id="s1014">Not intentionally or unintentionally, but I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s1015">Maybe I would with some other – I don't know – In my whole life, it's not a daily routine, but he left a big mark on my way of thinking even if I don't think about him directly.</span> <span id="s1016">So when I had a chance, I was trying to help.</span> <span id="s1017">Not in those circumstances, but I had my other later on with the Communist government and so forth, which I was against.</span> <span id="s1018">So he left – he left a deep mark on my mind and in my heart, in a good way.</span> <span id="s1019">Sometimes I was just suppressing, you know, because for a while, when – when nobody was listening, I was trying to tell a story and was trying to tell people about him and they didn't listen, so I buried it.</span> <span id="s1020">And it's – I call it lately, maybe in the last few years.</span> <span id="s1021">And then I saw many that I – I'm still not active because even today, I don't see too many things right about what people are doing.</span> <span id="s1022">Many are just there; not just there, but making money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: What would you like younger people who are not familiar with his actions, what would you want them to know about what he did, what he was, what he is for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">04:27:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: For me or for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: In the sense of what he did, what that represents, how that changed you for the good.</span> <span id="s1027">How would you communicate that to younger people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: It's easy to live when there is no trouble in your life, and you will find only few people who will stand up, and you never know where the trouble comes; from the right or to the left.</span> <span id="s1029">And try to be a mensch, which he was.</span> <span id="s1030">That's it, a mensch, which he was.</span> <span id="s1031">Because you don't find this type every day, and you may not recognize it when there is no trouble.</span> <span id="s1032">But you do know who it is by the action when it's there.</span> <span id="s1033">And very few people stand up when it's needed.</span> <span id="s1034">And you think they are good friends, and they don't stand up for you.</span> <span id="s1035">And do not wait for the time when the trouble is coming.</span> <span id="s1036">Try to prevent the trouble.</span> <span id="s1037">Because no matter where it happens in the world, should it be Hungary, Germany, the United States, the gutter people are there, no matter what and where they were born.</span> <span id="s1038">And the same bad idea could be anywhere.</span> <span id="s1039">Should it be called “Communist,” should it be called “Nazi,” they come out from the gutter.</span> <span id="s1040">They float out when the people are not there to prevent it.</span> <span id="s1041">That's it.</span> <span id="s1042">I hope it says it.</span></p> <p><span
