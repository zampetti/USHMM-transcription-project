Now, I would like to have you pronounce your last name and spell it for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Answer: Bucur, B-u-c-u-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: And what is the origin of your last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: It’s Romanian in ancestry.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Oh, it means happy, it means glad.</span> <span id="s10">Mostly happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born here in the United States, in Youngstown, Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: March 5th, 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And where did you grow up?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I grew up actually in Youngstown, Ohio and went to college from -- graduating from high school and then actually never really went back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What language or languages were spoken in your home when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I’m of Romanian ancestry and consequently both my parents had emigrated from Romania and as a result spoke Romanian in th -- in the house and when I went to school, the elementary school, I used to answer the teacher sometimes in Romanian when I didn’t know how to speak it in English.</span> <span id="s19">But nevertheless, mostly Romanian as a youngster, and then -- excuse me -- as I grew up it just completely changed to English and didn’t use it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Can you tell me please about your hometown from your childhood?</span> <span id="s21">What kinds of childhood memories do you have of your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Well, Youngstown at that time was a very thriving me-metropolis because it was on the theater circuit.</span> <span id="s23">My father was a very avid theater-goer, so I recall going to the Hippodrome and the Palace theaters and seeing the old magician shows with Thurston and Blackstone and those, and seeing Al Jolson u-up on the stage in person while in my father’s lap, and then later on as his a-accompanying [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What else do you remember about your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, I -- I -- of course I remember going to high school, perhaps more so than anything else.</span> <span id="s26">I was a pretty good student actually, I was val-valedictorian of my class.</span> <span id="s27">And it was during the early wartime, in -- in 1943 when I graduated, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: I-I’m going to not get the war years just yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Were there many Jews in your town when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Certainly in the area that I grew up in because it was a -- what we call a mixed area.</span> <span id="s32">There were Jews, there were French, there were Italians, and -- in fact, it was almost a -- a conglomeration of just every -- every language there was spoken.</span> <span id="s33">And as a result, actually when I was younger, I spoke some of the other languages, too.</span> <span id="s34">I learned how to speak a little Hungarian and a little bit of Italian, which makes it easier because Romanian and Italian are pretty much aligned.</span> <span id="s35">And under those circumstances even as a youngster, we went to each other’s homes and so forth and heard it spoken because that’s what most people spoke at that time.</span> <span id="s36">And, oh, we were at that time, foreigners.</span> <span id="s37">My father had ra -- come here, as I said, working in the steel mills and when the war broke out and -- first World War, he volunteered to go and he was in the American expeditionary force, and when the war was over he automatically became a citizen.</span> <span id="s38">And he was still a young man, he was only in his 20’s and decided to go back to Romania and find somebody to marry.</span> <span id="s39">And he met my mother and they had a -- a courtship that lasted a short period of time, and he got married there in Romania and came here, and brought her with him.</span> <span id="s40">And s -- at the time that she came to this country, she was pregnant and I was born -- she got here in February and I was born in March, in 1925.</span> <span id="s41">I can always say I was conceived there and dedicated here.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: You said you came from a community with a lot of different people [indecipherable] different --</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Ethnic groups, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: -- ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s45">How did they all get along, and how -- specifically how did people get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: How did the Jewish community get along with the Christian community?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: We had a ver -- marvelously -- that’s -- we had friends that were Romanian Jews that spoke Romanian and actually they didn’t call themselves Jewish.</span> <span id="s49">I don’t think there was any distinction back in those days a-about being a Hebrew or a Jew or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s50">And you were Greek or you were Italian, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s51">And we all played together and we all commiserated with each other when things went wrong, and it was -- the relationship was exceptional, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: You told me about your father’s livelihood, but you didn’t tell me his name.</span> <span id="s53">What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: His -- his name was John also.</span> <span id="s55">So I’m really, to all intents and purposes, junior, but he never used his middle name, so I -- but I have, so I -- that distinguishes me from him, cause I’m a Charles.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And what was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: My mother’s name was Victoria, and she was -- her maiden name was Morjiniana, which just means marginal in nature, coming from the mountain area, and her father’s and -- and her -- her parents were from the mountains, the munchan, in Transylvania, that part of Romania that is western part of the Carpathian mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What work did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: My mother had finished school and -- at mo -- moment that my father brought her here.</span> <span id="s60">She went to school here to speak English, and she was a seamstress for a period of time and during the war working in a -- a -- as a supervisor in a factory making uniforms and raincoats and so forth for the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Do you have any siblings?</span> <span id="s62">A: No, I’m an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: You mentioned high school, do you remember anything about elementary school, and do you know the name of your elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my elementary school because in the fourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I was a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one, in the work that I was doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general class, because it was such a mixed group.</span> <span id="s65">And it was at that time that my mother and I went to visit Europe and this teacher encouraged it, even though I was going to be absent for a period of time, and encouraged it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her and we communicated during the time I was gone.</span> <span id="s66">As a result though, I was gone about a year and a half and went to school there, i-in Romania, so going back to the -- my parent’s homes.</span> <span id="s67">And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left to me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come back here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in America, and from then on it was just here.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: When you were a child, what were your plans for your future, or your ambitions?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: As -- as a child my own ambitions were always -- they were led by my parents because the thing that they wanted most of all was for me to go to school.</span> <span id="s70">And whatever it was that I did, it didn’t make any big difference.</span> <span id="s71">I always leaned toward being a doctor, and my father said, if that’s what you want to be, that’s fine, go ahead, let’s -- but you’ve got to excel in school and -- and this was the time.</span> <span id="s72">And of course the depression held things back considerably during that time.</span> <span id="s73">And we always fared very well, though, because my father had a good -- good job and worked se-several days a week and so that we always didn’t have to worry about whether we had enough food on the table or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What did you do for fun when you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, abs -- I was pretty athletic so I wa -- we played baseball and football.</span> <span id="s76">I played a little baseball.</span> <span id="s77">We had baseball group that collected in the neighborhood and we played other neighborhoods, so we had -- th-that was a real big, going thing.</span> <span id="s78">And football, I tried football in high school for a short period of time, but I was wiser than most kids and I quit it.</span> <span id="s79">They didn’t pay very much in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Did you come from a religiously observant family?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s82">Yes.</span> <span id="s83">My father came from a minister’s family.</span> <span id="s84">Actually, a second family.</span> <span id="s85">His father was married and had five children and th-the diphtheria epidemic hit them and all of them died, including his wife, and he was left single and still a young man and a minister.</span> <span id="s86">And he remarried and then he had the five other children and my father was the youngest of those five.</span> <span id="s87">A-Actually a favorite of my -- of my grandfather.</span> <span id="s88">But they -- he was a minister there and my father kept all the -- the [indecipherable] and all holidays and -- and -- and I -- I grew up that way cause we were Orthodox and un -- under those circumstances, we went to church.</span> <span id="s89">When he came here as a young man, he built the church that was the Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s90">They dug it with their own hands and shovels and so forth to put the foundations in and so on, it was just something.</span> <span id="s91">The church still stands, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: The name of the church?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: It’s Saint Mary’s in Youngstown.</span> <span id="s94">And then Holy Cross is what it’s called now cause they moved into a big section of town now, near the Butler’s Art Museum and the -- and the Youngstown colleges in a very, very special section in Wick Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Did you have any favorite traditions or holidays when you were a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, Easter is our biggest tradition and most favorite.</span> <span id="s97">Not only my parents, but I guess it’s because I was a youngster it always is, and it was always a -- one of our biggest holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Oh, I guess it was because of the -- the -- the birth of Christ and all and the story that goes along with it and -- and how it all happened and what it meant to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you ever witness any anti-Semitism in your childhood before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: There -- there was no such thing in no -- not in our neighborhood, no.</span> <span id="s102">This was a mixed neighborhood as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s103">None.</span> <span id="s104">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: What do you remember hearing about Hitler before the war started?</span> <span id="s106">Did you hear anything at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes, from my father particularly because he was in World War I and the stories that he told about that war were easily translated into what was going on there now.</span> <span id="s108">And he was quite happy that I had decided not to stay there because that’s when Hitler was rising in his power and he said, this man is evil.</span> <span id="s109">And some of the things that he was perpetrating against his own -- own people there, even though he wasn’t a real German, were pretty atrocious.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: It sounds like your father was quite aware of what was happening in Germany, but we-were you also aware of things like, let’s say the Berlin Olympics, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s112">And Kristallnacht, yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s113">The reason for that is because my father was a very avid follower of what was going on and s -- and not only by paper but radio had just come in during this particular time and we had a good radio that we kept up with what was going on, and as a result it rubbed off on me because when we talked about it and -- even at church or anyplace else, and the men spoke, the children were there and we listened and we heard an-and participated actually, in -- in many of the discussions that were had.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Do you remember any of the things that were said in church about Hitler and what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh yes, that -- that he was an evil man that had deposed the -- most of the hierarchy that was there in Germany and was taking control at that particular time, and that he had started blo -- marking the Jews and putting a-armbands on them.</span> <span id="s116">And he was taking the books that were written by them at that time and everybody was saying that this was an evil action.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Do you remember your friends from your multi-ethnic neighborhood ever talking about events in Europe before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes, I had one that was pretty close.</span> <span id="s119">He was Polish.</span> <span id="s120">He had his family and his sister, so -- were older than I was -- or he wasn’t, but th-thi -- he had older sisters, and they taught us how to dance, and -- and they were the -- the hoi polloi of the area, actually, for that matter.</span> <span id="s121">The girls were, they were just beautiful.</span> <span id="s122">And they were very, very strongly against anything th -- and they were strong Catholics.</span> <span id="s123">There they were, strong Catholics with an Orthodox boy in their midst, and that was me, and -- but we loved each other an-and got along quite well.</span> <span id="s124">And they -- they also were aware of what was going on, very, very, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Did you ever see any newsreels or anything before the war that showed what was happening over there?</span> <span id="s126">A: Yes, I remember the eye and ears of the world that we used to see at -- as -- as a youngster.</span> <span id="s127">In between features at the movies there would always be some news thing and we would see what was happening and see the crowds and the way that people were responding and all the Germans were responding to Hitler.</span> <span id="s128">They were -- it seemed now that I look back over it, as if they were mesmerized by this man and that he was a hypnotist that had them under control, because it was all seeming so put on, but it wasn’t just put on.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Do you have any other memories that stand out in your mind from the time before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I guess there -- there -- there would be good times and bad times.</span> <span id="s131">I remember that during the depression my -- I wanted to get a typewriter and just to get a typewriter was an expensive thing at that time, it was maybe 50 or 75 dollars, well my goodness.</span> <span id="s132">And my father said, well, we will get you the typewriter, but you got to teach yourself how to type.</span> <span id="s133">And I says okay.</span> <span id="s134">So he bought a typewriter for me and I got the books with it and taught myself how to type.</span> <span id="s135">And then went to take it in school, in high school and the teacher said, after I sat down there, she said, you already know how.</span> <span id="s136">I’ll give you credit for the class.</span> <span id="s137">In the meantime, go do something else.</span> <span id="s138">So I was -- that was something that really stood me in good stead.</span> <span id="s139">I recall that specifically because of -- of how it came about.</span> <span id="s140">And most of the things that I -- that I wanted as a youngster, being an only child, I got on the basis that I could earn them and -- and use them.</span> <span id="s141">They were not something that was not utilitarian, they were always something that could add to my benefit, or our benefit, or our total benefit, or everybody’s benefit.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Do you have any recollections of when Hitler moved into Austria or Czechoslovakia?</span> <span id="s143">Do you have [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Mm-hm, the Sudetenland, yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s145">My father was just upset, I mean upset.</span> <span id="s146">I remember him personally being upset, saying how could this -- how could this happen, and what is Chamberlain doing over there in England, mollifying these people, you know, and -- and saying that this is not right.</span> <span id="s147">And the people that we, in our neighborhood were concerned.</span> <span id="s148">And th-they were worried about our being -- go-going to war.</span> <span id="s149">My father didn’t want me to go in the service either, and he says, you know, I already did, I spent all my time in the service.</span> <span id="s150">Why should you have to go, again?</span> <span id="s151">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Do you remember any of your Jewish friends saying anything about all these events at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s154">The Jewish friends that I had, in fact one of -- one of mine was very close, taught me how to play chess.</span> <span id="s155">He was a very intelligent youngster, he was a couple of years older than I, lived up the street.</span> <span id="s156">And he said -- I was playing checkers with one of the other neighbors, and he said, did you ever play chess?</span> <span id="s157">And I s -- never even paid any attention to it, I knew what it was, but we didn’t have it in school back in those days.</span> <span id="s158">And he says, well I’ll bring my chessboard down and I’ll teach you how, but you’re never going to beat me.</span> <span id="s159">And I says, oh, come on.</span> <span id="s160">Four or five years went by and I finally did beat him.</span> <span id="s161">But then that was about the last time I’d seen him of -- really, because I left when I was 17, I went to college and I was in college when I went into the service.</span> <span id="s162">So I never really came back to Youngstown, Ohio after that.</span> <span id="s163">All my memories are from 17 down instead of up.</span> <span id="s164">Just going back to visit my folks is about the only thing that --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What did this fr -- you didn’t tell me the name of this friend who taught you chess, but wha-what did he say about what was happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh, they -- they -- they said that this -- this was awful.</span> <span id="s167">Why are they picking on the Jewish people and why are wa -- bu-but it wasn’t only that, my father was pointing out to them that they -- th-that they were incarcerating people in camps and things like that that weren’t Jewish, they were just politically against what he was for, and that -- and that was what they were saying.</span> <span id="s168">And -- and so many of them, of course, had relatives that were there, and they had relatives in Romania, but most of the ones that we knew were of Romanian ancestry, and so that the ones that were Romanian would eat Romanian food and the ethnic mixture, and they spoke Romanian.</span> <span id="s169">They didn’t -- the ones that I knew did not speak the Jewish -- the Hebraic language at all, they spoke Romanian.</span> <span id="s170">And many of them, when somebody would say, well what are you, said I’m a Romanian.</span> <span id="s171">Well, so I’m a Romanian Jew, what difference does it make?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How did you learn that Hitler had invaded Poland and the war started?</span> <span id="s173">Do you remember the moment that you first heard about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yes, it was in a newspaper, headlines in a newspaper.</span> <span id="s175">Was Hitler invades Poland, and if I remember the Sudetenland, that -- going into Czechoslovakia, the same way again, newspaper.</span> <span id="s176">And of course the radio subsequently, but it was newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: You mentioned Chamberlain, let me ask you, what was the reaction in this country when Hitler made his deal with Stalin?</span> <span id="s178">A: At that time they thought that Stalin was a great guy, because they felt that maybe Russia would be our stalwart person and that would be against Hitler and -- and the German Reich, except that they had signed the pact themselves at that time.</span> <span id="s179">And my father had said, was very wary, he said it-it’s not worth the paper it’s written on.</span> <span id="s180">And he said, it’s just not going to be of any consequence.</span> <span id="s181">And that’s as far as I think I could go on that at this particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What was happening in your life in 1939 and 1940, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I was in high school.</span> <span id="s184">1939, four years of high school to 1943 is when I graduated.</span> <span id="s185">Now, I graduated in January of ’43 because of the -- the war, they accelerated certain [indecipherable] so we had two graduations, one in January and one in June.</span> <span id="s186">I graduated in January and I think two weeks after graduation I was down [indecipherable] off the bus in Athens, Ohio going to Ohio University.</span> <span id="s187">I had picked that as the place to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s189">Let’s stay in high school for just a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Do you remember discussions about the war and what was happening in Europe and also in Japan while you were in school?</span> <span id="s192">Did you have any discussions in the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s194">I was a debater to begin with and we had considerable discussion of the political situation at that particular time, a-aside from the ra -- who shall own the railroads, or other topics that we used in debating.</span> <span id="s195">But there were other groups, like the Greek groups that were -- to put that in context, like the Greek groups that are in college, these were small little splinters like the National Honor Society and other groups like that.</span> <span id="s196">YMCA and the [indecipherable] and so forth, and that were very much concerned as to what was going on because we were approaching the age of which we would probably be serving in -- in the army or navy or otherwise if we went to war.</span> <span id="s197">And some of my -- my confreres, including myself, were leery about the fact that we would be going to war.</span> <span id="s198">And we were young, but I suppose that we got that from our parents, mostly and I don’t think that was an individualistic thing that -- I don’t think that I was that -- that intelligent to be able to fear that at the time.</span> <span id="s199">Youngsters at -- in those ages are -- you can’t beat them.</span> <span id="s200">They’re -- they can’t -- nothing is ever going to happen to them.</span> <span id="s201">It always happens to somebody else.</span> <span id="s202">So as a result, we didn’t fear much other than the fact that we might have to be going to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: One last question -- I hope it’s a last question about your high school and -- and everything else.</span> <span id="s204">You mentioned that your community was very multi-ethnic.</span> <span id="s205">Was there a -- a group of students who were, you know, more -- no -- traditionally American in the sense that their parents were born in this country, perhaps even their grandparents.</span> <span id="s206">And my question is, did they see things differently than you, in your community?</span> <span id="s207">Your friends who were, you know, first generation Americans in some cases.</span> <span id="s208">Did the people whose ancestry -- no, th-the people who were more American in terms of generations, did they see things differently than you and your friends did?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s210">I think they were all pretty -- pretty much -- that’s why I mentioned the [indecipherable] and the YMCA groups and things like th-there -- they were comprised of the very same ethnic groups that I came from so that we all went to school together and we all learned things together and we were all exposed to the same thing.</span> <span id="s211">Perhaps differently intellectually as to the levels, but nevertheless, it was pretty much the same.</span> <span id="s212">We’ve had a 50 year reunion a number of years ago, and many of them showed up and -- that had survived and we lost -- lost some of them in the war, but it was interesting to see that -- the changes that had occurred in these individuals only physically, but mentally they’re still in the same area they were in then, at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So you’re saying that --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: In other words, they didn’t really move out of their milieu as far a-as that was concerned.</span> <span id="s215">Many of them improved upon what they were, but many of them did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: In retrospect, would you say that you and your friends were pretty politically savvy for your age, considering the situation --</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I think my friends, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Pearl Harbor, how did you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: December seventh.</span> <span id="s220">Actually I heard about it by my father telling me that when I came home from school that we had been attacked by the Japanese [indecipherable] in the newspapers and the radio and the else -- everybody was talking about it, you know, but that’s the only way I heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Well, my -- ab-absolute horror, because it was unexpected, as far as we knew at that time.</span> <span id="s223">And the horror of the matter was that there was no retaliation.</span> <span id="s224">I mean, we -- we were sitting ducks, and they just came and -- just tried to destroy us.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: How old were you on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: In 1941, ’25, I was 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Did you wish that you could enlist right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: [laughs].</span> <span id="s229">Oh, not quite at that time, I -- I was too inculcated by my father to sa -- want to go to war right away.</span> <span id="s230">It was only after I got into college that that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: In 1941, in -- before Pearl Harbor and immediately right after Pearl Harbor, did you have any idea what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No.</span> <span id="s233">We just knew that Hitler was being very strongly opposed to their function and he was selecting them out, as I mentioned earlier.</span> <span id="s234">And that’s about all that we knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Had you been carefully following the -- the war news?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What languages did you learn in school, if any?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh, I took Latin all the way through, as much as you can possibly get it, cause it was easy for me, being of Romanian ancestry, and that wasn’t a real -- and I -- I -- I took Greek and Romanian, of course, is what I spoke at home, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: You said that you were a student until 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s242">I’m going to pause to change tape and we’ll pick up in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: -- Bucur.</span> <span id="s246">This is tape number one, side B. And we were now up to June 1943.</span> <span id="s247">I’d like you to tell me how your life changed, and walk me through the changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, as I mentioned to you earlier, in January I graduated in ’43, cause it was early graduation and I went to college.</span> <span id="s249">I had applied to a number of colleges and we felt that going within the state would be a ma -- more [indecipherable] you save a little more, but th -- and state tuition would be less.</span> <span id="s250">However, I didn’t have to have tuition, I was val-valedictorian of my class and as a result I had a scholarship.</span> <span id="s251">So I had a scholarship for actually four years, but wa -- during the first year at Ohio University, a number of us decided that may-maybe we ought to go in the service and -- instead of just sitting around and waiting, that as it so happened, I-I was called up for the draft anyway, so it didn’t make any -- much difference.</span> <span id="s252">The thing that’s sur-surprising is -- is that when I was called, we had volunteered, and I was called to go to a railroad station and -- and from there to go to Columbus, Ohio where there [indecipherable] four days, and where they were gonna decide what to do with us.</span> <span id="s253">The thing that really troubled us a lot was the fact that when d -- I was -- went to the station, my father and mother came with me and we went to the same station that my father went to in the first World War and I si -- was leaning against a poster and he just broke down and cried.</span> <span id="s254">He says, I was right there, right there, I saw myself, he said, just going.</span> <span id="s255">And I was an only son, I wasn’t supposed to go in the service, an only son.</span> <span id="s256">Also had a perforated eardrum, which kept just about everybody out, but it didn’t make any difference, they needed to fill their quotas back in the old days, and I wouldn’t have told -- told them anyhow, so I want -- wanted to go in the service.</span> <span id="s257">And the -- the thing that I remember so clearly was saying goodbye at the -- at that time, and -- and hope -- hoping that I would be back again at some time later.</span> <span id="s258">And fortunately I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Can you give me some historical context?</span> <span id="s260">What was happening in the war at the time that you went into the service?</span> <span id="s261">It -- you know, give me some background in Europe and -- and also the war of Japan.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, a-at that time England was having a tough time because they were being bombarded and the -- Germany had just developed the -- the -- the V1 rocket and they were shooting these rockets over and I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s263">I was a physics major in high school and I was quite interested in the -- that type of development.</span> <span id="s264">So I followed that pretty closely from that standpoint and then they developed a V2 rocket as well later, while I was still in the service.</span> <span id="s265">But the -- the context of the war at that time was that, you know, we -- we have to get into that European war because the ja -- the Japanese have already attacked us and we’re already at war, and that we have to go ahead and then do something just as my father did before.</span> <span id="s266">And I think that was the attitude that many of us had.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: How far had Hitler expanded in Europe when you went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Oh, he had taken the Sudetenland and Poland and -- and there was -- at that -- well, he was in France and that Paris had fallen and -- and was in control of most of -- most of -- actually, most of Europe because he o-obviously, yo-you know, he was -- he had taken Sweden -- I mean, not Sweden, Denmark.</span> <span id="s269">That was a Scandinavian country and yes, that’s about it and yeah, he was in control of just about everything and he was now starting his Russian front.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Now you’re in the service.</span> <span id="s271">Tell me about the -- the training.</span> <span id="s272">Where were you assigned, and -- and walk me through the t --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, we went to -- we were taken to Fort Hayes in Columbus, Ohio and we left th -- th -- in -- in the evening, and naturally nobody is going to be sleeping and all night we were up singing and playing cards and just about everything else.</span> <span id="s274">And we got there and they fed us breakfast and then they put us in a room and examined us.</span> <span id="s275">Th -- I mean, you had a -- an examination of -- of written tests, that were -- one part of it was written and another part was oral and then they had a test for sound, code, Morse code, the dot dashes and so forth, whether you’re capable.</span> <span id="s276">And we were all examined and all that and then you were sent to the places that they thought that you would do well in.</span> <span id="s277">I had a pretty high score, they sent me to Fort Sill, Oklahoma to school.</span> <span id="s278">And the school there was an observation sound and flash school, and we had it quite nice as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s279">And some of my confreres that went with me went to the cavalry and some of them went to the tank outfit and to the -- the mule teams and -- and also, depending upon what their capabilities were, or what they felt their capabilities were and whether they were intelligent enough to handle it.</span> <span id="s280">And actually while I was at Fort Sill and th -- learned that that school there, I actually got a minor in engineering because it was in engineering that we had to learn how to use a -- a -- surveying equipment, Theodolites and -- and the various other methods of -- of marking out areas o-of importance against the enemy, that is.</span> <span id="s281">I’ll describe that a little later, if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: So you went through this training program, and then what happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Oh, the one -- then we were da -- moved overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: When you were sent overseas, what was your rank and what was your assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I was a private.</span> <span id="s286">We were all privates, nobody had any rank in our school, of any kind.</span> <span id="s287">And we went -- well, actually we were -- in part we were one of the largest convoys that every crossed the -- th-the Atlantic Ocean, it was thousands of ships.</span> <span id="s288">Our ship and our equipment that was given us, was as if we were going to be going to Africa because the African theater was still in full force at that time, and we had some equipment that was all -- and we -- we -- we knew that’s where we were going.</span> <span id="s289">We ended up in Reykjavik, Iceland.</span> <span id="s290">And from there we watched the skyline and then dropped down into England from there.</span> <span id="s291">And in England we got new equipment and new things at a new camp.</span> <span id="s292">Actually, we went -- we were stationed at Cardiff in Wales.</span> <span id="s293">And from Cardiff in Wales, then we were sent to the unit that would need you.</span> <span id="s294">And our unit was sent to an area called [indecipherable] in -- in Devonshire.</span> <span id="s295">And it was a -- we commandeered a big castle that was there and had nice quarters and -- and so -- and trained and trained our people there on the wartime basis instead of the Fort Sill basis, where I had the initial training.</span> <span id="s296">War is a little different than the books tell you all the time.</span> <span id="s297">So we trained there and then from there we moved on a number of occasions, as if we were going to go on invasion, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s298">And then they moved the whole unit to Bournemouth, which is a resort on the channel, a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s299">And about every other day we would go out as if we were going to invade and we didn’t, and months went by and -- until June sixth, and June sixth the invasion occurred and we were still on the ship.</span> <span id="s300">And we only landed D plus two, but we started out on the -- the fifth and went out and -- and went in and pulled back, went in and pulled back.</span> <span id="s301">We were artillery people, actually, and the work that we did, there was no place to work, as yet.</span> <span id="s302">So as a result, until they had taken land, there was nothing much that we could do.</span> <span id="s303">So they held us back a-as much as they could.</span> <span id="s304">Plus the fact that the bombardments of the Germans was pushing our ships back.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Tell me about those two days between --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: This was Omaha Beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s308">But the two days you said you -- you didn’t get there til D plus two.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: What was the experience of those two days?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: It was -- actually, it was rather jocular.</span> <span id="s312">Everybody wanted to get in there and get in there and fight, and go -- and -- and get this thing over with.</span> <span id="s313">And after the f -- the first few hours in that you didn’t land, and waited to go in, you knew that you were going to be going in soon enough, it was, as I said jocular, right, everybody was pretty happy about going in.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening to the people who were on the beach at -- you know, the first ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, we saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: You could see it?</span> <span id="s317">A: Yes, we could see it.</span> <span id="s318">We could see from -- from our ship just exactly what was happening, and th-th-the jocularity I’m talking about only was an in -- an internal feeling of wanting to get out there and do something.</span> <span id="s319">We were not happy about what was happening to our people because they were -- it was pretty bad because the tide came in and they -- they had dug in and the tide, some of them drowned in there, in the tide.</span> <span id="s320">And they were -- th-the -- Omaha Beach, if-if you’ve seen some of the newspaper articles and so forth, show there’s -- there’s are -- there’s a large cliff that comes down there, that we had to scale that particular cliff before we could go ahead and occupy any territory.</span> <span id="s321">And they were having a tough time because there were pillboxes all along the line and they were pretty well en -- they were pretty well entrenched.</span> <span id="s322">But as you know we -- we did do it.</span> <span id="s323">And D plus two, we went in.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Where were the members of your unit from?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Most of the members of my unit were all from the east of the Mississippi River.</span> <span id="s326">But we were all pretty much, you know, cause we were picked out by our grades from the exams that we did as to whether you were going to go to -- and there was a -- there was a time there that they wanted to put us in the ASTP, which was army specialized training program, in which th -- you know, if you got into that program you didn’t have to go to war, which of course was a foolish thing because that -- that wasn’t so.</span> <span id="s327">What Roosevelt had done was he created this large army specialized training program and took the flower of the youth [indecipherable] the kids that were intelligent and knew everything that was going on, and under those circumstances he suddenly says, well I’m going to close that up and then send them overseas.</span> <span id="s328">Then he sent the best and the flower out there because they’re the ones that could -- could make decisions quickly and rapidly, rather than having a -- other groups do-doing it.</span> <span id="s329">But we didn’t ga -- we didn’t get into the ASTP.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Were there any Jews serving with you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Yes, one of my group -- closest friends in the various unit that I was with, the 17th Field Artillery Observation Battalion was Theodore Singer.</span> <span id="s332">And he was also a chess player and I told him that he would never beat me.</span> <span id="s333">And we played and we pretty much evened out all the time when -- he’s a very, very brilliant man.</span> <span id="s334">He has since died.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Who was your commanding officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Brown, Captain Brown.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Did you witness any anti-Semitism at any time in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Did you witness any anti-foreign sentiment any time in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Did you have a chance to read “Stars and Stripes” in those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Oh yes, absolutely, very -- we enjoyed that very much, with Bill Maudlin and his cartoons.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: I’m going to ask you about “Stars and Stripes” again later --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: -- I just wanted to make sure.</span> <span id="s346">Tell me what action you saw.</span> <span id="s347">Now we’re at -- at D-Day plus two.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Well, we, actually we got stymied at Saint-Lo.</span> <span id="s349">We had gone inland that far and the action that we saw was getting our units in t -- into function.</span> <span id="s350">Now, an observation battalion is a flash and sound unit.</span> <span id="s351">And by flash meaning that there are outposts that are put out into no man’s land and you can have two of those outposts, generally and they look at the enemy territory and they see the flash of a gun, and they have an [indecipherable] to take they can adjust on their instrument where that flash occurred and then they triangulate on the flash and they send it back to a central point behind, and then that’s pinpointed and those coordinates then are s-sent to our artillery and our artillery fires on them.</span> <span id="s352">That’s flash.</span> <span id="s353">Now, the s -- the sound unit is a little more complicated is because they -- we sunk microphones down a -- a distance of about a foot and a half or two, in a semi-circular fashion in no man’s land so that the sound that traveled from the gun that fired there in the enemy territory would hit microphone number one, before it hit number two or three, and in succession you would draw a line to the microphone that was hit and then pinpoint where it came from, within about a foot and a half, actually.</span> <span id="s354">So we’d call those coordinates and of course the artillery loved us.</span> <span id="s355">They said, they’re -- they’re our boys because they’re the ones that tell us where to fire.</span> <span id="s356">We can’t see a thing, yet -- un-un-until we have a coordinate that’s set on.</span> <span id="s357">And th-those microphone, sound travels 1100 feet per second.</span> <span id="s358">As a result, as that hit the microphone, it triangulated in on that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s359">We’d call it back and they would fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: How long were you at Saint-Lo?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Oh, we were at Saint-Lo quite awhile.</span> <span id="s362">We lost our captain, Captain Brown went out reconnoitering, he wanted to see whether one of the towns over there was taken or not, and there was a little pocket of Germans that th -- supposedly it was taken, but wasn’t.</span> <span id="s363">But we were stymied at Saint-Lo for a long period of time, and nevertheless, as he traveled with his driver the Germans came up and they shot him.</span> <span id="s364">The driver escaped and was captured, and we -- we captured him back later on, but nevertheless, we lost the captain.</span> <span id="s365">That didn’t -- we were battery B of the 17th observation battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Then what ha -- you were there for awhile, and then when you finally were able to move, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh, one -- once we were able to move, we moved rather rapidly.</span> <span id="s368">In fact, sometimes they moved so rapidly we didn't have a chance to set up and the -- our artillery would argue with them, hey, wait a minute, once you set up, what are we going to fire at, you know, until we get somebody out there.</span> <span id="s369">And we were the only unit in -- in -- in the V-corps, th-that area, so as a result it was a little difficult for them to really have a target, otherwise they’d have to just time fire everything.</span> <span id="s370">Nevertheless, the thing about it was that our -- our -- our feeling was that they were moving too rapidly.</span> <span id="s371">But we moved ver -- very, very rapidly and once we got up to the Argentan Falaise area, that -- that -- that was the -- that -- they called that the Argentan Falaise gap in which we encircled about six or seven companies of Germans completely.</span> <span id="s372">And un-under those -- while there, we were a -- stopped because we had -- had circled them and the continued to fight down to the last.</span> <span id="s373">So we -- we went back into functioning again.</span> <span id="s374">And right about this -- this particular time we had heard that there was a -- another sound and flash observation battalion being sent from Fort Sill, th-the 285th.</span> <span id="s375">And that’s the one that had the massacre occur at Malmedy in Belgium.</span> <span id="s376">And that’s at the time of the big push that the Germans -- the -- the -- pushing us into the ocean is what they were trying to do.</span> <span id="s377">The Battle of the Bulge, as they’ve called it.</span> <span id="s378">And we had conferred with the eight -- 285th when it came there that they can’t function the way they did at Fort Sill, that this is war, and that -- that it’s a different thing.</span> <span id="s379">But they were young, with young officers and young -- young companies and they just went the wrong way.</span> <span id="s380">Actually, what really happened was that the leader, one of their lieutenants was going down the road, and there was -- the road signs were made out of wood in those days and they pointed the direction of where they -- you were going and -- and he said, now this is the route we’re supposed to take, instead of looking at his map and being sure.</span> <span id="s381">Well, the Germans had turned the -- turned the sign around, and they went directly into the Germans.</span> <span id="s382">And they got caught by the SS troops and about a hundred and some -- 20 of them or so, were massacred right on the spot.</span> <span id="s383">And several of them did survive that we finally got to, but it was a pretty bad situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: You mentioned the term time fire.</span> <span id="s385">I don’t know what that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s387">Oh, time fire is when artillery fires a shell and the shell will hover, essentially, over an area and -- and discharge.</span> <span id="s388">In other words, it doesn’t hit into the ground, it hits up above the ground and it’s timed so that it’ll go off before it hits the ground and that’s why they call it time fire.</span> <span id="s389">It’s rather frightening because it covers a greater area of destruction than -- than the one that hits the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Did you take any prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s392">We -- well, we caught th-the numbers of them in -- in small pockets, maybe five and 10 at a time.</span> <span id="s393">But the -- we were quite good with our prisoners because most of the ones that we took were old -- old -- old German army.</span> <span id="s394">They were not the young SS troops.</span> <span id="s395">If it were the young SS troops, they would not survive, they would have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Because they were the ones, they were the killers, and we all knew.</span> <span id="s398">And we -- I -- we could identify them.</span> <span id="s399">They had tattoos on them and usually what happened was somebody would come along and say that we just got so many prisoners, but we couldn’t afford to have men take them back and -- and take care of them, because we needed tha -- our own help and our own men with -- our units functions coordinately that you couldn’t spare the men.</span> <span id="s400">And if they were SS men they would go back with them and -- and if they tried to -- to break away to -- to escape, they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What did you know at the time about the difference between the general Wehrmacht and the SS as you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well the -- the old army, they -- they understood a lot better about what it was to be a soldier.</span> <span id="s403">They were not the killer that we foresaw in the young people that we met there.</span> <span id="s404">The SS troops were just unbelievable, just as bad as Hitler was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: This judgment that you have of them, was this from firsthand experience or had you been told about the difference in the s --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No, fir -- it was firsthand as well as told.</span> <span id="s407">I mean, it was the -- it was handed down from soldier to soldier and from ev -- and we really di -- we spared the -- the old German army, the Wehrmacht, the old army, the Germans, th-they knew they were captured, they were a prisoner and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Did you have much contact with the civilians as you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Not very much cause we were always pretty active, but we did meet some -- some here and there, particularly when we were moving through some area that had been cleaned out completely a l -- a lot earlier, like when we went to Paris, for instance, and we -- we were in Paris and we were -- actually we were -- stayed at Le Bourget Airdrome, th-the old name, and we had leave to go out into Paris, if you wanted to, but you -- you had to go in -- in pairs or threes or fours because there were German snipers in -- living in houses and living with the French that were killing off our soldiers when they were gone.</span> <span id="s410">So you couldn’t -- couldn’t go unless you went in in twos or threes or more.</span> <span id="s411">And so as a result you didn’t get to see much of Paris because nobody wanted to go out into something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Can you give me an idea of the route that you took from D-Day plus two to Saint-Lo and then take me through some of the progression that --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Well, Paris is a -- the -- we started in Paris.</span> <span id="s416">Then we had the Argentan Falaise gap.</span> <span id="s417">We had th-the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s418">And then we -- that was at Malmedy.</span> <span id="s419">And then from there we went up and -- and crossed the Rhine and of course I remember crossing the Rhine very well because we captured the -- the Piper Heidsieck champagne factory and put guards on it so that other units couldn’t come and -- and get the wine and the spirits.</span> <span id="s420">That -- that was -- that’s quite something.</span> <span id="s421">That was quite something to see.</span> <span id="s422">They left it intact, they did not destroy it, because they could have.</span> <span id="s423">Why they did, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s424">They even left the caretakers there with them.</span> <span id="s425">They had wines and -- and -- and cognacs and so forth that were aging in -- in these subterranean tunnels.</span> <span id="s426">Casks as big as a house, you know, th-the -- unfortunately sometimes our soldiers would go down there and -- and get a bottle and then forget to turn the tap off, you know, and the -- course the caretaker would blow his mind.</span> <span id="s427">He doesn’t mind if you’re going to drink the stuff, but for God’s sake don’t let it run on the ground.</span> <span id="s428">So that’s why we se -- we sent guards there and we’d have our trucks go back every week or so and -- and come back with a -- a couple of loads of -- of champagne and wines and so forth.</span> <span id="s429">And then it was distributed to everybody else.</span> <span id="s430">But up until that time [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s431">And then we crossed the Rhine at Rebagen and from there on we moved into Belgium and I remember being in Liege very well.</span> <span id="s432">And I remember that -- hiding in the sewers of Liege during the Battle of the -- of the Bulge, and so forth.</span> <span id="s433">And during Christmas of 1940 -- ’45.</span> <span id="s434">Couldn’t have been, ’44.</span> <span id="s435">Christmas of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: While you were in England and also when you crossed the channel, did you hear any of the Nazi propaganda?</span> <span id="s437">A: Yes, Axis Sally was very, very -- she was -- she was something.</span> <span id="s438">In fact [indecipherable] we liked to tune into her because we all knew what a doggone horrible person she actually was.</span> <span id="s439">She survived, I understand, the whole -- the whole bit, and anyway died as an old lady, from what I understand, in prison somewhere.</span> <span id="s440">But anyway, yes, there was quite a bit of German propaganda, and they used to drop leaflets on us, and even out in the field the -- they would drop, you know, your -- your girlfriend is now doing around with somebody else, you’d better go home.</span> <span id="s441">Things like that.</span> <span id="s442">The -- the why are you here because you’re not doing any good.</span> <span id="s443">You’re just killing people, you know.</span> <span id="s444">But there was th -- there was a lot of Nazi propaganda from that standpoint.</span> <span id="s445">Everything, of course, you know, from their side of the -- the pond.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Once you got into operations in Europe, how much did you know about what was happening to the Jews?</span> <span id="s447">Now, you’re already fighting.</span> <span id="s448">How much did you know at that time?</span> <span id="s449">A: Quite a bit.</span> <span id="s450">Actually, we got most of that from our “Stars and Stripes” if we were ever able to get one and see th -- we knew what was happening and -- and what they were doing and that’s how I knew about Kristallnacht and that -- when they -- they burned th-the -- they burned all the books and all that.</span> <span id="s451">That’s -- you know, all that was earlier but this is what all recapitulated and told to us a number of times, was in our -- our “Stars and Stripes”.</span> <span id="s452">And we of course heard it from our own commanders and everybody else that were there who were well informed on what was going on, pretty much.</span> <span id="s453">We did know that there were camps, and we were -- my unit actually was one of the first ones to go into Buchenwald, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Be-Before we go into Buchenwald, I want -- I wanted to know just how much you really knew and how much of it did you believe before you actually got firsthand experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Well, we knew that there were camps.</span> <span id="s456">We did not know what was happening inside the camps, because even the people around those camps, and I can tell you that now because I talked to many of them, claimed they did not know, but that’s not true.</span> <span id="s457">I think they all knew.</span> <span id="s458">I think all the Germans knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s459">They were bringing in -- oh, excuse me -- they were bringing in people into these camps at a certain number and the camps could only hold a certain amount, and they had to go ahead and get rid of that amounts that’s going to be displaced.</span> <span id="s460">So even if they weren’t close to dying, they would go ahead and kill them in order to make room for the new groups that are coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: I think I’m going to pause so we can change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with John Bucur.</span> <span id="s465">This is tape number two, side A. And you had been telling me that you had crossed the Rhine, and then tell me what happened after you crossed the Rhine.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well, we -- actually were going in -- into Germany itself at this particular point and we were approaching a -- Weimar and -- and that particular area.</span> <span id="s467">And the third army had come in to the fight for about several weeks or almost a month or so before, and they were pushing out farther even ahead of us.</span> <span id="s468">And we were moving quite rapidly, at a -- as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s469">And we were just taking the towns as they came, and as we came to Weimar, that’s where we came close to Buchenwald and Buchenwald was very close to the -- to this large city and we were told that when we were on bivouac there that there was a camp here, and that it -- it was a camp of -- of political as well as Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s470">And we said -- not we said, they said they would take us through the camp.</span> <span id="s471">And there was a select number of us that went through and I had a camera and took some of the pictures that we have here.</span> <span id="s472">And I -- I have to tell you this, that there was probably one of the worst things that I’ve seen in my whole lifetime.</span> <span id="s473">And I became a surgeon after all this, and I’ve seen some pretty awful things in the operating room, and everything tha -- injuries from cars and [indecipherable] but it was nothing like this.</span> <span id="s474">This -- this was a -- a horrible situation that should never have been allowed to occur.</span> <span id="s475">And as I’ve mentioned earlier, I -- the people claimed that they didn’t know what was going on, but you could smell the camp from miles away, because they had crematoriums and they would incinerate some of the people that they had, once they died, and some of them that hadn’t even died yet, for that matter.</span> <span id="s476">I understand that they were functioning at full blast when the camp was captured, and that they were trying to clear their -- their rooms in the crematorium, and there were some of -- of them that were still alive, and they were just pushing them into the -- into the furnaces while they were still alive.</span> <span id="s477">So we knew a little bit about what was going on there.</span> <span id="s478">Then when we walked in to see it, to see that there was a -- a basement underneath the crematorium in which they had big hooks, like sky hooks on the wall, and they had bodies that were hung on these sky hooks and they would hang them there until they either died or what happened to them, and then put them on an elevator and send them up to the crematorium, and there dispose of them by burning them.</span> <span id="s479">And the stench, as I said, was -- why these people didn’t know something was happening there was beyond me.</span> <span id="s480">But they had quotas that they a-apparently had that said that they had to have at least 80 people die per day because they had to replace them with 80 new ones that were coming in.</span> <span id="s481">At least that’s the smallest number [indecipherable] there would be more than 80 that died during the day.</span> <span id="s482">How some of these people survived as long as they did, we could not understand.</span> <span id="s483">When we came in, there were some of them that were still walking around, but we were warned not to try to feed them or try to do anything.</span> <span id="s484">They were under medical con -- surveillance and so forth.</span> <span id="s485">But it was just atrocious and that’s wa -- that’s how I got these pictures that I -- that I ha -- that I took.</span> <span id="s486">Th-This was still there cause it was still fresh.</span> <span id="s487">This hadn’t been -- hadn’t been cleaned up or moved or anything, and that’s why they wanted us to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: What was the passage of time between when the camp was first entered by the American soldiers and you got to go in?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Oh, I think there was -- it must have been a week or so -- oh, perhaps -- it might have been two or three days, or a week.</span> <span id="s490">I really don’t know, because th-there was talk about it earlier and we -- and -- and one of the visits was scrubbed and I do -- I don’t know what the reason was, but then we eventually did go.</span> <span id="s491">So it had to be -- it had to be s-several days, but these bodies, they wouldn’t let them just sit there all the time, so it had to be pretty fast.</span> <span id="s492">It had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Why did they tell you not to feed the prisoners that were walking around?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Oh, because if they got food, their stomachs were contracted to an extent that food would kill them.</span> <span id="s495">And so the -- and -- and they, of course, didn’t know, and so th -- but the soldiers, who -- we were very good about that.</span> <span id="s496">Everybody wanted to help them, to give them something, candy bars, anything that we had, but that -- that wasn’t doing them any good.</span> <span id="s497">So that was the fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: I’d like you to -- to walk with me through the camp.</span> <span id="s499">For -- a-approach the camp with me as in your -- no -- as you remember approaching the camp, and take me through the entire experience.</span> <span id="s500">First, what did you see as you approached and what did you hear, and you know.</span> <span id="s501">You told me that there was a stench, but what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Oh, th-the stench, of course, was overpowering as you -- as you walked in, but there was a large gate as we walked into that, and there was a compound where there were posts that were stuck in the ground, and I understand that those were whipping posts, and a [indecipherable] somebody was chastised and whipped and -- and so forth on these posts and tied to them, and left there sometimes overnight and otherwise.</span> <span id="s503">And then there were a series of barracks that were -- were approximately 15 or 20 feet apart and they were maybe 150 - 200 feet long, and maybe 25 or 30 feet wide.</span> <span id="s504">And there was an aisle in the middle of each barrack and as -- as we entered on the first barrack that we entered, there were still people in th-their area, these were some that had survived, obviously.</span> <span id="s505">And they were in their niche, as they were -- as -- as they called them, this is my spot.</span> <span id="s506">Surprisingly enough, we also saw some that -- some women that were kept as prostitutes for the camp people.</span> <span id="s507">And they were, of course, favored by the Germans because they wanted them to still continue to function.</span> <span id="s508">But anybody in the camp that had anything to do with them was immediately ostracized amongst the people, from the way I understand from -- I talked to several of them for that matter, I talked to some of them that spoke Romanian and -- and they were Romanian Jews, and not political prisoners and they op -- from what they told me, you know, these people that were ostracized that way were shunned completely and actually, eventually they would die out.</span> <span id="s509">Th-The Germans would -- would have them killed or -- or something would happen to them, or something would happen to them amongst them, for that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: When you spoke to some of the prisoners, can you remember exactly what they said to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: They didn’t believe that they were re -- that they were free, that they could possibly be free.</span> <span id="s512">That this couldn’t possibly be happening to them.</span> <span id="s513">Their -- that freedom was the next step that they were going to see.</span> <span id="s514">They all anticipated dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And the women that you said that were the prostitutes at the camp, do you know what their ethnic background -- were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: N-No, they were just all -- I -- no, they were not only Jewish, no.</span> <span id="s517">They were all -- all ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s518">I’m sure there were Greeks and Italians and --</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What else did you see inside the camp besides the prisoners?</span> <span id="s520">Did you see anything of the way the guards that were --</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Well, we went to the crematorium and as -- I saw that, th-the ovens.</span> <span id="s522">There were six or -- six or seven ovens in there that I can remember.</span> <span id="s523">And they were just like what you see, you know, in -- on television today when you see the mortuaries, with -- with the slots that go in it, the fire underneath it and the -- and th-they were -- there were still bodies that -- they turned off the fire, but there were still some bodies that were still there, that we were able to see.</span> <span id="s524">So the -- and we saw d-downstairs where they -- the hooks were.</span> <span id="s525">They -- they said that they reserved this for -- for fliers, for -- for our air force people.</span> <span id="s526">Why that would be as -- I don’t understand, but interrogation or something like that, I don’t have any idea why they would want to interrogate once they got to this particular camp is beyond me.</span> <span id="s527">I should think that by the time they got there, they were pretty well interrogated.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Had their been any Americans liberated from that camp, to your knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Oh, there were some, but I didn’t see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Did you see any part of the camp where the Germans had lived, or the guards had worked or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s532">I’m glad you mentioned that because I almost forgot about it completely.</span> <span id="s533">The commandants wife had quarters there, and I believe they called her the bitch of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s534">And she had lamps in her -- ooh, that still runs up and down my spine now just to say, lamps made of the skin of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s535">Lampshades, that is.</span> <span id="s536">And she had lamps that had bones that was the supporting [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s537">And furniture and furnishings apparently that was woven and -- and -- out of skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What kinds of skins?</span> <span id="s539">What skins did she --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Skins of the -- of the actual camp inmates, the human skin.</span> <span id="s541">Yes, dermal, this type of skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: When she would select a skin, for whatever purpose, was there -- could you tell if there was any reason why she selected this particular skin?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I was given to understand that she was quite particular about what type of skin she was going to use, whether it was clear or whether it had blemishes on it, or what.</span> <span id="s544">But I don’t know anything else, other than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Did you see any skins with tattoos?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s547">Yes.</span> <span id="s548">They tattooed their own, too.</span> <span id="s549">The SS men were tattooed.</span> <span id="s550">They had a tattoo over their arm as you -- you know, that’s the way we identified them many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Besides her quarters or her office, whatever area of -- of her --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I saw her living room, that’s the only one tha-that we were escorted through.</span> <span id="s553">I didn’t see any other part of -- she had an office, I understand there, and everything.</span> <span id="s554">She -- she pretty much almost ran the camp, from what I understood, rather than her husband, if -- if she had a husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Is there anything else about the camp that comes to your mind right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Nothing other than the fact that it was a relief to leave it.</span> <span id="s557">And then -- and then upon leaving it, you got a feeling of -- of real loss, of -- you know, when we went in there, you go -- you went through Weimar and the -- the German people were there laughing and scratching and having fun and en-enjoying themselves.</span> <span id="s558">And then when we came back out again, they were still there, but it didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s559">And it felt to us that they were not sincere, that they had to know what was going on wi -- up until then there was a doubt, but we knew that they knew.</span> <span id="s560">There was no question about it.</span> <span id="s561">We didn’t feel there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: How long did you spend in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Oh, I s -- guess we were there a couple of hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: After your visit to the camp, did you have any conversations with any of the civilians in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: No.</span> <span id="s566">No, we went back to our units.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Where did you go next, after Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: I can’t recall actually what our next thi -- but -- but we ended up in Liege, and then through Liege into Germany itself, but we were close to what we call Cologne, and that was just about pretty close to where the war was gonna end.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Do you remember the date that you walked into Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: I also just wanted to ask you about the time of day that it was when you went into Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s572">Was it the morning or the afternoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: It was morning, mid-morning, sunshine-y day.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did you see any children in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yes, little ones?</span> <span id="s576">Yes, they were in there, their bodies were piled up there just like everybody else’s.</span> <span id="s577">And the only way we knew they were children was their -- their size.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: You said you spoke to a couple of the prisoners there in Romanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Did any of the prisoners, either the ones that spoke to you or the ones that you just observed, did any of them stand out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Were you aware of any acts of revenge or retaliation against the guards in this camp?</span> <span id="s583">Had you heard of anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And when you got there, had there been any burial of bodies yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: No.</span> <span id="s587">Na -- that’s why I got the pictures of -- they had none of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And do you know if any of the civilians were brought into the camp to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I’m sorry, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Were you aware if any of the civilians had been brought into the camp to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: No, I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Who went with you into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: There was about nine of us altogether and it was -- mostly we were the -- the part of the 17th Observation Battalion that was the headquarters [indecipherable] and we were the officers.</span> <span id="s595">The officers and ourselves.</span> <span id="s596">I was a sergeant and our master sergeant, myself and two lieutenants and a major were a-all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: How did the other people that were with you react?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Well, we all got back home and we still -- we had to have -- we all sat and talked about it and then some of them actually got drunk, but I was a teetotaler ab -- by about that time.</span> <span id="s599">And there was a -- it was pretty sad.</span> <span id="s600">They just -- they can see -- they felt that th-this was the reason we were fighting, that we were there to stop this and we all felt very strongly at this particular --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: When you got back to your comrades, did you tell them what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s603">And they believed us.</span> <span id="s604">Not everybody had the opportunity to see it, but they did, they -- they believed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And by the time you had visited the camp you had already read about --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: -- the things in -- in “Stars and Stripes”?</span> <span id="s608">Okay.</span> <span id="s609">In correspondence with your family and friends at home, did you tell them about what you had seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s611">I wrote and -- and I had saved them, many of them, but when we moved somehow they got lost.</span> <span id="s612">I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s613">My mother had saved all my letters and everything, and all my correspondence.</span> <span id="s614">She gave everything else away that I had, all my memorab -- she -- she gave it all to the Salvation Army.</span> <span id="s615">But no, I -- I -- I can’t say that there was any special thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Tell me a minute -- for a minute, about the photos that you have and -- and how you came to be in possession of these photos.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Well, these were photos that I took with my camera and at the time it was a small, little camera and there are photos of bodies that have been stacked outside the barracks itself, and you can see the emaciated legs and arms and so forth, of the people and several show the ashes after the crematorium, the burnt ashes and there was a -- as you can see, this was several days after because see, they have two little wreaths over here.</span> <span id="s618">Had to be -- but they left them there for us to see cause I guess nobody would believe them.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: In the picture you have here of the ashes, what else is in the picture besides ashes?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Well there’s a rake that shows the -- the -- they’re trying to keep them together in a pile.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And in this photo the ashes are dark, what are these white things?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: That’s bones.</span> <span id="s623">Residual bones.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So we --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: You can have these, if you like.</span> <span id="s626">A-And just promise to get them back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Is there anything else about your -- your visit to the camp that you wanted to add before we move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: I don’t believe so, I think that covers.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: What did you do during the next couple of days or weeks or whatever, before -- you know, after that, until the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Actually, they took our unit out because we were relieved by the 285th and we were sent to Czechoslovakia, and we ended up on a -- a beautiful resort in Kadyne, K-a-d-y-n-e.</span> <span id="s631">And this was supposed to be [indecipherable] of rest and relaxation, but i-in anticipation of the end of the war, and indeed we really had it very nice there.</span> <span id="s632">And the war did end, V-E day, it’s -- the European war only.</span> <span id="s633">And of course we, the unit we’ve been such old tried and true soldiers who’d been there so long, we didn’t have to worry about being sent to the South Pacific.</span> <span id="s634">But that 285th that I mentioned earlier, they were the youngsters and they were -- mobilized them and they were on their way immediately.</span> <span id="s635">And I wanted to -- I had enough points, because you got points for the number of months that you were there, to be discharged, and I said fine, I want to go home.</span> <span id="s636">And they said, well it’ll take quite a bit of time because there’s -- it’s going to take preference to get these troops moved into the South Pacific, so we need all that transportation.</span> <span id="s637">I said, well, I’ve missed so much school, I’d like to apply to go to school here.</span> <span id="s638">I had heard about an American school in Biarritz, France, and they says, okay.</span> <span id="s639">And I applied and within 24 hours I was on a train on the way to Biarritz.</span> <span id="s640">And as I was on the way to Biarritz, we were -- we had stopped in -- in Nancy, France, Nantaise as they call it and the newspapermen were howling and yowling that we dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese.</span> <span id="s641">That was Nagasaki, or -- or Hiroshima, which one of them was first.</span> <span id="s642">And that this was anticipation of the end of the war.</span> <span id="s643">And on -- on the next station that we stopped at, they said that probably the war would end.</span> <span id="s644">And then I understand we dropped another bomb subsequently and then the war did end.</span> <span id="s645">But in the meantime I went to Biarritz, and this is on the Bay of Biscay, on the Atlantic, it’s a big, beautiful resort that the Germans used for their officers.</span> <span id="s646">So we went into a city -- I w-went into a city that was pro-German.</span> <span id="s647">They didn’t want us in there at all, cause they had it nice.</span> <span id="s648">The German officers treated them well, and you know, gave them food and you know, they -- they -- they lived very well.</span> <span id="s649">So th-th -- it took us a long time, that is months to go ahead and -- and si -- and make inroads into the fact that we were the ones that freed them, and that freedom was a heck of a lot better than just being subservient to Germans.</span> <span id="s650">But I just continued my college courses there, and -- and I got full credit for them, and on the second or third -- second of December, 1945, my semester had ended and they said, y -- okay, you can go home now.</span> <span id="s651">And I got on a ship and in five days I was back here and on December 7th, 1945, I was discharged from the service.</span> <span id="s652">Pearl Harbor day.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: What courses did you take when you were studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Oh, I took Abnormal Psychology, which was very, very great, because the French had th -- all these abnormal people, they were allowed to have their own enclaves and everything.</span> <span id="s655">So I -- I had a -- a -- a field tha -- to work in easily.</span> <span id="s656">Homosexuality was a -- a n-not very well known at that time, at least in this country it wasn't, or if it was it was behind bars somewhere.</span> <span id="s657">But there they were -- they -- they lived an open life.</span> <span id="s658">And we studied i -- Abnormal Psych.</span> <span id="s659">I took, surprisingly, enough German.</span> <span id="s660">I needed a language, so I took German and I had English and one other subject, chemistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: During your time in the service, did you meet anybody famous or infamous?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: In the service itself, no, but I met him after the service.</span> <span id="s663">And I can’t think of his name, it’s the -- the German that defected here that worked on the atom bomb.</span> <span id="s664">He lived not too far away from us in -- I can’t think of his name and I know it just as well as I know my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Well, maybe it’ll come to you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Maybe so.</span> <span id="s667">He’s the one who worked on the atom bomb.</span> <span id="s668">Di-Did all -- di-did -- and had -- had worked on the V2 and V -- V1 initially there, and came here and -- oh gee.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Maybe it’ll come to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: We can get back to that.</span> <span id="s672">When you were discharged, what was your rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I was a sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: And did you have any military honors?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Well, I had five bronze stars and a Medal of Honor and all those others, and I was injured once, but a whole bunch of us were injured when one of those V2 hit -- hit our unit, but it didn’t -- we didn’t walk down to get our Purple Heart, so we didn’t -- there was no in -- no serious injury.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: When you came back, what did you tell people about your experiences overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Well, I think ma -- th-the -- the most outstanding thing that they wanted to know about was -- was the -- the camp.</span> <span id="s678">And then that, of course, was something that was ingrained.</span> <span id="s679">That’s why I remember as much as I’ve do -- have al -- although I’ve tried to put it out of my mind.</span> <span id="s680">It was -- they wanted to know if it was real or not.</span> <span id="s681">There -- th-there are some people that say tha-that it was all a put-up job.</span> <span id="s682">Tha-That is, of course is not -- not true.</span> <span id="s683">And this is only one camp.</span> <span id="s684">I mean, there were Polish camps and there were -- they were all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Was it difficult for you to return to civilian life at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Not at all, because I was home, as I said, December seventh and one week after that I was back at college, where the dean had said when I left that there will be a place for me no matter when I got back.</span> <span id="s687">And I called him, he was still there, and he says, come on back, John.</span> <span id="s688">And I went back and s -- went back into pre-med, you know, a pre-medical course and continued.</span> <span id="s689">Went through summer, trying to catch up to the years that I’d lost, and caught it all up and graduated 1940 -- ’48, actually when I went to medical school in 1947, because my grades were so good that they wil -- they were going to give me credit for a year of medical school towards graduation, so that I could b -- be in medical school for a year and graduate the following year.</span> <span id="s690">So I got my degrees the following year, I’d already had one year of medical school at the time.</span> <span id="s691">So it was kind of nice.</span> <span id="s692">Actually, I had almost caught up to myself.</span> <span id="s693">So then four years of medical school, graduated 1951 and was an intern at Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s694">I went to Pitt, and subsequent to that, while I was at Pitt and I had the -- been an intern and an extern as well.</span> <span id="s695">My grades were good and when you were a good student you could live outside, and I lived in the hospital.</span> <span id="s696">And the-they challenged me quite a bit as to what I was going to be and I was going to be a surgeon.</span> <span id="s697">And they said, well, wen -- we’re going to send you to school.</span> <span id="s698">So here comes school again and I says, fine.</span> <span id="s699">And they sent me to University of Pennsylvania, the graduate school of surgery.</span> <span id="s700">And I spent a year there doing nothing but surgery.</span> <span id="s701">And while there is when I met the great Bailey, the heart surgeon and -- and I was challenged there by being an assistant --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: I-I’m running out of tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Just one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with John Bucur.</span> <span id="s707">This is tape two, side B. And you had been telling me about your medical training and you were up to being in --</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: They sent me to the University of Pennsylvania and while there I spent a year doing nothing but graduate surgery, and surgeons from all over the world who were gathered there and I was the baby, by the way, I was the youngest one in the class.</span> <span id="s709">And while there is when Bailey did his first heart surgery, at Harmon Hospital there.</span> <span id="s710">And we as students there were allowed to go out and ob-observe all the types of surgeries that were done within the university’s per view, and at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Grof, G-r-o-f was the neurosurgeon there and he asked if I would help him on one of his craniotomies, operating on the head.</span> <span id="s711">I said, I’ll be glad to, because I had a lot of experience in surgery from where I had come from.</span> <span id="s712">And I did.</span> <span id="s713">And I was so taken by him while we were operating that he challenged me to the point whereby he said, I will get you a residency, if not right here, I know where y -- I want you to go.</span> <span id="s714">And I said, are you -- he said, you’d make a great neurosurgeon.</span> <span id="s715">I said, well I -- I just wanted to be a surgeon at that time and he se -- I says, but that means another five or six years.</span> <span id="s716">And up until that particular point, you know, I [indecipherable] I wondered whether that was a wise decision to make, but I’m -- I dil -- I was delighted with what we were doing, so I said yes.</span> <span id="s717">Anyway, then he was one of my champions as far as referral was concerned and I applied to several places that he had w-wanted me to go, and ended up under Jack French in Long Beach, California, the V.A. hospital, and spent five years there.</span> <span id="s718">And in that fifth year I was chief of neurosurgery at the hospital because Jack French got married, and he wa -- married the diva Dorothy Kirsten.</span> <span id="s719">In -- in her day -- she’s the one that was thrown out of Russia, by the way, because of her attitude.</span> <span id="s720">They said -- of her American attitude, that is.</span> <span id="s721">Persona non grata, they called her.</span> <span id="s722">This was back in Stalin’s days.</span> <span id="s723">Anyway, the thing about it was that he -- and he wanted to take a year off as a sabbatical and he says, you’re going to be chief.</span> <span id="s724">And I went from, I think it was 9,000 dollars a year to 30,000 dollars a year as chief.</span> <span id="s725">Wow, talk about living it up.</span> <span id="s726">I still remember that very well.</span> <span id="s727">I was married at that time and we had our first child there in -- in Long Beach.</span> <span id="s728">And things were pretty tough on 9,000 dollar a year and we lived just a -- where Disneyland was built.</span> <span id="s729">And the kids in my youngster’s age group were asked to come to try out Disneyland before they even opened it.</span> <span id="s730">And so he got to know pretty well what the rides were going to be and everything else.</span> <span id="s731">But we didn’t stay there, I wanted to come back east again.</span> <span id="s732">The California type of life was not my type of life.</span> <span id="s733">[indecipherable] as I always say, the -- there was always somebody running around with somebody else’s wife.</span> <span id="s734">And it was just different.</span> <span id="s735">A bar on every corner, school three sessions a day.</span> <span id="s736">Some of them were four hours apiece and they’d have the three sessions, three different groups.</span> <span id="s737">Th-They were crowded.</span> <span id="s738">So anyhow, I-I wanted to come back here, and I came.</span> <span id="s739">When I finished I came back here.</span> <span id="s740">And the reason I did come to this particular area is because before I went overseas I was stationed at Fort Mead.</span> <span id="s741">And when I had got leave while I was stationed at Fort Mead, I came into this area and came into Arlington, and I loved Arlington.</span> <span id="s742">Arlington was just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s743">Still is, but it’s -- it’s -- it was just gorgeous.</span> <span id="s744">I said, one of these days I’m going to live there.</span> <span id="s745">And that’s what I did, I came here.</span> <span id="s746">There was one other neurosurgeon here and we went into partnership together and everybody in the District of Columbia kept saying, what are you -- what are you going over there, that’s on the other side of the river.</span> <span id="s747">Nothing is every going to happen there.</span> <span id="s748">So the thing that happened is we built all these hospitals and I was the founder of Fairfax Hospital, the founder of Northern Virginia Doctor’s Hospital.</span> <span id="s749">The founder of National Orthopedic Hospital.</span> <span id="s750">So we built our own hospitals and we -- w -- and it -- it -- it was quite nice and had a nice practice, and I practice in what -- what I refer to as the golden age of medicine, where there was no Medicare or Medicaid and not everybody was entitled to everything under God’s creation.</span> <span id="s751">They got treated free in most of my practice.</span> <span id="s752">Back early on, 40 percent of it was gratis, it -- it was free patients, so -- but I made my first dollar when I was about 36 years old.</span> <span id="s753">And everybody says, boy, it takes a long time to be a neurosurgeon.</span> <span id="s754">It does.</span> <span id="s755">And I think it’s going to be even longer, they’re going to make it longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, actually I have three and I’m -- I’m in my second marriage, we’ve been married 22 years.</span> <span id="s758">And she had two, so we have five all together.</span> <span id="s759">And all -- all of them are out of school, graduated, they’re all in their 40’s.</span> <span id="s760">They’re attorneys, no doctors.</span> <span id="s761">Lot of attorneys.</span> <span id="s762">One’s a judge.</span> <span id="s763">So we’re -- we’re doing very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: What did you tell them about your experiences during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Oh my, as -- as they were growing up, they -- they know most of these stories, cause they would ask me, and I -- I -- I -- we would sit sometimes after dinner and just -- just talk about things in general, and th-th -- these subjects would come up.</span> <span id="s766">And they’d ask -- they ask particularly about the atrocities and the camps and so forth, knowing -- and they know, of course that I have th -- had these pictures and they all saw these, so they knew that this -- this was something that did really happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Do you ever speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: In what ways do you think that this experience has changed you in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: I can’t say maturity because once you got into the service you became mature no matter whether you wanted to or not.</span> <span id="s771">I wasn’t -- when I came back from the service -- I -- I went into the service as a young college boy that probably had a beanie on his head.</span> <span id="s772">I came back from the service as a mature man that never belonged to a -- a fraternity or anything like that, because that was a lot of bunk, as we felt coming back.</span> <span id="s773">So we set up our own organizations.</span> <span id="s774">But I think that my entire wartime experience gave me a sense of understanding of what man can do to man.</span> <span id="s775">What -- what had happened in Germany should never happen again, and I understand that it’s been happening in some of these other countries, in Africa and otherwise.</span> <span id="s776">And that just recently Idi Amin just died and he was one of these Hitlers.</span> <span id="s777">He was -- and he was responsible for millions of deaths as well, and he -- he doesn’t have the notoriety that Hitler had obviously, but I think he -- the -- the people [indecipherable] know that he’s done this.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Is there anything else that you’d like to add before we conclude?</span> <span id="s779">Is there anything that we haven’t discussed that you want to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, but it’s just been wonderful to have you ask me the questions, because it woke up memories that I’m going to be talking about for the next couple of weeks, I think, a-again.</span> <span id="s781">And I want the children to know and remember some of those things and I think that’s a good thing.</span> <span id="s782">And so I want to thank you for asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: I want to thank you for doing the interview with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Oh, my pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Bucur.</span> <span
