id="s10">01:01:09</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name is Fritz Schnaittacher.</span> <span id="s12">I was born in a small village near Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s13">The name of the village was Forth, F-O-R-T-H.</span> <span id="s14">It's a village that's about 23 kilometers from Nuremberg, about ten kilometers from Schnaittach, after which we are named, and it had a population of 1,100.</span> <span id="s15">At the time I was born it might have had ten or fifteen Jewish families.</span> <span id="s16">By the time I left, it had dwindled to eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: I need some dates here.</span> <span id="s18">What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in July of 1913 and left -- an interesting part of the development of young Jews at that particular time was that the village only provided elementary education.</span> <span id="s20">During the first three years of my life, I was in a one room school house which was staffed by a teacher who was Jewish who acted also as a cantor and an insurance agent on the side.</span> <span id="s21">Finally, the small community could no longer afford this teacher, and we were transferred at the third year of elementary school to the government school, which was largely a Protestant school, because the village also had a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s22">I lived in this village of Forth until it became necessary for the purpose of getting a better education to go to a so called Pensionat, a glorified boarding house in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s23">My mother, who then had been a war widow, had to give me up just like she gave up her elder son, my brother Mike, who also went to this Pensionat in order to go from there to a Realschule, or in my case, ultimately to a commercial high school.</span> <span id="s24">It is interesting to note that because of coming from a village elementary school, I had to undergo an entrance examination into the then what we considered preferable the Realschule, a high school providing education in languages, math, etc.</span> <span id="s25">But anti-semitism back in 1923 in that particular school had risen to the extent where the director of the boarding house saw fit to transfer me from there to the commercial high school.</span> <span id="s26">Life continued as a student and the practice was to go home on vacation and holidays and of course that was a double holiday to be spent with my mother and spinster aunts who housed the family.</span> <span id="s27">After graduation, at the age of 17, I went to work in a wholesale establishment for the sale of household goods and toys.</span> <span id="s28">This would have brought us up to the year 1930.</span> <span id="s29">In these intervening years, Nazism grew, but it did attain the imminent danger of the overthrow of the Weimar Republic.</span> <span id="s30">The years 1932 indeed seemed to from my memory and as a youngster, seemed to reflect a decrease in the significance of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s31">There was an election in Schleswig-Holstein which indicated for the first time a decrease in the electoral votes that the Nazis got.</span> <span id="s32">This presented the urgency to Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933.</span> <span id="s33">That changed the situation radically.</span> <span id="s34">Immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor, forms of oppression of terror began to ensue not as yet outwardly against the Jews, but most of all against social democrats and communists, anti- fascist forces.</span> <span id="s35">In order to give the appointment of Hitler's Chancellor the democratic appearance, the election of March 6, 1933 was called.</span> <span id="s36">The disunity on the left and the support of the Nazi movement by German nationalists brought about the so-called electoral victory confirming Hitler in the position of Chancellor.</span> <span id="s37">Thereafter, really, the efforts began to denude Germany of human rights, of civil rights, of democratic rights.</span> <span id="s38">Now, shall I swing over the time of the arrest?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">01:09:09</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Not yet.</span> <span id="s41">What I would like to ask you is prior to this period of time, did you have any trouble with people as a Jew?</span> <span id="s42">Did you come from a religious family?</span> <span id="s43">Did you mix well with your German neighbors?</span> <span id="s44">What was it like before Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: What was social life in a community such as the little village or for that matter social life in the city of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s46">Now, I can speak of it from only a very limited point of view.</span> <span id="s47">As far as the village was concerned, after we had left school we hardly -- we only would socialize and to a very limited scale with young people whom we knew to be anti-Nazis.</span> <span id="s48">The few -- I shouldn't say few, there were quite a few social democrats and those were the only people that we socialized with.</span> <span id="s49">Earlier on, during the years that I went to school in Forth, we would play soccer yet with everyone.</span> <span id="s50">That was until say 1930.</span> <span id="s51">From then on, the lines were beginning to be drawn much more severely.</span> <span id="s52">Now, the question could be raised why would it be called for that a young man who is working in Nuremberg and during the week lives in Nuremberg would go home over weekends.</span> <span id="s53">Well, obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships.</span> <span id="s54">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s55">My family was not a orthodox Jewish family.</span> <span id="s56">It practiced traditional Judaism.</span> <span id="s57">I at one time through my growing up period had developed a spirit of orthodoxy in deed until I became some sixteen, seventeen years old and I lost it.</span> <span id="s58">I became agnostic.</span> <span id="s59">Our social life in Nuremberg centered around a German Jewish Youth movement which believed in ideas of humanity and yet we were able to enjoy life, until truly the radical changes took place in the beginning of 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">01:13:17</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did you experience any abuse or attacks verbal or otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I in the place of business where I worked, I never experienced any acts of anti-semitism.</span> <span id="s63">The place of business was owned by two Jewish families.</span> <span id="s64">As a matter of fact, particularly one non-Jewish family I was very friendly with.</span> <span id="s65">I considered him to be a devout anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s66">On the street I wouldn't be recognized as a Jew.</span> <span id="s67">I'm not proud of that, so I did not experience any acts of anti-semitism only when I would become involved in street discussions and they were not infrequent.</span> <span id="s68">Then sides were being drawn occasionally with violence.</span> <span id="s69">Once, I do remember one little incident which happened in the moat of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s70">Nuremberg, the medieval city is surrounded by moat which was used in those days to play soccer in.</span> <span id="s71">The kids from the boarding house, some ten or 13 or us went to the moat in order to play soccer when all of a sudden a bunch of rowdies, Nazis, came storming upon us trying to beat us up and I'll never forget one single guy with a hammer and cycle on his cap, I must mention it, a hammer and cycle on his cap he beat them off.</span> <span id="s72">These things stand out in one'e memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: When you talk about all of the street discussions, what was the mood?</span> <span id="s74">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: The street discussions were between right and left.</span> <span id="s76">The street discussions were prior to the appointment of Hitler as a Chancellor.</span> <span id="s77">Thereafter there were no more street discussions.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">They were in anticipation of the elections.</span> <span id="s79">There were several elections in Germany during the year of 1932.</span> <span id="s80">I did, now that I research my mind, I did experience another rather painful experience in our village -- it used to be a vacation home for Jewish children, and I was befriended by one of the young social workers in charge of this home, and there were maybe 30, 40 children, and they had taken a walk to a neighboring village and I followed them when all of a sudden I was being attacked by a guy from my village who was known as a criminal who was on the loose.</span> <span id="s81">I didn't want to become entangled with him.</span> <span id="s82">Finally I had to ask for police protection and we got home.</span> <span id="s83">The police visited us.</span> <span id="s84">That was in the summer of 1932.</span> <span id="s85">In order to ask whether we wanted to press charges and we decided not to.</span> <span id="s86">It was a rather potentially dangerous act.</span> <span id="s87">There were other occasions when Nazis pelted our house with stones, but then in the year 1932 one wasn't hesitant to go after them, but that again that ceased after January 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">01:18:23</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Were you at all friendly with Christian neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: We had neighbors in a broad sense, yes.</span> <span id="s91">We had some friends in the village.</span> <span id="s92">Our family had lived in the village for many generations.</span> <span id="s93">I think you're going back possibly to the early part of the 18th centuries.</span> <span id="s94">Jews only received citizen names in the year 1729 and over the years because we were the family that tried to do well by the poor people, so we had many friends amongst them.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: While we're on this, can you tell us a little bit about your family.</span> <span id="s96">I know that you said your mother was widowed and you lived with her.</span> <span id="s97">What about the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Well, my father died as a result of World War I, in 1919.</span> <span id="s99">When he was only 47 years old.</span> <span id="s100">He had not suffered bodily injury, but the service had caused had aggravated his heart condition and he died of a heart attack in 1919 when I was 6 years old and my mother was 31.</span> <span id="s101">My father had two spinster sisters and two or three single brothers no four single brothers who all were living in the two houses that we owned visa vie from each other.</span> <span id="s102">He had also a married sister living a few houses away in the village and after my father had died if it is of some interest we were --- the family had been in the textile business.</span> <span id="s103">Part of the house was devoted to a store where we sold piece goods but the men of the house pursued the hop business.</span> <span id="s104">This was the hop- growing section and we went around, my father and my uncles went around to the farming villages to buy the hops, and we sulfurized them, baled them and took them to the largest hop market in the world which was Nuremberg by horse and freight car.</span> <span id="s105">There were no automobiles in the village.</span> <span id="s106">In deed, my mother got the first car I think in 1923 or 24.</span> <span id="s107">This describes somewhat the cultural life and existence of Jews in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">01:22:30</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I had one brother who passed away 23 years ago.</span> <span id="s111">Interesting is the fact that my mother, this very courageous woman, took over this textile business and during the years that she didn't have a car, drove out by horse and buggy to the farming village in order to sell from house to house the piece goods and invite the farmers from the village to the store in order to buy.</span> <span id="s112">She was an amazing vital and courageous woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Your brother was he an older brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: My brother was four years older than I am, but he died at a very young age.</span> <span id="s115">He had left for America four years prior than myself, not because of Nazi persecution at that time, but because an uncle of ours had come over in 1900 and had no children of his own, no family of his own, decided to have him join him to ultimately take over his business.</span> <span id="s116">It was this uncle who then four years later was helping me to come out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: One other question about this period you had mentioned a Youth movement that you were involved in.</span> <span id="s118">Was this political at all or Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: No, it was not Zionist.</span> <span id="s120">To be sure we were conscious Jews but rainbow colors of political opinions, largely however forward looking, progressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Is there anything else you want to tell me about your boyhood in either Forth or Nuremberg or the mood of the times?</span> <span id="s122">Anything else you can remember?</span> <span id="s123">It sounds like you had a fairly comfortable existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">01:25:35</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s126">My family lived in very comfortable circumstances.</span> <span id="s127">We weren't rich, but to be sure we were conscious of the very difficult conditions which existed in Germany economically where you could paper your walls with the money that was printed yesterday.</span> <span id="s128">The inflation didn't go unscathed by us and there was rationing of food and it is one of the few recollections that I have of being with my father after he had gotten back from the war and we were riding out in horse and buggy and opened freight car like in order to go to a neighboring village and buy from the farmer four geese.</span> <span id="s129">That was considered like black market.</span> <span id="s130">I know it, did my father know it?</span> <span id="s131">Probably.</span> <span id="s132">So, the farmer loaded the geese on the cart and covered them with straw, but it wasn't a half an hour later that we heard the shrill whistle of a policeman on a bicycle who could move faster than we did by bicycle, not motorcycle.</span> <span id="s133">As he drew abreast of us, he forced us to turn around and return the geese to the farmer.</span> <span id="s134">It was however, a week or two weeks later when the farmer drove up to our house and delivered the geese.</span> <span id="s135">Somehow he had escaped the attention of the authorities then, but yes, there was hunger in the country.</span> <span id="s136">There was the large scale unemployment which led to the radicalization of the political life.</span> <span id="s137">Were the farmers friendly with us?</span> <span id="s138">Yes, in the main they were very friendly with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: You said that in 1933, everything started changing very quickly; like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: The changes in 1933 that I indicated which came about were demonstrated immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30.</span> <span id="s141">The very following day there were demonstrations of stormtroopers along the street where I worked and the call went out close your windows or we shall shoot.</span> <span id="s142">On the same street there had been the editorial and printing offices of the social democratic newspaper which had been destroyed on this occasion.</span> <span id="s143">On top of that building on the fifth floor or fourth floor were the offices of people that the company that we had been doing business with.</span> <span id="s144">I forgot the name.</span> <span id="s145">They were wholesalers in textiles, and I took it upon myself to ask the stormtroopers who had been guarding the Social Democratic newspaper in order to visit the offices of this particular company which was owned by Jewish people, and I was greeted with a deep feeling of dismay and despair because their goods were stolen.</span> <span id="s146">Their goods were thrown out of the window to stormtroopers who were waiting downstairs.</span> <span id="s147">That was the beginning, only the very beginning of it and you could during the time of the announcement of elections to be held on March 6, 1933, during these short five weeks election rallies of the opposition were prohibited.</span> <span id="s148">So, it really began rapidly to spread fear and hopelessness in the circles of the anti-Nazi movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">01:32:00</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: What were you afraid of?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I was afraid of physical persecution, of being beaten up and the beatings that they rendered were severe.</span> <span id="s152">After the --if you were accused of anti-Nazi activities you were likely to be sent to prison and after all that didn't take long.</span> <span id="s153">On March the 26th, twenty days after the election, when I came home on my weekly weekend visit to my mother, I was settled down and we would have a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s154">My mother had a bad cold, but we were happy to see each other.</span> <span id="s155">That happiness lasted but a few minutes, and there was a hard knock on the door of our living room and there was the gendarme, who said, "Herr Schnaittacher, come with me to the police station."</span> <span id="s156">I asked why to no avail; no answer.</span> <span id="s157">I had no alternative but to follow him.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">That was in what would have been the purpose of saying no I'm not going with you not without an arrest warrant.</span> <span id="s159">This is authority.</span> <span id="s160">I followed him to the police station, and as we arrived at the police station he said, "Herr Schnaittacher, you're under arrest."</span> <span id="s161">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s162">No answer.</span> <span id="s163">I said can I go home to say goodbye to my mother.</span> <span id="s164">He said no.</span> <span id="s165">I said can I call my mother?</span> <span id="s166">He said here use the telephone.</span> <span id="s167">It was probably one of the most difficult and painful telephone calls I've had to make in my life.</span> <span id="s168">"Mother, I'm under arrest."</span> <span id="s169">You could have heard her shriek to the police station.</span> <span id="s170">We lived quite a distance from it.</span> <span id="s171">She came storming out, protesting, but all to no avail.</span> <span id="s172">An hour later, after the policeman asked me whether I carried weapons on me, and I had a little knife and he said you better give it to me so it couldn't be used as evidence.</span> <span id="s173">After an hour I was transported by train.</span> <span id="s174">The village didn't have a regular prison, and I was transported to the county seat of Erlangen, a university city and a county seat, and I was delivered to the prison.</span> <span id="s175">The warden received me, assigned me to a cell and dusk began to settle and the cell door opened and I was put in to a cell that consisted of a wooden board that we slept on, a bucket, and you can imagine what it was for, and three pitchers of water and water basins for drinking and washing.</span> <span id="s176">It was inhabited by two other men, one a communist, one a socialists.</span> <span id="s177">All of them were at least double my age.</span> <span id="s178">I wasn't twenty, yet.</span> <span id="s179">And, so here I was.</span> <span id="s180">It wasn't a incarceration that could be in the terms that we subsequently learned inhuman, it was deadening.</span> <span id="s181">There was very simple sometimes inedible food.</span> <span id="s182">The living conditions were very primitive.</span> <span id="s183">We then were assigned mattresses and a blanket.</span> <span id="s184">It wasn't without humor and I might relate these two little stories.</span> <span id="s185">The first morning and I didn't need sleeping pills then, which I do now, the first morning my cellmates very humanly gave me the easiest job and that was to fill the water buckets.</span> <span id="s186">There was one faucet with running water in the long hallway that opened up to the cells.</span> <span id="s187">And as a I stood there filling the pitchers with water and I turned around and who was sitting in the adjoining cell but my second cousin from the village.</span> <span id="s188">So what they had done was they had the humanity of only arresting the two young male Jews instead of all the others.</span> <span id="s189">The other little story is headed under humor.</span> <span id="s190">A few days after we had been brought in we saw on our daily walk in the courtyard of the prison which was important because we had no exercise otherwise, there was a young kid, even younger than I was who told us the story that he had been picked up in a certain village as a vagrant, for vagrancy, and one day as he came down he clapped his hands out of pure joy.</span> <span id="s191">Why?</span> <span id="s192">Because he saw the mayor of the village who had arrested him now also in prison.</span> <span id="s193">This is in Germany Schadenfreude, what is best English translation, "spiteful joy."</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did they ever tell you why you were arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Okay, the charges for my arrested and I insisted and finally they were given to me.</span> <span id="s196">I was accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government, knowledge of secret ammunition dumps, and liaison man of secret anti-Nazi organizations.</span> <span id="s197">I remotely could have been accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government well it was perfectly legal.</span> <span id="s198">Thereafter I desisted of any political activity.</span> <span id="s199">I had been an anti-fascist throughout.</span> <span id="s200">My conscience dictated it to me.</span> <span id="s201">From the moment that I had been arrested, my mother did not rest for a moment, until she succeeded in setting us free.</span> <span id="s202">That came about through her contact with the Sturmbahnführer and the higher officer of the S.A. who three weeks after we had been in prison came to the prison to look me over and after he saw me in my stocking feet, pants and shirt, he said you don't look too dangerous to me.</span> <span id="s203">A week later, the head of the prison, the prison warden, gave us my cousin and myself the joyful news that we were to be released the following day.</span> <span id="s204">And who was there to release us but my mother.</span> <span id="s205">She really had given me two lives.</span> <span id="s206">When the news spread by wall Morse code, we had figured out a way of communicating that we were to be released and the answer came back from the two sides of the adjoining south well good for you.</span> <span id="s207">Leave all the uneaten food behind you.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">So, I was released from prison.</span> <span id="s209">However, with the understanding that I was to report to police station every other day.</span> <span id="s210">And as I returned to the place of work where I had been working it had become apparent that rumors had been spreading which only furthered endangered my continued peaceful existence in Nuremberg in the area where I had been living and working then.</span> <span id="s211">So, then in consultation with my mother and an uncle of mine who lived in Munich and had his place of business in Munich, we decided that I was to move to Munich.</span> <span id="s212">So, I remember the date, May 1, May 1, 1933 I moved to Munich and started to work in my uncle's business which was a business selling wholesale glassware and chinaware.</span> <span id="s213">I reported in this capacity to his brokerist, brokerist means general manager.</span> <span id="s214">He had the power of signature.</span> <span id="s215">His name was Hermannn, and I would like you to remember that name, Hermannn, and I worked there in the offices before I started to travel, but I had filed an application to be able to travel and for that purpose I needed to be relieved of having to report to police stations every other day.</span> <span id="s216">So, I was in the office and I received a call from my aunt who was in her apartment in Munich and she said there is somebody here who wants to see you.</span> <span id="s217">As I came to the apartment, there was a man who stuttered unfortunately.</span> <span id="s218">He was a criminal inspector.</span> <span id="s219">A criminalist.</span> <span id="s220">Until, with the stuttering, he brought out the fact that I had filed an application to be released of parole and he was here to grant it to me.</span> <span id="s221">I died a thousand deaths, because I saw now the concentration camp of Dachau looming for me.</span> <span id="s222">So thereafter I travelled for my uncle.</span> <span id="s223">I never returned to the village I was born because it became apparent that it would be very unsafe.</span> <span id="s224">Indeed, after he visited with my mother she was called by the village council and was told Mrs. Schnaittacher if you had been here yesterday, we would have arrested you.</span> <span id="s225">That was the summer of 1933.</span> <span id="s226">My mother courageous as she was said well, if you want to let out your ire on a poor war widow then do so.</span> <span id="s227">Arrest me now because tomorrow I shall be leaving to visit and stay with my mother who lived then near Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s228">I continued to live and work with my uncle until the late fall of 1933 and then probably in the month of September or so I filed for an application for a visitors visa to come to the United States under the subterfuge to sell German products.</span> <span id="s229">So, this visitor's visa and the exit visa from Germany was granted and I came to America in the late fall of 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">01:49:18</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: I just want to ask you a couple of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: My living and working in Munich was very interesting because Munich was a beautiful city.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">I had wonderful family contact but also working within my uncle's company gave me the opportunity to meet not only Jews but non-Jews.</span> <span id="s234">I went mountain climbing with one particular man who was an extremely commraderie and friendly and if anything he saved my life when I was about to slip and he helped me back.</span> <span id="s235">He was by no means singular.</span> <span id="s236">Later on, I started to travel and I made no secret of the fact that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">I was not greeted by hostility and indeed I came back with a feeling or came to America later on with a feeling that the laden anti-semitism in Germany was not as significant as I experienced in my first few weeks of the United States of America.</span> <span id="s238">Now, that sounds like an illusion and a terrible accusation, but I experienced here in my early days more direct Jew calling than I did in Germany.</span> <span id="s239">I do remember several indecents along a railroad station where young men made remarks which were veiled anti-Nazi remarks.</span> <span id="s240">Of course it didn't last.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">01:52:16</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: When you were in Munich, was it starting to get more difficult for Jews even though you had some friends who were not?</span> <span id="s243">Was there a change that affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: In the 30s and you probably could extend it to the late 30s almost until the Kristallnacht, even though I can't authoritatively speak for it because I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s245">I left Germany in the fall of '33, but there was the hope on the part of Jewish business people that it was a transient affair, that it was a passing affair and business was good.</span> <span id="s246">On the other hand, I witnessed, and I will never forget it, young kids being trained in the throwing of hand grenades.</span> <span id="s247">These were the future soldiers that invaded Europe, the world.</span> <span id="s248">And yet, my uncles were very intelligent, very capable businessman.</span> <span id="s249">He took, and I'm going ahead of myself, he took the Kristallnacht and the incarceration in Dachau to convince him in spite of my letters to come to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: In 1933, there weren't yet any restrictions that impacted your movement of your activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Until I left in the fall of 1933, the only restriction as far as my movements were concerned was not to go back to the village.</span> <span id="s252">The village was a virulent sort of active anti--semitism and my mother and her sisters-in-law and another uncle of mine and his wife and daughters left for Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s253">The few other Jews remained in the village to be picked up after the Kristallnacht never to return.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">01:55:16</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You've mentioned Dachau.</span> <span id="s256">What did you know about it at this point in time.</span> <span id="s257">It was new?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: I failed to mention that when I was released on about April 18 or 19th, 1933, there may have been a general amnesty because of Hitler's birthday, but primarily I was released because of the endeavors of my mother.</span> <span id="s259">Had I remained in prison for some time longer, I would most likely had been transferred to the concentration camp of Dachau which was open just around that time, and whereas it was not an extermination camp at that time, but it was a camp of terror and torture and this is where the term was first being formed in German of the "auf der Flucht erschossen": Shot while trying to escape.</span> <span id="s260">This only got worse with every month and my mother's chauffeur who was an unusually decent guy and a friend of the family was taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s261">When he got out, after two months, he said, don't ever go provoke or do anything that would get you back.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Other people you know being sent there were you hearing about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s264">Wherever two friends whom I didn't know personally but I knew the brother or sister.</span> <span id="s265">One, by the name of Goldmann, and the other one, by the name of Minardio, were shot and killed during the month of March.</span> <span id="s266">It was not unusual to find an item in the newspaper shot while attempting to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s268">02:01:03</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Let's pick up with your travels to the United States.</span> <span id="s270">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: In the late fall of 1933, my application for visits to the United States and selling German merchandise in the United was approved of and I was accompanied by my mother and the uncle for whom I had worked.</span> <span id="s273">We traveled to Bremen in order to take the Europa, one of the two great German steamers to the United States.</span> <span id="s274">I arrived in New York passing the Statue of Liberty never to be forgotten and received by my brother an an uncle and an aunt who had lived here before.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Had you made that journey alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I made the journey by myself.</span> <span id="s277">Did I know any other people aboard ship?</span> <span id="s278">No.</span> <span id="s279">But I smiled at a pretty American girl and we took a nice picture but I was so young and innocent and there were two German Jewish girls aboard ship also from Nuremberg whom I got to know and the trip as such was a joyous affair for me because I was out of Germany and looking forward to a new vital and enormously exciting experience.</span> <span id="s280">To be sure I was very mindful of the important members of my family, most of all my mother whom I left behind.</span> <span id="s281">But we had an understanding that my mother would be visiting me the next year and now being in America and having the helpful support on the part of my uncle, I started to work in his factory, knitting fabric for the manufacture of sanitary napkins.</span> <span id="s282">My uncle was a bachelor who specialized in the manufacture of sanitary napkins and modern mother nursing brassieres.</span> <span id="s283">What could be more logical.</span> <span id="s284">And early on I became a salesman for him and I learned to speak English.</span> <span id="s285">Then another one of my father's brothers came to America to help set up a distillery for the manufacture of cordials, liqueurs, in Norwalk, Connecticut and I at the ripe old age of 22 became the first member of the Alcoholic Beverage Salesman's Union, an AFL union, and became the missionary man for this particular company.</span> <span id="s286">Then because it's important -- I'm sorry, I have to bring in another moment.</span> <span id="s287">I had come on a visitor's visa and it was obvious that it was of importance and most desirous to change the status, my status from a visitor to an aspiring citizen.</span> <span id="s288">At that time, you could not apply for permanent citizen status while living in the United States.</span> <span id="s289">You had to go abroad.</span> <span id="s290">The system which had developed at that time was either to go to Cuba or to Canada.</span> <span id="s291">I went to Canada, to Toronto.</span> <span id="s292">In Toronto I went to the American consulate and applied for a visa and it was necessary then to come in under the so called quota.</span> <span id="s293">They had to cable to the embassy, to the American Embassy in Berlin in order to receive a quota number and then within approximately 48 or 78 hours, the number arrived and then I emigrated into the United States as now a potential citizen.</span> <span id="s294">This was finally confirmed with receiving the citizenship papers in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">[Break in Tape] 02:07:26</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Was it difficult when you first came over here?</span> <span id="s297">You had family I know that made it a lot easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: How was the life of a young immigrant or refugee?</span> <span id="s299">Because there was so many of us, not necessarily as far as total number is concerned to proportion to the number of German Jews who wanted to get our of Germany and had difficulties getting affidavits, getting support, but it wasn't that long that an organization had been founded which concentrated then the influx of German Jewish refugees and provided an enormous emotional support system ultimately to be followed up even with support as far as employment facilities, advice, etc. was concerned.</span> <span id="s300">The organization which originally was called the German Jewish club, and then was named New World Club publishes the only German Jewish newspaper and it is still being published under the name of the Aufbau, which is a good paper, an interesting paper.</span> <span id="s301">We met socially.</span> <span id="s302">We had lectures.</span> <span id="s303">We went on hikes.</span> <span id="s304">It assisted the integration into the American life enormously primarily emotionally and really in every respect you weren't alone.</span> <span id="s305">You weren't an isolated being.</span> <span id="s306">One important point to me which I do wish to mention is then the visit of my mother in 1935.</span> <span id="s307">Now, she had been taking care of her mother who then was in her late 70s.</span> <span id="s308">She enjoyed her visit to America enormously.</span> <span id="s309">Began to dabble in English a little bit and she would have loved to stay but her conscience and sense of duty obviously overruled her own desires and she went back in order to take care of her own mother.</span> <span id="s310">This until the other critical, most critical date in the period of after January 30, the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor most critical date is the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s311">Here I would like to mention a few incidences, which I didn't experience personally but which most were authentically reported to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">02:11:12</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: By your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: By my mother and by my uncles.</span> <span id="s315">My mother's experience.</span> <span id="s316">She lived in a village, in a little town near Frankfurt which then had not been as virulently anti-semitic as my village near Nuremberg, yet during the Kristallnacht, stormtroopers came, smashed their windows invaded their home and she suffered a severe nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s317">My uncles--one living in Munich, the one I had been working for, and the other uncle who lived in Mannheim--they were visited by the Gestapo and taken to the concentration camp of Dachau where they were released.</span> <span id="s318">They suffered enormous physical damage due to closing in the severe winter, severe circulatory problems.</span> <span id="s319">They were able to survive it and come to America the year of 1940.</span> <span id="s320">I'd like you to remember again the story of my uncle in Munich whose name was Hermann.</span> <span id="s321">The man I had reported to, who, on the morning after the Kristallnacht, stood in front of my uncle's place of business and as my uncle approached he said, "Jews are not allowed here."</span> <span id="s322">My uncle turned around and went home and within hours was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s323">These stories, these events were told to me after my uncles and my mother came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: How much were you aware living in New York or in Connecticut what was going on in the 1930s in Germany?</span> <span id="s325">What information did you get either through newspapers or through letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I was considered myself politically aware.</span> <span id="s327">I was very much aware of the Spanish Civil War, of the war that Germany had played.</span> <span id="s328">The role that Italy, not fascist Italy, had played and the point that I had been trying to make that until 1938 there was still evidently hope on the part of the Jews in Germany that the storm could blow over.</span> <span id="s329">I did not think so.</span> <span id="s330">In ever so many letters I wrote to my uncles and aunts and finally succeeded first with my mother that there is no alternative but to get out.</span> <span id="s331">My living in America I lived during the years of the deep depression supported however always if need be by my uncle but I didn't need it for myself the income ranging from $13 to $35 to $40 a week was most adequate.</span> <span id="s332">We lived together with two or three other immigrants, refugees in relative luxury on Western Avenue in 96th Street or 96th Street and Riverside Drive between the four or five of us the joined income was probably $80 or $90 in a furnished apartment.</span> <span id="s333">We did largely our own cooking or ate in cafeterias and weekends we spent hiking was the social life in the organization of Refugees.</span> <span id="s334">It was a good life.</span> <span id="s335">Ultimately on the request of my uncle, I changed my position from the liquor salesman to become a member of another company which he controlled which was a company by the name of Acme Cotton Products Company manufacturing surgical dressings and I first worked in the factory and then as a salesman and ultimately I became President of the company in the post war period.</span> <span id="s336">That is where I met my wife.</span> <span id="s337">My colleague and next door occupier of a desk, Ariel Sankon, had a beautiful daughter whom I first saw at the age when she was about 14 and I was of the ripe old -- no she must have been 15 and I was over 22 and I saw her.</span> <span id="s338">It took some years later at a Christmas party when she attended she was a student at the University of Michigan and was home for vacation and after taking another girl home I said to my wife, today I met the girl I'm going to marry.</span> <span id="s339">The war clouds became darker, and Germany invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland, and the onslaught continued, but fortunately by then we had gotten the rest of my family either to this country or to England and finally from England to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">02:20:24</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: You were now a U.S. citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes, I am now a U.S. citizen, 1939.</span> <span id="s343">I watched the grim developments in Europe with the faint hope that a United front could ultimately be shaped with the Russians in order to ward off the total occupation of Europe and to bring fascism to its knees.</span> <span id="s344">Should I talk about now my involvement in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: How did you get into the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s346">Did you enlist, were you drafted, did you have thoughts of going back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: America got into the war on Pearl Harbor day and from then on it was merely a matter of time until I would be drafted.</span> <span id="s348">I was working then in a position of some significance as far as wartime supplies were concerned but that certainly did not outweigh the importance of military service.</span> <span id="s349">I was drafted shortly after we had gotten married in February of 1942 and I was drafted and sent to Ft. Dix and from there to basic training at Cancroft, South Carolina and by the way, with the exception of the camp at Fort Dix, Dottie followed me from camp to camp until we finally had to say our goodbyes when we were shipped abroad.</span> <span id="s350">From basic training I was sent to a radar training center in Steward, Florida.</span> <span id="s351">From Steward, Florida, I applied for OCS and went through OCS in Virginia.</span> <span id="s352">At that particular time there was a surplus of officers and so I was sent to cooks and bakers school because the Army travels on its stomach and from there back to Virginia and from Virginia to an ordinance training center on the racetrack in Santadena, California, and from there to depot in Oakland, California.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Then near Washington D.C. there was an intelligence school for topography.</span> <span id="s354">From there I was sent as a base sensor to Camp Miles Standish and finally to the intelligence training center at Camp Richey, Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">02:25:55</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Was that something you volunteered for?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s358">That's where I was trained in various disciplines of military intelligence from the interrogation of the prisoners of war to further interpretation and various other forms of the type of intelligence information gathered for tacticle purposes at the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Was it assumed that because you were German that this was a good fit for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: I would be inclined to think that that is the very reason that we were selected.</span> <span id="s361">Having been Jewish we were presumed to be beyond any doubt anti-Nazi and a large percentage, I don't know as far as total numbers are concerned, but I'm inclined to believe that a large percentage of I.P.W.graduates from the school of Richey were of German Jewish background.</span> <span id="s362">Then they seemed to need me in a hurry.</span> <span id="s363">I graduated from Camp Richey and the second front second to the Omaha Beach landing was being prepared for the landing in Southern France on August the 15, 1944.</span> <span id="s364">So, we were flown across.</span> <span id="s365">We landed first an unplanned landing on the Azores because we were hit by a lightening bolt, and after that was prepared, we flew on to Morocco, to Casa Blanca.</span> <span id="s366">The following day or two days later we were flown to Naples.</span> <span id="s367">In Naples where the European headquarters were for M.I.S. we were now being reassigned to the divisions that were preparing for the landing into Southern France.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">02:28:47 1Interrogation of Prisoners of War.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Before you continue, I want to get a couple facts straight.</span> <span id="s370">Can you tell me what division and regiment and your rank and all that sort of military --?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Well, as far as my rank was concerned, when you become a commissioned officer it's called great.</span> <span id="s372">I was a Second Lieutenant at the time that I joined the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th National Guard Division of Oklahoma.</span> <span id="s373">The 45th Division was the Oklahoma National Guard Division, one of the most battle tested outfits in the war.</span> <span id="s374">It had a 400 percent, if that is claim to fame 400 percent casualty turnover.</span> <span id="s375">It was one of three divisions that was used in the attack.</span> <span id="s376">The 36th and the 3rd and the 45th.</span> <span id="s377">A division consisted at that time of roughly 20,000 men consisting of three regiments each regiment had three battalion and each battalion had four companies.</span> <span id="s378">Whether that is different now, I do not know.</span> <span id="s379">Our specific purposes, and I say our, the I.P.W. specific purpose was to receive prisoners as early as possible out of the chaos of battle in order to get the truth of whatever information they were able to give and it was up to us to discern and as we began to accumulate information from the many, many prisoners that we were able to learn truth from fiction because we knew a lot of the information that they had had and could balance it off and very few because of the tactics we had learned would refuse to provide us with the information we were seeking.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: How did you do that?</span> <span id="s381">What kind of tactics?</span> <span id="s382">02:31:55</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Rule number one--and you're testing my memory--rule number one was never to ask a question that you could answer with yes or no.</span> <span id="s384">Revealing information that we have had and formulating a question accordingly.</span> <span id="s385">Speaking to them in the dialect that they were accustomed to because we had sensitive ears and we knew the dialects all over Germany and if we were able to speak we were able to locate them and thereby develop a relationship that created a degree of confidence and willingness to give.</span> <span id="s386">The morale of the German Army began to be sure once we entered German proper, began to deteriorate rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: One other question and then I want you tell me where you went.</span> <span id="s388">Did you go over there with any trepidation or great eagerness to take this assignment on.</span> <span id="s389">Do you remember what you were feeling at the time when you were just not another American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I to the best of my recollection I went with a degree of eagerness because it was one way that I truly could contribute to the effort of destroying Hitler.</span> <span id="s391">To be sure I needed to learn.</span> <span id="s392">I never forget a first attempt, my first attempt to interrogate prisoners and then to report the results of my interrogation to the general in charge of our regiment, who had been accustomed to the battle wise master sergeant, who had furnished him information through many campaigns, from Africa or Sicily up to , and here he now turns to the brand new chickenshit second lieutenant, he says well Lieutenant what did you learn?</span> <span id="s393">I told him fanciful stories that there of enormous strategic importance and with dismay he turned away from me and says my buddy's name master sergeant was Fritz, he says, "Fritz, what do you know?"</span> <span id="s394">But it changed rapidly and with due modesty I became an expert.</span> <span id="s395">Yet, the most successful interrogation that I had was when I couldn't ask questions.</span> <span id="s396">On March 15, 1945, we had a company of ours had broken through the Siegfried Line into one of the deep enormously strong fortifications.</span> <span id="s397">My regimental intelligence officer came to me and said, "Lieutenant, this is beyond the call of duty, but if you care to, and Fritz we would like you to go up and the company has occupied the bunker and they hear voices on the telephone system but they can't make them out."</span> <span id="s398">So, we did and it was a very active night.</span> <span id="s399">There was a lot of firing going on, but we made it.</span> <span id="s400">The moment I picked up the received and then relayed the information to my buddy, one sergeant from a German outfit who identified himself and his outfit reported to an officer of another outfit identifying the outfit indicating the route of withdrawal, the next day's ammunition dump, the location of the ammunition dump, the refueling dump, any question that I could have possibly asked that was of material tactical information was revealed and the following day we were able, not only because of our information but other information that came in to slice totally through the Siegfried Line and advance by some 30 miles.</span> <span id="s401">That was a proud day.</span> <span id="s402">From then on, we moved very rapidly and we moved along a line that could hardly have been designed any better had I volunteered or had I been asked because of my personal knowledge of areas.</span> <span id="s403">The first such town that we occupied that we conquered, was Aschaffenburg, where an aunt of mine had left prior to the war and had married my favorite uncle, and I was to their wedding in 1924.</span> <span id="s404">Indeed, my buddy and I took on our jeep -- no let me clarify something.</span> <span id="s405">Under the command my buddy and I under the command of Colonel O'Brien we accepted as interpreters the surrender of Aschaffenburg.</span> <span id="s406">We then took the commander of Aschaffenburg, who the day before had strung up several officers who had wanted to surrender.</span> <span id="s407">We put them on the front of our Jeep and he drove with us into areas that had not been occupied yet by our troops, and then we were stopped.</span> <span id="s408">He said, put your arms down and they had one American prisoner to whom he gave a gun, and we disarmed.</span> <span id="s409">They disarmed voluntarily.</span> <span id="s410">A platoon of at least 30 or 40 men and this one American soldier, G.I. with a German rifle marched this unit back to the American P.W. cage.</span> <span id="s411">We moved quickly and other points of interest were only days later when I had a group of six prisoners in front of me.</span> <span id="s412">One of them stepped out and said, "Lieutenant, didn't we go to school together?"</span> <span id="s413">I picked up his helmet and I said "By God, Leslach, we did."</span> <span id="s414">I have a picture still here in America a class picture of 1929 or 1928 with a picture of Leslach.</span> <span id="s415">He had been a decent guy and he said, "Couldn't you let me go home?</span> <span id="s416">I love my wife so much."</span> <span id="s417">I said, "I love mine too, but I can't let you go home."</span> <span id="s418">The next day, we took Bamberg.</span> <span id="s419">Bamberg a beautiful medieval town with a magnificent cathedral had suffered little damage and in the church yard we had some 800 prisoners.</span> <span id="s420">It would have been a vain effort to interrogate anybody specifically because militarily speaking we had more information than they did.</span> <span id="s421">It was a pure coincidence that one out of these 800 stepped up to me and said, "Couldn't you let me go home?"</span> <span id="s422">I come from a village not far from here.</span> <span id="s423">And I said, "My, where are you from?"</span> <span id="s424">and he said, "Forth, F-O-R-T-H."</span> <span id="s425">This is the village where I was born, where I knew every house and house number and every street.</span> <span id="s426">And it seemed to me that I had known every person.</span> <span id="s427">So, I said to him, "But you weren't born in Forth?"</span> <span id="s428">He said, "No, I wasn't."</span> <span id="s429">I said "How come that you lived in Forth."</span> <span id="s430">"Because I married a girl from Forth."</span> <span id="s431">"Whom did you marry?"</span> <span id="s432">"Gunta Haas."</span> <span id="s433">Gunta Haas was a year or two years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s434">I had known her.</span> <span id="s435">I said, "Gunta Haas, she lived in House number 35."</span> <span id="s436">We lived in House number 52.</span> <span id="s437">He said yes, house number 35 is two houses removed from the Protestant ministers house from the Protestant church, two houses from the little fire house and his pupils grew wider and wider and he said "If American Intelligence has all this information, how can we win the war?"</span> <span id="s438">So, now you know how we won the war.</span> <span id="s439">A few days later, and I'll never forget that date, Roosevelt died.</span> <span id="s440">We were outside of Bamberg and on our way to Schnaittach.</span> <span id="s441">The town after which my family is named.</span> <span id="s442">Schnaittach had no more Jews of course.</span> <span id="s443">It was the seat of the only Jewish cemetery in a large area of central Franconia.</span> <span id="s444">It's oldest Jewish cemetery went back, so I'm told went back to the 14th century.</span> <span id="s445">My father and uncles and grandfathers, etc, grandmothers, are buried there in the new cemetery.</span> <span id="s446">While we were still receiving German artillery directed towards us, the occupiers of Schnaittach I visited my father's grave and I never forget as I was standing there in deep deep thought and sorrow, somebody came up to me and said what are you doing there and I said, "My name is Schnaittacher."</span> <span id="s447">That little story seemed to have traveled to my village.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">We didn't conquer my village.</span> <span id="s449">It was occupied by a sister regiment.</span> <span id="s450">From there we went to the conquered Nuremberg, the town I went to school.</span> <span id="s451">I interrogated the fortress commander of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s452">I had known him.</span> <span id="s453">I had no particular coincidences relating to my past having lived in Nuremberg while occupying Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s454">We moved on across the Danube and approached Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">02:47:30</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What information, you knew of Dachau from when you lived in Germany, but how much did you know of the camps in Germany at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: At this point we had very little information about concentration camps generally.</span> <span id="s458">We had liberated, but I forgot the name of a small camp which was neither extermination or torture camp where we saw emaciated human beings suffering from all kinds of sicknesses, stacked up in beds with little care.</span> <span id="s459">That was no preparation.</span> <span id="s460">We had no information on Auschwitz, on Theresienstadt, on Mauthausen, etc.</span> <span id="s461">But I knew from past knowledge of Dachau as a camp of torture and destruction.</span> <span id="s462">We arrived in Dachau my regimental headquarters in the late afternoon, or afternoon and I was asked to go to the camp headquarters.</span> <span id="s463">Approaching the camp in front of the gate was one of these infamous freight trains.</span> <span id="s464">The likes of which I had never seen.</span> <span id="s465">The freight train was filled with corpses.</span> <span id="s466">Men and women who according to what we were told possibly might have been transported from the east to the west as the juggernaut.</span> <span id="s467">And, with no food, little clothing, most of them died of hunger.</span> <span id="s468">Those who tried to climb over the trains -- cars were shot by the SS.</span> <span id="s469">Yet, I couldn't resist a feeling that when a few minutes later, I saw the living cadavers the dead ones were more peaceful than the living ones.</span> <span id="s470">The living skeletons their beaming ravaging eyes, the torment that was obvious that they had suffered.</span> <span id="s471">The endless torment.</span> <span id="s472">I didn't get into the camp otherwise to visit the barracks.</span> <span id="s473">I passed an oven but I had no time for any personal inspection because I had to interrogate an SS Brigadeführer, an SS brigadier general who I first had been introduced to him or it was mentioned to me that he was someone to give us information and he was friendly and I think I shook hands with him, and later on I felt that my hand would shrivel up.</span> <span id="s474">Now, he claimed that he had been in Dachau on an arrest and recuperation leave.</span> <span id="s475">That he had become a member of the SS against his wishes, yet he was grateful for it because he could give personal testimony personal witness as to the crimes that had been committed.</span> <span id="s476">One thing which I never forget was you should not be enraged as to what you see here.</span> <span id="s477">Here you see little heaps in Auschwitz in Kattowice, you would have seen mountains of dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">02:54:00</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: This is what he said to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: This is what he said to me.</span> <span id="s481">According to my buddy Fritzie who was involved much longer than I was in the War Crimes Trial, I believe he was hung as well.</span> <span id="s482">I had asked you to remember the date of May 1.</span> <span id="s483">It is the end of my story of Dachau.</span> <span id="s484">I went back to regimental headquarters and the very next day or morning we moved on.</span> <span id="s485">We then began to experience some hopeful signs.</span> <span id="s486">The underground anti-Nazis tried to make contact with us.</span> <span id="s487">I come back again to May 1.</span> <span id="s488">I had moved to Munich on May 1, 1933.</span> <span id="s489">My division conquered Munich on May 1, 1945.</span> <span id="s490">I do think that it might be interesting to mention a few personal experiences.</span> <span id="s491">As soon as I did not have a regimental obligations I tried to clear up or redeem one event.</span> <span id="s492">I had asked you to remember the name Hermann.</span> <span id="s493">I had worked for him.</span> <span id="s494">He was my immediate boss and he was the one who prevented my uncle from entering his place of business and ultimately to be sent to Dachau.</span> <span id="s495">As soon as I was able to, I went to my uncle's place of business, which had been bombed out, and I asked about Hermann and I was able to locate where he was living there.</span> <span id="s496">Having the ability to use a Jeep, not to drive it, I had a driver.</span> <span id="s497">By then I was a first lieutenant.</span> <span id="s498">I drove out to this little town and I asked people and at that time gleefully as long as they weren't involved the Germans pointed at others, and so I arrived at the house where Hermannn was living.</span> <span id="s499">He was dressed in his stocking feet and pants and underwear and long johns and I said, in very harsh German, "Go and get dressed, and come with me to Munich."</span> <span id="s500">He didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s501">His wife wailed and so did his daughter, but I could be heartless, and I loaded him on my Jeep and we went to Munich where I took advantage of the friendly offer that was made by the counterintelligence and interrogated Hermann.</span> <span id="s502">As I mentioned or didn't mention, in accordance pursuant to army instructions and regulations would have been to go through channels, but I had no time for it.</span> <span id="s503">Fortunately for me, in the course of the interrogation, he revealed that he was a guard at a concentration camp, which made him subject to automatic arrest.</span> <span id="s504">After I concluded my interrogation, I introduced myself to him.</span> <span id="s505">I told him who I was and he said "But you, Herr Schnaittacher, should know how good I was to your uncle."</span> <span id="s506">And I said "Yes, I certainly do."</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s508">03:01:05</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: My stay in Munich gave me the opportunity also to meet the friend of the family, and that was a very joyous occasion.</span> <span id="s510">She had been working as the housekeeper for my aunt and she was overjoyed to see me and overjoyed about the end of the oppressive system.</span> <span id="s511">Another somewhat humorous experience reflecting upon some key reporters was the following.</span> <span id="s512">My division commander had learned that I lived in Munich prior to the war, and so I was ordered to come to him and he said Schnaittacher I understand you had lived here before.</span> <span id="s513">We are expecting a bunch of newspaper men, congressmen senators, all kinds of bigwigs that want to see the birthplace of Nazism and I want you to be their guide.</span> <span id="s514">So I took this group on the trip and I started with the Odeonsplatz, which is the square where the Putsch had taken place in 1923 which had failed, and the legend went that courageous Hitler as firing started quickly left his troops and hid behind one of two statues and one of these key reporters profoundly thought so nothing more important to ask behind which one.</span> <span id="s515">The other little story goes to the beer hall where the Putsch had started in 1923 and in the basement of the beer hall there was an air raid shelter which was filled to some degree with stuff which had been stolen from Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s516">Amongst them was a statue of a storm trooper standing on a swastika with a German eagle and the other key reporter raised the statue and said, "Did this come from a Jewish home, too?"</span> <span id="s517">This I could only laugh at.</span> <span id="s518">My stay in Munich was then a brief one.</span> <span id="s519">I participated in the surrender of the Hungarian Army and I do remember at the behest of my general and I do remember that the Hungarian general was really only interested in his men but in his two horses.</span> <span id="s520">Memories.</span> <span id="s521">Thereafter, I was assigned to a camp in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart which was an American P.W. camp of so called automatic arrests.</span> <span id="s522">This was a very wise law that Eisenhower had released early after combat.</span> <span id="s523">Classifications of people would be subject to automatic arrest.</span> <span id="s524">Nothing noteworthy happened other than one general who revealed something that I had had no idea of that they were working on the ultimate secret weapon but I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s525">Then after a brief rest in a rest area, I was transferred to the War Crimes Commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: When was this, what month?</span> <span id="s527">03:06:13</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: I would say that should have been, could have been in July of 1945, and I was in charge of a detail that was screening the archives of the German army high command in pursuing the case of Hjalmar Schacht, the economic czar of Hitler's.</span> <span id="s529">I must say that we did not find any important evidence of his involvement in war crimes.</span> <span id="s530">Not of any national significance but a totally inhuman story was contained in a letter that I came across from a youngster who very proudly reports to someone in his family that on his 13th or 14th birthday his father gave him a rifle and three Jewish prisoners to be shot.</span> <span id="s531">Inhumanity beyond description.</span> <span id="s532">We could not make use of it as evidence in pursuing this case.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Why couldn't you use that?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Because we were not able to identify the people involved.</span> <span id="s535">This period where I had a good deal of free time, and possibly I skipped a few months, I should go back to the month of June when I had the first opportunity to visit my village.</span> <span id="s536">Again, I had the privilege of a Jeep and a buddy of mine, because my driving left much to be desired.</span> <span id="s537">I learned how to drive a truck on some desert exercises where we had no roads.</span> <span id="s538">As dusk began to settle we reached the village, and I can still see shutters opened and I hear the sound "Fritz is back, Fritz is back, Fritz is back."</span> <span id="s539">I come to my house, the house where I was born in, and we drive up to it.</span> <span id="s540">The house hadn't changed.</span> <span id="s541">Downstairs had been converted into the mayor's office of the party's office, but the upstairs were living quarters.</span> <span id="s542">I knock on the door and fearfully a young woman looks out of the window of the bedroom where my mother used to sleep and I could hear her knees shaking because those were the days when an American knock caused fear.</span> <span id="s543">I didn't recognize her.</span> <span id="s544">She was too young, and I asked her to send her father down.</span> <span id="s545">Her father came, and I recognized him at once and he fell around me because he recognized me inspite of my uniform.</span> <span id="s546">He had been an old Social Democrat, a very decent human being, a decent anti-Nazi and I said you can stay in my house but tonight we want to sleep here.</span> <span id="s547">But now I want to visit the driver of my mother who in my memory had taken on the role of a hero.</span> <span id="s548">He protected my mother wherever possible.</span> <span id="s549">He suffered the concentration camp of Dachau and I wanted to know whether he had come back from the war and whether there is anything I could do for him.</span> <span id="s550">We drive up to his house but he hadn't returned yet.</span> <span id="s551">He had I believe still a prisoner of war, but we left some gifts with his wife, who was deliriously happy to see us.</span> <span id="s552">As we drove back to our house and now again I close a cycle who was there to greet me?</span> <span id="s553">The very gendarme who had arrested me in 1933, plus another man.</span> <span id="s554">Both of them wanted to shake my hands but their hands are still sticking in the darkness of the night.</span> <span id="s555">But I ordered the gendarme to report to me the following morning that I needed him for certain steps that I wanted to take.</span> <span id="s556">In one of our back rooms of my house, I then asked him to bring to me the mayor and again I went beyond army authority and that was being held against me and I had him.</span> <span id="s557">We had town criers in the village and I ordered him to tell the town crier to return to the mayor's office all stolen Jewish property.</span> <span id="s558">Thereafter, I told the gendarme I want him back in about three or four hours because I wanted to drive to Schnaittach in order to set things straight there because grave stones had been thrown over, destroyed, etc.</span> <span id="s559">I went to the mayor's office, who at first was reluctant to cooperate but when I touched my sidearm, he said yes I will do it, I will do it.</span> <span id="s560">In order to restore to whatever extent possible the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s561">Then I drove back to the village.</span> <span id="s562">This is Fritz's war, and I ordered the apprehension of the guy who had been responsible for sending the remaining Jews after the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s563">I think his name was Britting (ph), and ordered him to be brought to me and I took him again without authority to Nuremberg and turned him over to the C.I.C. Subsequently some months later I was ordered to come to Heidelberg because I received a decoration and after that I passed an office where the friend of mine who had become a major I believe and he took me into his office and he said you've got to watch your step, you went out of channel.</span> <span id="s564">Where did I go out of channel?</span> <span id="s565">By ordering the mayor to do things and by apprehending whom I considered to be a criminal and by ordering the mayor of Schnaittach to restore the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s566">So, I said, "Who's complaining about it?"</span> <span id="s567">"The town major of Erlangen."</span> <span id="s568">Erlangen, where I had been in prison, so I said, "On my next trip, I will see the town major."</span> <span id="s569">and indeed I did and I said Major this isn't the first time I was in prison in Erlangen.</span> <span id="s570">I had been in prisoner here in 1933 but if you wish to imprison me feel free to do so.</span> <span id="s571">Well, he was embarrassed and then he tried to get information from me, but I used this opportunity to then go to the prison and knock on the door and the same warden was still alive and he said, Herr Schnaittacher, now the ones who imprisoned you are imprisoned here."</span> <span id="s572">Well, another cycle is closed.</span> <span id="s573">Now, back to the War Crimes Commission.</span> <span id="s574">The greatest satisfaction I had was when I was called in to act as interpreter for an integration carried out by I think a Colonel Gershon (ph) of Field Marshall Keitel, the chief of staff of all of the German armies.</span> <span id="s575">I certainly felt a great deal of satisfaction when I entered the office that he stood up and stood at attention and saluted me.</span> <span id="s576">Can I think for a minute?</span> <span id="s577">I don't know if there was anything else worth mentioning of my tour of duty with the War Crimes Commission.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">03:18:19</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: What else were you doing with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: We were going through the archives document by document, and I had a group of translators that was in pursuit of it was located in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s581">The War Crimes Trials took place in Nuremberg but it took place outside of Frankfurt in Fechenheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And you were looking mostly for Schacht evidence --?</span> <span id="s583">A: Only that.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you come up with anything else that became useful?</span> <span id="s585">A: No, not that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: How many months did you work with the War Crimes Commission?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Let me think now.</span> <span id="s588">At most it was probably not more than two.</span> <span id="s589">I'm trying to think, maybe three because in October the return trip started.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: To the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Right.</span> <span id="s592">I guess I could close with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: I have a few questions for you if you feel that you have covered the war crimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, it's disappointing little because I don't have any recollection of any documents due to the specialization of our search.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Were there certain difficulties or obstacles you faced in trying to --?</span> <span id="s596">A: No, no because in the archives if anything it was lack of experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Well, I want to go back to the liberation of Dachau a little bit.</span> <span id="s598">I know that that 45th did in fact go into Dachau.</span> <span id="s599">Were you part of the first group that went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">03:20:47</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: I was part of the -- I can say that I was in --I must explain a little bit about the order of battle so to speak, the system of battle.</span> <span id="s602">You have the advance unit of infantry men commanded by lieutenants or captains.</span> <span id="s603">Usually there is a lieutenant in charge of a platoon and a captain in charge of a company.</span> <span id="s604">They are the real heros in my opinion because they day by day are exposed to not only artillery fire but small arms fire and the physical danger which we were exposed to a much less degree.</span> <span id="s605">I was with regimental headquarters.</span> <span id="s606">My buddy Fritzie had gone somewhat earlier because I was ordered to stay back at regimental headquarters and I think he interrogated the wife of General Paulus, the general who was in command of the German army in Stalingrad I was ordered to come into the camp, camp headquarters which was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s607">I still heard firing but it was no longer an intense firing that we saw in the resistance.</span> <span id="s608">I'm inclined to believe anyhow with the approach of our units that the SS took off as fast as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Who was doing the firing?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: I could not identify, but I would be inclined to think that it was our men who did the firing.</span> <span id="s611">Any German being killed because of the rage that was in our troops I wouldn't doubt it for one moment because one could only feel the deepest of rage and hatred for what human beings could do to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: You didn't see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: I didn't witness it.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: What about retaliation by the prisoners?</span> <span id="s615">03:24:10</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I saw one incident as I was in the process of entering which I interpreted to be the headquarters or one of the headquarters of the camp and a large group of prisoners seemed to want to tear a guy to pieces.</span> <span id="s617">My false humanity showed itself.</span> <span id="s618">I tried to stop but I didn't persist.</span> <span id="s619">It was not a very pleasant sight.</span> <span id="s620">It was an obviously disturbing and in retrospect and even then I could understand how valid and justified for what these people had gone through for years and years.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: What were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Trying to tear him to pieces.</span> <span id="s623">Q: Was he a guard a Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: I had no idea what he had been whether he was a guard a Kapo.</span> <span id="s625">I had no idea what he had been.</span> <span id="s626">By the time I got through with the interrogation of this SS brigadier general night had set in and it was dark and I headed right back to regimental headquarters and early the following morning we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Were there a number of SS guards still there that you saw?</span> <span id="s628">A: No, I didn't see anymore guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: What can you estimate when you saw those boxcars coming in how many of them there were or how many people you saw only corpses?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: The figure that sticks in my memory is anywhere between six to eight hundred.</span> <span id="s631">I didn't count the boxcars.</span> <span id="s632">I went along side them and I saw the horrible sights.</span> <span id="s633">Some of them were trying to eat each other.</span> <span id="s634">There was such terrible terrible hunger and then primarily what I seem to be impressed with was that then suddenly life ebbed out the precision of the corpses seemed to tell this as a story.</span> <span id="s635">They succumbed in so many different positions.</span> <span id="s636">They succumbed to weakness.</span> <span id="s637">They succumbed to the end of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: But at the time you were walking by there was still some sort of alive?</span> <span id="s639">A: No.</span> <span id="s640">I didn't see any more that there was movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: I thought you said something about they're eating each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: There was evidence of it.</span> <span id="s643">The only ones that had reached the outside of the boxcars were people who had some strength left and they were shot and there was evidence of them having been shot by the SS.</span> <span id="s644">I had had pictures but over the years someone took them.</span> <span id="s645">Now if it is of interest the history of the 45th Dvision which was written up, I don't have a copy of it, but they have a brochure.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">03:28:49</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: The prisoners, you said when you entered, what was going on?</span> <span id="s648">Were they coming up to you?</span> <span id="s649">Were they trying to walk out of the camp?</span> <span id="s650">What was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: They didn't come up to me.</span> <span id="s652">There seemed to be traffic all around.</span> <span id="s653">My memory doesn't justify me to say that there was overwhelming joy in the air.</span> <span id="s654">I can't say that.</span> <span id="s655">I was much too short a time in the prison -- in the camp.</span> <span id="s656">I think there is one little story which pertains to a young kid, age 13, 14 years.</span> <span id="s657">And it was yet I do believe before we had reached Dachau that I came across him, and he wore the concentration camp garb.</span> <span id="s658">I asked him where are you from?</span> <span id="s659">He said, I don't know.</span> <span id="s660">Where are your parents?</span> <span id="s661">I don't know.</span> <span id="s662">Where were you?</span> <span id="s663">In Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s665">I don't know.</span> <span id="s666">I tried to persuade a woman in whose house we were to take care of the kid, but she refused.</span> <span id="s667">Now memory tells me that I came across a group of anti-Nazi and they promised to pick up the kid and take care of him.</span> <span id="s668">It was one story out of hundreds of thousands.</span> <span id="s669">It was so deeply, deeply depressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: When you entered, were there men and women and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s672">Primarily, see because I drove up to the camp headquarters and the only contact I had was in the group of prisoners around the guy that they wanted to tear to pieces.</span> <span id="s673">There was others in the vicinity but my memory fails me.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Any other impressions of entering that camp?</span> <span id="s675">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: In terms of the layout, the conditions, the facilities, the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No, not even a knowledge of it due to the fact that we liberated and we moved on.</span> <span id="s678">We didn't spend a night in a camp.</span> <span id="s679">We spent the night in the village of Dachau.</span> <span id="s680">People in Dachau of course disclaimed the knowledge of what was going on.</span> <span id="s681">That is of some significance.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: How close did these people live to the camp?</span> <span id="s683">03:33:23</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: A matter of minutes.</span> <span id="s685">A matter of minutes.</span> <span id="s686">Q: So, it doesn't make much sense does it?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Hardly.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Any other experiences in the town that you're remembering?</span> <span id="s689">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: What out of all of this when you reflect back haunts you the most?</span> <span id="s691">What were the strongest images for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Had you asked hurts me the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Haunt.</span> <span id="s694">What images really stand out in your mind the most?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Of Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Or just your experiences of going back as a soldier?</span> <span id="s697">You had a very unique perspective I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">03:34:34</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Thinking back fulfilled me with a degree of pride and satisfaction was that I did believe I contributed to the best of my ability to the ultimate victory.</span> <span id="s700">The relatively little that I was involved in the actual liberation of Dachau the fact that I was part of the unit that liberated was one of my proudest days.</span> <span id="s701">I wish I could have done more.</span> <span id="s702">The personal revenge that I got against the man such as Hermann was of great, great satisfaction.</span> <span id="s703">The recognition of the silent interrogation having been of enormous value in the further prosecution of the war was great.</span> <span id="s704">All in all, from the moment that I set foot on first French soil, and throughout the campaign through Germany, I never had a boring moment, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: What ever happened to Hermann after you arrested him?</span> <span id="s706">A: Hermann only got a few months of prison out of it.</span></p> <p><span
