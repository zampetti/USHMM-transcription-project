id="s3">Answer: I probably won't __________, if you don't mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s5">If you want to stop the tape at any time, just let me know.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Oh that's okay.</span> <span id="s7">I'll manage.</span> <span id="s8">I'll manage.</span> <span id="s9">I didn't talk for many, many years.</span> <span id="s10">I did not talk.</span> <span id="s11">When my kids started to understand, more or less, I just did not talk what I went through.</span> <span id="s12">I tried to have good times.</span> <span id="s13">I tried to forget.</span> <span id="s14">I tried to, I blocked out.</span> <span id="s15">I just didn't want to inflict the pain.</span> <span id="s16">I was in so much pain, deep-knee, that I didn't want to inflict on my children.</span> <span id="s17">I suffered so much as a child and when the kids were born, they were my whole life.</span> <span id="s18">I didn't expect to be alive, I didn't expect to get married, I didn't expect to have children.</span> <span id="s19">And when this, God gave me two kids, it's just, why should I put the pain on them?</span> <span id="s20">It's not enough that I went through?</span> <span id="s21">This is all I have now.</span> <span id="s22">I lost my mother, my sister, a brother who was one year younger, a sister who was five years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s23">And just to put this kind of pain on my children, I said no.</span> <span id="s24">When they'll grow up, they'll go to school, I raise them as Jewish.</span> <span id="s25">I'm not orthodox but I am very much Jewish orientated, all my life in this country.</span> <span id="s26">I gave my life to Judaism.</span> <span id="s27">I work for the ZOA.</span> <span id="s28">My name is quite known in the ZOA.</span> <span id="s29">Florence Eisen, Fanny Eisen.</span> <span id="s30">I give big donations.</span> <span id="s31">I love Israel, it is my life.</span> <span id="s32">Anything that was for Israel I raised millions of dollars for Israel, for bonds, UGA, they all know me.</span> <span id="s33">But to tell the children about the ghetto and the war, and what I went through, I just, I stopped right there.</span> <span id="s34">I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s35">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s36">I couldn't put this pain on them.</span> <span id="s37">I want them to grow up not to know what mother went through.</span> <span id="s38">But to be happy.</span> <span id="s39">To grow up as American, normal children.</span> <span id="s40">I was not normal.</span> <span id="s41">I didn't grow up normal.</span> <span id="s42">I didn't have a normal upbringing.</span> <span id="s43">From twelve years of age, since 1939, and I just wanted, that's all I have is my kids, and to let them lead a normal life.</span> <span id="s44">Let them grow up like all the other American next-door children.</span> <span id="s45">Not by a mother who is always worried.</span> <span id="s46">I did put my overprotection over them.</span> <span id="s47">I did.</span> <span id="s48">I didn't let them swim.</span> <span id="s49">I didn't let them play ball.</span> <span id="s50">I didn't let them, food was always eat, eat, eat.</span> <span id="s51">Push, put on them.</span> <span id="s52">I knew my abnormality.</span> <span id="s53">I knew it, but I couldn't help it.</span> <span id="s54">Now, they're now in school, and then they went to High School and college, they know Grandmas, they call me Babba, overprotection of them.</span> <span id="s55">Even up until now, I still don't want them to ride a bike.</span> <span id="s56">I just can't bear for them to get hurt in any way.</span> <span id="s57">In any way I can't bear for them to get hurt.</span> <span id="s58">Now I have grandchildren so I am even more overprotective.</span> <span id="s59">But now we talk about it.</span> <span id="s60">As soon as my kids, my grandchildren, not to my children.</span> <span id="s61">They start to go to school and of course it came out, schools talk about it.</span> <span id="s62">I was able more to talk about it.</span> <span id="s63">They called me, there's not, my children live in Connecticut and when they started High School, even, when _________ public schools they wrote about their grandma.</span> <span id="s64">In schools, and I'm sure you know that they say, you know, you have grandparents?</span> <span id="s65">Tell me about you're grandparents.</span> <span id="s66">They always say that my grandparents are survivors but I don't know much about them.</span> <span id="s67">They called me into Connecticut, to schools.</span> <span id="s68">I talked a little bit about it.</span> <span id="s69">I told them.</span> <span id="s70">They wrote about my life.</span> <span id="s71">They always got A's, always got A's.</span> <span id="s72">When they graduated, my older one's bar mitzvah, and it was like some kind of a Friday night, they called me, I went there.</span> <span id="s73">I told them what I would like to do.</span> <span id="s74">They brought the whole school children.</span> <span id="s75">I told them that I want to tell them how lucky they are that they were born here and raised here and educated here.</span> <span id="s76">They didn't have to go through what grandma went through.</span> <span id="s77">And how overprotective I am over them.</span> <span id="s78">With both boys I did that, both boys.</span> <span id="s79">And really they take pride in me.</span> <span id="s80">They take pride in me for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Let's talk about you're children and you're family life a little bit later on.</span> <span id="s82">Let's go back to the stories that . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: To the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: . . . now you're beginning to talk to them about these stories.</span> <span id="s85">Why don't we start?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Start to talk about the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Yes, start when you were a child.</span> <span id="s88">Let's talk of you're experiences in the ghetto and just give, first of all, you're name then, how old you were, and a little bit about you're family and then we can talk about the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s90">Actually the war for me started in 1939 when the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s91">In 1939.</span> <span id="s92">I was born in 1928.</span> <span id="s93">My name then was Fagel Giterman.</span> <span id="s94">Fagel was my Jewish name, Giterman was my father's name.</span> <span id="s95">A family of five, my father, my mother, three children.</span> <span id="s96">I'm the oldest of the three.</span> <span id="s97">My brother was one year younger, my sister five years younger.</span> <span id="s98">Also lived with us a grandma, my father's mother, who was an old, lovely lady.</span> <span id="s99">And in 1939, when the Russians came our lives started to change.</span> <span id="s100">My father was a barber, he gave the kids a good education, he worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s101">My mother never worked.</span> <span id="s102">In Europe, in those years, women didn't work.</span> <span id="s103">They took care of the children and we lived in a small stet-ill (ph) by the name of Lock-mul (ph), not far from Pease (ph), from Mun-yeah-yetz (ph), it’s a stet-ill (ph) but a nice stet-ill (ph), with a beautiful you-gont (ph), beautiful, beautiful young crowd of people which, I didn't even know them yet because I was what?</span> <span id="s104">I was born in 1928 and this was 1939, I was eleven years old, right?</span> <span id="s105">About eleven years old.</span> <span id="s106">And the war started already.</span> <span id="s107">They sent us to school.</span> <span id="s108">They put us like a year younger.</span> <span id="s109">I felt as a child that life started to be hard.</span> <span id="s110">Anyway, two years the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s111">It wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s112">Then, in 1942 I think, the Germans came.</span> <span id="s113">As a child, I was a curious child.</span> <span id="s114">I use to, we had a radio.</span> <span id="s115">Some people didn't have a radio, we did have a radio.</span> <span id="s116">We use to sit, my father use to sit by the radio and listen what's going on the world.</span> <span id="s117">And I was hiding and listening.</span> <span id="s118">I was unhappy.</span> <span id="s119">I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s120">It made me very unhappy.</span> <span id="s121">I cried a lot.</span> <span id="s122">Then they started to talk about they are going to go to a ghetto, they are going to put us in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s123">We lived like, we had our own house, and we lived like outskirts of my town.</span> <span id="s124">And they are going to put us like in the middle of the town.</span> <span id="s125">They divided the ghetto, this is only what I've heard talking from the grown-ups.</span> <span id="s126">Like their going to divide the town, not the town, but in the middle of the marrick (ph) they use to call it, middle of the city or the town or the stet-ill (ph), and they're going to put us in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s127">I remember what they gave us, a buggy and a horse.</span> <span id="s128">They didn't give us, my father had to borrow it from the next door, a peasant, non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s129">But they had a good pull you put on it and I walked in the back.</span> <span id="s130">I looked at my house.</span> <span id="s131">I cried.</span> <span id="s132">I remember like now.</span> <span id="s133">This was 1942, I must have been fourteen I guess.</span> <span id="s134">I cried my eyes out.</span> <span id="s135">I looked to the house.</span> <span id="s136">I said, "where are we going"?</span> <span id="s137">Anyway, they took us there.</span> <span id="s138">My father had a stepbrother in this particular ghetto.</span> <span id="s139">There were two ghettos split in half and we were in one ghetto, not far from the Shul (ph).</span> <span id="s140">And he had a big house, but they gave us a small room.</span> <span id="s141">And this small room, very small, tiny, maybe, my father made bunk beds.</span> <span id="s142">And there were five people, and my grandma was six, and they put another couple there, an elderly couple, and they also had like a bunk bed.</span> <span id="s143">And that's how we lived there.</span> <span id="s144">We were there from, it must have been around Pacer side (ph), before Pacer side (ph).</span> <span id="s145">So Pacer (ph) is usually April sometimes, the end of April probably.</span> <span id="s146">And I didn't know, there wasn't enough food.</span> <span id="s147">I heard my father talk about trying to get together a young group of people that, they are going to make like an uprising and they are going to go to the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s148">I was always kind of, as a child I was hiding and crying and hiding and reading whatever I could put my hands on, some books, reading.</span> <span id="s149">And my mother never talked a lot.</span> <span id="s150">She was a nice, quiet lady.</span> <span id="s151">My father was a barber and he was a good barber.</span> <span id="s152">And him I think, and the guy, the other couple that was with us, they opened up a barbershop special for the Germans and also for the non-Jews outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s153">And he worked there.</span> <span id="s154">So he use to bring in, probably smuggling, hiding, a piece of bread, a piece of fish or a piece of _________ because whatever the ration they gave to you it wasn't enough.</span> <span id="s155">I remember after quite a while, my mother's walking around with a pair of swollen feet.</span> <span id="s156">I said, "Ma, what is it?"</span> <span id="s157">.</span> <span id="s158">"Oh, nothing my kin, nothing.</span> <span id="s159">Don't worry about, I'm fine."</span> <span id="s160">Later on I found out it was from lack of food.</span> <span id="s161">She didn't eat.</span> <span id="s162">Whatever little food she had she gave it to the children.</span> <span id="s163">And she didn't eat it, she got swollen.</span> <span id="s164">She was only thirty-six years when she went to her grave.</span> <span id="s165">When they killed her.</span> <span id="s166">Thirty-six years old.</span> <span id="s167">And then old grandma was with us.</span> <span id="s168">I was never in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s169">I was never, there was one kitchen, it couldn't have been for ten family's maybe, I was never in somebody else's rooms.</span> <span id="s170">I couldn't, I was just in pain, pain, pain, pain.</span> <span id="s171">I couldn't, I was mainly in my room.</span> <span id="s172">I don't even remember playing with children.</span> <span id="s173">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s174">I was just trying to get books and read and read and stay in bed and read.</span> <span id="s175">There was no school, of course.</span> <span id="s176">I never went to school there in ghetto.</span> <span id="s177">And my little sister, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s178">I can visualize them very well now, but I never went to school in ghetto.</span> <span id="s179">Maybe there was some school, I don't think so, if there was any schooling there.</span> <span id="s180">And one day, they use to send people to work.</span> <span id="s181">What was the work?</span> <span id="s182">Later on I found out, at the end.</span> <span id="s183">That they use to take a bunch of people from on ghetto, send them to a different, out of town place or out of this, to another town, dig graves and that's how they use to kill the people.</span> <span id="s184">They didn't know about us.</span> <span id="s185">They wanted my mother, my mother was a very brave woman, and one German was like after my mother.</span> <span id="s186">So instead of sending my mother to work, work means to dig the graves for other people, I went.</span> <span id="s187">I went to dig these graves and I remember the graves, they was like long, deep graves.</span> <span id="s188">I was in one grave, digging, and there were some other people digging, and on the way back they brought us home in trucks.</span> <span id="s189">And it was like in the middle, this work was always done like in the middle of the night, like from suppertime around, before it got dark, until like the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you know what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No.</span> <span id="s192">I really didn't know what I was doing.</span> <span id="s193">Because I, I had a hunch maybe, but I really didn't know.</span> <span id="s194">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s195">Whatever it was I had to dig the grave, I wasn't the only one.</span> <span id="s196">Not directly, I didn't know that this is really for killing people, to throw people in there.</span> <span id="s197">And we came home, it must have been about 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s198">The ghetto was already rounded, all around.</span> <span id="s199">There were trucks, there were soldiers.</span> <span id="s200">It was like, the ghetto was barb wired all around and we looked around and one German said, "Well, you're going to be killed tonight."</span> <span id="s201">And the people that were with us, they said, "This is it.</span> <span id="s202">I think we're going to get killed tonight."</span> <span id="s203">They dropped us off.</span> <span id="s204">We went into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s205">Everybody was up, it started to get like a little lighter, everybody was up.</span> <span id="s206">My mother was up.</span> <span id="s207">Everybody was crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s208">But they didn't take anybody yet on the trucks yet.</span> <span id="s209">I said, "Where's my Dad?"</span> <span id="s210">.</span> <span id="s211">Dad wasn't there anymore and my brother wasn't there.</span> <span id="s212">And I couldn't stand the crying, the yelling, the screaming.</span> <span id="s213">So I went out of the house and, excuse me for the expression, to go to the bathroom they had like booths outside.</span> <span id="s214">And you go into that booth and it was like a hole with a seat in there so when they dropped this came down, and I hid there.</span> <span id="s215">I hid, that's why, when I saw Shindler's List, I saw myself, that little girl.</span> <span id="s216">That little girl who dropped in the, excuse me, in the droppings of the people.</span> <span id="s217">I was there.</span> <span id="s218">And when I saw this, it just, I was screaming.</span> <span id="s219">I was yelling, I was crying.</span> <span id="s220">When I saw the movie.</span> <span id="s221">It's true, I was there.</span> <span id="s222">And I went in like halfway, I just wanted to drown and I couldn't drown.</span> <span id="s223">All of a sudden, my mother came running after me, grabbed my hair, pulled me out and said, "You can't do that, you can't do that."</span> <span id="s224">I said, "Ma, I can't go on that truck.</span> <span id="s225">I don't want to be killed.</span> <span id="s226">I can't do that."</span> <span id="s227">Anyway, she schlepped me into the house, she washed me off and I hid under the pillows.</span> <span id="s228">I went into bed and I hid myself.</span> <span id="s229">I covered my eyes and I put this blanket over my ears.</span> <span id="s230">She said, "No, you come out of there."</span> <span id="s231">She schlepped me out of there.</span> <span id="s232">She dressed me and she put some clothes on me and she says, "Listen, my child.</span> <span id="s233">You're father and you're brother went to the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s234">They might survive.</span> <span id="s235">They might not survive.</span> <span id="s236">But I want you to go there.</span> <span id="s237">Get dressed fast."</span> <span id="s238">She dressed me, she put some shoes on me, she put a school thing on me and I started to run to the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s239">Now why didn't I say, "Ma, come with me."</span> <span id="s240">?</span> <span id="s241">Why didn't I say it to my sister?</span> <span id="s242">She was running after me.</span> <span id="s243">She said, "Take me with you."</span> <span id="s244">I said, "I don't know where I'm going, I don't know where I'm going."</span> <span id="s245">[Mrs. Eisen overwhelmed at this point, unable to make out what she is saying] She continues: Who's going to take care of you're sister, my great grandmother, old grandma."</span> <span id="s246">She said, "You go.</span> <span id="s247">Maybe you'll save yourself, maybe."</span> <span id="s248">Anyway, I started to run.</span> <span id="s249">The ghettos were closed, they wouldn't let me through.</span> <span id="s250">I started to beg, "Let me through, let me through.</span> <span id="s251">My father's there."</span> <span id="s252">So one guy opened the gate, I was the last person crossing from one ghetto to the other.</span> <span id="s253">And they opened the gate, I crossed the street, the only one, and they wouldn't let me in there.</span> <span id="s254">So I started to scream and banging and knocking and they let me in.</span> <span id="s255">I went into the other ghetto, ten minutes later the ghetto exploded, like exploded.</span> <span id="s256">They started to shoot into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s257">The houses were on fire.</span> <span id="s258">I saw my first cousin, he lived in a house in the other ghetto, in the Rabbi's house, I saw the Rabbi standing, wrapped in a talus (ph), his little children next to him, with their heads up.</span> <span id="s259">My cousin, her mother was in the back yelling, "Schmish-oil, Schmish-oil, Schmish-oil" (ph).</span> <span id="s260">There was another guy next to him burning, on fire.</span> <span id="s261">And they started the shooting.</span> <span id="s262">The shooting came in like a hail.</span> <span id="s263">I didn't see my father.</span> <span id="s264">I didn't see my brother.</span> <span id="s265">I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s266">All of a sudden, I got killed.</span> <span id="s267">I got killed, I fell and I see people, I look around me.</span> <span id="s268">I see people lying dead with open mouths.</span> <span id="s269">Children, blood, flesh, pieces ripped apart.</span> <span id="s270">And I'm just laying there.</span> <span id="s271">I said, I touched myself, I said, No, I'm alive.</span> <span id="s272">I'm not dead.</span> <span id="s273">I fell, I don't know why, but I fell and I touch myself.</span> <span id="s274">I got up and a bunch of young, Jewish guys, I think you have it on the record, somebody who was in the front there, ripped the gate and they started to run through the town into the gardens, straight to some woods.</span> <span id="s275">Everybody ran.</span> <span id="s276">I was running, I was running, I was strong.</span> <span id="s277">I got weaker.</span> <span id="s278">I still didn't know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s279">And I was running.</span> <span id="s280">I was running after everybody, I'm looking, maybe I'll see my father, my brother, nobody.</span> <span id="s281">I knew my mother's not there, this I knew.</span> <span id="s282">And I passed my house, we passed the house where I lived in, I looked at it.</span> <span id="s283">And I ran.</span> <span id="s284">And we came to a place by the name of Prepitch (ph) and I said to myself, there's something running in the back of me.</span> <span id="s285">There's something not right about, my shoulders are getting weaker, I'm getting dizzy a little bit.</span> <span id="s286">I said, my back is wet.</span> <span id="s287">And I looked, I touched my back, my behind, and I'm full of blood.</span> <span id="s288">A girlfriend who lived next to us came over and she looked at me and said, "Fanny, you know you are wounded.</span> <span id="s289">What's the matter?"</span> <span id="s290">I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s291">She said, "You're whole wet back is ripped, the clothing is ripped, I could see an open flesh there."</span> <span id="s292">I said, "Well, I must have got hit in the ghetto by a, you know, when they hit me."</span> <span id="s293">She took off her kerchief from her head, she took off her shirt, she had that little shirt underneath.</span> <span id="s294">There was water there, the name of the place called Prepitch (ph).</span> <span id="s295">She dipped this in the water, she wiped me around, she cleaned me off and she put this around me and I was okay.</span> <span id="s296">I mean, there was a wound there.</span> <span id="s297">I didn’t know anything else anymore.</span> <span id="s298">And that's it.</span> <span id="s299">And I was on the Prepitch (ph), unfortunately people are cruel, I guess when the Mo-ha-movis (ph) is in front of you you're trying to save yourself not somebody else.</span> <span id="s300">And the grown up people took off.</span> <span id="s301">Nobody wanted me.</span> <span id="s302">I was very skinny.</span> <span id="s303">I didn't look like, I was thirteen-and-a-half I think, nobody wanted me.</span> <span id="s304">I was running after the young males, you know, they said, "My sister, my brother, my father, my mother, they are going to die and I can't schlep here with me, I can't save my own life.</span> <span id="s305">Go home."</span> <span id="s306">I said, "What do you mean go home, the ghetto was on fire, where am I going to go?</span> <span id="s307">I can't go anyplace, it's burning.</span> <span id="s308">Where am I going to go?"</span> <span id="s309">Anyway, I was on my own there with some, one guy who had two small children of his own took me under his arms.</span> <span id="s310">And another two kids, they are all alive, he died, never, he shouldn't have died, he should have lived forever.</span> <span id="s311">And he got in touch with some kind of peasant guy.</span> <span id="s312">We were there for about a week on this Prepitch (ph), for about a week.</span> <span id="s313">Do you want me to . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: So how many people, let me just go over, when you left there, when you ran from the ghetto, how many people were you with?</span> <span id="s315">Were there many people running?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Running, they were running for about, out of the Prepitch (ph) there must have been around 500 people who ran away from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And did people scatter?</span> <span id="s318">Did you go . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: But they scattered all over the places, all over the places.</span> <span id="s320">Some, then quite a few weeks later, I was traveling, we had to cross the Prepitch (ph) with some kind of a kayak or something, otherwise we couldn't be over.</span> <span id="s321">And this guy who took me under his wings, he had two small kids of his own, one is my age and one a bit younger.</span> <span id="s322">And he said to him, "Well, if you're going to take care of _________, you're going to _______ us a little bit.</span> <span id="s323">I have like a big pot of gold hidden behind my house.</span> <span id="s324">When the war is over, I'll give it to you."</span> <span id="s325">It's true, he gave it to him, but this poor peasant got killed for saving Jews.</span> <span id="s326">They killed him.</span> <span id="s327">And we were there for about eight days.</span> <span id="s328">This peasant use to come, like everybody took off in different directions, nobody wanted the kids.</span> <span id="s329">I'm talking about the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s330">Nobody wanted us.</span> <span id="s331">And he use to bring, every day, like a little fish, cooked fish.</span> <span id="s332">A small piece of bread.</span> <span id="s333">It must have been for about 7 or 8 kids there and this grown-up man.</span> <span id="s334">And this is how we survived this Prepitch (ph).</span> <span id="s335">And then he said, "Over there, on the other side of the Prepitch (ph) there are partisans.</span> <span id="s336">I'll take you there, but one at a time."</span> <span id="s337">It was like a kayak, a metal kayak.</span> <span id="s338">And he started to, one day, like a week later, with that whole week.</span> <span id="s339">And the Germans was looking for us.</span> <span id="s340">There was one incident.</span> <span id="s341">We were laying, all of us together, in the woods.</span> <span id="s342">I lost my shoes when I was running, my feet were swollen.</span> <span id="s343">At that time they take off, like the corn, and it is so hard, it's like needles.</span> <span id="s344">And when you run, when I was running, it like went through and through my feet, and my feet were huge and swollen.</span> <span id="s345">And it was cold already, it was September I think, it must have been September.</span> <span id="s346">When did they take off the corn?</span> <span id="s347">September, right?</span> <span id="s348">After the ghetto already, you know?</span> <span id="s349">So, it was the end of September, or October, no, September, the end of September I think.</span> <span id="s350">And he says, and I was laying there hungry and some kids were swollen already too, and he said, "I'll take you over there."</span> <span id="s351">And he took like two, three people on this little kayak and he took us over on the other side.</span> <span id="s352">Little by little, it must have been about 7 or 8 kids.</span> <span id="s353">This grown up man, and he should rest in peace, he saved my life.</span> <span id="s354">Because nobody wanted me.</span> <span id="s355">My own people, they knew me.</span> <span id="s356">"Why are you running after me?</span> <span id="s357">Go back to you're mother."</span> <span id="s358">I said, "I don't know where they are.</span> <span id="s359">It's burning, how can I go back there?"</span> <span id="s360">Twice they left me sleeping.</span> <span id="s361">I shouldn't say it but it's the truth.</span> <span id="s362">They left me on a stack of hay.</span> <span id="s363">I wake up in the middle of the night, there's nobody there.</span> <span id="s364">I'm laying there all by myself, on the Prepitch (ph), I'm laying there all by myself.</span> <span id="s365">I got up.</span> <span id="s366">It's dark.</span> <span id="s367">Where am I going to go?</span> <span id="s368">I don’t know, so I was listening quietly.</span> <span id="s369">I've heard some talking but I didn't know for sure if it was German or Yiddish, but at that particular point, I couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s370">So I figured if it's Germans, they kill me, it's enough.</span> <span id="s371">If Jewish, let's see what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s372">I followed the voices and I got it there.</span> <span id="s373">It was the same people who left me laying under the stack of hay.</span> <span id="s374">Twice like this I survived, twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: How did you meet up with you're father again?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: This was quite weeks later.</span> <span id="s377">I was laying in some woods.</span> <span id="s378">Some people went away, some people got connected with some other groups.</span> <span id="s379">There was a lot of traveling Jews from different towns.</span> <span id="s380">Some grown-ups.</span> <span id="s381">They knew the way and they went to look for partisans.</span> <span id="s382">I was laying there with another woman and she had, like a little child, a little boy.</span> <span id="s383">And I think this, Romanofski's (ph) his name, with the two girls.</span> <span id="s384">We were laying there in a ditch in the woods, and of course I had a lot of hair, I had long hair.</span> <span id="s385">Skinny I was all my life.</span> <span id="s386">And now, after weeks of not eating, I could hardly move.</span> <span id="s387">We were laying there.</span> <span id="s388">"Mommy's dying."</span> <span id="s389">All of a sudden we hear, some people hear some talking, either Yiddish or German.</span> <span id="s390">So we gave up, figure, look, whoever is going to be there, it's going to be there.</span> <span id="s391">If it's going to be Jews, fine.</span> <span id="s392">If not, if it's Germans, you're going to be dead.</span> <span id="s393">They are going to shoot us out like worms in this ditch and put us there, you know, get it over with.</span> <span id="s394">And they came closer and closer and closer.</span> <span id="s395">I can hear now, the echo in my head.</span> <span id="s396">And they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s397">And this Jewish, and there was a man, just a man.</span> <span id="s398">A few men.</span> <span id="s399">There was a woman with one child, I think, too.</span> <span id="s400">And they came closer and I looked.</span> <span id="s401">I didn't know if my father ran.</span> <span id="s402">I knew he was in the ghetto where it was the uprising, but I didn't know if he ran away or he survived or he got killed running.</span> <span id="s403">Nobody saw him running, you know, and nobody knew if, nobody saw him.</span> <span id="s404">I mean, I didn't see anybody.</span> <span id="s405">All of a sudden I see my father.</span> <span id="s406">I start yelling in Yiddish, "De-tock-n-key, de-tock-n-key (ph)".</span> <span id="s407">He backed it up and he looked, he didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s408">He said, "De-tock-n-key?"</span> <span id="s409">.</span> <span id="s410">"Don't you recognize me?</span> <span id="s411">It's Fagel, you're daughter."</span> <span id="s412">He just didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s413">He grabbed me and touched me and opened up the hair over my face, took it away, and looked at my face and he started yelling, "No, this is not my Fagel."</span> <span id="s414">And he passed out.</span> <span id="s415">I said, "Oh my God, finally I found him and now he got a heart attack and he died."</span> <span id="s416">He didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s417">He just didn't recognize me at all, I was like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s418">And lots of hair, the hair was all coiled, like all over my face.</span> <span id="s419">And he passed out.</span> <span id="s420">He passed out, of course, we started to yell and scream and put some, there was no water there.</span> <span id="s421">I remember we use to squeeze down our food and take some moisture out of it and that's what we drank.</span> <span id="s422">We survived, we didn't get poisoned.</span> <span id="s423">And that's what we did, and we tried to, and he woke up and he recognized me, of course.</span> <span id="s424">And this is how he found me, this is how he found me.</span> <span id="s425">And then he said he knew his way a little bit around and he said, "Well, let's see what you can do now."</span> <span id="s426">And we started to walk.</span> <span id="s427">And in the morning, when it was light, the peasants, they go to the fields.</span> <span id="s428">It was field time.</span> <span id="s429">And they leave the house open.</span> <span id="s430">So we use to go into the house, grab a piece of bread, you know, steal.</span> <span id="s431">Steal a potato.</span> <span id="s432">Sometime we went in, like during the day we would pass by some fields and this was like September, there were like beets and potatoes and carrots.</span> <span id="s433">So we use to steal from the fields and sometimes we stole from the houses.</span> <span id="s434">If we saw a house standing there, nobody was there, we ran in and we stole a piece of pancake, whatever it was on the table.</span> <span id="s435">And this is how it was for quite a while, for quite a few months.</span> <span id="s436">And then my father had a profession.</span> <span id="s437">He asked me if my brother was running too.</span> <span id="s438">He thought maybe he was running out of the ghetto, maybe he survived.</span> <span id="s439">All his life he was looking for him, but he didn't survive.</span> <span id="s440">Later on we found out what happened to my brother.</span> <span id="s441">He was running.</span> <span id="s442">He ran from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s443">He got wounded very, very badly.</span> <span id="s444">Worse than me.</span> <span id="s445">And a German caught him and he said to him, "Run.</span> <span id="s446">Maybe you could save yourself.</span> <span id="s447">Run."</span> <span id="s448">My brother was working in a stable with horses in the ghetto, so he use to bring in like little things from an orange, a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s449">And these Germans recognized him.</span> <span id="s450">And he started to run and he was weaker and weaker and weaker and he came to, like close to my house where he was born, and the peasants recognized him.</span> <span id="s451">And believe it or not, they finished him off with sticks.</span> <span id="s452">They killed him with sticks, they finished him off with sticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: At this point how much information did you have when you found you're father again and between . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: . . . to my ghetto.</span> <span id="s456">When I walked out of there, when I went out of that ghetto, what they did.</span> <span id="s457">Like I digged graves for other towns.</span> <span id="s458">They, some other towns dig graves for my hometown.</span> <span id="s459">And what they did, they put all those people on trucks.</span> <span id="s460">Whoever survive.</span> <span id="s461">In my ghetto there was not killing, I mean, in the ghetto, there was no fire there.</span> <span id="s462">What they did from my side of the ghetto, they took those people like my mother, my sister, my grandma, my aunts, my uncles, they put them on those trucks.</span> <span id="s463">They took them to this grave.</span> <span id="s464">They put them, they lined them up close to the grave.</span> <span id="s465">They told them to put their clothes off and, an old lady of over eighty years of age.</span> <span id="s466">Why?</span> <span id="s467">You ask why?</span> <span id="s468">They took off their clothes, they shoot them and they threw them in, like rows and rows.</span> <span id="s469">They threw in one row, they put this disinfectant stuff, I don't know what it is, like a white type of thing, they put it over, then another.</span> <span id="s470">They killed another row of Jewish, all, they had to get undressed.</span> <span id="s471">And shoot them out, throw them into this grave.</span> <span id="s472">This was going on.</span> <span id="s473">Whoever was there, there must have been about 2 1/2 thousand people.</span> <span id="s474">I think in these grave, I think in this grave, there is about 1,900 people in this grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: When did you, how did you find out this information?</span> <span id="s476">When did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: After the liberation, after the liberation.</span> <span id="s478">My father also knew, like through the war we didn't know exactly, but my father knew from some peasants.</span> <span id="s479">They saw it.</span> <span id="s480">They were standing there watching.</span> <span id="s481">There was a lot of peasant people standing and watching.</span> <span id="s482">And they saw exactly what they were doing.</span> <span id="s483">But, either they were afraid of their own skin or they were happy about it and they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s484">And what could they do if they did care?</span> <span id="s485">They'd shoot.</span> <span id="s486">But they saw something like this going on, they could have been dead too.</span> <span id="s487">If they would say one word for the Jews, he would have been dead too, the peasant.</span> <span id="s488">And that's, they finished it off.</span> <span id="s489">They said that the grave was up and down, raising, for three days.</span> <span id="s490">This grave was like breathing for three days, up and down, up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s491">After the war I went to that grave.</span> <span id="s492">And it wasn't, it was like dropped already, fell already.</span> <span id="s493">Me and some, another two girls.</span> <span id="s494">And we started to clean up around and I saw these shoes, baby's shoes, baby's clothes, baby's, just like they left it there, that's how it was there.</span> <span id="s495">The peasants didn't touch, they had the goym (ph), they were afraid to come close to it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s496">And we started to clean it up and we put it in bags and then I saw little bones and I took off.</span> <span id="s497">I took off.</span> <span id="s498">I left my hometown.</span> <span id="s499">I lived in Swooz-ka (ph) after the war, I was liberated by Swooz-ka (ph), a town.</span> <span id="s500">It was Russian there, like where I was born it's like the borderline was.</span> <span id="s501">Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s502">So I was like on the Polish side of the border.</span> <span id="s503">And Swooz-ka (ph) was on the other side.</span> <span id="s504">And I was liberated there, in Swooz-ka (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Let's talk about liberation.</span> <span id="s506">What were you doing?</span> <span id="s507">You were with you're father?</span> <span id="s508">Tell me about what you were doing, what they daily life was like leading up to liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Well we were walking.</span> <span id="s510">We were looking actually for the partisans because the peasants said that there are partisans.</span> <span id="s511">And being my father was a barber and he knew a little bit how to sew, he didn't have ammunition on him.</span> <span id="s512">And we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s513">And we had no other choice.</span> <span id="s514">I mean, we walked and we came across some groups and, say they were partisans, and he got in touch with them, he got connected with them.</span> <span id="s515">And they said, well, they'll take in my father.</span> <span id="s516">At first, like the partisans in that area, they were organized from Moscow.</span> <span id="s517">They use to, they had to obey Moscow's orders.</span> <span id="s518">And in real life they were not allowed to kill Jews, but if they caught the Jews they killed them.</span> <span id="s519">They killed a lot of Jews, the partisans, a lot.</span> <span id="s520">And we were walking and walking and walking, my father with his ___________, but when he found me I was full of lice.</span> <span id="s521">I was like one lice from toe to head.</span> <span id="s522">And in the middle of the night, I remember like now, we went into somebody's house and I started to cry, this is after he found me, he said, "I have to save my child."</span> <span id="s523">She looked at me, she said, an older lady, she said, "Oh my God, my child, my child.</span> <span id="s524">What is it?</span> <span id="s525">What's happening to you?"</span> <span id="s526">I was swollen here, I wore the same outfit, you know, it was hard already from the blood.</span> <span id="s527">And full of lice, I had a big head of hair.</span> <span id="s528">She took me in.</span> <span id="s529">She was a nice lady.</span> <span id="s530">An older lady.</span> <span id="s531">She had like a big, how you call it?</span> <span id="s532">Made out of wood where you bathe someone, bathe the children or bathe a pig, who knows?</span> <span id="s533">She put in some water there.</span> <span id="s534">My father had his, this machine that you cut hair off.</span> <span id="s535">First of all, the first thing he did he cut off my whole head of hair.</span> <span id="s536">The lice were gone.</span> <span id="s537">They put me in this ___________, how you call it?</span> <span id="s538">In the val-it (ph) we use to call it.</span> <span id="s539">And they gave me a bath, he said, "But I have nothing for you to wear.</span> <span id="s540">I can't give you anything to wear."</span> <span id="s541">She said, "I'm going to give you some of mine."</span> <span id="s542">So she gave me something to wear, something what she was wearing.</span> <span id="s543">Everything, I mean, panties, those __________ panties.</span> <span id="s544">And she gave me a pair of lop-chess (ph), it's made out of straw to put on my feet.</span> <span id="s545">And she said, "I have nothing else.</span> <span id="s546">It's cold.</span> <span id="s547">How could you walk on that?"</span> <span id="s548">So she went into her stable and there was a big pig there.</span> <span id="s549">And the pig was covered with a big blanket, it's like a burble, how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Burlap?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Burlap.</span> <span id="s552">She took it off.</span> <span id="s553">She said, "This will keep you warm."</span> <span id="s554">And she gave this to me, they gave me a bath, they cut off my hair.</span> <span id="s555">And she said, "But you have to live."</span> <span id="s556">And she gave me something to eat, and she said, "But you have to leave my house.</span> <span id="s557">You have to go.</span> <span id="s558">Go, go, I don't want to see you.</span> <span id="s559">You were never in my house.</span> <span id="s560">Just take off because they are going to kill me.</span> <span id="s561">The Germans are going to kill me."</span> <span id="s562">And we took off.</span> <span id="s563">That little old lady, I'll never forget too.</span> <span id="s564">And we walked again, the two of us, and two more people.</span> <span id="s565">And we walked and we walked and we walked, and my father who use to walk daytime, we use to hide at night.</span> <span id="s566">We walked and stole a potato.</span> <span id="s567">We stole carrots, in the woods, I mean in the gardens.</span> <span id="s568">And he used to give the peasants a haircut because in those years they didn't have those automatic razors and how to take a haircut.</span> <span id="s569">So they had pity, kind of, for us, some of the peasants, non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s570">And we walked and we walked and we walked until we came to this particular place, close to ____________, it took us months.</span> <span id="s571">And the name of it was Lublin.</span> <span id="s572">And he said, "Look, I have a profession."</span> <span id="s573">They said, "Do you have ammunition?"</span> <span id="s574">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s575">I don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s576">I don't have a pistol, I don't have a, I have nothing."</span> <span id="s577">He said, "But I have a profession.</span> <span id="s578">I could give you haircuts.</span> <span id="s579">I could sew.</span> <span id="s580">I'll make you jackets".</span> <span id="s581">You know, whatever, jackets from the ship things.</span> <span id="s582">He said, "But I have a child with me."</span> <span id="s583">He said, "No.</span> <span id="s584">We'll take you __________."</span> <span id="s585">They wanted to take him in, but not the child.</span> <span id="s586">He says, "Well, I'm not going without the child.</span> <span id="s587">Either you take us both.</span> <span id="s588">I'm sure she could be useful, she could work."</span> <span id="s589">They had kitchens.</span> <span id="s590">They had, we lived underground, like they call it in Russian _______________, underground.</span> <span id="s591">And there were only left over soldiers from Russia that they took off.</span> <span id="s592">When the Germans passed by they were going and there was no war there actually, the Russians they were running, in the Russia and the Germans just took it over, that's it.</span> <span id="s593">It wasn't any shooting there.</span> <span id="s594">And so they said, you know what, they said, "We have a town that, the partisans own it.</span> <span id="s595">There's no ___________ there.</span> <span id="s596">We are going to put you're daughter in one of those houses.</span> <span id="s597">They are going to keep her.</span> <span id="s598">But we're not going to take her in."</span> <span id="s599">There was no children there.</span> <span id="s600">And they did.</span> <span id="s601">They put me in this peasant's house.</span> <span id="s602">For some reason, I must have been there for quite a few months, I don't remember nothing of this particular house and what I did.</span> <span id="s603">I must have been, I cleaned probably.</span> <span id="s604">I go to the fields.</span> <span id="s605">I went, as my father use to tell me later on, why I blocked this out I cannot understand.</span> <span id="s606">I just remember I slept on top of an oven.</span> <span id="s607">And it was so hot.</span> <span id="s608">Like, the cooking was in the middle and the oven was like bricks.</span> <span id="s609">And this heated off the whole house.</span> <span id="s610">I slept on it.</span> <span id="s611">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s612">This pain and this burning in my flesh I'll never forget.</span> <span id="s613">And also this house had cockroaches.</span> <span id="s614">Lots of them.</span> <span id="s615">Lots of cockroaches.</span> <span id="s616">This I remember.</span> <span id="s617">But the rest of it, what I ate, how I ate, I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s618">But of course they needed my father for haircuts.</span> <span id="s619">He use to sew something, fix something.</span> <span id="s620">So they kept him and he was of course after them to take me into, to bring with him, because who knows?</span> <span id="s621">Here I am okay with the peasants, a minute later they could give me out.</span> <span id="s622">You know, a German could come in or, but ____________ was owned by the partisans.</span> <span id="s623">This town was owned by the partisans.</span> <span id="s624">So I was kind of in a safe way but my father wasn't sure.</span> <span id="s625">And there was no transportation.</span> <span id="s626">I didn't know where he was, where he is, if he's going to come back to pick me up or if he's going to leave me there.</span> <span id="s627">Because I saw on the Prepitch (ph) how running people left their children to die.</span> <span id="s628">I saw it.</span> <span id="s629">And this was in my mind.</span> <span id="s630">Some of them were wounded, some of them were not wounded.</span> <span id="s631">And they left them and the parents took off.</span> <span id="s632">And this was in my mind all my life, even when I came here to this country, that my father's going to leave me.</span> <span id="s633">Which he never did.</span> <span id="s634">He was the best father.</span> <span id="s635">He saved my life.</span> <span id="s636">Not just this time, there was other incidences, and the partisans, true, they wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s637">And he said no.</span> <span id="s638">But this was in my mind because what I saw on the Prepitch (ph).</span> <span id="s639">The parents left their children.</span> <span id="s640">And one day, all of a sudden a buggy came with a horse and two soldiers and they came into the house.</span> <span id="s641">But I stayed.</span> <span id="s642">And he brought me like a little, he made it, he put it together for me, from wool, sheepskins.</span> <span id="s643">Like a little jacket.</span> <span id="s644">And he brought me a pair of, put together from little boots, you know?</span> <span id="s645">And he put me on that wagon and he took me to the partisans.</span> <span id="s646">I was useful there actually.</span> <span id="s647">I peeled potatoes.</span> <span id="s648">I went into the kitchen, they had an organized kitchen for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s649">I went into that kitchen at 2 o'clock in the morning, 1 o'clock, peeled potatoes.</span> <span id="s650">Served them.</span> <span id="s651">Food I had enough already, I had enough food.</span> <span id="s652">I wasn't hungry anymore.</span> <span id="s653">I use to knit for the soldier's gloves.</span> <span id="s654">They got it somehow, wool.</span> <span id="s655">I use to knit for them gloves.</span> <span id="s656">I use to knit for them socks.</span> <span id="s657">I use to sew up certain things that they were ripped on them, you know?</span> <span id="s658">Of course, I was under the protection with my father.</span> <span id="s659">Otherwise, they would have raped me, they would have killed me, they would have never taken me in.</span> <span id="s660">They didn't need me.</span> <span id="s661">But they needed my father.</span> <span id="s662">Sometimes I use to even go, they taught me how to use a, not the piece of rifle gun, but the long ones.</span> <span id="s663">The . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Rifle?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: The rifles.</span> <span id="s666">They taught me how to use it in case something comes up.</span> <span id="s667">They didn't want me, but there was other two Jewish girls there.</span> <span id="s668">One was older than I am and one was younger.</span> <span id="s669">Also because of their brothers.</span> <span id="s670">They had brothers.</span> <span id="s671">And this is all, there were three children, Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s672">There was no females at all, they were not allowed to have any females there.</span> <span id="s673">It was a regular army, organized army.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: And what was life like with the partisans?</span> <span id="s675">Like, how many people were there?</span> <span id="s676">Did you travel?</span> <span id="s677">Was their fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: We traveled, they were fighting.</span> <span id="s679">They were not so many fighting, they were bombing us.</span> <span id="s680">The Germans knew that the partisans are there but it was town and towns and miles with partisan, soldiers, armies, that the Russians left there when they took off and they ran.</span> <span id="s681">And the Germans, they were so busy with the Front and with the fighting, it was a real organized group, thousands of partisans, thousands.</span> <span id="s682">And they use to, my father knew more, unfortunately my father's dead.</span> <span id="s683">But they use to put bombs, when the Germans use to send, let's say ammunition to the Front, into deep Russia, the partisans knew about it.</span> <span id="s684">And they use to put bombs under the trains and stop them and just explode them.</span> <span id="s685">They shouldn't be able to take it to the Front, the ammunition and the soldiers.</span> <span id="s686">They killed thousands and thousands of them, thousands of Germans.</span> <span id="s687">They never made it into deep Russia because the partisans really, so they tried to bomb us out.</span> <span id="s688">They tried, they kept on constantly bombing.</span> <span id="s689">And in one of these bombings we ran and I lost my father.</span> <span id="s690">I lost my father.</span> <span id="s691">I was one who always was running in the front for some reason.</span> <span id="s692">And my father, he was only thirty-six years old so he still was a young man, but for some reason, I was younger of course, and I lost him.</span> <span id="s693">I lost him and I couldn't find him.</span> <span id="s694">And we passed by a river.</span> <span id="s695">We passed by a river, I was like in the front.</span> <span id="s696">The partisans, what they did, in order for the other to cross the river, because it was really burning and bombing heavily, they put like ropes.</span> <span id="s697">Some partisans swam through and they put a rope and two ropes on this side and this is how you pass the river.</span> <span id="s698">A few of them passed, it was, of course, I think it must have been a very, very hard thing to do, and having partisans with ammunition.</span> <span id="s699">I got hold of this thing and I started to walk over, they grabbed me and they wanted to pull me back.</span> <span id="s700">I didn't let myself and I knew my father was like a few feet in the back of me someplace and I started to pass by and the bombing got closer and closer and they dropped the ropes and I fell into the river.</span> <span id="s701">But I was already not in the middle of the deep river, I was like closer on the way out.</span> <span id="s702">And they saw me falling into the river.</span> <span id="s703">I fell into the river.</span> <span id="s704">There's some Russian soldiers, the Chinese I guess from, they called them in those years, I remember, Ta-tongs (ph), I don't know how you call them now.</span> <span id="s705">They schlepped me out, they pulled me out.</span> <span id="s706">And of course I had nothing with me, whatever I had, clothing on, but they pulled me out and I was trying myself to be close to them.</span> <span id="s707">I saw that they took off, I don't have my father, I'm either 14 or 15 years of age, skinny like a toothpick, you know?</span> <span id="s708">That's it, this is the end of me.</span> <span id="s709">And my father didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s710">He knew that I am in the water someplace, so he said, "I'm not going."</span> <span id="s711">They said, "Well, you're daughter's dead.</span> <span id="s712">I saw her falling."</span> <span id="s713">Which is true, they saw me falling in, he said, "Forget about it."</span> <span id="s714">I have a blouse from this incident, and he said, "No, you're daughter's not alive.</span> <span id="s715">You're daughter fall into the water and who's going to save her?</span> <span id="s716">Who's going to take care of her?</span> <span id="s717">She fell into the water.</span> <span id="s718">She got drowned.</span> <span id="s719">She's dead."</span> <span id="s720">But I didn't.</span> <span id="s721">I, these two Ta-tong (ph) from deep Russia, they really took care of me.</span> <span id="s722">They really took care of me.</span> <span id="s723">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s724">They, I gave them haircuts.</span> <span id="s725">I also was working with the partisans with the machine, they had a machine and shaving, so they needed me in a way.</span> <span id="s726">And they really took care of me.</span> <span id="s727">They really took care of me.</span> <span id="s728">If they were stealing some food, because the partisans, the group fell apart.</span> <span id="s729">The majority group was left behind.</span> <span id="s730">I was with just about a dozen people, maybe two dozen people.</span> <span id="s731">Nobody wanted to take care of me, to give me a piece of bread, nothing.</span> <span id="s732">But these two particular people, they just felt sorry for me.</span> <span id="s733">Whatever they got they shared with me.</span> <span id="s734">And one night we were laying there in the bushes, it was cold already, it was close to winter.</span> <span id="s735">All of a sudden somebody stretching like that, I said, Oy-vey, what am I going to do now?</span> <span id="s736">It's going to, and he's sort of laying completely like, freezing.</span> <span id="s737">They took off their jackets, he covered me.</span> <span id="s738">He covered me with whatever he had, his jacket.</span> <span id="s739">There's some good people in this world, there really are good people.</span> <span id="s740">And then I walked with them, I held on to them and they were watching me.</span> <span id="s741">Until the other group of the partisans, the bombing stopped and we got reunited.</span> <span id="s742">But my father couldn't find me, he really couldn't find me.</span> <span id="s743">Do you want to hear the story, how he found me again?</span> <span id="s744">And we walked and we walked and there was a, you walk daytime, nighttime and you stay hidden, and these two people shared with me they're piece of bread.</span> <span id="s745">There was not really a partisan here.</span> <span id="s746">The real partisans were left behind.</span> <span id="s747">And we came to a town and I was with them and there was a doctor, not a doctor, it was a felcher (ph), a doctor.</span> <span id="s748">And people started to get sick on typhus, stomach typhus.</span> <span id="s749">I was the only girl.</span> <span id="s750">I wouldn't say a woman, I wasn't a woman, the only girl.</span> <span id="s751">And this doctor said to me, he said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s752">I'm going to show you how to take care a little bit of sick people."</span> <span id="s753">People started to get sick on the typhus, they were just dying under you're hands, under you're feet.</span> <span id="s754">He said, "This town is from partisans, it's a partisan town.</span> <span id="s755">Let's see what."</span> <span id="s756">And some other partisans came and I was with this doctor and he was telling me how to put a bandage on, how to give him, there was no medications, there's some tea.</span> <span id="s757">And we weren't, and the bombing started again.</span> <span id="s758">This was already a few weeks later.</span> <span id="s759">And the bombing started again.</span> <span id="s760">And a bomb, I was with the typhus people, I got sick on typhus.</span> <span id="s761">I got sick on typhus and the temperature was running high and then when the, and they were laying on bridges kind of, soldiers.</span> <span id="s762">Some dead, some alive, some dead, some alive.</span> <span id="s763">And I put myself at the very, very end.</span> <span id="s764">They were not allowed to touch me really because it was against the law.</span> <span id="s765">So I was, and then there were so many young, beautiful women, young women, in the towns that, you know, look at me?</span> <span id="s766">There's no woman, there was nothing.</span> <span id="s767">There was a skin and bone little girl.</span> <span id="s768">And they were not allowed.</span> <span id="s769">So I slept like against the wall most of the time but with the rest of the people, they were sick on typhus.</span> <span id="s770">And I got it, I got it.</span> <span id="s771">And I started to, I remember once they even brought, they flew down from Moscow, packages of medications.</span> <span id="s772">They had connections with Moscow.</span> <span id="s773">And laying there and they put out all the sick people, outside.</span> <span id="s774">Bombing started again.</span> <span id="s775">And they schlepped, we schlepped all the sick people out, they put them outside in barns, some dead, some alive.</span> <span id="s776">I was crawling a little bit and this house was burning and I got out of the house and I was laying in the back of the house.</span> <span id="s777">And the house is already on fire and I was laying there to die.</span> <span id="s778">All of a sudden, my father's here.</span> <span id="s779">It's just like a miracle, a real miracle.</span> <span id="s780">How did you get here?</span> <span id="s781">When they were walking from the other side of the river and then they crossed the river and then they came, the bombing stopped, and then when the bombing started again and the town was burning, he kept on yelling, "I had a daughter someplace, I had a daughter someplace.</span> <span id="s782">Maybe you saw a little girl?"</span> <span id="s783">And they kept on telling him, maybe she's here, maybe she's there, maybe it's in this house.</span> <span id="s784">And until he came where I was laying under this building.</span> <span id="s785">But I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s786">I was like dead, half-dead.</span> <span id="s787">He schlepped me, he put me on his back.</span> <span id="s788">This was just before the liberation I guess, this must have been like six months before the liberation.</span> <span id="s789">And we had bombing and bombing and the partisans more or less had started to fall apart.</span> <span id="s790">But we belonged to the group yet, and they wanted to kill me, the partisans.</span> <span id="s791">He was schlepping me on his back and he said, "Well, if you drop her and any Germans get her, she might talk a little bit.</span> <span id="s792">Maybe she knows anything, I mean, she knows something."</span> <span id="s793">And they just wanted to kill me.</span> <span id="s794">And I heard that, I wasn't unconscious.</span> <span id="s795">Maybe sometimes.</span> <span id="s796">And he said, "No, you will not kill my daughter.</span> <span id="s797">If you want to kill her, first you have to kill me so I wouldn't know it.</span> <span id="s798">Then you could kill my daughter."</span> <span id="s799">And they didn't.</span> <span id="s800">And he schlepped me, he schlepped me on his back.</span> <span id="s801">I was walking with a big, not a cane, but a big stick of wood, and after the liberation yet I was walking with that stick.</span> <span id="s802">I couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s803">And this is how he saved my life.</span> <span id="s804">We were liberated not far from So-you-sk (ph).</span> <span id="s805">When we got there, there was no government at all yet.</span> <span id="s806">They didn't have any government yet.</span> <span id="s807">But there were no Jews yet.</span> <span id="s808">There was, for about three or four days, there was no government at all.</span> <span id="s809">It was like, the Germans took off and the Russians came in and there was no government yet.</span> <span id="s810">And finally I guess the government got organized, the Russians, and they.</span> <span id="s811">I remember walking with this stick, with my father's help of course, and there was telephone poles and on every pole there was hanging a German with his head down.</span> <span id="s812">On every pole.</span> <span id="s813">I don't know if I should tell this or not.</span> <span id="s814">On every pole.</span> <span id="s815">The partisans cut some Germans or some peasants that were involved, who was a policeman and he killed Jews or he was a policeman and killed partisans, who was a guy who was with the Germans, you know?</span> <span id="s816">They caught him and they hung him up.</span> <span id="s817">They were hanging.</span> <span id="s818">I remember when we came to Sloo-sk (ph) that was the first day I think, but we just walked in there and they had caught some Germans, the partisans I guess, Germans, Poles, the others who were involved in the German government, and they threw them all, certain things I remember well, certain things I don't, I just don't remember, but this I remember.</span> <span id="s819">They put them like in one, big mountain of people, living people, alive.</span> <span id="s820">They were crawling on each other like worms.</span> <span id="s821">Some wounded, some healthy.</span> <span id="s822">And the partisans said to my father, they said to him, "You know what?</span> <span id="s823">You have this rifle.</span> <span id="s824">Why don't you hit them?</span> <span id="s825">Hit them in there.</span> <span id="s826">Give them for you're wife, for you're son.</span> <span id="s827">Give it to them."</span> <span id="s828">My father gave one hit and he passed out.</span> <span id="s829">He can't do it.</span> <span id="s830">So they said, "Come on, how about you?</span> <span id="s831">You're a young girl."</span> <span id="s832">I must have been close to 16.</span> <span id="s833">"For you're father, for you're mother.</span> <span id="s834">You were there.</span> <span id="s835">You saw them doing that to you."</span> <span id="s836">I couldn't, I was like numb.</span> <span id="s837">I looked at this.</span> <span id="s838">I got sick to my stomach, I started to throw up.</span> <span id="s839">I couldn't hit one German.</span> <span id="s840">I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s841">And then my father got to his feet, he passed out.</span> <span id="s842">He gave one hit and he couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s843">These are Jews.</span> <span id="s844">Jews are not fighters.</span> <span id="s845">Thank God now, their Fathers in Israel, thank God.</span> <span id="s846">But those years were just, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s847">What they did to me, what I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s848">This is just a fraction of my story, what I saw when it was burning.</span> <span id="s849">I got caught once, I ran, I walked out of the ghetto and I was going to my house.</span> <span id="s850">I got out, I just sneaked out.</span> <span id="s851">And I asked for some food.</span> <span id="s852">On the way back they didn't give me.</span> <span id="s853">On the way back, I passed by a garden and I was, maybe I took out a few scallions there, I don't know.</span> <span id="s854">They caught me.</span> <span id="s855">They beat the Hell out of me.</span> <span id="s856">They threw me back into the ghetto, they could have killed me on the spot.</span> <span id="s857">They threw me back into the ghetto with a swollen face, beat up.</span> <span id="s858">Not the Germans beat me up, the Poles.</span> <span id="s859">And here I couldn't hit one German.</span> <span id="s860">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s861">My father couldn't, he gave one hit and he passed out.</span> <span id="s862">There is Jewish people for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Let's talk a little bit about how you got to the DP camps and what they were like?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Well we were liberated in Swoot-ska (ph) and my father was always a Yiddishist and he said, "Well let's go to my home town."</span> <span id="s865">He met a woman in Slot-skol-sa (ph) and we knew that my mother's dead, and we went to my hometown and then he went to a bigger town in Pinske (ph) to look for some more Jews.</span> <span id="s866">Pinske (ph), in Pinske (ph) a few people survived, not too many people.</span> <span id="s867">And another town by the name of Wo-nin-yetz (ph) and they were talking, there was the hagga-nah (ph) and there was the Brig-ha (ph) sneaking and looking and trying to organize Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s868">My father, I really don't know how he found out about it, he found out about it and he got in touch with some people and he said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s869">There is a way, they are going to take us to Israel from here.</span> <span id="s870">There is the Bra-han (ph), the Haga-nan (ph), other Israeli organizations.</span> <span id="s871">And they are going to somehow get us out of here and we're going to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s872">My father had two sisters and a brother in America.</span> <span id="s873">But he didn't remember the address, he didn't remember nothing.</span> <span id="s874">I mean, he lost everything that was left in the house before we went into ghetto.</span> <span id="s875">And there was no way of getting in touch.</span> <span id="s876">But with the Hagga-na (ph), Abra-ha (ph), I really don't know which one it was, they organized the left over Jews who ever survived.</span> <span id="s877">And they were going to send us, we had to go I think to Bialystok, to some organizer.</span> <span id="s878">This was the main place where they tried to get some Jewish names and Jewish people and he went there and he registered kind of there and then he came back, this I remember, and then we went, they smuggled us, it was 1945 yet.</span> <span id="s879">We were liberated in 1944, in Sou-lska (ph), a year before the regular liberation.</span> <span id="s880">And they smuggled us as Greek Jews to Lodz.</span> <span id="s881">We came to Lodz, very well organized, they put us in a Kibbutz (ph) being we were partisans and soldiers.</span> <span id="s882">They put us in a camp by the name of Ba-hack (ph).</span> <span id="s883">It was not a camp really, it was more like a group.</span> <span id="s884">And we came there and were registered there, they brought us there.</span> <span id="s885">I think they gave us papers . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s886">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: This is interview with Florence Eisen, tape 2.</span> <span id="s889">Okay, we were just talking about after liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s891">And from there they smuggled us in, we're not allowed to speak any other language but Hebrew, I guess.</span> <span id="s892">I was the only one who knew a little Hebrew, how to speak Hebrew.</span> <span id="s893">But by then already my father remarried.</span> <span id="s894">He got married in Swiss government, a Jewish woman with a child.</span> <span id="s895">More or less my age, so we were the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: Who was she?</span> <span id="s897">How did he meet her and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: He met her in Swoo-sk (ph), he met her in Swoo-sk (ph) right after the liberation.</span> <span id="s899">Some Jews started to come in from every part of Russia.</span> <span id="s900">They came from, she was born and raised in Swoo-sk (ph) but in the war her husband got killed right away, I guess, they killed him.</span> <span id="s901">And they kind of, I don't know how they got to deep Russia.</span> <span id="s902">But after the war, it was not after the war the war was still going on for a whole year, but in that area, in Swoo-sk (ph) the war was over.</span> <span id="s903">So she came with her daughter, also a son but the son was in the army, and my father was a young man, thirty-six years old, a lonely person with a child, and he met her.</span> <span id="s904">She just came from, I think she was around Moscow someplace, and he met her.</span> <span id="s905">And she was also a young woman, lonely.</span> <span id="s906">And they got married there.</span> <span id="s907">She knew that my mother's dead, I mean, they knew my mother is dead.</span> <span id="s908">And he married her.</span> <span id="s909">So we were like four of us.</span> <span id="s910">She wasn't a good stepmother.</span> <span id="s911">She was a mean stepmother to me, like in the books.</span> <span id="s912">I had another war with her.</span> <span id="s913">This woman really didn't give me to eat, that's how mean she was to me.</span> <span id="s914">Let her rest in peace now.</span> <span id="s915">And she, we traveled from Lodz through Czechoslovakia, through Germany, into a displaced camp not far from Munich by the name of Poke-ing (ph).</span> <span id="s916">They brought us there, they gave us clothes, they sanitized us, they cleaned us up.</span> <span id="s917">We were clean already more or less, more or less we were clean.</span> <span id="s918">And they start to give us, it was an organized camp for misplaced people.</span> <span id="s919">They gave us packages of food.</span> <span id="s920">And they started to leave, more or less, they gave us a room.</span> <span id="s921">It was like a barracks and like little rooms, so they gave us a small room.</span> <span id="s922">They gave us enough food.</span> <span id="s923">And, of course, my father always had a profession, he was a barber.</span> <span id="s924">So he started right away to work in the camp as a barber.</span> <span id="s925">We were free already, of course, and we were there.</span> <span id="s926">We came in 1946 in January and we left and they closed this misplaced, the DP camp, they became like in 1948.</span> <span id="s927">I got married there, met my husband there, got married there, had a nice wedding.</span> <span id="s928">But then when Po-king (ph) got closed, they send us to another camp by the name of Feldafing where my son was born, my son was born there in Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: How many people were in the camp?</span> <span id="s930">Were there many other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: It was a big camp, yeah.</span> <span id="s932">Whoever had survived.</span> <span id="s933">I mean, they get at us, they took us to a place in Mechelen and Saltzheim (ph) and they ________ at us, I guess they sent other people to different camps too, but this was all organized from Israel.</span> <span id="s934">Hagga-nah (ph), Abra-ha (ph), I'm not sure which group did it, but that was well, also from Hi-yas (ph) already, we were supported from the Hi-yas (ph) from the United States.</span> <span id="s935">They found us, my father's two sisters.</span> <span id="s936">Unfortunately the brother just died when we came, but the two sisters they found out for us.</span> <span id="s937">It was, the food and everything, the clothing and food was mainly through the Had-dasa (ph), Hi-yas (ph), excuse me, not Had-dasa (ph), Hi-yas (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: And what did people do during the day?</span> <span id="s939">What did people occupy themselves with?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: What did people do?</span> <span id="s941">We start to get organized, like I knew like a little Hebrew.</span> <span id="s942">There was kitchens.</span> <span id="s943">That there were cooks and brought in food and whoever didn't have any food to eat, you came there, you ate in the kitchen, in the __________ kitchen.</span> <span id="s944">Or like we had like a family, my stepmother and my father, they gave us care packages and my stepmother cooked for us.</span> <span id="s945">My father is being a barber.</span> <span id="s946">He started to work right away as a barber.</span> <span id="s947">There were organized, they start to organize like schools for children.</span> <span id="s948">I was like a kindergarten so I was teaching, I was talking, I had to talk Hebrew to the kids and I knew some Hebrew so I spoke Hebrew to the children.</span> <span id="s949">I have pictures, I have a picture from it.</span> <span id="s950">And I guess whoever was a tailor and whoever was a shoemaker, everybody started to reorganize their lives a little bit, in that camp even.</span> <span id="s951">We had, next door to us, we had a Club with music and the young kids use to go dancing there, next door.</span> <span id="s952">We were liberated, we were free.</span> <span id="s953">We were already free.</span> <span id="s954">And this was, and we start to correspond with my father's two sisters.</span> <span id="s955">They send me packages, clothing, food, money.</span> <span id="s956">We had enough food.</span> <span id="s957">And we were there from about 1946 of January.</span> <span id="s958">In March my husband came with his group and we met and we were courting for over three years.</span> <span id="s959">And in 1948 we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: How did you meet you're husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: You know, the Jews somehow they are, they know how to live and they are survivors.</span> <span id="s962">So as soon as we got there it was a group like actors and I wanted to be an actress.</span> <span id="s963">So I went over there and I said, well I could dance, I could sing, take me in, this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s964">And they put up a show, there was like 7,000 Jews maybe in that camp.</span> <span id="s965">A show, _________ ___________, an old, old Jewish show.</span> <span id="s966">And they gave me a part in the other, interviewed me, this guy and they gave me a part in there.</span> <span id="s967">So they put up like a _________ ___________ and after the show, there was dancing.</span> <span id="s968">So I was in the show.</span> <span id="s969">I played my part and after the show I washed my face, whatever the make-up was on, and I went down and was dancing.</span> <span id="s970">And this young man came over to me and asked me to dance.</span> <span id="s971">I said okay.</span> <span id="s972">And once or twice, we were both very good dancers, and this is how we met.</span> <span id="s973">And we never left each other again.</span> <span id="s974">It was just instant love, instant love.</span> <span id="s975">And that's how we met and we were going steady, and then when they closed the camp, I got married there.</span> <span id="s976">We went to, they sent us to a camp, I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s977">They send us to a camp by the name of Fohrenwald.</span> <span id="s978">I was there, I gave birth there.</span> <span id="s979">Meantime, the family of my father, the two sisters, especially one sister, was working we should come to America.</span> <span id="s980">She just wanted us in America, it's a good country and she wanted everybody.</span> <span id="s981">She wanted her brother, his wife and stepsister, me, my husband.</span> <span id="s982">But my father didn't tell them that I got married.</span> <span id="s983">So they send us, at that it was affidavits, it was not contracts yet, it was affidavits.</span> <span id="s984">They made up papers and they were going to take us from Po-king (ph) to America.</span> <span id="s985">But meantime I got married and I put another name on the contract, on the, later on it was contracts, affidavits, whatever.</span> <span id="s986">And then, all of a sudden, I got pregnant.</span> <span id="s987">And they had to put somebody else on it, on the, so anyway, when we moved to Fohrenwald they, my stepsister, she says she doesn't want to go to America.</span> <span id="s988">She doesn't want to go to America.</span> <span id="s989">She got up and she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s990">She went to Israel and my father's sister started, I shouldn't go to Israel.</span> <span id="s991">I should come to America.</span> <span id="s992">They didn't have any children.</span> <span id="s993">They wanted me as a child, they will do for me, they'll give me, they'll give my husband a good job.</span> <span id="s994">He had no profession, he was 21 years old when he married me, he had no profession.</span> <span id="s995">We had no skills.</span> <span id="s996">I was already with a baby.</span> <span id="s997">We took some lessons in camp, in English, how much do we know English?</span> <span id="s998">Yes or no, maybe thank you, that's about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s999">But my stepmother, being her daughter, at that time it wasn't legal to go yet, being that the daughter's already in Israel, she wants to go to Israel too.</span> <span id="s1000">So she schlepped my father to Israel.</span> <span id="s1001">This was in 1948, must have been the end of 1948 because I got married the end of August, and a month later they left to Israel.</span> <span id="s1002">So he saw what was going on there, bad.</span> <span id="s1003">Mo-mish (ph) people were starving and the wars and he kept on writing letters, please my kin (ph) don't come here.</span> <span id="s1004">I know you don't want to be without me, all those years, but now it’s a different world, it’s a free world.</span> <span id="s1005">You're going to see, I never wanted to leave my father for one day.</span> <span id="s1006">It's _________ in the partisans, there were a few children and when the plane came, they wanted to take them to Moscow.</span> <span id="s1007">I said, I'm not going.</span> <span id="s1008">Either I'll live with my father or I'm going to die with my father.</span> <span id="s1009">They left, they went to Moscow by plane, they took them.</span> <span id="s1010">I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s1011">I said, no way am I going without my father.</span> <span id="s1012">Whatever it will be it will happen to the two of us.</span> <span id="s1013">I'm not leaving my father.</span> <span id="s1014">So he said to me, "It's not the partisans, it's not the war.</span> <span id="s1015">The war is over.</span> <span id="s1016">Go to my sister's.</span> <span id="s1017">You'll have a good life.</span> <span id="s1018">You'll come here with a husband who has no skills, who does not know a word of English.</span> <span id="s1019">Believe me, we are starving.</span> <span id="s1020">There's no apartments.</span> <span id="s1021">You can't get an apartment.</span> <span id="s1022">He doesn’t have a profession.</span> <span id="s1023">I have a profession.</span> <span id="s1024">I could work as a barber, but you're husband doesn't have a profession.</span> <span id="s1025">He has nothing."</span> <span id="s1026">Anyway, I let him, he said, "If you're coming over I'm going to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1027">And then you're not going to have a father all together.</span> <span id="s1028">Go to America."</span> <span id="s1029">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s1030">They send, but then already the contracts came in.</span> <span id="s1031">They send the affidavits and they made affidavits for me, for my husband and for my son.</span> <span id="s1032">Then they had to re-do it because by the time the affidavits came my son was born and they had to change everything around again, you know?</span> <span id="s1033">And I said, well, let's go to America.</span> <span id="s1034">My husband had a family there, they didn't want him to go to America either.</span> <span id="s1035">Because they were going to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1036">My mother-in-law had two sisters in Israel.</span> <span id="s1037">So we were kind of written aside, I won the case.</span> <span id="s1038">And we went to America.</span> <span id="s1039">It just turned out that I took my husband's whole family to America.</span> <span id="s1040">A year later his brother came with his wife and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1041">And a year later, two-and-a-half years later, we took over his mother, she still stayed in Fohrenwald and his married sister with her two children and a husband.</span> <span id="s1042">So I won the case.</span> <span id="s1043">I took them all to America.</span> <span id="s1044">Think that I'm no sorry, it's a beautiful country, we've had a good life here.</span> <span id="s1045">My husband works hard.</span> <span id="s1046">And then my father, after quite a few years, her daughter went to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1047">She got married in Israel and her daughter went to Montreal and I couldn't being him here yet.</span> <span id="s1048">So she took him to Montreal.</span> <span id="s1049">Unfortunately he died when he was too young, he died of cancer, he was fifty-six years old.</span> <span id="s1050">But the time came that I could have enjoyed my father and be with him and give him a little na-has (ph), he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Before we talk about life in America, just again, the camps.</span> <span id="s1052">How much was it, like, did it feel at all like a sort of like a real life?</span> <span id="s1053">You said there were classes, there were schools, there were dances, there were plays.</span> <span id="s1054">How was it like a, how do you kind of build back a life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: To me I knew it's not a real life yet, but it was good.</span> <span id="s1056">It was heaven.</span> <span id="s1057">I had enough food.</span> <span id="s1058">I had friends.</span> <span id="s1059">Now I remember my friends, and the rest of the friends I just block out, I remember nothing.</span> <span id="s1060">But in camp, in Po-king (ph) it was a good life for us.</span> <span id="s1061">It was, but we weren't, if we had from 1939 until 1946 already it was, it was already after the war, it was heaven.</span> <span id="s1062">They gave us the hi-yas (ph) and there's enough packages, enough food.</span> <span id="s1063">It was kitchens, whoever couldn't cook for themselves they took care of us, they give us clothing.</span> <span id="s1064">It was a life.</span> <span id="s1065">What we had in the war, this was a good life.</span> <span id="s1066">Some people from, survivors, they went to towns, they went to business even there, they got married there.</span> <span id="s1067">I mean, like in Minute-hen (ph), Deblin, and those big cities, some of them got re-established there too but my father was a, had a job and this was his profession and we went to this camp and we had it pretty good.</span> <span id="s1068">But we knew that sooner or later we would have to go.</span> <span id="s1069">This is not a place to finish, to make a life, the rest of our lives.</span> <span id="s1070">It was, mainly it was Israel.</span> <span id="s1071">Mainly our aim was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1072">But being of his two sisters and alarming and coming and being, he was there before me and life was tough and life was hard and life was really hard, you know?</span> <span id="s1073">So we said good-bye and life in camp wasn't a ________ ________ camp.</span> <span id="s1074">Everybody had enough food to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: What did people talk about in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: It depends.</span> <span id="s1077">We came out like from cages.</span> <span id="s1078">That's all we wanted to do, is have a good time.</span> <span id="s1079">We went to work, we came back from work.</span> <span id="s1080">I was working as a, first I was working as a Hebrew teacher, no, first I was working in a place where they use to make, it’s a factory you call it.</span> <span id="s1081">They use to make little sweaters and gloves for American, this was done through the Hi-yas (ph).</span> <span id="s1082">So I knitted, being I knew how to knit, I knitted the little scarves, sweaters, little boots, gloves, and this was sent to America.</span> <span id="s1083">Where it was, I think to Texas someplace, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1084">So, for this we worked and every week we got a care package for that.</span> <span id="s1085">No money.</span> <span id="s1086">Just a care package of food we got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: So we were just talking about working and the daily life in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Yes, and the daily life, we as children, we had some friends.</span> <span id="s1089">Once or twice a week we went dancing.</span> <span id="s1090">We belonged to this kibbutz (ph), Ba-hach (ph), which it was for leftover partisans and soldiers.</span> <span id="s1091">As a matter of fact, they send us, being I knew a little Hebrew, they send a group of us to a different camp, Ba-drack-en-hive (ph) to organize.</span> <span id="s1092">It was also a DP, there for misplaced people.</span> <span id="s1093">They send us to re-organize Ba-hach (ph), to open up a new kibbutz (ph) and that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1094">As a matter of fact with some of the people I am still friendly up until now.</span> <span id="s1095">Lovely people, intelligent people.</span> <span id="s1096">We were there for almost a year.</span> <span id="s1097">And then that group, they send him to Israel and I didn't want to go and they wounded up in the Cypress, and I went back home to my father, in Po-king (ph).</span> <span id="s1098">It was, for a DP camp it was a pretty good life what we went through.</span> <span id="s1099">Food, we had.</span> <span id="s1100">Clothing, we had.</span> <span id="s1101">We went dancing.</span> <span id="s1102">The Ha-yass (ph) took care of us.</span> <span id="s1103">I had family in America, they send me packages.</span> <span id="s1104">But our aim was to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1105">This was our aim, is to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1106">But being for my father's two sisters, they were yelling and screaming, we should come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: And you were saying before that in the camps, people mostly talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: They talked about the past.</span> <span id="s1109">They were still looking if anybody survived.</span> <span id="s1110">They were still looking if anybody, someplace survived.</span> <span id="s1111">So they use to go to different misplaced camps and look around there.</span> <span id="s1112">They were looking, they were looking for family.</span> <span id="s1113">There was one from here, one from ten people, one from seven people, mostly from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1114">Most of them.</span> <span id="s1115">With the numbers.</span> <span id="s1116">And what could they talk?</span> <span id="s1117">What we went through, and now what are we going to do now with our future?</span> <span id="s1118">What we going to do now?</span> <span id="s1119">And broken up families.</span> <span id="s1120">If there was a family.</span> <span id="s1121">My father made a family because he married that woman and she had a child, and me, we were like a family.</span> <span id="s1122">But most it was like one person, one person, one person.</span> <span id="s1123">Brother and sister?</span> <span id="s1124">Not too many.</span> <span id="s1125">Unless people who came from Russia, who had a few families where they came from deep Russia and they were like a few families together.</span> <span id="s1126">But most of them, they were lonely, lonely people who tried to find a mate and get married and have a, to be with somebody, not to be lonely.</span> <span id="s1127">Even some men who didn't know if the wife survived and they got married and then the wife came, from someplace, who knows where?</span> <span id="s1128">There was trouble in this area.</span> <span id="s1129">But we were two young kids with my father, my stepmother and we had like a little home, you know?</span> <span id="s1130">In one room.</span> <span id="s1131">And then we went dancing, we were laughing, we were playing cards, it was a pretty normal life in this DP camp, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Did people have much information about what had happened to their families or their neighbors or their towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: They did and they didn't.</span> <span id="s1134">It still was unbelievable that something like this could have happened.</span> <span id="s1135">I went home, I knew what happened to my mother and my sister and my brother.</span> <span id="s1136">I knew it because the peasants told us.</span> <span id="s1137">They were watching.</span> <span id="s1138">And from this side of the ghetto nobody survived, nobody.</span> <span id="s1139">From the other side where it was the uprising, like me, survives.</span> <span id="s1140">And some other people survived.</span> <span id="s1141">500 people run out of that area.</span> <span id="s1142">But survive?</span> <span id="s1143">Maybe 125.</span> <span id="s1144">Some of them got starved from hunger, some of them got killed, some of them got killed in the partisans.</span> <span id="s1145">Some of them got lost.</span> <span id="s1146">Some of them remained in Russia.</span> <span id="s1147">But the majority of people of my hometown went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1148">The majority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: So let's talk about coming to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: So this was my life in Germany.</span> <span id="s1151">Got married there and then right away I got pregnant and I had a little boy, which was like a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s1152">I just, a miracle.</span> <span id="s1153">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1154">As a matter of fact, when I got pregnant I was only 20.</span> <span id="s1155">I was 20 when I got married.</span> <span id="s1156">And I went to this doctor, the German doctor, and he said to me, "You are pregnant."</span> <span id="s1157">I said, "Well, yeah I'm married and now I'm pregnant."</span> <span id="s1158">And he said, "You shouldn't have gotten pregnant, you're not even developed yet.</span> <span id="s1159">You're not a woman, you're a child."</span> <span id="s1160">I didn't even have, excuse me, my period normal yet.</span> <span id="s1161">I was 19 and I still wasn't normal.</span> <span id="s1162">So he said, "You'll never have this child.</span> <span id="s1163">I don't know what's going to happen to you but you shouldn't have gotten pregnant."</span> <span id="s1164">I had a tough time, I really had a tough time.</span> <span id="s1165">In this country I would have had a cesarean, but then they schlepped them out, they ripped me apart, ripped me in pieces.</span> <span id="s1166">He was born in a camp by the name of Fohrenwald and I was four days in labor.</span> <span id="s1167">This doctor was right, I wasn't developed, I just didn't grow as a woman.</span> <span id="s1168">I was still, I was undernourished.</span> <span id="s1169">I'll give you, food was good but it wasn't such a vitamins and such, good food.</span> <span id="s1170">Even in the DP camp, like we had the cans of Spam, cans of, it wasn't the right food for a child to eat and the right vitamin food, you know?</span> <span id="s1171">But then, of course, we got the papers and we immigrated to America, the three of us.</span> <span id="s1172">Me and my husband and my son.</span> <span id="s1173">As a matter of fact, my Uncle, they paid up that we shouldn't go by boat so he paid up to fly in here.</span> <span id="s1174">We should fly to America.</span> <span id="s1175">When we got here the Ha-yass (ph) gave us back the money.</span> <span id="s1176">And we stayed, we came the three of us, without language, without real clothing, without knowledge of anything.</span> <span id="s1177">I mean, just young.</span> <span id="s1178">Very young.</span> <span id="s1179">My husband was 21 and I was 20-something, not even 21 when I gave birth to him.</span> <span id="s1180">And we stayed with my Uncle and my Aunt, they were pretty good to us.</span> <span id="s1181">It was my father's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: It was in the Bronx, East Bronx, Franklin Avenue.</span> <span id="s1184">But to me it was heaven.</span> <span id="s1185">As meager everything was and we lived with them and to me it was, I was free.</span> <span id="s1186">But I had a problem sleeping.</span> <span id="s1187">I heard the plane and I was flying but when I heard a plane I was flying out the window.</span> <span id="s1188">This was going on for years, for years.</span> <span id="s1189">And I tried not to think and I, whatever, for some reason the bombing made such a big impact on me, left me with such a, I was terrified for planes, terrified.</span> <span id="s1190">I didn't fly for many, many years.</span> <span id="s1191">Though I flew in here.</span> <span id="s1192">But I was like, I had like anxiety, when I heard the plane fly I had an anxiety attack.</span> <span id="s1193">And I was flying through the window.</span> <span id="s1194">I was cold, I was relaxed, when we started to go to the _________ colonies.</span> <span id="s1195">When I was in the woods and I could run, it's like, always I could hide and run in the woods.</span> <span id="s1196">I was not safe in a building.</span> <span id="s1197">I was afraid of buildings.</span> <span id="s1198">I was afraid of planes, of the bombing.</span> <span id="s1199">Because they tried to bomb us out a lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s1200">And this was my, I got anxiety attacks.</span> <span id="s1201">I almost got killed if my husband wouldn't have grabbed me, I would be out the window, flying out the window.</span> <span id="s1202">The only time I felt good, I felt relaxed, when I was in the country, in the __________, in the _________ __________, I was in the woods and I saw the trees and I knew I could run.</span> <span id="s1203">I mean, it was still in my mind, of running.</span> <span id="s1204">I'm going to run, I'm going to run, I'm going to run.</span> <span id="s1205">Though I was safe but I wasn't safe psychologically.</span> <span id="s1206">I just couldn't, I couldn't, it was still in my mind, I'm going to run.</span> <span id="s1207">That's it.</span> <span id="s1208">For many, many, many years.</span> <span id="s1209">Many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: What did you and you're husband do when you first got here?</span> <span id="s1211">Work?</span> <span id="s1212">Did you find an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Well we got here.</span> <span id="s1214">My family picked us up.</span> <span id="s1215">We stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1216">It was very hard in 1949, it was very hard to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s1217">It was impossible to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s1218">So we lived with my Uncle and Aunt, they took us in.</span> <span id="s1219">They had a private house on Franklin Avenue.</span> <span id="s1220">We live with them.</span> <span id="s1221">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s1222">They gave us a little spending money.</span> <span id="s1223">And then we knew there was a ha-yass (ph).</span> <span id="s1224">My husband use to go, I had a baby already, and he start to go to school, learn the language, went to ha-yass (ph), got some information.</span> <span id="s1225">They tried to give him a job but he had no skills.</span> <span id="s1226">So he was, I had a cousin who was a painter, he painted apartments.</span> <span id="s1227">He gave him a job as a painter.</span> <span id="s1228">But before that he was a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1229">He didn't know how to keep a hammer in his hand, he was a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1230">Then they put him, he got a job, it was Moisher's (ph) Supermarket.</span> <span id="s1231">He got a job there in Moisher's (ph) Supermarket, he use to put the cans on the shelves.</span> <span id="s1232">And then my cousin took him in as a, to teach him how to paint, paint apartments.</span> <span id="s1233">He was very good at that, once he learned how to paint, and he learned and he painted and he made some money.</span> <span id="s1234">We stayed with my family for six months, with my Aunt and Uncle.</span> <span id="s1235">And then they got us an apartment, also not far from Franklin Avenue, I remember the address, 638 Catona Park South, East Bronx.</span> <span id="s1236">They got us an apartment.</span> <span id="s1237">My family paid $600.00 under the table to get me this apartment.</span> <span id="s1238">But they were very nice, they were not poor people, and they got us this apartment, came with some furniture.</span> <span id="s1239">And my Uncle bought me a brand new bedroom set, I'll never forget, if I would have that set now it's an antique.</span> <span id="s1240">I could have made a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1241">So I, beautiful two-bedroom apartment, it was on the second floor, two bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1242">But the rent was expensive, $42.50 a month.</span> <span id="s1243">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s1244">A lot of _________ came in there and there's one single guy who I knew him from Po-king (ph).</span> <span id="s1245">I rented to him as a boarder.</span> <span id="s1246">So he lived, I rented the apartment to him and he gave me like, $25.00 or $30.00 a month, so that was a big help with paying rent.</span> <span id="s1247">And then a year later, to me it was heaven on earth.</span> <span id="s1248">If I could go to ________ Avenue shopping, buy food, I didn't have to buy expensive food, in those years we didn't know about cholesterol, but if I could make them a chicken, three meals, which I did, I was always a big with bala-boosta (ph).</span> <span id="s1249">I learned from my stepmother, she was a _________ bala-boosta (ph).</span> <span id="s1250">From my Aunts.</span> <span id="s1251">And I didn't know how to cook, but I learned.</span> <span id="s1252">I wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s1253">I wanted to take care of my family.</span> <span id="s1254">And I loved every minute of it, from the day I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1255">Because I was free.</span> <span id="s1256">I was free, except when I was on the plane flight, I was free.</span> <span id="s1257">And I had food, I had enough food.</span> <span id="s1258">I had my own refrigerator of food.</span> <span id="s1259">I opened up and I bought bread and milk and I baked cakes and I went out with my kid to the park and, I was afraid to go.</span> <span id="s1260">I was looking with kind of a, I was always suspicious, but you get use to it.</span> <span id="s1261">And then a year later, we brought his brother and his wife and a child here.</span> <span id="s1262">And he worked, being my husband worked a little bit by Moisher's (ph) Supermarket and my brother-in-law who worked in Germany, he was in a different camp in Germany, also with this kind of a supermarket goods, and they were thinking of going into business.</span> <span id="s1263">No profession, what do you do?</span> <span id="s1264">You go into business.</span> <span id="s1265">So they start, they looked into it and they bought like a small, little grocery.</span> <span id="s1266">Money we didn't have.</span> <span id="s1267">And my Uncle said to me, "Humph, I gave you everything.</span> <span id="s1268">I'll give you a business?</span> <span id="s1269">What does you're husband know about business?</span> <span id="s1270">Was he ever . . .[End of side 1 of Tape 2]. . . but to give us money?</span> <span id="s1271">To go into business.</span> <span id="s1272">He said, "You're not, you're still green horns.</span> <span id="s1273">You have to bring yourself up first before you go into business."</span> <span id="s1274">Anyway, we borrowed here a few dollars, there a few dollars, and he worked.</span> <span id="s1275">Those years he made nice money as a painter.</span> <span id="s1276">And we saved up.</span> <span id="s1277">He didn't even know, I saved up $1,500.00.</span> <span id="s1278">And then when he went to business, where are we going to get the money?</span> <span id="s1279">I took out the $1,500.00, I said, "Here's $1,500.00."</span> <span id="s1280">He said, "What?</span> <span id="s1281">Where did you get the money?"</span> <span id="s1282">I saved it up.</span> <span id="s1283">And his brother brought a set of Rosenthal (ph) dishes from Germany, he sold that.</span> <span id="s1284">And they bought like a small, little grocery.</span> <span id="s1285">And they cheated us from top to bottom, from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s1286">We couldn't make a living out of it.</span> <span id="s1287">Not two families.</span> <span id="s1288">I remember they started to take out, like $30.00 a week, and some food when they could.</span> <span id="s1289">By then already I had a beautiful apartment, they had an apartment.</span> <span id="s1290">The ha-yass (ph) helped with apartments, a lot of people, a lot.</span> <span id="s1291">I was lucky that I had my Uncle, my Aunt, my father's sisters helped us.</span> <span id="s1292">But the other newcomers, _______ they use to call those years, the ha-yass (ph) helped.</span> <span id="s1293">Help with money, paid for rent, gave money for food, for a while.</span> <span id="s1294">Until you got jobs.</span> <span id="s1295">They tried to give you jobs, they got you jobs.</span> <span id="s1296">And luckily, as I said before, my family was very helpful.</span> <span id="s1297">They gave me kosher dishes, they gave me ________, they gave milk, they gave ________, I was kosher in those years, very kosher.</span> <span id="s1298">And this is how we bought this little store and they cheated us.</span> <span id="s1299">They were __________ green, they were green.</span> <span id="s1300">But they never gave up.</span> <span id="s1301">They didn't give up, and then there was, they started to build a huge, big building on the concourse.</span> <span id="s1302">The store was like off the concourse and they started to build like a big building with a huge supermarket on the bottom.</span> <span id="s1303">Well, they got panicky.</span> <span id="s1304">If this huge supermarket goes in, we are completely out.</span> <span id="s1305">At least, legally we push through days and months thinking what to do for the future, but now with this supermarket coming up, forget it.</span> <span id="s1306">So they looked at each other, the two brothers, and they said to themselves, how do we get this supermarket?</span> <span id="s1307">We could buy it.</span> <span id="s1308">But we don't have any money.</span> <span id="s1309">What are we going to do for money?</span> <span id="s1310">There's no money.</span> <span id="s1311">My Uncle says he's not giving me any money because you're going to lose it, he said, they cheated you out of this little store and now their going to cheat you again.</span> <span id="s1312">He wouldn't give it to us.</span> <span id="s1313">Here I have already another child was born, my daughter was born in 1952.</span> <span id="s1314">What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s1315">We started to talk to Green-na (ph) and Green-na (ph) are really helpful, you know?</span> <span id="s1316">And they lended us money, they got $2,000.00 here, $1,000.00 there.</span> <span id="s1317">Maybe we got something for this little store here, I don't know how much.</span> <span id="s1318">My husband maybe knows more about it.</span> <span id="s1319">And believe it or not, we bought this Supermarket.</span> <span id="s1320">They went to the people that put in the electric supply and they went to the people that gave us the food, you know?</span> <span id="s1321">Am I correct, Heshew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Heshew: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: How we got into the supermarket, to the big supermarket?</span> <span id="s1324">It was the first air conditioned supermarket in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s1325">I think in New York, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Heshew: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: The first air conditioned supermarket.</span> <span id="s1328">We have pictures.</span> <span id="s1329">There was a line when we opened up, there was a line around the corner coming into the store to buy.</span> <span id="s1330">And we worked hard, I mean, they worked hard.</span> <span id="s1331">They worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s1332">They still took out very little money, and to pay up all the debts, that we owe people money.</span> <span id="s1333">And the business, I was in seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s1334">I have enough food.</span> <span id="s1335">I could give my kids food, food, food, food.</span> <span id="s1336">Until now, my gut obsession is food.</span> <span id="s1337">Just to have enough food for my children and for my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1338">They are always right about me.</span> <span id="s1339">Why is my Babba so obsessed with food?</span> <span id="s1340">So I explained it to them, how many years I was hungry.</span> <span id="s1341">That I had raw beets and raw potatoes, and now I have food and I don't want my kids to get hungry.</span> <span id="s1342">We're not going to be hungry, don't push on us.</span> <span id="s1343">And thank God the store was good.</span> <span id="s1344">And we saved and we saved.</span> <span id="s1345">We lived very, how you say it?</span> <span id="s1346">Within splash, with lots of money.</span> <span id="s1347">And ________ they had and they worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1348">In those years the supermarkets were open seven days a week.</span> <span id="s1349">And later hours.</span> <span id="s1350">He hardly saw the children.</span> <span id="s1351">By the time he came home the kids were already in bed, like 7 or 8 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1352">Until 7 o'clock the store was open, Friday until 9 o'clock, I think it was.</span> <span id="s1353">And Saturday, Sunday, it was seven days a week.</span> <span id="s1354">And then they opened up another store.</span> <span id="s1355">On Kingsley _________ Avenue, another supermarket.</span> <span id="s1356">In the beginning it wasn't good, in the beginning it was really, it was bad.</span> <span id="s1357">But then with hard work and a little by little it was good.</span> <span id="s1358">It was good.</span> <span id="s1359">He made money, we made money and I had my home, which I didn't have a house but apartments, which I was always in seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s1360">I kissed the ground in this country.</span> <span id="s1361">I had my family, I had my food, I had my FrigidAir, I had my home.</span> <span id="s1362">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Heshew: She had nothing else to do, just kissing the ground.</span> <span id="s1364">Her husband was slaving and she was kissing the ground.</span> <span id="s1365">Not a bad idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: [Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: You were making him do all the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: What sort of network was there among Jews in general and Jews from the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Here.</span> <span id="s1372">In the neighborhood or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Well here we started like accumulating together.</span> <span id="s1374">Like all the survivors.</span> <span id="s1375">One family was looking for another one.</span> <span id="s1376">We got together.</span> <span id="s1377">We had our own groups.</span> <span id="s1378">I really didn't, I only mingled with my family, which I had family, cousins, they were very nice to me, very nice.</span> <span id="s1379">I had a big, beautiful family and they took me in with open arms.</span> <span id="s1380">But concerning the _________, that we were called all those years, the newcomers, the survivors, we got together.</span> <span id="s1381">We had our groups.</span> <span id="s1382">We start to play cards, we let a normal life.</span> <span id="s1383">Tried to lead a normal life.</span> <span id="s1384">Of course, the past, you cannot forget.</span> <span id="s1385">And you cannot just let go.</span> <span id="s1386">It's deep in you're mind and in you're heart.</span> <span id="s1387">I think of it until the day you die.</span> <span id="s1388">It will never, never, never leave us for one minute.</span> <span id="s1389">Those years back, even up until now we have the same organized organizations, which is only by survivors.</span> <span id="s1390">We have New Years Eve parties.</span> <span id="s1391">I got involved, years later, I got involved in the ZOA.</span> <span id="s1392">We had a group, then we moved to, this was many years later, to Pelham Parkway.</span> <span id="s1393">I got involved there.</span> <span id="s1394">I was President of the __________, it's a Chapter from the ZOA.</span> <span id="s1395">District 20.</span> <span id="s1396">And we made like a Ladies Auxiliary, it’s a chapter of it and I was President for ten years.</span> <span id="s1397">I worked very hard, of course no pay.</span> <span id="s1398">And we raised money for Israel.</span> <span id="s1399">Our lives was quite normal.</span> <span id="s1400">I still did not talk about what I went through to the kids.</span> <span id="s1401">Until my grandchildren started to grow up and understand what means, they start to learn in school and ask questions, then I started to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1402">But our life here was pretty good, I can't complain really.</span> <span id="s1403">I never complained and my husband worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1404">I never worked.</span> <span id="s1405">To me the kids were my first priority.</span> <span id="s1406">And I took care of the kids, I didn't trust any babysitters.</span> <span id="s1407">For five years I never saw a movie in this country.</span> <span id="s1408">Any place I went there were the kids and the kids and the kids.</span> <span id="s1409">Later on, when they got a little older, I put my emphasis on education.</span> <span id="s1410">I tried my best to push my kids through schools.</span> <span id="s1411">If they were weak, to, never had a babysitter in their lives.</span> <span id="s1412">To, how you call it, someone to help my kids with education because I wasn't knowledgeable enough in this country to learn English.</span> <span id="s1413">I never went to school here.</span> <span id="s1414">Whatever I learned, whatever I know in writing or reading, is only from reading.</span> <span id="s1415">I read a lot in those years, an awful lot.</span> <span id="s1416">And this is what I tried to push on my kids.</span> <span id="s1417">Send them to Hebrew school, send them to, I led a pretty normal, Jewish life.</span> <span id="s1418">Going to _________ ___________ even when they, when my husband went to work I took both kids, schlepped them to school.</span> <span id="s1419">Of course, the holidays, I was very close with his family.</span> <span id="s1420">He had a, then two or two-and-a-half years later, after we came to this country, I think two-and-a-half or three-and-a-half years, we brought his mother, his sister with her family, a husband and two kids, to this country.</span> <span id="s1421">And I considered myself extremely blessed and very lucky to be into a family.</span> <span id="s1422">Because I didn't have anybody from my mother's side or my, I had my father's two sisters and some cousins here, but they were very good, but survivors?</span> <span id="s1423">I was the only one.</span> <span id="s1424">There was another sister of my mother with five kids.</span> <span id="s1425">They all got killed in Lack-ma (ph).</span> <span id="s1426">In my town where I was born, the name of it is Lack-ma (ph).</span> <span id="s1427">They all got killed.</span> <span id="s1428">So I considered myself very blessed and very fortunate to go into a full family.</span> <span id="s1429">They all came from Russia.</span> <span id="s1430">My husband lost his father right when the Germans came into their town, they killed him immediately.</span> <span id="s1431">No, they didn't.</span> <span id="s1432">They took him into a camp and they burned him, to Belzec.</span> <span id="s1433">And he got burned, they burned him.</span> <span id="s1434">But the two brothers and the sister and the mother are very, very close.</span> <span id="s1435">All these years, they were in business together, we lived in the same area together, more or less.</span> <span id="s1436">I lived in ___________, the Parkway, they lived on the Concourse and then they moved to ___________ Parkway, and then we all moved to Pelham Parkway.</span> <span id="s1437">And that's where we lived for eight years until I moved in here and I considered myself very lucky to be in a family like this and my life here was quite normal.</span> <span id="s1438">My husband tried to be in business all their lives, on his life.</span> <span id="s1439">He worked himself up.</span> <span id="s1440">Thank God he made a good living, always.</span> <span id="s1441">Money was no problem.</span> <span id="s1442">When I had the supermarkets, food, I always had galore.</span> <span id="s1443">And we went into real estate little by little.</span> <span id="s1444">And thank God financially we did pretty well for ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: What sort of things became important to you based on you're experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s1446">You said food, for one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: My family.</span> <span id="s1448">My children.</span> <span id="s1449">To raise my children, maybe in a liberal way, maybe too much liberal.</span> <span id="s1450">Maybe too much of liberal.</span> <span id="s1451">To raise my kids, to give it to them, they shouldn't be hateful.</span> <span id="s1452">They should love all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1453">They should be good people.</span> <span id="s1454">They should have professions.</span> <span id="s1455">They should have a profession and God forbid a war comes over or whatever, they should have something to fall on.</span> <span id="s1456">Because my father, if not this profession where he was a barber, we would never have survived.</span> <span id="s1457">See, I wanted my kids to have some kind of a profession.</span> <span id="s1458">Of course, I didn't want them to be a tailor or a carpenter because this is not the Jewish mother's thing for children.</span> <span id="s1459">What does a Jewish mother want, is her husband?</span> <span id="s1460">Her children should be a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, at least a teacher.</span> <span id="s1461">So I was pushing for teaching for my kids.</span> <span id="s1462">So both of my kids actually, originally they became teachers.</span> <span id="s1463">My son was a special education teacher and my daughter, she wanted to be a veterinarian when she was a little girl, but she was raised in the 1960's.</span> <span id="s1464">She was not really a full fledged hippie, but kind of on the very liberal side.</span> <span id="s1465">She went to Binghamton, to school, ________ was _________.</span> <span id="s1466">And what I said, I was pushing for teaching.</span> <span id="s1467">Now she became an Anthropology teacher, she's a very bright girl.</span> <span id="s1468">And she was teaching anthropology for a full year and then she came home and said, "Ma, I don’t like this profession.</span> <span id="s1469">I don't want to be an anthropologist."</span> <span id="s1470">I said, "What do you want to be?"</span> <span id="s1471">"I want to be a doctor."</span> <span id="s1472">I said, "You're crazy.</span> <span id="s1473">Now, after so many years, so much work you put in being a teacher, now you want to be a . . ." "I want to be a veterinarian."</span> <span id="s1474">Well, she's very bright.</span> <span id="s1475">I was against it.</span> <span id="s1476">The truth is she took crash courses in Italian.</span> <span id="s1477">She was short in Bio, she was short in Chemistry, and she went to Italy and she became a doctor veterinarian.</span> <span id="s1478">And she's practicing now.</span> <span id="s1479">And she's doing very well.</span> <span id="s1480">She has her own place and she is a very good veterinarian.</span> <span id="s1481">My son became a special education teacher.</span> <span id="s1482">And after a while he didn't like teaching either.</span> <span id="s1483">He didn't want to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s1484">And he got hooked up with a friend and somebody else, I guess, and they went into Nutra System Diet Centers.</span> <span id="s1485">And thank God, God was good to them.</span> <span id="s1486">He did very well.</span> <span id="s1487">Very well.</span> <span id="s1488">He makes a good living.</span> <span id="s1489">Now the Nutra System is not so well, the Diet Centers, but he makes a living, thank God.</span> <span id="s1490">He does pretty good.</span> <span id="s1491">She's also a teacher, his wife.</span> <span id="s1492">A lovely, lovely Jewish girl, very nice.</span> <span id="s1493">An angel of a child.</span> <span id="s1494">And they gave me three beautiful grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1495">And this is my whole life, I live for them.</span> <span id="s1496">I lived for them.</span> <span id="s1497">And I still do.</span> <span id="s1498">I still do live for the children.</span> <span id="s1499">This is my whole life.</span> <span id="s1500">Nothing else matters to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: And you were talking about discussing the stories from the war with you're kids.</span> <span id="s1502">I mean, did you discuss, did you talk about it with you're husband?</span> <span id="s1503">Did you talk about it with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: With my husband, we talked, yeah.</span> <span id="s1505">I talked to my husband, also not too much.</span> <span id="s1506">Also not too much.</span> <span id="s1507">He never talked at all.</span> <span id="s1508">But also not too much.</span> <span id="s1509">I was going on with my daily routines of life.</span> <span id="s1510">Getting up in the morning, cleaning, see that the kids should go out for fresh air, taking them to schools, baking, being with his family, being with my family.</span> <span id="s1511">And this was more or less my life, was wrapped around this here.</span> <span id="s1512">Not too much talking.</span> <span id="s1513">I started to really open up more when my grandchildren started to ask questions because it was, when my kids went to school they didn't talk too much about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1514">They really didn't.</span> <span id="s1515">Not in schools.</span> <span id="s1516">But at home, I couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s1517">I didn't want to put this pain on them.</span> <span id="s1518">But only when my grandchildren in Junior High School, I think, started to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1519">And then they kept on asking questions and I really started to open up to them.</span> <span id="s1520">And I was sitting with them, they were writing and telling what I told them and I told them what I went through.</span> <span id="s1521">They do know.</span> <span id="s1522">I don't know if they know every, little detail, but most of it.</span> <span id="s1523">They do, they know what I went through, yes, they do know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: How did you talk to your own kids?</span> <span id="s1525">I mean, you're son was born in one of the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: ___________.</span> <span id="s1527">He knew that I am a survivor and I went through Hitler and I lost my mother, my sister, my brother.</span> <span id="s1528">I survived.</span> <span id="s1529">And that's how I met his father.</span> <span id="s1530">He knew that he was born in this DP camp in Fohrenwald, he knew about all those things.</span> <span id="s1531">Which is not, it's painful and as a child they cannot realize what this means and how much pain his mother went through.</span> <span id="s1532">And even, I don't know if they know even the loss, if they could feel what I lost.</span> <span id="s1533">If they could feel my loss and my mother.</span> <span id="s1534">I was raised without a mother practically.</span> <span id="s1535">When I needed her the most she wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s1536">And I had to take care of other people all my life, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s1537">This was in the partisans, even after the war, when my father married my stepmother.</span> <span id="s1538">She wasn't a good woman and I had to prove myself, to be good and to be, and to do things.</span> <span id="s1539">I always took care of somebody, all my life I, nobody, except I happen to take care of me, but I always did for people that my life should be easier or to be good or to impress people.</span> <span id="s1540">They shouldn't hurt me, they shouldn't leave me.</span> <span id="s1541">The fear of leaving was in me a lot, a lot.</span> <span id="s1542">Like especially fear with my father of leaving.</span> <span id="s1543">It was really kind of a, painful to me.</span> <span id="s1544">Very painful.</span> <span id="s1545">Even here, being in this country, and he didn't live here.</span> <span id="s1546">This feeling went away when he died.</span> <span id="s1547">It's like it was wiped away, like I was relieved.</span> <span id="s1548">And up until then, until the day he died, just either I was holding on to him __________.</span> <span id="s1549">When he died, I was sure that, you know, God took him away and I cannot even explain.</span> <span id="s1550">I cannot explain the feeling of it.</span> <span id="s1551">The fear that I'm going to be left alone.</span> <span id="s1552">But when he died, its like something, a clock in me says well, this is, if he left you and he will never come back and you have to take care of yourself and you're family.</span> <span id="s1553">This is you're family.</span> <span id="s1554">You're father is gone, you cannot lay on him anymore.</span> <span id="s1555">You cannot depend on him anymore.</span> <span id="s1556">He cannot save you anymore.</span> <span id="s1557">These fears for some reason, it was, it was a terrible, frightening thing.</span> <span id="s1558">Maybe if it was just me, maybe other people didn't have this, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1559">But I had this pain, I had this terrible pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Before you're father died, what was you're relationship with him?</span> <span id="s1561">After the war, did you talk to him about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Unfortunately, yeah, we talked, I talked to my father, yeah.</span> <span id="s1563">I was like his life.</span> <span id="s1564">I was, I am by nature, I was a strong, self-confident person.</span> <span id="s1565">My father gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1566">He was the one who inflicted this on me.</span> <span id="s1567">You are beautiful.</span> <span id="s1568">You are the smartest.</span> <span id="s1569">You know how to do this and he gave me the confidence in him, in me.</span> <span id="s1570">He made me, whatever I am now, he made me.</span> <span id="s1571">But unfortunately, circumstances after the war ripped us apart.</span> <span id="s1572">He went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1573">I went to this country.</span> <span id="s1574">Then he couldn't come here.</span> <span id="s1575">And he went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1576">As soon as he got to Canada, he was, from Israel he traveled to Argentina, he had a sister there.</span> <span id="s1577">And from there he couldn't come to straight here, but to Canada, through Italy, so he was in Italy.</span> <span id="s1578">And I was always of course in touch with him, close in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1579">But really, being together he should see me grow as a woman, grow as a mother, grow as a wife.</span> <span id="s1580">Having a family that, he never saw it because he wasn't with me.</span> <span id="s1581">That's bothered me a lot, it still does.</span> <span id="s1582">__________________, but when it came to _______________, for some reason it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s1583">So then he lived in Canada, in Montreal.</span> <span id="s1584">And I use to go there constantly, he use to come to me.</span> <span id="s1585">He was _____________ __________ __________ when my son was born.</span> <span id="s1586">It's not like you could hold his ___________ for my child.</span> <span id="s1587">It was just the circumstances didn't happen, it just didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1588">I use to go a lot to Montreal, I open him a barbershop, I didn't have too much money then but I did my best.</span> <span id="s1589">I opened him up a barbershop to make him happy.</span> <span id="s1590">They wanted to be there.</span> <span id="s1591">And then, unfortunately, he got sick.</span> <span id="s1592">He got sick.</span> <span id="s1593">He got sick and I use to schlep him here, schlep him to doctors here.</span> <span id="s1594">Schlep him for surgery here.</span> <span id="s1595">He had eleven surgeries, he had cancer in his testicles.</span> <span id="s1596">And he was sick for about six or seven years.</span> <span id="s1597">Now, he would have been saved because medicine is so progressed now that prostate cancer is now much easier to help and to cure within those years.</span> <span id="s1598">I mean, he died six months ___________.</span> <span id="s1599">Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Did you look back on the war together though?</span> <span id="s1601">Did those things you talked about, were they about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: Yeah, we talked to each other, yeah.</span> <span id="s1603">With him I talked a lot, yeah.</span> <span id="s1604">But he was also one of those people who couldn't see me suffer.</span> <span id="s1605">So he would start to talk, and he said, take her around it, around it, don't talk.</span> <span id="s1606">Don't aggravate yourself.</span> <span id="s1607">You're here.</span> <span id="s1608">You have a good husband, you have a beautiful family.</span> <span id="s1609">Don't go back.</span> <span id="s1610">No.</span> <span id="s1611">Before he died, he called in me and my Uncle and my Aunt, and he said, "Look to the High my kin", he said.</span> <span id="s1612">"You went through a lot.</span> <span id="s1613">This is you're first _________.</span> <span id="s1614">I'm dying.</span> <span id="s1615">I'm not going to make it, but I want you to have a _____________ the way.</span> <span id="s1616">The way, ___________, the way you want it.</span> <span id="s1617">That's you're first symbol in you're life.</span> <span id="s1618">Make a big bar mitzvah, make a nice bar mitzvah".</span> <span id="s1619">He thought that I was rich because I use to help him a lot and give him a lot.</span> <span id="s1620">I had enough.</span> <span id="s1621">Never complained on money.</span> <span id="s1622">And he said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s1623">I'll be with you.</span> <span id="s1624">I'm going to be there every minute of you're step, watching you.</span> <span id="s1625">_____________, enjoy it."</span> <span id="s1626">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s1627">I made him a big bar mitzvah, I had to give him __________, I'll have the music and I had ____________ because he didn't trust me.</span> <span id="s1628">I had an extremely close relationship with him, close.</span> <span id="s1629">Because this is all I had, you know?</span> <span id="s1630">And I saw where other fathers left their children, he didn't.</span> <span id="s1631">He was really watching over me.</span> <span id="s1632">He use to wake up in the middle of the night, touching to see if I'm there.</span> <span id="s1633">If not, God forbid, some soldiers grabbed me someplace, to rape me or something.</span> <span id="s1634">He was so overprotecting me.</span> <span id="s1635">He did.</span> <span id="s1636">He protected me.</span> <span id="s1637">There's no end to it.</span> <span id="s1638">It's just, it was a time period in my life, in this country, that I had good times.</span> <span id="s1639">I raised my kids.</span> <span id="s1640">I was involved in the ZOA.</span> <span id="s1641">I had the ______ club, raised money.</span> <span id="s1642">And I was kind of a very, very happy person.</span> <span id="s1643">Now, it comes with age.</span> <span id="s1644">I think more than ever.</span> <span id="s1645">Why me?</span> <span id="s1646">Why did I not take my sister?</span> <span id="s1647">Why didn't I schlep my mother with me?</span> <span id="s1648">Maybe they would have survived.</span> <span id="s1649">It's like conscious.</span> <span id="s1650">I'm not blaming me, but actually my mother saved my life.</span> <span id="s1651">She pushed me out of the second ghetto.</span> <span id="s1652">But maybe my sister would have survived if I had grabbed her hand and take her to the other ghetto.</span> <span id="s1653">Why didn't I do that?</span> <span id="s1654">It's, I have more time on my hands now and many times you don't sleep at night, you think.</span> <span id="s1655">And I cry a lot.</span> <span id="s1656">I do cry.</span> <span id="s1657">And if I'm by myself, I say, why didn't I do this?</span> <span id="s1658">Why didn't I do that?</span> <span id="s1659">Maybe things would have been different.</span> <span id="s1660">But I guess I'm not the only one.</span> <span id="s1661">I read a lot about it.</span> <span id="s1662">I read the book about the children, survivor's children.</span> <span id="s1663">I think everybody feels this way.</span> <span id="s1664">I'm not the only one.</span> <span id="s1665">I have a girlfriend, __________, she's going for therapy.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, fifty years later.</span> <span id="s1667">And she just started to go for therapy because she can't cope with it, she can't live with it.</span> <span id="s1668">After fifty years.</span> <span id="s1669">This is one of the girls, she lives in New Jersey, that we survived together.</span> <span id="s1670">Her father actually saved my life up in ____________.</span> <span id="s1671">He gave me this piece of fish and she is a very educated girl.</span> <span id="s1672">She came here single, she went to school, she was a teacher at Stiverson High School, and she just, now, _____________, she's not old, I mean, she just can't, why did she do this and why didn't she do it and why her sister got killed, her mother got killed?</span> <span id="s1673">Three kids got killed.</span> <span id="s1674">Maybe she is blaming herself a lot.</span> <span id="s1675">It's kind of like she went back to Lock-ma (ph).</span> <span id="s1676">She went back to Lock-ma (ph).</span> <span id="s1677">She's, her fear just in this age, she lives with this fear.</span> <span id="s1678">I lost the fear.</span> <span id="s1679">I don't have this fear.</span> <span id="s1680">Oh, when I hear something happens to Israel, I get panicky.</span> <span id="s1681">I'm, you know, I get scared.</span> <span id="s1682">But the fear of bombing and running, it's gone.</span> <span id="s1683">This is gone.</span> <span id="s1684">You know?</span> <span id="s1685">But we are, I think each and every one of the survivors, is, how could you say it?</span> <span id="s1686">Very, very unhappy people.</span> <span id="s1687">With all the happiness, with all the money they made for all those years, with the children and the grandchildren and the homes, financially okay, I have this home, I have a home in Florida.</span> <span id="s1688">But deep in you, there is certain pain that is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1689">And each and every one of us, whoever I talk to, it just, I think it will go to grave or take it with us.</span> <span id="s1690">This kind of thing that we've been through.</span> <span id="s1691">It's not just sometimes a person is being killed.</span> <span id="s1692">To blame yourself, you blame your father, you blame your mother, you blame the world.</span> <span id="s1693">It's just, ________ at least you're alive and none of us is going to die young, but our whole life was kind of a, in pain.</span> <span id="s1694">We lived in pain.</span> <span id="s1695">With the money, with the homes.</span> <span id="s1696">There was like a cancer in you that ate you up.</span> <span id="s1697">This is life.</span> <span id="s1698">This is our, even the times that we blacked out, we didn't want to think about it, we didn't want to talk about it, this guilt.</span> <span id="s1699">Guilt of dancing, guilt of drinking, guilt, we are guilty to have a good time.</span> <span id="s1700">Why me?</span> <span id="s1701">Why not my sister?</span> <span id="s1702">Why not my brother?</span> <span id="s1703">She was eight years old, that little girl.</span> <span id="s1704">An old lady of 85, my grandma.</span> <span id="s1705">Had to get undressed?</span> <span id="s1706">In front of so many people and shooting, blowing her brains?</span> <span id="s1707">Why?</span> <span id="s1708">Just because she was born a Jewish woman?</span> <span id="s1709">So, as I say, with all those richness that our ________ have now, survivors.</span> <span id="s1710">With all the good times, and we do have good times, we go, we dance, we sing, we have wonderful times.</span> <span id="s1711">But there's something that is eating you up inside.</span> <span id="s1712">Eating you up inside, like a cancer.</span> <span id="s1713">And it just, I think, it's me, I think.</span> <span id="s1714">The older I get the worse it gets.</span> <span id="s1715">Overprotective of my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1716">Or if my son is flying.</span> <span id="s1717">My granddaughter is flying.</span> <span id="s1718">My grandson is flying, he's going by car, he's going to come.</span> <span id="s1719">It's just, what I went through, my son, my only son I guess, I have a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1720">It was in the 1960's and he wasn't a good student and I was afraid by 18 they'll take him to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1721">Well, this was the last thing I would have done.</span> <span id="s1722">I would have, but I went to, not to in order for him, he shouldn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: I just couldn't see, God forbid, they will take him to Vietnam, to another war, he could get killed.</span> <span id="s1726">And I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1727">I just, I went from doctor to doctor, trying to make him sick.</span> <span id="s1728">I tried to, he shouldn't go to the, not to the ________ army, but I forgot how you call it.</span> <span id="s1729">I pushed him into a school in Louisiana.</span> <span id="s1730">He was such a bad student.</span> <span id="s1731">I mean, later on he picked up and he really is a great guy, a very successful businessman.</span> <span id="s1732">And he, we pushed him into a school in Louisiana and he was there and he was doing bad and I was afraid, if he's going to drop out, they are going to grab him into the Army.</span> <span id="s1733">He had to stay in school.</span> <span id="s1734">I went, at that time he developed some boils from nerves.</span> <span id="s1735">He was never away from me too, he was like a mother's little boy, you know?</span> <span id="s1736">I was always protective, the Jewish mother.</span> <span id="s1737">I went to doctors, to skin doctors, this is like I'm saying it here, off the record.</span> <span id="s1738">I almost took him out for $10,000.00 in those years.</span> <span id="s1739">I cried my eyes out.</span> <span id="s1740">I told him my story, I said, I cannot afford to lose him.</span> <span id="s1741">I almost say yes, I almost paid somebody off for $10,000.00.</span> <span id="s1742">I was going to get him out.</span> <span id="s1743">Because I couldn't afford, otherwise if I wouldn't be able to do this I would grab him and take him to countries or off to Canada or someplace.</span> <span id="s1744">He would have never went into the Army, never, never.</span> <span id="s1745">And I was running from place to place to place, telling my story, why I cannot send him to the Army.</span> <span id="s1746">Why it's not fair.</span> <span id="s1747">I lost so much, why should I lose another child now, this is all I have.</span> <span id="s1748">And, but luckily, I mean, luckily all of it was very fixed, I'm not sure, but the numbers came out.</span> <span id="s1749">I don't know if you know this story, in the 1960's, they drew lottery numbers.</span> <span id="s1750">And his number was the first one to be out.</span> <span id="s1751">Then I was safe with him.</span> <span id="s1752">Then I was safe with him.</span> <span id="s1753">I never gave my kids swimming lessons.</span> <span id="s1754">Now my grandchildren have everything because they don't listen to me.</span> <span id="s1755">They swim, the big ones swim too, but I was protective.</span> <span id="s1756">I was very, very, very protective.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Do you think you created, I mean, is it, can you create something of an ordinary life like everyone around you who didn't go through the experiences of the war?</span> <span id="s1758">I mean, what other things sort of color you're experiences, as you’re creating you're family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: You mean an effect on my children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: The effect on the family that you built?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: I'm sure it did.</span> <span id="s1762">I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1763">There's a lot of books now written, especially my daughter I think.</span> <span id="s1764">She's a rebel.</span> <span id="s1765">She married one non-Jewish guy for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1766">Then she divorced this one after ten years and she married another non-Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s1767">Though I have a good relationship with her, she loves us very much.</span> <span id="s1768">She is a very bright, very pretty child.</span> <span id="s1769">But maybe she picked up here and there about what Jewish people go through and she married these non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1770">Maybe that's a reason to it.</span> <span id="s1771">And my son now almost always says, _______ _________ ____ ________ _______, they're sick in the head.</span> <span id="s1772">All ________ children.</span> <span id="s1773">But I think you are normal, you are okay.</span> <span id="s1774">It didn't effect you.</span> <span id="s1775">He said, but luckily you didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s1776">Because I have a niece here who, she's not crazy, she's very bright.</span> <span id="s1777">She has her problems I think and she blames that her mother talked too much.</span> <span id="s1778">She heard that her mother talked about the, what she went through, that she wasn't __________.</span> <span id="s1779">I was not in a concentration camp or Dachau or Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1780">Her mother was a Russian and she blames, she was married, she was divorced.</span> <span id="s1781">She is not stable.</span> <span id="s1782">Very bright girl, very bright.</span> <span id="s1783">She blames her parents of talking too much about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1784">That's why she's screwed up.</span> <span id="s1785">She does.</span> <span id="s1786">And there are a lot of books written about this kind of a thing, the children of survivors.</span> <span id="s1787">That they do have problems.</span> <span id="s1788">So, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1789">I don't think, I don’t think so of my kids, that they really have problems because of that.</span> <span id="s1790">I really don't think so.</span> <span id="s1791">My daughter, maybe she's a little rebel, she married one non-Jewish guy on top of another non-Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s1792">Maybe this has anything to do with that.</span> <span id="s1793">But I don't see my son or my grandchildren, any effect of the war.</span> <span id="s1794">Maybe they don't talk about it and tell me, but I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1795">I really don't because I didn't show.</span> <span id="s1796">I didn't show, I didn't talk, I didn't act.</span> <span id="s1797">I was always vivacious, outgoing person.</span> <span id="s1798">Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">Q: Did the war change you're views on you're connection to Judaism and later to Israel and even to religion and God?</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1801">Yes.</span> <span id="s1802">I cannot be partial to non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1803">I don't trust them.</span> <span id="s1804">I don’t believe in them.</span> <span id="s1805">I just, for Israel, I would give my life of course.</span> <span id="s1806">I worked non-profitable organizations only to raise money and to send to Israel.</span> <span id="s1807">When it comes to non-Jewish people, I don’t have any confidence in them.</span> <span id="s1808">I don't trust them.</span> <span id="s1809">I don't.</span> <span id="s1810">Because we lived next door to non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1811">The same non-Jewish people who robbed my house.</span> <span id="s1812">Grabbed my brother's violin.</span> <span id="s1813">Killed my brother.</span> <span id="s1814">And I saw what they did.</span> <span id="s1815">How could I have confidence in them?</span> <span id="s1816">How could I trust them?</span> <span id="s1817">They use to come into my father's barbershop, eat and drink, and into my house where we lived.</span> <span id="s1818">My father's best friend.</span> <span id="s1819">And then when I came to them to ask for a piece of bread, they throw me out of the house.</span> <span id="s1820">On top of that, they were the worse killers in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1821">The worse killers.</span> <span id="s1822">How could I have confidence?</span> <span id="s1823">How could I trust them?</span> <span id="s1824">None of them.</span> <span id="s1825">None of them, unfortunately, I don't trust a non-Jewish person in relation to Judaism.</span> <span id="s1826">I don't.</span> <span id="s1827">I'm a good Jew.</span> <span id="s1828">I'm not religious.</span> <span id="s1829">I'm not saying religious Orthodox religious.</span> <span id="s1830">Deep in me I have a conviction, you know?</span> <span id="s1831">I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s1832">Tradition.</span> <span id="s1833">I love the Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s1834">And I gave my kids a Jewish tradition.</span> <span id="s1835">Not religious maybe, I should have and maybe this wouldn't have happened with my daughter, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1836">But I'm not a young, Israel person.</span> <span id="s1837">I'm not.</span> <span id="s1838">I am a, I wouldn't say a liberal.</span> <span id="s1839">I try to teach my kids liberal.</span> <span id="s1840">Liberalism.</span> <span id="s1841">I tried.</span> <span id="s1842">They, maybe not to hate each other.</span> <span id="s1843">Because it's wrong.</span> <span id="s1844">It's so wrong.</span> <span id="s1845">That one race should hate the other like that.</span> <span id="s1846">It's so wrong.</span> <span id="s1847">It doesn't bring any, even now, when I see what's going on in Bosnia, I can't understand.</span> <span id="s1848">Why?</span> <span id="s1849">Why can't everybody, you're Jewish, be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1850">You're Moslem, be a Moslem.</span> <span id="s1851">Don't hit me, I wouldn't hit you.</span> <span id="s1852">You do your own thing.</span> <span id="s1853">I'm going to do my own thing.</span> <span id="s1854">I can't understand this.</span> <span id="s1855">Why hate each other like that?</span> <span id="s1856">For what reason?</span> <span id="s1857">I have a right to pray for my prayer, but as long as I'm not hurting you.</span> <span id="s1858">I don't care if next door to me lives a __________, but don’t hit me, don't hurt me, I shouldn't be afraid of you.</span> <span id="s1859">Be my neighbor.</span> <span id="s1860">Be a good person to come into my house, we'll have a cup of coffee, we'll talk about business, about the children.</span> <span id="s1861">Why hate me only because I'm Jewish or you are black?</span> <span id="s1862">God created us like that so why hate each other like this?</span> <span id="s1863">For what reason?</span> <span id="s1864">I can't understand this.</span> <span id="s1865">And I taught, I was teaching my kids the same way.</span> <span id="s1866">But still, I didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s1867">Because for all the 2,000 years we are being, we are the one, now we have in Bosnia, it's __________, it's different religions, but those, way back, you didn't have those things.</span> <span id="s1868">They always, every religion hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s1869">Every religion hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s1870">From 2,000 years ago.</span> <span id="s1871">Why?</span> <span id="s1872">If you believe in God, God made it this way.</span> <span id="s1873">Jesus is not the God, God made Jesus, yeah?</span> <span id="s1874">Jesus made himself as a, Jesus was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s1875">So why hate each other?</span> <span id="s1876">We work hard.</span> <span id="s1877">We came to this country.</span> <span id="s1878">We were never on relief.</span> <span id="s1879">Never on footsteps.</span> <span id="s1880">I had neighbors, nice people.</span> <span id="s1881">So my husband went to work, he scrubbed herring.</span> <span id="s1882">Came home, he was smelling of herring.</span> <span id="s1883">Never saw his children go to bed and get up in the morning.</span> <span id="s1884">We worked hard for my _______, for our money, very hard.</span> <span id="s1885">Why can't other people do this?</span> <span id="s1886">Why hate the Jews, because they are hard working people?</span> <span id="s1887">The truth is, I have the highest respect for the Oriental people.</span> <span id="s1888">I love them.</span> <span id="s1889">They are good people.</span> <span id="s1890">They don't bother me.</span> <span id="s1891">We have them in my building.</span> <span id="s1892">They go, they work, they work seven days a week just like my husband worked.</span> <span id="s1893">The families are the back of the room.</span> <span id="s1894">They eat whatever is left over, whatever my husband had left over in the supermarket, he brought it home, I made a meal out it.</span> <span id="s1895">They do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1896">They are beautiful people.</span> <span id="s1897">They have a right to live like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1898">They work for their money.</span> <span id="s1899">They are family orientated people.</span> <span id="s1900">And that's what I tried to instill in my kids, this kind of a liberal way of life.</span> <span id="s1901">But it doesn't work.</span> <span id="s1902">It still doesn't work.</span> <span id="s1903">One bad thing about the Jews, and boom, everybody's on the Jews.</span> <span id="s1904">Everybody's on the Jews.</span> <span id="s1905">A plane's going to explode, they are going to blame the Jews.</span> <span id="s1906">That's why I would love to change the world.</span> <span id="s1907">They should be one race.</span> <span id="s1908">If there's a lot of races, to teach them how to get along together.</span> <span id="s1909">How to live together.</span> <span id="s1910">How to compromise.</span> <span id="s1911">But I guess, I don't know how.</span> <span id="s1912">I'm not, I'm too old and maybe if I had been born here maybe I would have some kind of knowledge.</span> <span id="s1913">But I, so I guess I am in a way a liberal.</span> <span id="s1914">That I don’t trust in non-Jewish people against the Jews, you can't blame me for that.</span> <span id="s1915">What I went through.</span> <span id="s1916">What I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1917">Though, some Christians are very nice to me, very nice.</span> <span id="s1918">They gave me food.</span> <span id="s1919">Gave me a haircut.</span> <span id="s1920">Gave me shelter.</span> <span id="s1921">So, but the majority in this world is against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1922">The majority of people are against the Jews.</span> <span id="s1923">I can't straighten this out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: You say that you're Jewish culturally, but maybe not religiously?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: Were you raised religiously?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Not really, my father was a liberal.</span> <span id="s1928">He couldn't care less that he's a, we had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1929">We had a grandma in the house, in those years, we had the kosher home.</span> <span id="s1930">My father went to Shula (ph) every Saturday, but not really Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1931">I never had non-kosher food in my house.</span> <span id="s1932">My mother came from a more religious home than my father.</span> <span id="s1933">They came from two different backgrounds.</span> <span id="s1934">My father came from working people.</span> <span id="s1935">As a matter of fact, my father's also a musician, was a musician.</span> <span id="s1936">There were ten children in his family.</span> <span id="s1937">There were four boys and six girls.</span> <span id="s1938">And my grandpa was a musician.</span> <span id="s1939">As a matter of fact, they took everything away from me, I would have shown it to you.</span> <span id="s1940">I have a picture and one of the books which was crated by Bashevitz Singer (ph) and he has my grandfather there playing this fiddle, that I gave the men.</span> <span id="s1941">He was playing the fiddle, what I gave to this Museum now.</span> <span id="s1942">But they have everything.</span> <span id="s1943">They still didn't send it back to me.</span> <span id="s1944">I should really be after them.</span> <span id="s1945">So they were all four brothers, they were musicians, all of them.</span> <span id="s1946">My father played all the instruments, you just name it, piano, just natural, naturally came to them.</span> <span id="s1947">I don't think that, none of them knew how to play by notes, they all played just from their heads.</span> <span id="s1948">I was trying to bring something up, but I forgot what I was going to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: Oh, we were just talking, I guess I was wondering whether you're experiences during the war changed you're feelings on being a Jew in this country and other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: Well I was a child yet.</span> <span id="s1951">I really didn't know much about any religious, religions of the world.</span> <span id="s1952">I had a kosher home, as I said.</span> <span id="s1953">And my mother use to bake bread.</span> <span id="s1954">It was a small town and holly and ________ we ate together, Friday night we ate together.</span> <span id="s1955">And ___________.</span> <span id="s1956">We were not like a young Israel, I wouldn't say young Israel people.</span> <span id="s1957">More tradition with a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1958">Jewish traditionally established people.</span> <span id="s1959">But not _______, no.</span> <span id="s1960">We were not _________.</span> <span id="s1961">And I still am the same way.</span> <span id="s1962">Same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: Have you gone back to Poland or have you had any desires?</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: Yeah, I do have a desire.</span> <span id="s1965">I do have a tremendous desire.</span> <span id="s1966">I would like to be in this grave.</span> <span id="s1967">I was in this grave right after the war and I saw the big grave.</span> <span id="s1968">Through all those year, whoever survived in Israel, they really worked on it and they made the ____________, now there's no more Communism, but when it was the Communism even, there was a nice group of Jewish, if I would have been in Israel, I would have been over there many times, in Lackenbach.</span> <span id="s1969">But in here, unfortunately there's not too many people in America.</span> <span id="s1970">There was one girl who lost her husband and one woman, what I was telling you, that she has some problems, mental problems and she still, now she's going through group therapy, she's going to a psychiatrist, like the whole thing came back to her, you know?</span> <span id="s1971">It was like, she can't live with it, it's just tormenting her.</span> <span id="s1972">The past is tormenting her.</span> <span id="s1973">And I don't have anybody to go with.</span> <span id="s1974">But from Israel they go constantly.</span> <span id="s1975">They put up a gorgeous monument, gorgeous.</span> <span id="s1976">Even for the Russians, yet.</span> <span id="s1977">A big monument with all the parades and all the, whatever has to be done, and all the names.</span> <span id="s1978">Whoever is laying in this grave, my mother, my sister, my brother, my Aunts, my grandmas, everything is written down.</span> <span id="s1979">A big, big, beautiful monument.</span> <span id="s1980">And many times, they go like every year, when it was fiftieth, they are there since 1942.</span> <span id="s1981">So they had like a memorial there and everybody from Israel went.</span> <span id="s1982">I had to go from America.</span> <span id="s1983">I have a back problem and I have this anxiety attacks, up until now, but in different ways.</span> <span id="s1984">And from this, I had nobody to go with.</span> <span id="s1985">Last year I wanted to go, my younger grandson wanted to go with me, and for some reason it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s1986">I have also a stomach problem, I have a terrible case of colitis.</span> <span id="s1987">So I get nervous.</span> <span id="s1988">I sit on the bathroom more than I'm outside.</span> <span id="s1989">And my husband says, well, you're going to go by yourself.</span> <span id="s1990">How are you going to travel?</span> <span id="s1991">You have to either go to Israel, go with them to Israel or you have to go to, meet them in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1992">He didn't want to go, he's not a well person.</span> <span id="s1993">He had two open-heart surgeries already.</span> <span id="s1994">So he said, I cannot go with you.</span> <span id="s1995">And my family said, Babba, why are you going to go?</span> <span id="s1996">You have plenty of aggravation, you still talk about it, sleep with it, why?</span> <span id="s1997">Don't go.</span> <span id="s1998">But I'm dying to go.</span> <span id="s1999">I am dying to go.</span> <span id="s2000">I want to go.</span> <span id="s2001">But I don't know how to work it out.</span> <span id="s2002">Maybe to go to Israel and go with them to Israel.</span> <span id="s2003">From there to go.</span> <span id="s2004">But from Israel, they are going constantly.</span> <span id="s2005">Every December there is a big, big, beautiful monument.</span> <span id="s2006">They take very well care of it.</span> <span id="s2007">And maybe someday, if I leave, I'll go.</span> <span id="s2008">I will.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: You mentioned before that you find yourself thinking about those events more and more?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: Do you have any sense why?</span> <span id="s2012">What that's happening?</span> <span id="s2013">And did you not think about it for a while as you were living your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">A: I wasn't thinking for a while.</span> <span id="s2015">There was quite a number of years in between that I really didn't think.</span> <span id="s2016">I was so involved with the ZOA and raising money for Israel, buying bonds, selling bonds, getting dressed up, playing cards, raising my two children, that I really didn't even think about it.</span> <span id="s2017">I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s2018">I just kind of like blacked out.</span> <span id="s2019">Sometimes we got together, you know, a bunch of us, survivors, and we talked about it and then when I left I had a normal life.</span> <span id="s2020">Now it's kind of like more and more on top of me.</span> <span id="s2021">More and more reminders of it.</span> <span id="s2022">I think more about it.</span> <span id="s2023">I am more in the house by myself, the kids are out of my life, thank God they're doing well.</span> <span id="s2024">I don't know, but I ask some people, survivors, as a matter of fact I guess I'm not the only one.</span> <span id="s2025">Because they opened up here on Pierce Blvd. group therapy of survivors.</span> <span id="s2026">Just survivors.</span> <span id="s2027">A whole bunch of them.</span> <span id="s2028">And hundreds of people are going there.</span> <span id="s2029">And I was thinking maybe I should go there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: And how does it come back?</span> <span id="s2031">I mean, do you think about it at night, during the day?</span> <span id="s2032">Just certain images come back or what comes back into you're mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Images.</span> <span id="s2034">What I went through.</span> <span id="s2035">How I went out of this ghetto.</span> <span id="s2036">It bothers me a lot that my sister, at least my sister, my mother was only, I didn't realize how young they were.</span> <span id="s2037">My mother was thirty-six years old.</span> <span id="s2038">I didn't realize that, I'm missing, like I'm missing that side of the family.</span> <span id="s2039">I think about what I went through in partisans and my father died so young and he really didn't have enough time to have na-has (ph) from me.</span> <span id="s2040">And we talk now, we get together, our survivors, we talk about it.</span> <span id="s2041">Do I have maybe less to tell than the concentration camp people, then from Auschwitz, Treblinka, My-don-ick (ph), you know they had it worse.</span> <span id="s2042">They had it worse than me, as bad as I had it they had it worse.</span> <span id="s2043">And we talk about it, we do talk about it and it bothers me more, it bothers me more my sister, that my brother didn't survive.</span> <span id="s2044">You think what you went through, you see on television certain things.</span> <span id="s2045">You see the misplaced people, it comes back to you.</span> <span id="s2046">It comes back with and you feel sorry for those people.</span> <span id="s2047">But now they are being helped from people all over the world.</span> <span id="s2048">I say, why wasn't we helped?</span> <span id="s2049">Maybe it would have been different by us if people in the world would realize what's happening to us?</span> <span id="s2050">Maybe we would have had some help like those, I see the children, it really breaks you, you know?</span> <span id="s2051">Though they are not Jewish, but it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s2052">They are people.</span> <span id="s2053">They don't deserve this kind of a treatment.</span> <span id="s2054">They are plain, different, ordinary people, why do they have to get involved in this kind of a way of life?</span> <span id="s2055">And then you know, your own life comes back, those years, and they say, well now at least they are lucky, everybody's trying to help them and fight for them.</span> <span id="s2056">Nobody fought for us.</span> <span id="s2057">Nobody heard about us.</span> <span id="s2058">Some may think, well maybe they were happy to kill us out once and for all, the Jews, and get rid of them.</span> <span id="s2059">But they didn't, thank God.</span> <span id="s2060">So, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2061">Every chance I have now I run to the kids, my grandson, my whole life, my whole pleasure, I run to the kids.</span> <span id="s2062">You think I make this punch here for myself?</span> <span id="s2063">No.</span> <span id="s2064">For the kids.</span> <span id="s2065">All for the children.</span> <span id="s2066">And this is my life, the kids, now.</span> <span id="s2067">__________ not going to die anymore, I would like to _________ in the house from the kids because they are good kids, thank God.</span> <span id="s2068">Very protective over me, very protective over me.</span> <span id="s2069">Babba don't do this and Babba don't do that and very proud of me when we go places, they introduce us.</span> <span id="s2070">We went to my grandson's college graduation, I didn't stop crying for one minute.</span> <span id="s2071">I said, this happened to me.</span> <span id="s2072">I lived to see a grandchild graduating college?</span> <span id="s2073">It's just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2074">It's just like I'm pinching, I'm alive, I'm dead, I got killed in the partisans, I got killed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2075">This is my child?</span> <span id="s2076">This is my grandson graduating from college?</span> <span id="s2077">I lived to see it?</span> <span id="s2078">Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s2079">Yes I did.</span> <span id="s2080">It's just sometimes you wake up and you say, no, that's not me.</span> <span id="s2081">That's not me, that's really not me.</span> <span id="s2082">My daughter's a doctor?</span> <span id="s2083">I said, no.</span> <span id="s2084">I don't deserve it.</span> <span id="s2085">Why God chose me to have a daughter a doctor?</span> <span id="s2086">Why did he choose me for that?</span> <span id="s2087">What did I do right?</span> <span id="s2088">I didn't do anything right.</span> <span id="s2089">I didn't _____________, now through the years I probably did plenty of wrong things but by then I was twelve years old.</span> <span id="s2090">How much wrong could I have done?</span> <span id="s2091">Why did He choose me and not my sister or my brother?</span> <span id="s2092">So all those things take you back for some reason, it just takes you back.</span> <span id="s2093">I have one son, my grandson is in Northwestern, such a prestigious school.</span> <span id="s2094">On the other hand I'm so thrilled that it's a free country, that being Jewish that my kids could do whatever they want to do.</span> <span id="s2095">I didn't, at least they could do.</span> <span id="s2096">And they could accomplish and they could go to the best schools and we could afford to pay for them.</span> <span id="s2097">So I'm blessed, I'm blessed but probably I took away, I took with me the blessings for my family, for my brother.</span> <span id="s2098">Whatever belonged to them probably, I took it away.</span> <span id="s2099">I wasn't selfish, it wasn't up to me.</span> <span id="s2100">See, we are screwed up people.</span> <span id="s2101">With all the best in our lives.</span> <span id="s2102">We are still screwed up people and that's it.</span> <span id="s2103">I mean, six years is a long time to suffer, a long time.</span> <span id="s2104">I try to be good to people, I give a lot of charities, a lot.</span> <span id="s2105">I help, try to be helpful to people, doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s2106">Whoever comes in, they are homeless, I feel sorry for the homeless.</span> <span id="s2107">I always give them something.</span> <span id="s2108">For Israel, for ZOA, forget about it.</span> <span id="s2109">Ha-dassa (ph).</span> <span id="s2110">Always involved in something.</span> <span id="s2111">It makes me happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: Well, thank you very much for talking and sharing your stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: Your welcome.</span> <span id="s2114">Well, at least this is I guess some of it, I think I'm sure there's more to it.</span> <span id="s2115">And when you think about it and you sit and say, if I did not tell this, why I tell that?</span> <span id="s2116">But it was funny, it's vague, it's mental even.</span> <span id="s2117">I was laying down in front of this building, the building was burning, I was halfway unconscious and here I have my father standing in front of me.</span> <span id="s2118">I mean, what is it?</span> <span id="s2119">Fate, somebody was watching over me?</span> <span id="s2120">Well, he was asking people and they told him that this group is here and this group is there, look here, look here, look there.</span> <span id="s2121">And he was looking all over.</span> <span id="s2122">The building was burning and out of ten minutes I would have been on fire.</span> <span id="s2123">All of a sudden, he's there right in front of me.</span> <span id="s2124">To schlep me on his back.</span> <span id="s2125">To save me.</span> <span id="s2126">And there's other things, who remembers all those things?</span> <span id="s2127">But I was, from 1939 until really we run out of ghetto, I just, I was a smart child.</span> <span id="s2128">I didn't want to play with children, that's all I did, is reading, reading, reading, reading.</span> <span id="s2129">Polish, Hebrew then and Russian, from my parents.</span> <span id="s2130">I didn't play with children.</span> <span id="s2131">Even for the two years when the Russians were there, I was also very unhappy.</span> <span id="s2132">And though, in America I am a happy person.</span> <span id="s2133">People think I'm a very happy, outgoing person.</span> <span id="s2134">But certain things I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2135">I was six months with those peasants, when my father was in the partisans, and I remember nothing.</span> <span id="s2136">I don't know what I ate there.</span> <span id="s2137">I don't remember, I just remember sleeping on that oven and burning my flesh, was burning.</span> <span id="s2138">But the rest of it, and then when they came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s2139">I don't even remember when they left me there.</span> <span id="s2140">I don't remember what I ate, what did I do?</span> <span id="s2141">They didn't keep me for nothing, I must have been either with the sheep in the fields or helping, doing something with the kids.</span> <span id="s2142">I must have.</span> <span id="s2143">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2144">And chunks like this of my life, like they are just out.</span> <span id="s2145">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s2146">Completely out.</span> <span id="s2147">That's the story of a survivor, my dear.</span> <span id="s2148">But unfortunately, every week is different funerals.</span> <span id="s2149">If Hitler would come up, would wake up now, and see that we still, we have a lot of green-na (ph), survivors, who lived a long, long age and lived a beautiful generation, left a beautiful generation of people, lawyers, doctors, politicians, on television, he would drop dead again.</span> <span id="s2150">And every time, I use to have a speech, I'm good in those things, I have to get it out now.</span> <span id="s2151">If Hitler would wake up and see what we are doing here and the generation we left.</span> <span id="s2152">We left, believing beautiful people behind us.</span> <span id="s2153">A beautiful generation.</span> <span id="s2154">This is just the first generation, how about the second generation?</span> <span id="s2155">That will come up also, doctors and lawyers and reporters and involved in politics.</span> <span id="s2156">A really big, most of our kids are educated people.</span> <span id="s2157">Ninety-nine percent of our survivor's children are very highly educated.</span> <span id="s2158">At least a teacher, many more, many are a teacher.</span> <span id="s2159">So I guess we'll never go.</span> <span id="s2160">The Jewish faith, the Jewish religion and Jewish people will survive, will survive.</span> <span id="s2161">They are supposed to be the chosen people, but I don't see it.</span> <span id="s2162">Why pay such an expensive price, I can't understand either?</span> <span id="s2163">But Hitler didn't wipe us out.</span> <span id="s2164">No way.</span> <span id="s2165">No way.</span> <span id="s2166">No way.</span> <span id="s2167">They are going to be alive and free and now we have to work for Israel.</span> <span id="s2168">Now we'll have to see that our generation and our second generation, third, they should be all Judaism, should be aware, and really stand guard.</span> <span id="s2169">I don't know how, but they are educated people, like, God should give, Swen-ton Da-Yah-ho (ph) is a young powerful man.</span> <span id="s2170">God should give him the wisdom and lead us on the right track and Israel should survive.</span> <span id="s2171">And we are human people and we are people in the world, the people who come up with us, that we are a Nation, we are a People.</span> <span id="s2172">And we have to survive like anybody, like any other Nation has to survive, who God created.</span> <span id="s2173">It doesn't matter, black, white, green or red.</span> <span id="s2174">If God put us here we should survive.</span> <span id="s2175">And one should not kill the other.</span> <span id="s2176">We should help each other.</span> <span id="s2177">So now we'll have see that Israel should survive, that's all.</span> <span id="s2178">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p></body></html>
