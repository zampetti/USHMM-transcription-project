Lowenberg.</span> <span id="s25">Born August 14, 1926.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And where are we today?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: We're in San Francisco at 44 Montgomery, in my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And your office, describe please the work you do and where we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Well, I'm in real estate development, mostly industrial, almost all industrial, some commercial.</span> <span id="s30">And I've been in this business since I came to San Francisco in 1950, January 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Let's begin if you would with your liberation from the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: If we, if we start with the liberation was, I was liberated on August, on April, pardon me, on April 30th, 1945, in Dachau, actually in the side camp of ________________.</span> <span id="s33">And because the side camp where most of the Jews were.</span> <span id="s34">Dachau had at that time, mostly Christians, political prisoners.</span> <span id="s35">And the Jewish prisoners, who had come from all part of, of Europe, mostly eastern Europe, they were sent into the side camps and we were in the area of Landsberg and Kahlfring(ph) etcetera, in ______________ we were building underground munitions factories for the Germans and for the V2, they were being built right outside, in those areas and there were _____________ satellite camps, I don't know how many, but quite a few, I was in one of them.</span> <span id="s36">We came there from, from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s37">I was in Warsaw and yes, ____________ the uprising, from Birkenau, Warsaw, Dachau.</span> <span id="s38">And on April 30th, we were in, well on April 24th, or 20, 20, somewheres the week before, 10 days before, we were in one of those satellite camps and we were marched out.</span> <span id="s39">And, I don't know if it's in the previous tape, we were marched out and we marched for several days and we were told at that point, after we were halfway through, one night there'd be, the Germans told us this, had instructions that the war is over and he have to take all these prisoners to Switzerland and the Red Cross has taken over and Red Cross was taking us all to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s40">In retrospect, was a lie, that was only to keep us calmed down and to make us subdued and they could handle us, so, but they marched us two more days and we were back, we were behind the wire in Dachau.</span> <span id="s41">So that was the easiest way to keep us together, not to have us escape.</span> <span id="s42">Anyhow the, the American army liberated us early in the morning and this morning, interestingly enough, I got a picture from a man whom I met a year ago.</span> <span id="s43">His, he lives in Mill Valley, across the Golden Gate bridge.</span> <span id="s44">He was one of the soldiers that liberated the camp that I was liberated, that morning and by pure accident, the reason we found each other, we gave, we honored liberators last year as a Yah Meshua(ph), 50th anniversary and we, our staff had a Jewish, a ______________ , send off ads and letters and they found 120 liberators in this area, up and down the coast, almost close to Los Angeles and into Oregon.</span> <span id="s45">One of these men, during the dinner, that night we gave a dinner for, I was the chairman of it and during the dinner, he said to me, he saw the picture, that famous picture being, which was being used in, for all these years at, at the museum, our museum, he says, "That is not Dachau."</span> <span id="s46">It's a picture that you have seen on the, ______________ Dachau liberation.</span> <span id="s47">It really was Allach(ph).</span> <span id="s48">He said, "That's Allach."</span> <span id="s49">I said, "How do you know?"</span> <span id="s50">He said, "Because I know it as Allach."</span> <span id="s51">So he twist it back and by God we met again, surely I said and he, he showed me, "It is Allach(ph), I can tell you."</span> <span id="s52">And it was Allach(ph).</span> <span id="s53">So I have the picture here, so I'm in the picture.</span> <span id="s54">And since then he, well he's very active in the 42nd division, the Rainbow division, which is the division we were liberated, who liberated Dachau and our camp and this morning, I lunched with about two weeks ago, three weeks ago and this morning he sent me a picture, which I want to give to the, to the museum in Washington, I don't know if they have this, it's a picture of the American soldiers killing quite a few of the Germans.</span> <span id="s55">They lined them up, they lined them up on the wall and they killed them, until an American general came there and saw this happening and he went almost berserk, this general, I'm going to meet with him in a very, very, in the next couple of months, he's still alive.</span> <span id="s56">He was so upset that they did this, he kicked, the machine gun, he kicked the soldier and stopped them using the machine gun.</span> <span id="s57">And they had killed about 17 of the guards and maybe more.</span> <span id="s58">He ________________ me that again this morning with the pictures.</span> <span id="s59">And I didn't, I realized that I saw that happen, but that came back only today to me.</span> <span id="s60">Anyhow, we were liberated and with my luck, a Dutch Red Cross came immediately., for some reason there was a connection about, there were several hundred Dutch Christians in Dachau and other who were, who were political prisoners, saboteurs to, to political, ________________ whoever, if they got you, if you're not with them, as you well know.</span> <span id="s61">And this appear from the Dutch underground and others and the Dutch Red Cross came immediately, within 10 days, two weeks, to, to the camp, with trucks, Prince Bernardi(ph), then husband of the then Princess, who's now, who's now the Queen Mother already, Juliana's husband, came with them.</span> <span id="s62">And they picked us up and they drove us all the way from Dachau back to Holland on those trucks, took about six, five, six days, the bridges were out, you know and ________________ stuff.</span> <span id="s63">I remember we stopped in Frankfurt for some reason and ________________, Iggy Farben(ph) factory, which was a big cafeteria ________________ and they kept us there for one or two nights, one night and we went back to Holland and at the border, we, we were asked where we were from and I was not a Dutch citizen, I had no documentation, all I could say, I was from ___________________.</span> <span id="s64">But I'd only, I'd only lived there since I was 10 years old, we came there 1936, we went over the border from Germany into Holland, only about 25 miles.</span> <span id="s65">Wasn't far enough obviously because they killed all my family.</span> <span id="s66">And the Red Cross took me back to Holland, to, to, to Berculo(ph) from the, from the, that, there was a town on the border, Savina(ph), where they, it was kind of an army, army town and that's where they held them for a day or two and, and assigned us where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s67">And we were, I was in a, in a, in a pair of black pants, which were some pants I'd taken off a soldier, an SS I'd killed and a toothbrush from the same SS man I'd killed.</span> <span id="s68">And the, and the shirts.</span> <span id="s69">We had no clothes except the striped things, which we couldn't get out fast enough and they were very filthy.</span> <span id="s70">So I was in some beat up German's uniform.</span> <span id="s71">And then they gave us other clothes at the border and as much ______________, that's because Holland was in very bad shape in 1945, the Germans had plundered it.</span> <span id="s72">And they took me back to my, what I call my hometown and they took me to the city hall, there was no place for me to go.</span> <span id="s73">The house was occupied that we lived in, it was occupied by people, I had no idea who they were.</span> <span id="s74">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: You remembered the town, was it still familiar to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Oh sure, oh I went to school there, oh sure, went to school there, I mean like my father had a business there, my father had a textile store there.</span> <span id="s77">And there were, there had been 42 Jewish families and it was known in Holland as the most religious Jewish town.</span> <span id="s78">Religious meaning what we call Conservative here.</span> <span id="s79">Everybody _____________ on Shabbat, everybody eat kosher, nobody smoked on Shabbat and nobody drove his bicycle or car on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s80">Very traditional, went to Temple three times a day on Shabbat and during the week twice a day.</span> <span id="s81">And everybody had their different businesses, from cattle dealers to butchers to textile to scrap, you know, typical Jewish trades.</span> <span id="s82">And we had a, a rabbi and we had a mikba(ph) of course.</span> <span id="s83">And there was a wonderful Jewish life there before the war, literary things, my father was quite active in the community and so was my mother and they, but there was no one left when I came there, except the mayor says yeah, there's somebody came back that was hidden and was a man by the name of Mayer(ph) and his children were all, all killed, so was his wife, he survived and was hidden in some farmhouse.</span> <span id="s84">And another couple survived, there were no children.</span> <span id="s85">And then, they didn't, they couldn't handle me because they had no place to live themselves, they lived somewheres in, I forgot where they _____________, weren't back in their homes yet.</span> <span id="s86">And our neighbor, Catholic, was a Catholic town, to some extent, maybe 50-50 and our neighbor came over, they heard about this, a small town, there was 7,000 people and they said, "He's staying with us," so I lived with our neighbors.</span> <span id="s87">They ________________ , they had a room in the back, near the stables, ________________ people have the cows in the, in the winter they stayed, not in the house, but in the back of the house there's stables.</span> <span id="s88">So I slept there and they made a bed for me and I stayed with my neighbors, I couldn't, I wouldn't eat pork things, so I usually potatoes and breads and salads, but I couldn't, I did not eat the, the pork products.</span> <span id="s89">Which, that was the only thing they had in meat in those days, because they had their own, they raise their own pigs.</span> <span id="s90">And I stayed with them for, and the mayor of the town knew my parents quite well, gave me a job in the city hall, to work some clerk, was awful, pencil pushing, you know, whatever that's called and but I had a job because I had no money.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: How old were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I was 18.</span> <span id="s93">In April I was, in April '45, I was not 19 yet, I was 18.</span> <span id="s94">And it was very strange because number one, there was no one left, a few here stray people, Jews, were hidden.</span> <span id="s95">No one came back from the camps, I was the only one there who had come back from the camps.</span> <span id="s96">And there were Jews in those towns in Holland, every town had Jews and, and they had wonderful lives there.</span> <span id="s97">We, we never knew about anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s98">We knew it from Germany, my family and I did, but native Dutch Jews did not know about anti-Semitism, it didn't exist, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s99">And since I was, I was not a Dutch citizen because we were stateless, til Hitler made the Nuremberg laws, said we are stateless, I never became a Dutch citizen, ________________ first I was citizen was when I came to this country, became American in 1954.</span> <span id="s100">Anyhow, so I stayed with the neighbors, then about a month or two and I found my uncles.</span> <span id="s101">My mother had two brothers who were in the camps and I found them in a camp in Holland, in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s102">And I went there...</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: How did you go about finding them?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: By word of mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Was that common, was that going on around you?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yeah, there were, you know, people made phone calls, people knew my uncles for some reason.</span> <span id="s107">I knew that they were in Westerbork when I went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s108">They stayed there.</span> <span id="s109">But I didn't know it because the ________________ that my parents were there, two of my sisters, they went to Auschwitz, my uncles allegedly stayed with ________________ , I didn't know that, but they did stay and they, I don't know how I found them, I don't know how they found me, but we found each other.</span> <span id="s110">I forgot who told us how it was done.</span> <span id="s111">And then, but they couldn't come to the ________________ to Berculo(ph), _______________, there was no place I could, I could put them.</span> <span id="s112">So finally they came anyhow.</span> <span id="s113">But before that, let me step back a bit.</span> <span id="s114">After maybe a month or two, after I came back, I'm called to this, to the mayor's office, in the town and he says, "You know, your grandmother's here."</span> <span id="s115">My mother's mother, who had lived with us, cause she also came over the border from Germany, she was a widow, and she had lived with us for, from 30, from Kristallnacht on.</span> <span id="s116">Was also shipped to, to Westerbork and wound up too, in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s117">And she survived.</span> <span id="s118">So they brought her back and they put her in a Red Cross van and they, she remembered Berculo(ph), the name, so that the Red Cross, I don't know how she, ________________ she got in.</span> <span id="s119">________________ I think it was about the same _______________, I came in from over the border.</span> <span id="s120">They flew her back by plane and she's sitting in the middle of town and the town's all have a square, you know, with a church in the middle.</span> <span id="s121">There is this Red Cross van with my grandmother in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Alone?</span> <span id="s123">Were there others with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, just herself, no one else.</span> <span id="s125">And said, "You have to take your grandmother ________________ ."</span> <span id="s126">So I had no place to put her.</span> <span id="s127">So was this one Jewish family who were colleagues of my parents, competitors really but, you know, same business.</span> <span id="s128">And we weren't close to them, but we knew each other quite well because the Temple and the Shul.</span> <span id="s129">He, they said, bring her in.</span> <span id="s130">They had gotten their house back.</span> <span id="s131">So they took her in, just took her in _______________.</span> <span id="s132">They also took in the three children of the rabbi, who were found by Christian, they were hidden by, in, by Christian families, they took the three, three children in, they were found.</span> <span id="s133">The parents were killed, the rabbi and his wife were killed, but they found the three children, how, I can, I cannot tell you how they found them.</span> <span id="s134">They were hidden in farmhouses, some as far away as 50 miles.</span> <span id="s135">So they all of a sudden had a big family and so my grandmother stayed there.</span> <span id="s136">And then my uncle's got out of the camp and they had no place to live, so they went, came to town, they ________________ .</span> <span id="s137">The only place which had almost a _______________.</span> <span id="s138">So my two uncles, they were still single in those days, and they were born, they were at that point in their 40's already, because the war, in '38, it came over the border in '38 from Germany and they were single.</span> <span id="s139">They were born in 1901 and 1902, somewhere in those years, they were two years apart.</span> <span id="s140">And we put them in the mikba(ph), that's where they lived.</span> <span id="s141">No money, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.</span> <span id="s142">And they had been quite well off in Germany, they were people of great means, my mother's side.</span> <span id="s143">And so I was working and my uncles were cattle dealers and I think I should have it in the story that gives you an, I think I take great credit for that.</span> <span id="s144">The farmers, one day I got a call, I mean not by phone, but they found me and about four farmers came, they said, "Look, we, your father always sold us textiles.</span> <span id="s145">We liked your parents very much, they were so good to us.</span> <span id="s146">Needed credit, got credit, we didn't have money..." That's how my, my mother was always active in this kind of work.</span> <span id="s147">"And we have decided that we took a piece of land, ________________ and we bought 12 cows in the pasture and here they are for your uncles.</span> <span id="s148">Now, my uncles had never lived there, they had never lived there, they knew my mother.</span> <span id="s149">And they said, "Here they are, you go and trade with them and when you make money, you pay us back."</span> <span id="s150">Well my uncles took that of course, it was very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s151">They did and they became extremely successful cattle dealers, to a point that there was another two men, two Jewish men who also had survived, who were friend, old friends of theirs and the four of them, they were the largest exporters of cattle to Israel.</span> <span id="s152">They had boatloads going out of Rotterdam every three months.</span> <span id="s153">And they developed in Israel, the dairy industry.</span> <span id="s154">They, they supplied the Israeli's with the dairy cows, which came from Holland, you know the black and whites?</span> <span id="s155">The Holsteins?</span> <span id="s156">And they were experts, my uncles and their two friends.</span> <span id="s157">So my uncles became quite successful again, in their businesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Let me back up and ask...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Am I giving you too much?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: No, I think you're doing exactly perfectly.</span> <span id="s161">I want to do a test on this.</span> <span id="s162">It's so fascinating, where to even begin.</span> <span id="s163">I want to, two things I want to ask you, first of all, how did you feel, tell me how you felt as, I'm going to try and stay chronological, the photograph, let's start with the photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: The photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: At Dachau, which...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: The one I _______________?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: ...the one, the one, no the one that's in the museum, that is not really at Dachau and where you're in the picture.</span> <span id="s168">Tell me what you, tell me what you remember about that photograph being taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Okay, let me tell you about the liberation.</span> <span id="s170">When, we were liberated early in the morning, saw the tanks coming over the, over the hill.</span> <span id="s171">And we had to scream to the soldier, the American soldier because the wires were all high tension wire and they had to bring in the engineers first.</span> <span id="s172">The next day or so, or maybe a day, within this, there were about half a dozen of us, we could still walk, we were in fairly good shape.</span> <span id="s173">We moved out of the camp immediately and moved into one of the SS barracks.</span> <span id="s174">Why, I don't know and I was the youngest of the whole gang, there was one other kid from Paris was younger.</span> <span id="s175">And, and we decided we, because the Americans immediately closed the camp, it was full of Typhoid, there was Typhoid and you name it, all the diseases, so we didn't want to be behind the wires because it took, they couldn't get out any more.</span> <span id="s176">They were, they were liberated and they were still back, they went back in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s177">The first troops were very good, but the second troops they, very protective of the surrounding Germans, for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s178">_______________.</span> <span id="s179">And we went, I remember, the only time I went to, to town of Dachau, we went in the town and we took a pushcart and we cleaned out one house with clothes and with food.</span> <span id="s180">And what I remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: How did you go about doing that, where were the people that lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: There were people, we just picked a house, I remember, it was ________________ house and we went in and took as much clothes as we needed and, four of us, because we had found next to us in the camp, another small camp with about 40 some odd women, young girls, Jewish women, who were from Lithuania and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</span> <span id="s183">All eastern, eastern Europeans.</span> <span id="s184">And we bought things back for them, they were in terrible, terrible shape, those girls.</span> <span id="s185">And we took ________________ , one of the Germans in the house ________________ tried to get fancy with us.</span> <span id="s186">Well, we didn't kill him, but we put him in a corner, we took care of him that he didn't, he couldn't fight us any longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Well we, we beat him up.</span> <span id="s189">Because he was, he called us, he was nasty, he wasn't, we did what we shouldn't have done, but we did it because at that time it was allowable.</span> <span id="s190">In my opinion it still it.</span> <span id="s191">They, but I've told this many times, I'm very proud of one thing.</span> <span id="s192">That in as much as the Jews were liberated, us, be it anger beyond any measure, we had seen killings hourly, not daily, hourly, morning til night, over a period of years.</span> <span id="s193">I don't know one Jew, one Jew who killed a German.</span> <span id="s194">I'm not talking about soldiers, SS, but not a German civilian, which no one appreciates, the Germans never appreciated that.</span> <span id="s195">But the Jews that were left out of the camp and I've checked this with other friends, so-called colleagues, that when they came out of the camps they did not kill German civilians.</span> <span id="s196">That gives me the pride as a Jew and as a human being, of that we were still civilized after having lived in the mud and the murders and the gas chambers, etcetera, our Jews were still, still civilized.</span> <span id="s197">And that gives me, and that always will give me great deal of pride.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Why do you think you yourself were able to hold on to that dignity?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: We weren't brought up like, look, the people I know ________________ my families and the town I lived in and other towns I used to visit, we were brought up in a, in a, in a civilization which we didn't, we had never seen this kind of thing ________________ , no one had.</span> <span id="s200">But the Germans and Goldhargen(ph) says it very clearly in his book, in as much they didn't, they weren't racist murderers, but they let it happen.</span> <span id="s201">So, and it was consent, the consent of the Germans, the consent of the Dutch, the consent of all the Europeans, the entire Christian world.</span> <span id="s202">And I will maintain, as long as I live and I said it in my own, my own book too, that when history will be written, I hope that some of these stories, writers will say, that during a Christian era, six million Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s203">It wasn't a Arab era, it wasn't a Chinese era, it wasn't a Buddhist era, it was an era in time, in Europe which was a Christian world, Catholics and Protestants and that's when they killed six million Jews.</span> <span id="s204">They can't hide, they can't walk away from that.</span> <span id="s205">It wasn't done by people who weren't religious.</span> <span id="s206">The majority of the people, I would say the majority were church going people.</span> <span id="s207">I know in my town they were.</span> <span id="s208">I went to Catholic school.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Do you, have you over the years developed a thought of why?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Why?</span> <span id="s211">Why?</span> <span id="s212">Because there was deep down anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s213">I mean go, you go back in history, the Jews in Europe, they were only permitted to come to towns, they were invited, if they were invited.</span> <span id="s214">__________________________ Jewish communities there, before the Inquisition and after.</span> <span id="s215">And I found gray stone, which we can go in later, gray stone rubbing in the town I was born, going back to 1530, of my families names.</span> <span id="s216">So I lived there longer than some of the other, non-Jews.</span> <span id="s217">Some have lived there too that long, but, but why did the Christians do this?</span> <span id="s218">I don't know, that, that's something, I'm not a psychologist, but I, it happened, it's there and they can't get away from this.</span> <span id="s219">It happened during a Christian world, in a Christian world.</span> <span id="s220">So, enough of that, I'm, I'm, because there's, there's nothing you can add to this.</span> <span id="s221">I'm not angry about it, I, I, that, that, my feeling has stopped then, because that is, would be counter-productive, I don't say that, I don't think I ever said it to a Christian because they wouldn't understand.</span> <span id="s222">I'm talking about American Christians now, ________________ with my friends.</span> <span id="s223">I couldn't say that to them, they understand it maybe, without me telling them.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: I'm struck by that moment that one day in April, you're in the camps, behind the wires and the next day you're sleeping in the barracks of the guards, the men who guarded you.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, we weren't sleeping so much.</span> <span id="s226">The feeling, how did you feel?</span> <span id="s227">Well, I said earlier, when we were told that the Germans told us on a march from the outlying camps back to Dachau that we were free.</span> <span id="s228">One of my best friends at that time in the camp was a Jew from, from Antwerp, Belgium and we never cried in the camps, I never cried when I heard that my parents were killed, that someone ________________ the gas chamber, I couldn't cry.</span> <span id="s229">I didn't cry then, but my friend cried and I cried almost, when we thought we were free.</span> <span id="s230">But the shock, the variation of shocks and remember I was arrested in 1942, so I wasn't even 16 years old yet, i was 15 year old.</span> <span id="s231">My sister was not even 12, not even 13 she was, well 1928.</span> <span id="s232">We were so numb, we were almost, the shock hypnotized us, I believe and for that matter, I'm slowly getting out of hypnosis right now, in 1996, even now, today...[end of side 1 of tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So let's go back and talk about that photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Well all I know, that the, that the American army came in and we were standing on a bridge, on a tower, on the stairs of the watch tower and I remember, I remembered all these years that they took a picture.</span> <span id="s235">And I also remember that the American army put me in a room, I'm sure they did it with others also and I was interviewed and I remember a soldier sitting there and typing, typing for hours and hours to interview me.</span> <span id="s236">And I can't find, I would love to find that interview.</span> <span id="s237">Some person took, archives of the United States Army, where I don't know.</span> <span id="s238">I have to make time one of these days to find it.</span> <span id="s239">I don't know how to find it.</span> <span id="s240">I know it's there, I don't know what division it would be in.</span> <span id="s241">Could be a 42nd, I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Try and remember some of the questions he was asking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I have no idea, probably the same like you're asking me, how did you feel and what happened and I would like to hear myself or read what I said then, because we were numb, because the night of the liberation, went through a bombardment.</span> <span id="s244">The Germans had taken the anti-aircraft batteries and bombarded the camp.</span> <span id="s245">They killed hundreds of them that night.</span> <span id="s246">29th or the night of the, the night of the, no, the 29th rather.</span> <span id="s247">And they took the aircraft batteries, the guns, instead of shooting where they shot those airplanes, they shot them straight out.</span> <span id="s248">________________ and they killed quite a few of our people.</span> <span id="s249">Because there were probably 30,000 people there, a lot.</span> <span id="s250">And so, I don't remember, I do not remember how I got into the Dutch transfer, because I was the only Jew that I knew, there may have been others, who was on this Red Cross transfer back to Holland.</span> <span id="s251">I know that, I remember seeing Prince Bernard, that was made a deep impression on me.</span> <span id="s252">I don't remember who the people were I was with, they were all Christians and they were ________________ I had known before, ________________ in the camps with.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: How had they realized that you were from Holland, how was that communicated to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: You know there's always the word of mouth and then, and then, what do they call, the, the grapevine or the, I don't know, I found out somewhere that the, the, the Dutch were being picked up by the Red Cross and I got myself on that, on that transport, pure accident I'm sure because I don't know, I don't know if there were other Dutch Jews with me or not, I don't think so, because I would know, I would have stayed in contact with them.</span> <span id="s255">There were none that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Did you, for a moment when you were out of the camp, even though you'd seen your parents going to the gas chamber, seeing your family, at all had, were you at all seized with this feeling of wanting to go search for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s258">Well I knew we had agreed to back to Berculo(ph), but I went also within months, I went to the town in Germany we were born.</span> <span id="s259">It was only, I got somebody to take me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Somebody had a car, somebody in the, in the town had a car, I don't know how he had a car, but he had a car, it was maybe six months after liberation and he took me to that town, I think I took, went by car, I don't remember, ________________ , I don't remember, yet I stayed, you know, he didn't have a car, didn't, that was the second time.</span> <span id="s262">I went there and I stayed with our neighbors, there was one neighbor who talked to us, stayed, had some connection with us, up to as long as he could and when I went there I knocked at the door and when they saw me, I said, they asked me what are you, you know, we talked, I said, "I'm looking for my parents and my sister and my grandfather, my grandmother."</span> <span id="s263">And, and, not my grandmother, she was, she had come back to Holland.</span> <span id="s264">My grandfather though, didn't, my father's father.</span> <span id="s265">And I think I stayed overnight with them, I vaguely remember and _______________, but they said, "No, your parents have not been here."</span> <span id="s266">And that was the answer.</span> <span id="s267">They said, "There are no Jews left here."</span> <span id="s268">They told me that.</span> <span id="s269">I went to a synagogue and it was burned down, they burned it in '38 and it was ________________ there.</span> <span id="s270">Now it's a parking lot, except this woman, this neighbor, she put a little statue there for the Jews and there's flowers there all the time, it's a very religious Catholic lady and I correspond with her.</span> <span id="s271">She came to visit us here.</span> <span id="s272">That was about 1993, I think, it was a visit with her, yeah.</span> <span id="s273">For a different reason I was in Germany with the United States army.</span> <span id="s274">In Holland, rather, Holland, Belgium and France.</span> <span id="s275">And I stopped in Germany to see my grandfather's grave and that's when I saw her for the first time again.</span> <span id="s276">I will not go back to Germany now, I'll never go back, they insulted me.</span> <span id="s277">And, and that's it, as far as Germany's concerned, ________________ went there.</span> <span id="s278">My feelings, I don't know, I went back to Holland, I lived with this neighbors, I went dancing every night, I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s279">Holland was celebrating for a year, the Dutch and the, dances every other night, every night.</span> <span id="s280">I went to every dance.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And did you dance?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: I danced, I danced a lot, I just didn't want to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Who were you dancing with?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: And girl I could, was willing to dance with me, short or tall.</span> <span id="s285">No, I remember that distinctly because there were always dances there, there was, it's not done any more today, but after the war they danced, everybody was celebrating, celebrating, celebrating, not drinking, there wasn't, you know it's not like we, partying here, where you have to drink, the Dutch don't do that.</span> <span id="s286">Maybe, there wasn't even beer I think in those days.</span> <span id="s287">And obviously I didn't drink, then.</span> <span id="s288">And I went dancing a lot, a lot, dance, dance, not to think.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Did it help?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I don't know, didn't hurt.</span> <span id="s291">I don't know, it must have helped because I didn't even have to force myself.</span> <span id="s292">That's all there was to do and you worked and there was, I mean they didn't take you, you didn't have to go to high school to do what I had to do there.</span> <span id="s293">I was just sitting there behind the counter and handing out the coupons for the, for the rationing.</span> <span id="s294">And I did this for about six, eight months.</span> <span id="s295">Then I decided, maybe six months, then I decided to go back in business in my father's business.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Textile business?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Textile.</span> <span id="s298">I didn't have a store, so I got myself a bicycle and two suitcases and through connections my father had, that they helped, they helped me and I had also a first cousin of my mother had survived.</span> <span id="s299">They helped me, they gave me, got me merchandise, was very, very hard because you had to have connections and you had to have a store and I didn't have anything so I got merchandise and then I went every morning, five days a week, I went by bicycle from farmhouse to farmhouse, I was 19 years old, and to sell textiles.</span> <span id="s300">And then when I sold out I went back to the sources and they gave me more, they were, they always helped me, people were always very nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Tell me what was in the suitcases on your bicycle, what were you, what did you have to sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: I sold underwear, I sold yardage goods, mostly yardage goods so they could sew their own.</span> <span id="s303">Holland, woman in Holland are very talented with that and socks, shirts, yardage and I sold that.</span> <span id="s304">And stockings and, and whatever I made, I could buy more.</span> <span id="s305">I never had a store and then after about a year, in 1946, obviously I wasn't making any money and this was no future and I couldn't get the store back because some Nazis had it.</span> <span id="s306">And the town was, it wasn't for me.</span> <span id="s307">There was nothing for me to do, I was the only Jewish young person there.</span> <span id="s308">And I decided that point that I was going to remain a Jew, I didn't think so when I was first liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Just say more about that, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Well I, I, I survived, you know, I had my doubts, I had a fight with God, with myself and God about if there's a God, how can He let that happen?</span> <span id="s311">And we were brought up religious as I said earlier and I had some, not long, it was a very short period after the war that I thought maybe it be better to just throw up any sign of religion, just live as a human being, period.</span> <span id="s312">And that didn't, that didn't sit well with me after a few days because I had too much tradition in me, thinking, then I thought about my mother, she would be totally disagreeing with that and my grandmother and my grandfather, my grandparents for that matter, they would disagree with that and they wouldn't tolerate that if they were alive.</span> <span id="s313">And I'm thinking of back from before the war end.</span> <span id="s314">And I had very good education, I studied not only Tanakh, the Bible, but also the Gemara and, and the other many books, we studied every night in Holland when we were children, ________________ Saturday and Sunday, the Mishna.</span> <span id="s315">So I had learned a lot in my short life.</span> <span id="s316">When I was 14 I could read Roshi(ph), the commentator on the, on the Torah and the mission, so we were highly educated in the Jewish ways.</span> <span id="s317">And that, that, that left something in my veins, in my blood.</span> <span id="s318">So I, I went back and then my uncles and my grandmother were alive, so I think I'm a Jew, I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s319">That, that went by the wayside real fast, just ________________ of becoming a nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: When you were in the camps, did you pray and did you connect to God?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, yes, I always prayed, I have a short prayer that I say even now, the same prayer I said then.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Will you say it?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: It's the Shema, with a few other sentences, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Do you, will you add that?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Can you say that for the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Sure, I always say Shema, the whole Shema, the first three, four sentences and then I say a sentence at the end of a prayer, which is usually said in the, in the religious community at Temples at the end of the service and I'll give you the last line of it.</span> <span id="s328">And that's, that's sad, my mother taught me that when I was a child.</span> <span id="s329">________________ , I trust in God, I have no fear.</span> <span id="s330">And that helped me a lot, it even helps me today.</span> <span id="s331">So I pray that ________________ now and at night I, I would say a prayer.</span> <span id="s332">And, yeah I said it a, I said it a lot when I was in the camps, but I'm not that deeply, I'm religious maybe when I'm, when you listen, like when I was saying what I'm saying now, but I'm not a, I don't feel like I have to _______________.</span> <span id="s333">I don't eat, I don't eat pork.</span> <span id="s334">On the other hand I do eat shrimp and crab.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Well, you live in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I live in San Francisco and where I was brought up they never, I never heard of it, so that wasn't, they never could tell me I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s337">Pork they could tell me, they taught me plenty, but crab, I never heard that word before, or lobster.</span> <span id="s338">We lived inland, there was no refrigeration.</span> <span id="s339">So I never was taught, so that, that doesn't bother me for some reason.</span> <span id="s340">Anyhow, the Jewishness stuck to me, thank God, it really stuck to me and it didn't go away.</span> <span id="s341">And I must say that there's a large majority of the survivors have maintained their Jewishness.</span> <span id="s342">There are very few, very few that I know, survivors and I think some of this, ________________ so close to us and ________________ came out of the camps, but the ones that came out of the camps that I know, they all have maintained the Jewish religion and their Jewishness.</span> <span id="s343">There isn't one I know who has, who really has said, "I'm now a Christian," or, "I have no religion."</span> <span id="s344">Which is a miracle, because I thought about it very often in the last, last year or two, even more so, that all this people I've met around the Holocaust development, the Holocaust Museum, Washington and here, survivors and, not that I'm that close to many of them, cause I don't want to be around them.</span> <span id="s345">I got into, I'll get into that later.</span> <span id="s346">I'm around them, I don't want to live with them, for different reasons.</span> <span id="s347">They all have maintained their religion and look, let's face it, we know when they march into the gas chamber, we could hear the ________________ and screaming, _______________.</span> <span id="s348">The Jews kept on screaming until they died.</span> <span id="s349">So that, one cannot forget it, one should not forget.</span> <span id="s350">And so the real survivors have remained to be Jews.</span> <span id="s351">The majority went to Israel, they had no place to go, but still, they may not be _______________, they may not ________________ to fill in every morning, but they're certainly Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Before, I've a few questions right at the time when you were leaving the camps and going back to Holland, do you recall music that you heard at all in those week or two, once the Americans were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Music?</span> <span id="s354">Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: I don't know, were people in the camps singing, were the Americans singing, was there music on a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: There was no, there was no music.</span> <span id="s357">There was no music, there was no singing.</span> <span id="s358">I don't remember, the liberation if there was any singing or music.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Did you know, did you have a sense Germany was losing the war when you were in the camps, could you tell what was going on with the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: We smelled something.</span> <span id="s361">We smelled something that there was, we saw, the reason that we heard it more was because we heard the bombings as time went on, were in the, in '40, we left, we came out of Warsaw in '44 and the reason we had to leave Warsaw, which is in the, in the ________________ because the Russians poked through.</span> <span id="s362">And they marched us for two weeks.</span> <span id="s363">And you know, you might have heard that we had 3600 Jews in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s364">In the ghetto, this was not the ghetto ________________ the ghetto, but when the fighting, so-called, stopped, the uprising, they took 300 people from Birkenau to Warsaw, to burn bodies and to dynamite the ghetto.</span> <span id="s365">I was one of those.</span> <span id="s366">Unfortunately the museum hasn't made an effort and I have to do something about it, that should be written up more, that story.</span> <span id="s367">Because we went to Warsaw and built a camp within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s368">And they build it up, they bought us all the Hungarians then, in '43, the end of '43 and in '44, June of '44, there were 3600 people alive.</span> <span id="s369">300 couldn't work any more, they killed them, 300 stayed to dynamite the ghetto and they killed them and 3,000 marched out of Warsaw and 240 got out of the boxcars in Dachau.</span> <span id="s370">I'm one of those.</span> <span id="s371">The rest were killed on the road.</span> <span id="s372">And that's the story.</span> <span id="s373">We went through a river, they drowned a lot of our people, a lot.</span> <span id="s374">And see, I always had luck, I was always in the front column or the back column, never in the middle.</span> <span id="s375">And then...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Do you have a theory of why you have that luck, do you have a..</span> <span id="s377">.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Theory?</span> <span id="s379">No, you know, the theories would be a self, self fabricated theory.</span> <span id="s380">I happen to believe that, as much as God didn't pay much attention to us in those days, that he wanted that some of them survive because I believe that God, there is a God and it was pure luck, cause no one can tell you that they were smart enough to save themself from the Holocaust, there is no such thing.</span> <span id="s381">It was pure, pure luck.</span> <span id="s382">Be in the right place at the right time and in the, in the wrong place at the right, at the wrong time.</span> <span id="s383">There is no luck, there's no ________________ , no knowledge, it was pure, pure luck.</span> <span id="s384">Look, I was the first transferred out of Holland in, in over a year they kept anyone alive.</span> <span id="s385">There were 3,000 people on the trains and they kept a couple hundred alive, I was one of those.</span> <span id="s386">The rest were all gassed ________________ within hours after they got to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s387">First transport in over a year.</span> <span id="s388">Pure luck, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: So who can say?</span> <span id="s391">Pure luck, our wonderful family, it was pure luck as much as we all ________________ , I'm sure.</span> <span id="s392">But it was luck to meet my wife in my 39 years, it was pure luck.</span> <span id="s393">The man who hired me also introduced me to my wife and then made me a partner.</span> <span id="s394">He __________________________.</span> <span id="s395">So, no it's destiny, it's who knows, who knows why anyone survives anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: I want to, before we go beyond the camps also, would you tell me about killing the SS officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Oh yes, kill him, we kill him with some stones or some two by fours, something.</span> <span id="s398">You know, we were angry at that point and we were hungry, we hadn't had food in days, four or five days we hadn't had food and they were bombing all night and there were people laying all over.</span> <span id="s399">Hundreds died the last night of the... They knew they're liberated but they died within hours or during the liberation at night, they were bombing and we didn't know whether the Americans were bombing or the Germans were bombing.</span> <span id="s400">We heard the, the, the, the, the, the bombers going overhead, bombing German installations.</span> <span id="s401">But they didn't, but the Americans and the British did not bomb the camps.</span> <span id="s402">They could have ________________ the trains to Auschwitz, you know they talk about the famous, all those lines about why didn't they bomb the railroad tracks to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s403">Well they were bombing down the streets, the chemical factories and missed them.</span> <span id="s404">So who knows?</span> <span id="s405">Their excuse was that we would have killed Jews.</span> <span id="s406">They were killed anyhow.</span> <span id="s407">And it would have saved some Jews maybe.</span> <span id="s408">_______________, but I cannot tell you how I felt.</span> <span id="s409">I came to Holland, was very lonesome, we clung to each other, the few Jews.</span> <span id="s410">We really clung to each other and I used to travel all over the country and I had a chance, after, when I got into this textile business, if I ________________ to spend the weekends through, there were always Jewish organizations coming back, where they had, ________________ store, they had a dance in Amsterdam, ________________ to the major cities, where some Jews came back.</span> <span id="s411">And about, I think 20,000 Jews came back in Holland.</span> <span id="s412">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s413">So we found each other.</span> <span id="s414">And then of course, I, after, in 1946, your arm is going to get tired, let me hold that for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: No, it's okay, I just ________________ .</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: In 1946, I decided that maybe that leads into ________________ question, that I had to get out of my own, oh, I didn't tell you that we finally found a house.</span> <span id="s417">There was a house which was occupied by some Nazi in the city government, mayor, they got rid of him.</span> <span id="s418">Was a Jewish home, was a Jewish house, belonged to Jews from before the war.</span> <span id="s419">And they, they gave the house to us, to rent the house to my two uncles, my grandmother and me and my uncle, one of his closest friends, his widow, he was killed and she survived, she had no place to go either and she moved in, was our housekeeper and we were friends for many years.</span> <span id="s420">She didn't marry my uncle, she married a friend of another friend, my uncle married somebody else, it's another story.</span> <span id="s421">Wait a minute, I think she has to talk to me for a minute, my secretary, hold on.</span> <span id="s422">(pause) ...together, we had a house and, yeah, I can do it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: ...and he says, well so and so, two sisters survived, they live in Utrecht(ph) and those two girls, one of them, was my so-called, she was destiny and so I was I, that we would marry someday, when we were children.</span> <span id="s425">Never happened, but we were always together, she was my same age, her name was Ruth and we found each other.</span> <span id="s426">She and her sister have come back from Auschwitz and they went through hell, those two girls, just like we all did, but they more so.</span> <span id="s427">And so then I went to visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Wait, now where were the girls, I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: In Utrecht(ph), in Holland, in Utrecht(ph) is a major provincial town in the center of Holland.</span> <span id="s430">It's like Chicago here ________________ the railroads, you know.</span> <span id="s431">And they were living with their mother's brother, who also survived and his wife, who was the daughter of a famous rabbi and she was a physician.</span> <span id="s432">And when I visit them, this man fascinated me no end and I, I must have done so to him, he hired me.</span> <span id="s433">He hired me and he said, "I want you to go to work for me."</span> <span id="s434">I said, "But I want to get out of this small town."</span> <span id="s435">So they were in the spices business, peppers, pepper and all this different and they had this business before the war, he and his brother, his brother was killed, parents were killed.</span> <span id="s436">And I went to work for him ________________ five days a week, from town to town by train in Holland.</span> <span id="s437">But the condition of my hirement, I had to live with them because of a very, very religious, kosher.</span> <span id="s438">Now when I tell very religious, they dress like you and I, they weren't with the black hats, this we don't, we didn't know that in Holland.</span> <span id="s439">This was just people who lived very religious.</span> <span id="s440">And did everything else, very sophisticated ________________ but they very religious, which you see here too, but when we talk about religions or anything, it's all _______________, which is not the case, Holland didn't have that.</span> <span id="s441">We never, I never heard Yiddish in my life until I went to the camp.</span> <span id="s442">In Holland Yiddish was not known.</span> <span id="s443">We didn't know, I never knew there was such a thing.</span> <span id="s444">We had Hebrew, we didn't understand all of it, but we studied all the time, we translated.</span> <span id="s445">But we never knew Yiddish, I learned it in the camps.</span> <span id="s446">Anyhow, so I had to live with them and since they were so religious, food was awfully abominable, because she was a terrible cook.</span> <span id="s447">Wonderful lady, but a terrible cook.</span> <span id="s448">And, and, so I lasted for one year and it was no good for me, I went and while I was there I made another contact ________________ was a larger community and Jews have come back, there's a congregation there and Jewish events there, so through that you meet other people and then I went, I was at, in Amsterdam and my best friend, my lifelong friend, who, we were in the camps together and we...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You had known him before the camps as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Vaguely.</span> <span id="s451">My sister knew him better.</span> <span id="s452">My mother knew him because ________________ an orphanage and the, we went back to Holland together, not together, he came a little later, he stayed, I introduced him to his wife.</span> <span id="s453">If that's one of the girls in this 40 girls we found, she was one of them, ________________ .</span> <span id="s454">She is like, she was like a sister to me after that.</span> <span id="s455">And she, she, we found her that night of the liberation, the morning after.</span> <span id="s456">He fell in love with her, we had an American army chaplain, a Jewish chaplain, married them, right on site there.</span> <span id="s457">The rush was okay, it worked out.</span> <span id="s458">She couldn't have children, they had done experiments on her.</span> <span id="s459">But she was like my sister.</span> <span id="s460">To a point, I can tell you when, after the war, I lived with them for, used to visit with them, I didn't live with them all the time, I used to visit, we slept on one mattress.</span> <span id="s461">She was in, she was in the middle and we were on each of the, she was like my sister, we were that close.</span> <span id="s462">They both dead now and he died very sadly.</span> <span id="s463">Two years ago he visited me and he had a heart attack here in New Orleans, on the way back.</span> <span id="s464">He had been here 15 times, lived in Rhodesia, Salisbury, in Zimbabwe(ph).</span> <span id="s465">I went to America and he went to Zimbabwe(ph) because his cousin gave him a big job there, lived with him before the war.</span> <span id="s466">Anyhow, where was I?</span> <span id="s467">Oh, I went from Berculo(ph) to Utrecht(ph), so I made a lot of contacts there and I had a good time.</span> <span id="s468">We had dating, you know.</span> <span id="s469">But you only dated Jewish girls, this was, you didn't, you didn't go out with non-Jews because for whatever reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Were you ever attracted to a non-Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Not to a point of, oh I had some relationships, but not to a point of marriage.</span> <span id="s472">And as a matter of fact I was going to, a girl, I was going with a girl, __________________________ again to Switzerland, who was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s473">I think one of the main reasons I didn't marry her was because her mother wasn't Jewish, her father was.</span> <span id="s474">_______________, I was still of that kind of mind.</span> <span id="s475">Now my wife today is the same, her mother is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s476">So you change, right?</span> <span id="s477">I grew up a little, whatever that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Did you stay in contact with that woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Yes, it takes about five minutes, it's another story.</span> <span id="s480">You want to hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Let me look at the tape.</span> <span id="s482">(pause) Okay, so there you are now in which city?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: In Utrecht(ph), Utrecht(ph) and I didn't like the job I had with this, selling spice, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s484">Was nothing, there was no future there, maybe there was, but wasn't for me and I had to live with them.</span> <span id="s485">So I went into this, this man who knew me through my, my uncle in the meantime had married, one of my uncles ________________ , got married in '46.</span> <span id="s486">He has a son who lives in, still in Amsterdam, we are very close.</span> <span id="s487">And her sister introduced me to, my uncle's wife survived, she was hidden in Holland too, _______________.</span> <span id="s488">And I met this man by the name of Oppenheim(ph) and he says, "I hear you speak German."</span> <span id="s489">________________ said, "Well a little bit, but not enough."</span> <span id="s490">He says, "I need somebody to open my branch up again in Switzerland."</span> <span id="s491">And he was selling chemicals to the paint industry and he had been very successful, they were German Jews, they'd gone to Holland in the early 30's.</span> <span id="s492">They had branches in several countries.</span> <span id="s493">So he hired me to be their Swiss and Italian representative.</span> <span id="s494">I went to Switzerland and...</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Now how old are you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: It was in 1946, I was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s497">Went to Switzerland to become a, and travel in Switzerland to sell paint, paint extracts or paint, oil, oil base paint to the paint industries.</span> <span id="s498">But was an oil ________________ manufacturer, was very well, very highly respected at that, that particular item and they mixed it into the paint when they paint the exteriors in Switzerland and wherever.</span> <span id="s499">And it lasted three years, that job, til '49...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Next time when we meet, on a different, we don't have to do this...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Yeah, we'll do, we'll hear the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: ...will give you some _______________, a real schmutz(ph), you know what schmutz(ph) is?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: I know the schmutz(ph), I know from schmutz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: The schmutz(ph), that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: That's what the book will be called, the schmutz(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Schmutz(ph), I like, I like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: I do too, it's a good title.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: I still haven't been able to find a name for my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: I don't think for this...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Now I'm going to Switzerland and all I had in Switzerland was me, my, a suitcase and a bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: You're always on a bicycle through all these stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Because I couldn't afford a car.</span> <span id="s515">________________ would have liked a car, yes.</span> <span id="s516">I didn't even have a driver's license because why would I need it for?</span> <span id="s517">My boss had a car, the man, he had a car, but they couldn't buy me one and I couldn't afford one.</span> <span id="s518">So I went from town to town by bicycle in Switzerland, I was climbing the mountains and by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What did you wear?</span> <span id="s520">What were you wearing during those years?</span> <span id="s521">What did your clothing look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Oh, I look with tie, I was always dressed ________________ .</span> <span id="s523">Of course you wear a suit and tie.</span> <span id="s524">As a matter of fact, I still have, my clothes are still in Zurich in an hotel room somewhere.</span> <span id="s525">I was kicked out of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s526">That's another story.</span> <span id="s527">I got in trouble for selling some black market business, which everybody did after the war, to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: What were you selling?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: ________________ maybe you should not put this in here.</span> <span id="s530">I had a good friend who was in ________________ my parents and me, we became good friends and he survived the war.</span> <span id="s531">He came back from Auschwitz too.</span> <span id="s532">And he used to have a kosher delicatessen.</span> <span id="s533">And he became a big wheel in the Dutch, so-called black market, he did, you could do everything after the war, cause that's how people survived, that's how people got food and coupons and that was an accepted thing, because he didn't steal from anybody, he was just trading.</span> <span id="s534">But he was doing it on a very good sized scale.</span> <span id="s535">And maybe I should tell this story about him because I admired him so much.</span> <span id="s536">He survived, his wife and two children were killed and by pure accident he found and I don't know again, know how, through the Red Cross I think again.</span> <span id="s537">Because in Holland, published names of people who are found and the Red Cross kept on publishing, every week, he looked at those lists, that's how a cousin of ours found my grandmother.</span> <span id="s538">He read that she was safe in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Where were the lists published?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: In the Jewish press, there's a Jewish press, very ________________ .</span> <span id="s541">So my friend found his sister's daughter in Poland, he had come from Poland as a young boy and he went, this guy could move mountains, and he went to Poland and found this girl, brought her back to Holland in 1946 and she had no place to live, he had a house, she moved in with him.</span> <span id="s542">She was 18, 16, 18, ________________ 18 by now.</span> <span id="s543">And they fell in love and he want to marry her, except in Holland you can't do that, that's against the law.</span> <span id="s544">And so he made a request to Queen Wilhemina, is the only one who can do this, only the Queen and she can give you permission, whatever that's, that's called.</span> <span id="s545">And she wrote him back there's no way I can do that, we don't do this and denied.</span> <span id="s546">So he, when he came back from the camps, he came back on a stretcher and on that hospital where he was brought in over the border, the Princess Julianna(ph), she visits hospitals, ________________ like to visit hospitals _______________, wonderful family.</span> <span id="s547">And she visit that hospital and he was laying in the bed, he had come back out of Auschwitz and they took a picture of her standing at his bed.</span> <span id="s548">And she said to him, "If there's ever anything I can do for you, feel free, you can call me."</span> <span id="s549">Which is, which is like giving you a check you can cash when you need it, you know.</span> <span id="s550">So he, so he wrote a letter after the Queen turned him down, to the Princess, said, "I want you to talk to your mother, I want to marry my niece."</span> <span id="s551">And the Princess wrote him a letter back, these are all true stories.</span> <span id="s552">"I can't give you permission, my mother doesn't waive, no she said so as you well know, but if someday in the future, it will all, things work out normal, I will be Queen, I'm in succession and then you try again."</span> <span id="s553">1948, two years later, Wilhemina abdicated her throne to her daughter, he didn't wait three weeks, he writes a letter to the Queen, then, "Remember me?</span> <span id="s554">Here's the picture."</span> <span id="s555">She gave permission and they married.</span> <span id="s556">And they had two wonderful girls, they all live in Israel except he died on a trip in, he dropped dead in a ________________ at an airport.</span> <span id="s557">But before that, when I was in Switzerland, Emil was in contact, he called me one day, he says, Emil was making deals, American dollars, gold, you know and he says, "I'm coming in such and such a date next week and I'm in a wheelchair and you have to get me off the plane in Zurich."</span> <span id="s558">I knew this was all a scam, I knew right away that he wasn't in a wheelchair, but he sat in a wheelchair and what he had, he had, he was sitting on a wheelchair, on a cushion which was, which had maybe, in today's dollar, in those dollars, maybe three million dollars in Belgium and Indonesian and Dutch government bond, who were totally worthless.</span> <span id="s559">Worthless because the Dutch government made an edict in '45, about within a month or two after the liberation, that everyone who had dollars, I mean gildens(ph), in Holland, had to turn them in and every person alive in Holland got 10 gildens(ph) that day.</span> <span id="s560">Every stock certificate had to be turned in and they forced every corporation or government ________________ to issue all new ones, because the Germans had falsified so many.</span> <span id="s561">They had emptied all the safe deposit box, deposit boxes of the Jews and others.</span> <span id="s562">So no one knew who was what and who owned what.</span> <span id="s563">So Dutch ________________ made a cutoff day in '45, that no one was worth more than 10 dollars.</span> <span id="s564">The phony money, the ________________ money, you went to the banks, later on, every week you could get, release some of it because they couldn't give it to you ________________ , they had to print it and finally everybody got dollar for dollar and the Dutch, whatever they did economically.</span> <span id="s565">So he now, so now it's 1948, about that time and he ran into a guy who says, "You know, I found in the backyard of my uncle, a whole box full of these bonds, they're worthless."</span> <span id="s566">So my friend is smart, he says, "Well," he says, "maybe I can do something with that."</span> <span id="s567">So he gave the guy, he says, "I'll give you 5,000 dollars for it, as a friend,", this man say, "but you have to deliver it in New York."</span> <span id="s568">So I had friends in New York, but ________________ American army, soldiers I met.</span> <span id="s569">And I arranged that I deposit some money in, it's a complicated situation, but I got to deliver 5,000 in New York, through the Swiss, through a Swiss bank.</span> <span id="s570">________________ but I had access to, to the business.</span> <span id="s571">And he put up 2500, I put up 2500.</span> <span id="s572">So now we own all these shares and he comes to Zurich, I take him off the plane and he's got a whole big suitcase sitting on him and a pillow.</span> <span id="s573">And I have no way what to do with it, I've never done this before.</span> <span id="s574">I was leaving the next day for Lougano(ph), where we also had a little office and I stayed in this hotel for a couple of years and I got to know the owner and I thought they are very nice people.</span> <span id="s575">So that night, I had dinner with them ________________ the hotel and then I tell them, the biggest part of the part of this story, he says, "I know who can help you, I can help you," he says, "but the man you talk to is a lawyer in Zurich."</span> <span id="s576">I said, "I just came from Zurich."</span> <span id="s577">He said, "Oh, you got to go back."</span> <span id="s578">So I went back to Zurich and I met this lawyer, I gave him a sample.</span> <span id="s579">From that, within three days I was followed by two plainclothesmen.</span> <span id="s580">I was followed for two weeks.</span> <span id="s581">Two weeks, it was in 19, in August '49, summer of '49.</span> <span id="s582">And finally I got so scared, I said there's nothing I can do, they keep on following me and I don't know if they were police or they were gangsters.</span> <span id="s583">I thought about police.</span> <span id="s584">So I walked up to them, they're sitting on a sidewalk cafe and I sat, I sat down next to them, right on the table, I said, "Are you following me?"</span> <span id="s585">There was a younger man and an older man, they said, "No, I'm not."</span> <span id="s586">I said, "Well, you are.</span> <span id="s587">Last week was somebody else, but there was ________________ two people following me."</span> <span id="s588">So I figured I got to have an emotional confrontation here, so I said, "Look, I know what you want, but I'm scared and I don't know how to handle this," _______________, show them a number on my arm.</span> <span id="s589">I said, "Look, I'm not a gangster, I'm a survivor ________________ the camps, ________________ I'm not a thief, I haven't done anything wrong."</span> <span id="s590">And this man says to me, "You did something wrong, you're peddling illegal documents, I mean stocks, bonds and that's not done in this country," he says.</span> <span id="s591">"And we're going to put you in jail because you're trying to sell that."</span> <span id="s592">And you, and we, and I didn't know if it was that, which, that's what he told me, but I'd also been buying up gold and I was smuggling it out of Switzerland to Holland, gold coins.</span> <span id="s593">But you, and in Holland I could, could make a huge profit every time I and I used packs of cigarettes, you know and things like that to smuggle them over the border.</span> <span id="s594">And ________________ maybe and I thought that could be also it.</span> <span id="s595">So he says, "Know what you're doing, you're selling things."</span> <span id="s596">So he says, I said, "How can I, how can I stop this?"</span> <span id="s597">Says, "I'll tell you what we'll do," He was an older man and he became very sympathetic.</span> <span id="s598">He says, "See my car there?"</span> <span id="s599">"Yeah."</span> <span id="s600">I was in Zurich.</span> <span id="s601">He said, "We are going to the airport right now and I'm going to drop you off there and you get out of this country and never come back."</span> <span id="s602">I says, "Okay."</span> <span id="s603">What was I going to do?</span> <span id="s604">All my suits were in the hotel room, all my clothes.</span> <span id="s605">Never went back to the hotel, he wouldn't let me and to the airport.</span> <span id="s606">Put me on a plane.</span> <span id="s607">I walk in my bosses office in Amsterdam and I say, "I quit."</span> <span id="s608">He said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s609">I say, "I hate you."</span> <span id="s610">I couldn't tell him why I was quit, I was doing on his time, all this black market business.</span> <span id="s611">So I never went back to Switzerland for a long time, until maybe 1980, the middle 80's with my family.</span> <span id="s612">Because now I had an American passport you see, they couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s613">But that's, that's my friend, ________________ .</span> <span id="s614">I mean, great stories, as far as I'm concerned, so.</span> <span id="s615">I still have a suit somewhere's in a hotel room in Zurich.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Now, what happened to him and what happened to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: She went, he dropped that, they had moved to Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: But before that, with bonds?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s620">Oh.</span> <span id="s621">I couldn't have them, I couldn't have a safe deposit in Switzerland after he gave them to me, so I gave this to a girlfriend I was dating, this girl I told you about whose mother wasn't Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Cecile?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: Cecile.</span> <span id="s624">You want to hear this now?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Cecile, so we were going steady, kind of, we were very close and great friends with a beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s627">She was younger, she was about two years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s628">And I left Switzerland, went back to Holland in August of '49 and in December I came to America.</span> <span id="s629">I, and then in '53, in '52, we kept on corresponding.</span> <span id="s630">In '52, early '52, we decided she would come here.</span> <span id="s631">And now it goes in the middle to the, in the, in the end of '52 and she had worked all the, for a number of years, in a children's home, where they had children from England, which was common in Europe, ________________ took children in mountains in Switzerland who had TB.</span> <span id="s632">And for some reason in those days, the air in Switzerland, and the rest, could cure them, today you have medicine.</span> <span id="s633">So she worked there.</span> <span id="s634">And the reason she worked there is, she didn't have to financially because her family had enough, she wanted learn English language and figured that would be the easiest because she was going to America.</span> <span id="s635">She worked there and, when she went to her visa, to the American consul, they had, she had to have an X-ray taken, it's the law in those days.</span> <span id="s636">And she had TB.</span> <span id="s637">Poor girl, she had contracted TB from being around those children.</span> <span id="s638">And they wouldn't let her in this country, they wouldn't let her in.</span> <span id="s639">And it was devastating for her and for me too, it was disappointing because, and that was the end of '52, it goes into '53 and all of a sudden I'm drafted in the army, Korean war.</span> <span id="s640">________________ the Korean war here.</span> <span id="s641">So I'm go in the army, I said there's no way I can bring this girl over here.</span> <span id="s642">I mean ________________ I can, I was making 72 bucks a month in the army, I had no money, I had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: And how old are you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Now I'm 25, 25, yeah it was 19, let me see, 25, 26.</span> <span id="s645">And so I write her a letter, I said I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s646">I couldn't tell her that I didn't want her to come, I couldn't tell because I wouldn't marry if she had TB, I was scared, in those days, you didn't know that TB was curable, in the early 50's, it was a very serious matter, I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s647">So what did I, I said ________________ some other girl here, that's how terrible ________________ , I lied, there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s648">And then she wrote me one more letter back, which I never wanted to read again, I threw it away real fast because it was, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s649">Anyhow, so I had to contact here before that though, because all those bonds, she had in her safe deposit box and my friend ________________ , he went there and met her.</span> <span id="s650">He met her I think once before with me and he picked them up so that's the end of that story and he dropped it, my friend.</span> <span id="s651">I don't know what happened to this girl.</span> <span id="s652">I can't find out and I shouldn't find out, I'm married now.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Did in part you, did in part that feeling like I survived the camp, I mean the first thought that comes to my mind is, you survived World War 2, you survived the camps, you didn't want to get TB at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Well, let me tell you what happened to me after the war, that I haven't said that too often, hardly ever, I don't think I ever told my family.</span> <span id="s655">When I got out of the camp, I knew I was sick.</span> <span id="s656">I knew I was sick.</span> <span id="s657">I went through every doctor I could get in.</span> <span id="s658">First our family doctor, small town, I said, "I have TB."</span> <span id="s659">Why?</span> <span id="s660">Because everybody else comes out of the camps has TB, ________________ .</span> <span id="s661">Doctor said, "No, you don't have TB."</span> <span id="s662">Six months I went back to the doctor, "I'm sick, I have TB."</span> <span id="s663">I didn't feel sick, I had it in my head that I was, that I was sick.</span> <span id="s664">Then I went from Berculo(ph) to Utrecht(ph), I went three ___ to the university, four or five doctors in a row, "I have TB."</span> <span id="s665">And they kept on saying, "You don't have it, we can't find it."</span> <span id="s666">I went to Switzerland and the same thing.</span> <span id="s667">I had this constant fear, that I would end up having TB, because there was no medicine.</span> <span id="s668">I know that my colleagues, a lot of them had TB that I knew and were living with this and dying of it.</span> <span id="s669">And I thought I had TB.</span> <span id="s670">I didn't have TB, I wouldn't be sitting here.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: But she had TB and she was wanting to come to America with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: This story I never told her of course.</span> <span id="s673">No, she didn't know, she was coming here then she found out she had TB when she had to take an X-ray.</span> <span id="s674">The doctors found it, the American consulate.</span> <span id="s675">So that's kind of a sad story because...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: ...she was a, she was a beautiful girl, a terrific girl and we liked each other a lot, I remember that, but ________________ , but a past love affair, everyone has had those.</span> <span id="s678">And not, it's not make an exception with me.</span> <span id="s679">So that, I tell you all my bubbameisers(ph) here.</span> <span id="s680">You know what bubbameisers(ph) are?</span> <span id="s681">I tell you all my bubbameisers(ph) here.</span> <span id="s682">Cause they come to me while I'm sitting here thinking.</span> <span id="s683">I must tell you, that I started saying earlier, my book starts with a line that I've ________________ heard.</span> <span id="s684">It takes 40 years to remember if something bad happens to you, that's in the, ________________ in one of the books of our religion.</span> <span id="s685">In another ________________ mishna, it says that at one of the ________________ , one of the rabbis said it takes 40 years for a human being to remember something bad, if something bad happens to him that they can talk about, takes 40 years to clear out your mind.</span> <span id="s686">And I must say, the man said it maybe a thousand years ago or 800 years ago, I agree with that.</span> <span id="s687">I didn't think about other things, I didn't think about the camps, you know, you think about it.</span> <span id="s688">Not the way I think about it today.</span> <span id="s689">I took showers all those years, didn't bother me, now when I take a shower in the morning, I'm feeling my back cause I have scars.</span> <span id="s690">Now I feel it every day.</span> <span id="s691">I don't feel, I've never felt it.</span> <span id="s692">Smell.</span> <span id="s693">I can't stand chlorine smell, because that's all we smelled in the camps.</span> <span id="s694">This, this, they spread chlorine on, all over.</span> <span id="s695">I smell it more now than I ever did.</span> <span id="s696">Just in general, thoughts about my childhood.</span> <span id="s697">People have, people have said that you remember.</span> <span id="s698">I'm, I feel I'm coming out of a hypnosis finally, after 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Why do you think that's happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: It's because that's what the rabbi said, it takes 40 years to, to, to remember if something sad happened to you, like you don't want to remember and it had to come out of your system maybe.</span> <span id="s701">It's not, it's not, there's no impact on my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: It's a safe enough distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Oh yeah, I can live with it, because I have to live with it and I have enough other things which attract me, my work and I like to work, I really enjoy my work, I love to work.</span> <span id="s704">And my family and my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s705">So I have ________________ being pulled away, ________________ and I do a lot of things that I enjoy, various things.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Let me have you go back and that...</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: My mother's brother left in the, in the 30's, to United States.</span> <span id="s708">His wife had relatives here.</span> <span id="s709">And they lived here in San Francisco, they moved here.</span> <span id="s710">And, when the war was over, I contacted him and my, and his and the two uncles, I talked to in the camp, I said brother.</span> <span id="s711">And I finally went here, my uncles didn't want to go to America, they were too old by then, they thought and couldn't make a living here, the language.</span> <span id="s712">So I went and he had two children.</span> <span id="s713">My uncle and aunt died in the meantime.</span> <span id="s714">My uncle ________________ left, he died in 1951, so I only saw him for a little over a year.</span> <span id="s715">My aunt died later, she had become a very good friend of my wife's.</span> <span id="s716">They became very close, those two.</span> <span id="s717">A very beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s718">And they have two children, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s719">The girl lives in New York, I'm very close to, we talk to each other almost every week.</span> <span id="s720">My cousin, the boy, we never talk.</span> <span id="s721">We talked last year or two years ago, but he, he has got a hang up with Jews.</span> <span id="s722">So he's married to a non-Jew, which is his business.</span> <span id="s723">But he, he is, he's anti-Semitic almost.</span> <span id="s724">It bothers me no end.</span> <span id="s725">He's got a terrible anti, he's anti-Israel and he doesn't talk to his sister hardly either.</span> <span id="s726">His sister Phyllis, who is not involved in the Jewish world as such, even though she is married to a Jew and married to a terrific guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Why do you think he?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I have no idea, I have no idea why he is, he's so anti anything Jewish, he makes very nasty remarks about it and he knows how I feel, he knows how his sister feels.</span> <span id="s729">And his aunts, who are dead now, his cousins.</span> <span id="s730">He has very little contact with the family.</span> <span id="s731">He was sales manager for Levi-Strauss, he's not an incompetent human being.</span> <span id="s732">He, he was in southern California, the big territory for Levi-Strauss.</span> <span id="s733">Levi's ________________ and he's retired now, I think.</span> <span id="s734">He ran for mayor of Santa Barbara , he's no slouch, but I will, I don't want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s735">I don't think he wants to talk to me either.</span> <span id="s736">It's a mutual thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Would you repeat about...</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: He doesn't talk to his own child, he has a daughter, who lives up here and my daughter, they talk to each other, but he doesn't talk to his own daughter, so ________________ see there's something wrong with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: The, about how you remembered the address.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I don't know, I remember more things from my childhood at times, like addresses than I remember what happened yesterday.</span> <span id="s741">I forget who, I forgot who I have lunch with, see I got to think.</span> <span id="s742">But I do remember things way back.</span> <span id="s743">They come back now, they open part of me, they open up now.</span> <span id="s744">A psychologist would have a heyday with me, a psychiatrist would have a heyday with me.</span> <span id="s745">I was offered by a psychiatrist, he wanted to do, really go through sessions and sessions with me and I said, "Not a chance, I don't need that."</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: But you were saying that you, you had heard the address of your...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Well, my mother used to write them all the time, you know and for some reason I thought, I remember my grandmother's phone number.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Number 2.</span> <span id="s750">She lived in a town, there were about 3,000 people at the most, maybe even 1500, I don't know.</span> <span id="s751">They were the only Jews in that town, my mother's mother, the one who went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s752">And there were two phones in the town, one was at city hall and the second one was my, my family because they could afford it, the rest... I told you, we were in good shape.</span> <span id="s753">I know my parents phone number, 270.</span> <span id="s754">I don't know, why would I remember them, ________________ .</span> <span id="s755">I don't remember numbers I've had in here, in this city.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: But the most...</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: That I remember.</span> <span id="s758">I do not remember my phone numbers I had before we got married, say, or the office number, I worked in an office for 18 years until we sold it, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s759">I remember the street address, but I don't remember the phone number.</span> <span id="s760">I should, right?</span> <span id="s761">Logically I should.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: It's not logic.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No, it's ________________ , but I remember my parents phone number and my, look, there were 7,000 people in that town, maybe, it was 270, wonder why I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Do you remember songs from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: No, not really, no.</span> <span id="s766">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s767">That's a good question, no one ever asked me that.</span> <span id="s768">Oh, children's songs, which are, maybe, things like they sing, sing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Such as?</span> <span id="s770">________________ sing a little bit of it if you could?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s772">But every ________________ I hear children sing this, we used to sing the same melody.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Do you remember your mother ever, or your father ever singing you lullabies?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: My mother must have, my father was very musical, he liked to, he played the harmonica.</span> <span id="s775">He loved that.</span> <span id="s776">They couldn't afford violins, things like that, but they weren't on that level.</span> <span id="s777">None of, none of the Jews in where I was born and ________________ I ever went to college, they didn't, most of them, I don't think that, I don't know how many went to high school even.</span> <span id="s778">That wasn't done, nobody went on, they didn't have those things.</span> <span id="s779">They went to elementary school eight years and ________________ , that was enough and that's all they had to, to be.</span> <span id="s780">And except my mother had one cousin who was a physician, the rest were all merchants.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Well let's go back to you telling the man that you hated working for him in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Oh, you mean when I quit?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Mm-hm, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Then I called my uncle in San Francisco, that was in August, end of August of '49, called my uncle here in San Francisco, I said, "I want you to send me the papers."</span> <span id="s785">He just kept on writing me all the time, come over here, come over here and I didn't want, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s786">I wasn't ready yet and I wasn't ready to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s787">For some reason that had no feeling for me at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Because I was in the wrong milieu, most likely.</span> <span id="s790">I didn't, luckily I think, that I didn't get into the DP camps, which happened to most of them.</span> <span id="s791">Most of the eastern European Jews really couldn't go back behind the Iron Curtain, but Holland and Belgium and France, they all went back to their countries.</span> <span id="s792">And why didn't I want to go to, I don't know, I just wasn't ready yet.</span> <span id="s793">I was, it wasn't, I wasn't ready, even though my uncle wanted me to come here.</span> <span id="s794">So I, I got a hold of my uncle and I say, "I want to come now."</span> <span id="s795">And by the end of August he thinks that he has set things in motion and the fifth of December, I left Holland.</span> <span id="s796">You couldn't get on the boats, this was a very serious problem and through, through another friend I got on the boat because this was a big steel company with offices in, in Holland, in New York, in England and they had guaranteed seats on these ships leaving Holland because for the commerce, bring the commerce back and they gave me one of their seats.</span> <span id="s797">It's a mutual friend and he arranged it and that's how I got ________________ to New York.</span> <span id="s798">And I spent about three weeks traveling, sitting in New York with my uncle's wife, my aunt, her sister and I went to Philadelphia to see a friend who had survived, I was in the camps with and then I went to Chicago to see another friend of mine and then I went to San Francisco, by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: What were you thinking on the boat over?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I was very excited to, to get to America, we had this huge dream of America, it's a garden of Eden and all this.</span> <span id="s801">I knew my cabin, there are four people in the cabin, it was very packed.</span> <span id="s802">But it was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s803">We went to Bermuda, went first from Holland to England, to Southampton, then they stopped and they stopped in Bermuda, it was beautiful, I never seen this kind of tropics and this kind of environment.</span> <span id="s804">And then New York, Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s805">And, but it was all, you know, it's so overwhelming, people, people think they remember details, I don't remember, it gets overwhelming, things of importance.</span> <span id="s806">You forget the emotions I think, years.</span> <span id="s807">We act and look and then observe.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Did you speak any English at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Very little, hardly anything.</span> <span id="s810">I'll give you an example how much English I spoke.</span> <span id="s811">After I'd been here for a few, a few weeks, I had a terrible sty on my eye, so someone says, "Well go to the Mount Zion clinic," which as you know, the Jewish hospital here was then.</span> <span id="s812">So I went to the doctor and he says, I remember, I don't know why I remember that.</span> <span id="s813">He said, "Does it hurt?"</span> <span id="s814">And I said, "It's very painless."</span> <span id="s815">So he says, "Painless?</span> <span id="s816">You mean painful?"</span> <span id="s817">I said, "No, painless."</span> <span id="s818">No where'd I get the word painless?</span> <span id="s819">When I used to be on the bus to go to work, there was an advertising dentist, he was called painless Parker.</span> <span id="s820">So I thought, pain, painless, painful, what's the, so I tell him no, it's very painless, he says painful.</span> <span id="s821">That's how much English I spoke, now you know.</span> <span id="s822">But I learned fast, I went to school every night.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: ___ high school in, four high schools.</span> <span id="s825">Washington High, Balboa High, Commerce High and Mission High.</span> <span id="s826">Every night that English class, they had different nights, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays.</span> <span id="s827">Went by bus to the high school from seven to nine and I lived in a boarding house, in a boarding house on Washington Street, right near the Jewish community center, I used to go there.</span> <span id="s828">________________ night time before, I usually worked, I worked quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: What... [end of side 1 of tape 2] Okay, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: ________________ do you have to close that?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Will it work without?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Yeah, it'll work, but it just keeps the dust out, it keeps it more protected.</span> <span id="s834">So, what work were you doing when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: The same, real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: But, well I was hired by this man, because when I came here my uncle had got me a job within a week or two to sell to the restaurants and apartment houses, deodorants and disinfectants and soaps and toilet paper, you know, those janitorial supplies.</span> <span id="s838">It was awful, it was terrible and they didn't pay me.</span> <span id="s839">And so then I heard, having met by now some people, that the Jewish family and children's service had an employment committee and I went there and I met this wonderful lady, her name was Paula Shirnholtz(ph), I'll never forget that.</span> <span id="s840">An elderly person, she worked there as a caseworker and I told her that I needed a job and she says, "Well we have a committee and I will take your case to the committee tomorrow night and then you'll hear from me."</span> <span id="s841">Well, the next morning, or the, the morning after, she says, "Here, go see Mr. Alberton at 157 Sutter and he, he's a member of the committee, he wants to see you."</span> <span id="s842">So I went in there, there's another man sitting there waiting and he interviewed me and he said, "You know what the real estate means?"</span> <span id="s843">"No, I don't know."</span> <span id="s844">He hired me, at, and his partner, there were two partners, a younger partner, his partner says, "____ the guy can't speak English, what do you ________________ ," you know, somebody __________________________ when he was in his late 60's, early 70's, very compassionate, very fine person and he hired me.</span> <span id="s845">So I had to put up signs and collect rent.</span> <span id="s846">I didn't have to be a scientist for that, right?</span> <span id="s847">So that was in 1915, and then I started slowly making leases and making sales and then, then the army came, had to be in the army for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Now, why did you have to be in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: I was drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: But had you, when did you get citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: In the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: You were drafted before you had citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s854">That was the law then.</span> <span id="s855">I was drafted and then I went to the draft board and I told them my sad story.</span> <span id="s856">I didn't, my boss did.</span> <span id="s857">So the draft board says, "Well, we can handle, we can change that, why doesn't he go and join the reserve unit and go into the ________________ , the army base here once a month and he can do it for a number of years and he doesn't have to go in the army."</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Now when you say, I told them my sad story, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Well I told them I already was in a war.</span> <span id="s860">And I don't, I didn't go into details because there was some lady sitting there, she wouldn't have known.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Did you tell them you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yeah, I told them I was in the camps and I was in the, in the, in the, and that, because I said I didn't want to go in any more wars.</span> <span id="s863">But it didn't make any difference to them, that's just a book and they followed the book.</span> <span id="s864">They didn't have anything in the book that you can't take guys with my background.</span> <span id="s865">So they said, "Well, I want to be," she want to be nice to me, really nice, and she said, "Well go to the ___ and join the reserve unit, you go once a month on Tuesday nights and, and, and you don't have to be drafted."</span> <span id="s866">I did that, but they drafted the unit, they took the whole damn unit after six months going through, through this ________________ thing.</span> <span id="s867">And ended up in Fort Worth, 16 weeks of basic training, I was the oldest man in the platoon.</span> <span id="s868">He called me Pop, cause it was all young kids, they were 19 and 20 year olds and I was 26.</span> <span id="s869">And then, then I went to Fort Lewis, they were going to send me to Germany, I refused to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s870">They said, "You got ________________ ."</span> <span id="s871">I said, "I don't care, but I'm not going to Germany."</span> <span id="s872">So I went up to Fort Lewis on the way to Korea and they kept me there.</span> <span id="s873">I became a supply sergeant.</span> <span id="s874">I came out as a sergeant, which is pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: How did you feel, being in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I hated it but I liked it also because, in retrospect more so, I, I never knew Americans.</span> <span id="s877">In San Francisco, the Jewish community center, I go to the Temple, I go, made a few Jewish friends there, met over ________________ and some family, my aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s878">And I never knew the Americans.</span> <span id="s879">So being in the army I met the Poles, from Chicago and then the Blacks from the south and the, and they, and the Jews from Brooklyn, I met every American there is.</span> <span id="s880">Indians.</span> <span id="s881">And, which amazed me the most was when I was the supply sergeant this young man used to come down and say, "Can you read me the letter from my mother?"</span> <span id="s882">They couldn't read and write yet, people who had come in the army couldn't read and write, they were so illiterate.</span> <span id="s883">And mostly out of Tennessee and Indians out from the reservations.</span> <span id="s884">And I was their interpreter and I wrote letters for those kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: You, who was just learning English yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Myself, yeah, but , but I, I could write them a letter to their, to their parents, and they, they all, excuse me, they were very, very good kids and then they brought a lot of Mormons in from Utah, who were very disciplined and very straight and, and others, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Do you remember the content of any letter you wrote for somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Not, these _______________.</span> <span id="s889">Dear Mama, I'm fine, how are you?</span> <span id="s890">Yeah.</span> <span id="s891">Hope you're fine and goodbye.</span> <span id="s892">We went, we had inspection yesterday, or we took a march.</span> <span id="s893">These kids weren't college material.</span> <span id="s894">But the, the Indians were very good, they made very good sharpshooters.</span> <span id="s895">But then I met Blacks, which I'd never met before.</span> <span id="s896">I met people from all over the, different nationalities and background, so, so in retrospect, I still correspond with, with several of them, from the army.</span> <span id="s897">Boys who, boys, boys, they're not boys, they're now in their 60's, who are in Montana, one in Wyoming, one in New York, one in Seattle.</span> <span id="s898">Christmas time we send, we send each other Christmas cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Now one thing I notice about you, you keep everybody in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s901">I can give you a longer list from people I don't want to talk to any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Yeah, but there's an awful lot of people you keep track of and you stay in touch with.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Well, well, yes, not a lot any more, it's, because ________________ people who have not shown loyalty to me and if they don't show, then I drop them, then I can't handle it.</span> <span id="s904">But people over the years, we stay in touch.</span> <span id="s905">Now this army situation goes back, it's only once a year, Christmas time and, and from the camps, the only friend I had really from the camps is the one who dropped dead in the, just two years ago, my friend Hans, we were very, very close.</span> <span id="s906">Another fellow I was in the camps with lives in Paris.</span> <span id="s907">I met him twice in Israel, it so happened, because we have a mutual friend now.</span> <span id="s908">I'm in, in, in, in touch with his mutual friend I met when I was on the board of governors of the Jewish agency and we have become very good friends, the four of us.</span> <span id="s909">But this other boy was in the camp, we had nothing to talk about to him.</span> <span id="s910">He speaks very hard English because he's a Frenchman from Reeon(ph) and we met twice and I thought maybe should get together more, but there was nothing to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: While you were in the army, were you telling, or in America, did you tell people about what you'd been through, did you tell them about the camps and World War 2?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Until a few years ago, maybe now it's 10 years, 12 years, not more than 15, nobody knew that I'd been in the camps, I never talked about it, I didn't tell anybody.</span> <span id="s913">People maybe, maybe people knew, people didn't ask me, I didn't tell them.</span> <span id="s914">People didn't know.</span> <span id="s915">I got involved, through the Jewish family, _______________, called me one day and I was active in the federation in '55 or, I mean every campaign since 1955.</span> <span id="s916">But early Rob called me, he says, "Look, there was an incident with the Nazis in the sunset district and we have to organize the survivors here.</span> <span id="s917">I know you're one," and we knew each other fairly well.</span> <span id="s918">He said, "And I want you to help me, because the survivors are going bonkers, I need to arrest one, one father and son who have burned a Nazi bookstore and you're going to get involved."</span> <span id="s919">They weren't organized, so I got involved and from there and then we had this group, that I've chaired most of these years, I can't find a, a substitute, nobody wants it.</span> <span id="s920">And they won't let me go.</span> <span id="s921">And immediately _______________, every year now.</span> <span id="s922">Then we built the, the memorial, you know, that Holocaust memorial, and which ________________ Goldman ________________ and I chaired and others, but we were there.</span> <span id="s923">She was the chairman, I was, I was the fundraising chairman.</span> <span id="s924">She was the artistic chairman, ________________ I was the overall chairman.</span> <span id="s925">And then we, we build the...</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: You're talking about the Holocaust memorial in San Francisco?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: And then the, the George Segal(ph) piece.</span> <span id="s928">And then we built, before that even, we built the Holocaust library and research center here.</span> <span id="s929">And that was done while I was president of the Bureau of Jewish Education, about that time.</span> <span id="s930">But that was spearheaded by Max Garcia(ph), a Dutch Jew, a Sephardic Jew, is one of the few Sephardic Jews alive here from Holland.</span> <span id="s931">My wife is Sephardic, her father's family.</span> <span id="s932">Originally, great-grandfather came from Baghdad(ph), through England, to Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s933">My wife was born in the Orient, all Sephardim.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Now when you say no one knew you were a survivor, what about your wife and your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: My wife knew a little, yeah we talked, but she never asked me, she didn't want me to talk, cause she didn't want me to think about it and talk about it and she tried not to have me see anything on television if she could help it.</span> <span id="s936">My children knew because they did it behind my back, they never asked me and one day, when they were in their middle teens, I remember it very vividly, I decided that I better tell these kids more than just what they hear, what they read and what they have extracted from me.</span> <span id="s937">So I took them individually, first one, then the other, in the car and we drove up to the Sonoma and I said, "Look, we going to, today we going to talk about, I'm going to tell you a few things."</span> <span id="s938">And they, unless, it felt like, they said both and I didn't tell one from the other, they both said independently, they weren't together, that I brought them separate, "We don't want to talk about it, we know all about it, we know, you don't have to tell us any more."</span> <span id="s939">So they didn't want and I think that was because my wife must have instilled that in them, they didn't want me to feel hurt and to think about it or talk about it, think about it, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Relive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: To relive it?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes, they said, "We know, we, we checked everything out, I mean _______________, we've read about it, but you don't have to talk about it."</span> <span id="s944">So obviously now they're 36 and 38 and we never talk about this.</span> <span id="s945">My best friend, the one, my friend Hans, who I told you, he and I were in Auschwitz together and we were in Warsaw together and Dachau together, he would never talk about it.</span> <span id="s946">I tried to talk about it to him, is because I wanted to prepare myself for my book.</span> <span id="s947">I wanted, he would never, he says, "No reason talk about it any more."</span> <span id="s948">He would never talk about it, he would never talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Did he have a family as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: He never had children, she couldn't have children, she had, they did experiments on her.</span> <span id="s951">She died before he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: How did you feel when they said, we don't want to talk about it, when your children, you were ready to open up and they didn't want to hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: I was a little disappointed and then I also felt that they were very protective of me, so I dropped it.</span> <span id="s954">They knew and they can read and they know.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Would you do it the same over again, if you knew now that...</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah, probably.</span> <span id="s957">Yeah, I couldn't change that.</span> <span id="s958">And that's the reason I want, I'm writing this book, so they have, so they can read it, but they, of course if they want to ask me, they could ask me, they never ask me and that's only because they want to protect me.</span> <span id="s959">And my grandchildren, who are six and eight, by the time they have, by the time can comprehend life a little bitter, better, _______________, I may not be here.</span> <span id="s960">So that's why I want to put it in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: Well what about, what about the interview that you did with the Holocaust museum, have they seen that?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Or read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: You mean I know more about your life than your children do?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: I don't know if you know more, but they didn't read it.</span> <span id="s969">I'm putting all, I'm combining it all in there, in my book, not, there's separate documents.</span> <span id="s970">I had a oral history taken because it's the custom here in San Francisco that the past presidents of the federation have their oral history taken.</span> <span id="s971">And the one who took mine was the ________________ for the federation.</span> <span id="s972">It's not finished yet, it's finished, but they haven't ________________ yet.</span> <span id="s973">And they'll come out the next couple of months.</span> <span id="s974">They haven't read it, they haven't read, I didn't want them to read the manuscript, not of the book, because I want to finish that, but they have not and the one from Washington, I must tell you, I have it in video and in writing.</span> <span id="s975">I don't even know why they want, yeah I think I have it, I know where it is now.</span> <span id="s976">I think it's not so good and I think that _______________, almost think it's boring, but that's me.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: It's not boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: It's not boring, I thought it was very poorly done.</span> <span id="s979">You've got more out of me than they have, I think, right?</span> <span id="s980">Smart.</span> <span id="s981">Very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Well tell me this, how do you think it affected you as a father, especially that you weren't telling them about it.</span> <span id="s983">How do you think having what you went through...</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Well there's a reason for this and I'm going to tell you the reason.</span> <span id="s985">When I came to San Francisco, I stayed with my aunt for a week, my aunt and uncle, then I said, "I need an apartment."</span> <span id="s986">How much, I had no money.</span> <span id="s987">So I got a room in a basement on 25th and Anza(ph), which cost eight dollars a month and I had a bunk bed, whatever it's called, a mattress and a curtain and that was my side of the garage and the other side was a car, left every morning at seven.</span> <span id="s988">I don't even know who's it was, lived upstairs somewhere.</span> <span id="s989">But I, I, I saved enough after I got, I bought myself a radio for five dollars.</span> <span id="s990">So I listened only to speaking, never to music.</span> <span id="s991">Anything speaking to listen to the language, night after night, way into the night.</span> <span id="s992">Damn flowers.</span> <span id="s993">And so that's how I learned the language a little bit and I wanted to be an American.</span> <span id="s994">I didn't want to live with my aunt's here and her sisters.</span> <span id="s995">They still spoke German and all their friends.</span> <span id="s996">I can speak German, to continue that.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: This was, you were out of the village now, you wanted to be somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: I want to get out of there and I went to the Jewish community center and I joined.</span> <span id="s999">Was 12 dollars a year, but I couldn't pay them 12 bucks, so I worked a deal with the girl on the counter, I pay one dollar a month, a month.</span> <span id="s1000">One dollar when I could pay, but I couldn't pay more.</span> <span id="s1001">So I wanted to be an American, I looked up to this whole country and I still do, as much as I'm now complaining more than I did then, because of our damn politicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: But that's being American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: That's being American.</span> <span id="s1004">So I, I went to the center, after the first year being in there, going to school, on weekends went to the center, then I went to the center almost every night.</span> <span id="s1005">And when you ask me about why did he join the Masons, I want to be an American.</span> <span id="s1006">I went in Toastmasters International, I went, I joined, which was very hard for me, but I joined Toastmasters International, later on, after 55, I was in the junior chamber.</span> <span id="s1007">I wanted to be like, and I'm saying this over, is I want to be like everybody else, I want to have that, that part of life had to stop because I couldn't function if I lived that life.</span> <span id="s1008">I didn't want to think about it.</span> <span id="s1009">And I wanted to have my children a normal life, an American, so called American, meaning a normal life.</span> <span id="s1010">I'd been watching some of my friends who were survivors, who messed up their children no end, messed them up, psychic, psychiatrically.</span> <span id="s1011">That's all they talked about ________________ and then listen, I had to listen sometime and I, obviously ________________ , when I was in the camps I didn't have a nice meal like you have tonight.</span> <span id="s1012">And they do this, they did this.</span> <span id="s1013">And I can tell you some of these people are really fucked up, pardon my language, it's not messed up, they're so messed, so horrible.</span> <span id="s1014">I have a guy I help every so often because he, the guy is going crazy with it, ________________ himself, they can't function, those kids.</span> <span id="s1015">They're not kids any more.</span> <span id="s1016">And I didn't want to be like that.</span> <span id="s1017">I wanted to be like same ________________ guy, like this lady is here, I wanted to be an American and I didn't want my children to be affected by that.</span> <span id="s1018">Pardon my language, I shouldn't have used that word, but that's how I felt about it, I was angry that they would, that they messed up their children and I didn't want that and I'm still, I still feel this today.</span> <span id="s1019">I still talk about today and I watched this.</span> <span id="s1020">They're either estranged from the children... I have a couple I ran into recently that I hadn't seen for awhile, they moved out of town.</span> <span id="s1021">I said, "How are your kids?"</span> <span id="s1022">"I don't know."</span> <span id="s1023">I said, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s1024">These were people in the camps, I said, oh no, first I said, "You have grandchildren?"</span> <span id="s1025">That's how I started out, because you know, I love my grandchildren, I have a great time with them.</span> <span id="s1026">They said, "Oh, we never see our grandchildren."</span> <span id="s1027">I said, I said, "How can you talk like that Helga?"</span> <span id="s1028">I said, "What about your son?"</span> <span id="s1029">"We never see him."</span> <span id="s1030">I haven't, I talked about it for one week to my wife, I said, "I can't believe them."</span> <span id="s1031">And these are nice people, these are not slobs, these are nice, decent, good citizens.</span> <span id="s1032">Intelligent, successful, they're retired.</span> <span id="s1033">And they messed up their children.</span> <span id="s1034">And I was right, I didn't want to live that, I smelled it, I saw it in Holland right after the war.</span> <span id="s1035">I saw the cliques and they sit there and ________________ about how it was in Auschwitz, how it was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1036">I said, I knew it already.</span> <span id="s1037">Now a lot of, some of the more intelligent survivors didn't talk to each other about it and when the conversation come up, there was nothing to, there was nothing to remember and nothing to commiserate at the misery, because it would only perpetuated, I wanted to be like everybody else and I will tell you today, I succeeded to the point that my children are very, very normal, very successful, very smart, they have everything.</span> <span id="s1038">They're college educated, they have it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And what did they think when you started getting involved with the Holocaust memorial here and the Holocaust Museum nationally and that part of your life started expressing itself more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Good question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Did my children, did my children and my wife encourage that?</span> <span id="s1043">First of all I didn't ask them.</span> <span id="s1044">Second of all, if I had asked them, they would have said, "What do you need that for?"</span> <span id="s1045">My wife more so than my children, most likely.</span> <span id="s1046">Most likely I shouldn't say, because I know.</span> <span id="s1047">I did it anyhow because I, I was asked, I felt I owe and it had to be done by someone who, who was willing to do it and, and, and had the connections nationally, was politically involved.</span> <span id="s1048">And just as a matter of, I think that I couldn't walk away from this, since I was asked.</span> <span id="s1049">And I was asked locally was mine, it was easy.</span> <span id="s1050">Nationally it was much, much more, more a bigger commitment.</span> <span id="s1051">They were very proud of me.</span> <span id="s1052">They always applauded it, my children and my wife, but if I, if they had to make a decision for me, they would have says no, enough is enough.</span> <span id="s1053">Which I think was normal and I would have done the same in their position, because they're very protective of me.</span> <span id="s1054">So that's why I didn't ask them.</span> <span id="s1055">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1056">Now, did they go to the opening, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: And what happened that night and that week in your family's life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: In the opening?</span> <span id="s1059">Well, I tell you, since Susan works with me here, she saw more what's going on and, but David really, really took to this, to a point that I could see it on his face.</span> <span id="s1060">His wife also went of course and his wife and I are very close, she's a wonderful, wonderful girl.</span> <span id="s1061">They understood it even better, they were very proud that they could see their father's name on the wall there, as one of the markers, you know.</span> <span id="s1062">And, and maybe they didn't understand when I was ________________ there twice a month for many years.</span> <span id="s1063">________________ all about, cause was hard to understand for anyone.</span> <span id="s1064">But when they saw that, and Fern had been with me in Washington of course, not often, but you know, a few times.</span> <span id="s1065">On the way to Israel we stopped over there, so she was with me.</span> <span id="s1066">And of course they, they understand it fully.</span> <span id="s1067">It was not that there was any remorse or regret that they had not stopped me, to the contrary, it's just not discussed.</span> <span id="s1068">That's what he wants to do, that's what he has to do, that's what he should do.</span> <span id="s1069">Oh yeah, and the kishkas(ph) in the, in the, in _______________, they know that it has to be done.</span> <span id="s1070">They're very, very, my daughter is more of a street person, like me.</span> <span id="s1071">David is, there's no gray with him, it's white or black.</span> <span id="s1072">And he's a very, very successful surgeon, he's an orthopedic surgeon here.</span> <span id="s1073">Very, he's a, he's a real star.</span> <span id="s1074">I can say that because people tell me that daily.</span> <span id="s1075">So he's on his own and so there's nothing, in retrospect it's good and I know they're very proud of that.</span> <span id="s1076">That's all but, did he agree with me at times, no.</span> <span id="s1077">Not that he said it, but I could feel it.</span> <span id="s1078">My wife says, "God, you're killing yourself, you're killing yourself, schlepping(ph) there all the time," you know, flying back and forth.</span> <span id="s1079">What can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: I have about five questions at once here.</span> <span id="s1081">First of all, how, did they ever see your tattoo growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: The children?</span> <span id="s1083">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: What did they, how did you explain that to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Well, the early days I couldn't explain it ________________ .</span> <span id="s1086">Even my granddaughter asked me not to long ago, what is that?</span> <span id="s1087">Oh she said, "Is that your phone number?"</span> <span id="s1088">Something like that, the little one, you see and I couldn't explain this to a five year old, four year old, five year old then maybe.</span> <span id="s1089">I said, "I'll tell you one of these days."</span> <span id="s1090">My children?</span> <span id="s1091">Fern told them, my wife told them, I'm positive, because they didn't press the issue and I've never heard them say, that's, like, things like my father had a number on his arm, you see, I never heard them say that.</span> <span id="s1092">Because it's private.</span> <span id="s1093">I tried to, I tried to wear long sleeves most of the time, which I notice a lot of survivors do.</span> <span id="s1094">You don't want to, except when I'm in Hawaii where we go on the beach, or on the pool here, swim every morning, that you can't help it.</span> <span id="s1095">People are very respectful of it, to me at least and the ones who ask, I will explain.</span> <span id="s1096">Non-Jews don't understand, some of them really don't know what it is.</span> <span id="s1097">And then I explain it.</span> <span id="s1098">And Jews, if they have to ask me, then there's something wrong with them, they should know.</span> <span id="s1099">And do I, I tried to play it down, that's why I don't wear short sleeve shirts in the summer or in the winter.</span> <span id="s1100">So and the children never, they never made an issue of it.</span> <span id="s1101">I'm sure their mother explained it to them because that's the protection ________________ they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: The man who hired me also introduced me to my wife.</span> <span id="s1104">That's Mr. Albertson.</span> <span id="s1105">They lived in the same building together, they were friends, family friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Here in...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Here in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1108">He and my wife's family, they were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Where was she while you were in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: At, in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s1111">She went to Lowell High School and she went to Stanford, when I was in the camps, kind of, you know, she, she was born in the Orient, came to this, came back here before the war, parents divorced.</span> <span id="s1112">She was raised by aunts, two aunts, who were like parents to me, she had two wonderful aunts.</span> <span id="s1113">They also born in the Orient, they spoke Chinese fluently.</span> <span id="s1114">They were born there, so was their father.</span> <span id="s1115">They were Sephardic Jews who were in business in Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1116">And my wife was born there, so she was here during the war, so was her father, he had come back here.</span> <span id="s1117">And they were in the import-export business in San Francisco, the offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Manilla.</span> <span id="s1118">So they didn't know much about, first of all, they were Sephardic Jews so they had no, no relationship with any Ashkenazim in Europe, so nobody was killed, except my wife's, two of her aunts died in the Japanese concentration camps in Hong Kong, because the Japanese interned the British, they all had British passports.</span> <span id="s1119">So they died in the camp.</span> <span id="s1120">Not for, not like the Germans, they died there of, I don't know if it was malnutrition or some diseases, but it was different.</span> <span id="s1121">That's the only relationship they had with the war, cause they were British subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Were you afraid for her to find out when you first met her?</span> <span id="s1123">Anything about your past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: No, that didn't bother me.</span> <span id="s1125">No, but I didn't make an issue of it, I didn't make an issue of it because, like I said earlier, I didn't want to be like, I don't like to be around survivors.</span> <span id="s1126">They're very narrow minded, at least the group here in San Francisco, others I know in other parts of the world, over the years, but here in San Francisco it's so, it's not a, I don't enjoy this group at all, that's between us, maybe I shouldn't put it on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: That's to be stricken from the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Yeah, but their nice people and I, we go out with some of them, every so often we have them over, they go to their house, to keep this relationship, but no, they're not, they don't think like I do, meaning I don't want to live that life any more.</span> <span id="s1129">I want to live like the rest of, like everybody else in this town, like 740,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: One thing you're saying that kind of amazes me is that you say you go swimming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: From the first interview, you said that you didn't, as a child you weren't allowed to learn to swim, because of being a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Ah, and I lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s1134">They took the kids swimming, you know, not every day, but you know, once a month, once a week, I forget.</span> <span id="s1135">Because I was the only Jewish child in the entire school of 800 children and there's a, there was a city pool they used, on the outskirts of town and I was, I went in that pool once, I think it was in first grade, was in 1932, or thereabouts, in '33, then I could never go in there again, they let me, I had to sit on the side, while, while all the other kids were swimming.</span> <span id="s1136">And I was the only Jew there.</span> <span id="s1137">Couldn't have really messed up too badly, but there's anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1138">And the head of the school was an anti-Semite, my teacher was not, but head of the school a was a Nazi, so no, I never learned to swim until, until I was in the army.</span> <span id="s1139">I never had lessons, I just taught myself.</span> <span id="s1140">Now I can swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: ...nobody else ever, nobody else ever asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Well, thank you for saying that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: You should just use your own judgment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Well, one thing, as I'm listening to you, talk about being, how did you make your political decisions, when did you become political and how did you choose what political party to, oh wait.</span> <span id="s1147">How did you choose your political affiliation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Well, as you know my wife will, will take, she would love to sit here now and explain it to you.</span> <span id="s1149">She keeps on, my wife was a Republican when I met her.</span> <span id="s1150">I can't explain why, but she was.</span> <span id="s1151">When I met her I was a register, registered Democrat.</span> <span id="s1152">Why?</span> <span id="s1153">Because the Jews in San Francisco are all Democrats, so that you know, you ask around, you register, so you register like all the rest of the Jews, Democrat.</span> <span id="s1154">Until, until, I think was around the Nixon, Nixon era, or there about and I became more conservative and definitely when the Reagan, I really did not get involved in, in, in overt politics until Reagan, national politics.</span> <span id="s1155">For some reason I got involved with the Reagan campaign here and I used to go and travel with Reagan in southern California to introduce him to Jewish audiences, B'nai Brith lodges and Temples and all this.</span> <span id="s1156">Because mutual friend was very close to his campaign and he asked me to fly down there.</span> <span id="s1157">And then I worked very hard, I was a chairman for Reagan in San Francisco, ________________ Jews.</span> <span id="s1158">And I'm very conservative and apropos, the majority of survivors and I'm talking about camp survivors, now everybody thinks they're a survivor, but camp survivors, are Republicans, are conservative.</span> <span id="s1159">It surprises ________________ because the biggest surprise when you talk to ________________ so-called, they say, "How can you, how can you, a guy was in the camps, how can you be a Republican or be so conservative?"</span> <span id="s1160">It blows people's minds, I'm talking about Jews, it blows their mind, cause I'm supposed to be a real bleeding heart liberal, you know, who gives everybody else's money away, except their own.</span> <span id="s1161">And you see I'm prejudiced, right?</span> <span id="s1162">And I'm conservative, because I had to make it, I did.</span> <span id="s1163">When I was in the army, I made 72 dollars and that's all I had and I bought a war bond of 18 dollars and 75 cents, every month for two years.</span> <span id="s1164">Did I have money left over?</span> <span id="s1165">No, because I didn't have enough money because you know, I have to get, certain necessary things you have to buy.</span> <span id="s1166">I worked at night as a waiter on top of it, every night and Saturday and Sunday, cause I'm conservative and I, I believe that you do it yourself, you help, obviously you know my life a little bit, people that need you, help them.</span> <span id="s1167">That's why I'm involved so much with all the institutions here.</span> <span id="s1168">But, but, this, this liberalism to me, is pulling the country in the direction Russia went.</span> <span id="s1169">Russia is a basket case, they can never get out of this, Russia is gone.</span> <span id="s1170">They can't pull out of this.</span> <span id="s1171">And, and I see, I see how we ________________ the deterioration which starts with the economics and then it goes into the mentality of people and the crime, it's all part of this, this, this ultra-liberalism and I cannot stomach this, I can't handle, I think it's wrong, you need to be more conservative, the liberalism is not going to, is not going to work the way this is designed for this country.</span> <span id="s1172">It isn't going to work.</span> <span id="s1173">Holland has a liberalism in a different way and I watch Holland's ________________ the Dutch press, I read a little bit, not much and theirs is working differently, it's working better than ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Why do you think that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Cause they're controlling it differently, they don't let it get out of hand and the government controls it, so they don't let, they, the special interests groups, who direct things without really having knowledge, for instance this, this, this thing this week about the trees up in, up north, a thousand people demonstrated.</span> <span id="s1176">Two-thirds have never been up there, they don't know anything about it, they saw dead trees and I think that sometimes you have to help nature.</span> <span id="s1177">They weren't destroying the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1178">Plus the fact, how many people are out of jobs there?</span> <span id="s1179">There's, the unemployment is unbelievable there in that area.</span> <span id="s1180">Because that's all they had to live off, that industry.</span> <span id="s1181">Destroy it?</span> <span id="s1182">They're destroying, they're destroying an industry, very simple.</span> <span id="s1183">Cause, it's the eagle.</span> <span id="s1184">They don't care about those God damn trees.</span> <span id="s1185">Sure, I'm saying they should take all the trees down, but in an orderly fashion you can handle that, but no by saying, not negotiable.</span> <span id="s1186">The people on welfare because of this.</span> <span id="s1187">And there must be a middle path.</span> <span id="s1188">You don't have to be on welfare, everybody.</span> <span id="s1189">Healthy, workable people.</span> <span id="s1190">But there's no other industry up there.</span> <span id="s1191">It happens constantly.</span> <span id="s1192">I can tell you that closing up the situation was chairman of the, he built a wing, the new wing on the Jewish home, he lost, we had, ________________ certain glass, from PPG, largest company in the country.</span> <span id="s1193">We found out after we were waiting for delivery that the factory closed up because, it was closed up because of, happened to be the union closed up that factory and we had to go to Spain and buy that, that whole town was unemployed.</span> <span id="s1194">There's got to be a middle path.</span> <span id="s1195">You see this, it goes too far.</span> <span id="s1196">Now as a dictatorship, my side, no it's no dictatorship.</span> <span id="s1197">But some people need, some people need guidance, but not the guidance of saying, we'll worry about you, just get out of bed in the morning, if you don't want to get up, we'll pay you anyhow.</span> <span id="s1198">That's why, my kid's think I'm, my daughter is a Democrat, my son is a Democrat, they think I'm Atilla the Hun.</span> <span id="s1199">They think I'm too far to the right, but I don't care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: So what lies ahead for you, what do you see ahead for yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: For me?</span> <span id="s1202">Not much any more, you know, I had some medical problems and this, I'm going through that, slowly I'm getting much better, I'm almost back to normal, but I, I have a pacemaker and I had some heart problems and I, I think I'm okay with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Is that part of what motivated you to write the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: No, but, no, no, what motivated me was basically because I was thinking about it more and I want my grandchildren to know where they came from, what they, what they, who their grandfather was.</span> <span id="s1205">One of my serious problems I have and I thought about it yesterday, I don't know why it came to my mind, that most people can go to a grandfather or to a relative and say, "What happened when I was a child?"</span> <span id="s1206">And I've no one to ask.</span> <span id="s1207">I don't know, I'd like to know more about my grandparents.</span> <span id="s1208">I know that I knew them, I know they lived there.</span> <span id="s1209">My father's sister, she disappeared, she died in Auschwitz, we don't know where, how, what date.</span> <span id="s1210">My grandfather died, was killed in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1211">But I've no one to ask.</span> <span id="s1212">Someone, anyone you see has someone they can ask, there's some relative and I have no one.</span> <span id="s1213">That bothers me at times and it's, it's the link that I cannot repair.</span> <span id="s1214">So at least I feel that I got to pick up where I remember.</span> <span id="s1215">I have no uncles to ask, my cousins all young, I'm the oldest, so they don't know.</span> <span id="s1216">And I had one aunt and a first cousin on my father's was still alive, she lives in upstate New York.</span> <span id="s1217">And ________________ , I talk to them regular, I'm very close to her children.</span> <span id="s1218">But I went to see, I made a special trip, I took my tape recorder with me, I said, "Sophie," her name is Sophie, Aunt Sophie, she's 97.</span> <span id="s1219">So I tried to get some out of her, I couldn't, she was too old.</span> <span id="s1220">Was too old, I went too late.</span> <span id="s1221">Because ________________ this book about, I went about a year, two years ago and I spent the day with her and I ask her daughter to try and she couldn't get it out of her.</span> <span id="s1222">She can't talk, this is somebody older, so there's no one left.</span> <span id="s1223">I have cousins in Jerusalem, my mother had a first cousin in Jerusalem, they ________________ , they gave me pictures.</span> <span id="s1224">So I have some pictures of my parents.</span> <span id="s1225">I had no pictures.</span> <span id="s1226">Now I have pictures.</span> <span id="s1227">In 1980's, in the '70's or whatever, I ________________ to my cousin in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: You had gone until the 1970's from, from that last image of them in the camp to the 1970's without seeing a, even a picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: I never had a picture.</span> <span id="s1230">But the pictures I have now, they're not that good, they're all taken in the 30's when there was already, when they already, their faces are not that, that happy.</span> <span id="s1231">I have some pictures, except for pictures of my grandparents, my mother's side, silver wedding anniversary in 1917, I have two pictures that I found in Jerusalem and I really enjoy looking at those pictures every so often, my parents.</span> <span id="s1232">And then, and I have a picture of my father, which is not a very good picture and I have only one picture of my sister and I found by accident, the neighbors had it when she was maybe 10 years old, I don't think she was 12, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1233">So that's the only picture I have of my sister.</span> <span id="s1234">And that link I miss, that I can't, I have no one to ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: I know, I think about that for you, of all those events you've lived through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I think, I think about it very often, that my mother, would she enjoy seeing my children, my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1237">Of course life, life stops even in normal times, but wouldn't she like to see my success?</span> <span id="s1238">You know, could she ever dream that I would be what I am?</span> <span id="s1239">I'm known worldwide, I don't mean to impress you, I mean I have friends all over the world because of my Jewish activities and, not so much the museum, that too, in this country.</span> <span id="s1240">My success, I have no need for money, I've got it all, two houses.</span> <span id="s1241">What else can a guy ask for?</span> <span id="s1242">I got a great family.</span> <span id="s1243">And I, and I think of very often, my father and mother, if they could only see this, cause they, they were very emotional, especially my mother and so was my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1244">They cried when somebody had a baby they cried, they cried for everything, you know how the Jews ________________ ?</span> <span id="s1245">But that would be, that would be a great thing which, under normal conditions that wouldn't have been alive with my great grandchildren are, chances are because they, they died in 1943, they were killed in 43 when they were 46 years old.</span> <span id="s1246">So, take your numbers I mean, ________________ the chances they would know more than grandchildren, minimum, they were in their late 20's.</span> <span id="s1247">________________ my wife and I married, I was 31, I was 31, she was 30.</span> <span id="s1248">So, that luck only ________________ people who marry very young and stay together, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: The odds of that are slim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Oh yeah, chances are.</span> <span id="s1251">But I would have, I think about it frequently, not often, but frequently.</span> <span id="s1252">_________________, my mother could only see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: It's ironic that being Jewish brought you the worst parts of your life and the best parts of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1255">I don't think it was Jewish, could be yeah, because of the camps, but the Christians went to the camps too, a few.</span> <span id="s1256">And look what it did to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1257">I saw thousands of Russians being killed, in front of us in Auschwitz and other camps.</span> <span id="s1258">They killed them.</span> <span id="s1259">Put them in ice water, big pools of ice water.</span> <span id="s1260">It wasn't only the, it was the Jews or the Gypsies, they did it to the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
