and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: I had one brother named Armon Schafler.</span> <span id="s29">He was two years older than me.</span> <span id="s30">He was born on February 28th, 1933, and he died in -- on March 14th, 1999 in Los Angeles where he had resided all his years in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And when and where were your parents born?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My parents were born -- my mother was born in a small town called Berehomet, which was on the border of the Bukovina and Poland in -- when -- when the Bukovina became part of Romania, Berehomet became part of Romania as well.</span> <span id="s33">And her -- my grandparents lived there.</span> <span id="s34">Their -- my mother's maiden name was Hollar, Klara Hollar-Schafler.</span> <span id="s35">My grandparents' name was Malka -- grandmother's name was Malka Hollar.</span> <span id="s36">My grandfather's name was Malkilabe(ph) Hollar.</span> <span id="s37">And my mother also had other siblings in the family.</span> <span id="s38">She had two sisters that survived the Holocaust, but her brother did not.</span> <span id="s39">He was deported from Berehomet with his family to -- to Moldova, to Transnistria, and they -- well, they -- they were either beaten to death or died of starvation.</span> <span id="s40">He didn't.</span> <span id="s41">He was very ill, and he died in 1945 in our house, but he was very ill.</span> <span id="s42">My mother had another brother who was a banker in Indiana and during Kristallnacht, he -- he was -- the police came to pick him up, told him that he needed to open the bank for some urgent matter, and he was never seen again.</span> <span id="s43">His name was Benja -- Bena Hollar in Vienna.</span> <span id="s44">So they -- in the morning, they let her know that he had a sudden appendicitis attack and died.</span> <span id="s45">So his wife and son left Austria and went to the United States.</span> <span id="s46">His son became a professor at the University of Connecticut at the Connecticut Institute for Research.</span> <span id="s47">And I don't know, the lady, his widow, died.</span> <span id="s48">My father was born in a town called Vishnitz.</span> <span id="s49">He comes from a long line of people that lived in Vishnitz, and Vishnitz is also part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s50">And a long line of people empowered.</span> <span id="s51">Somebody had -- with an interest had tracked the Schafler family in Vishnitz and tracked it down to 19 -- to 1845 where the -- the town, it probably the equivalent of mayor or executive, was a Schafler.</span> <span id="s52">And the Schafler family was a ______ educated family in Vishnitz.</span> <span id="s53">That's all I know.</span> <span id="s54">My father's parents I did not know.</span> <span id="s55">They died during the 1918 group epidemic.</span> <span id="s56">My father was, at the time, a student at the University of Konstanz in Germany.</span> <span id="s57">So he didn't know too much about them, about their death.</span> <span id="s58">And then he -- and then he -- at the time, he may have also ready been -- he was eventually a prisoner in Moscow, the German army -- he was in the German army and he was taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s59">So he didn't know much about the circumstances of their death.</span> <span id="s60">But that's all I know about my -- he had -- he had siblings.</span> <span id="s61">He had two sisters and -- and a brother.</span> <span id="s62">And there's more about -- it was an interesting experience.</span> <span id="s63">One of his sisters when -- when the Bukovina was annexed to Soviet Union, one of his sisters was married to a very wealthy man.</span> <span id="s64">And he was with her when they had two children, and they had a baby.</span> <span id="s65">They were -- as soon as the Soviet -- the Soviets occupied Chernowitz and Bukovina, they were deported to -- to Siberia, to Siberia.</span> <span id="s66">So they -- they went with the older children who were then teens, and they left the baby behind to their sister.</span> <span id="s67">They figured they're coming back and they'll get him.</span> <span id="s68">Well, they -- they didn't come back.</span> <span id="s69">They came like 40 years later.</span> <span id="s70">They went to Israel, and the son was raised by the sister and didn't know his parents and did not relate to them, and that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s71">And the others -- I don't know -- you know, they died of natural causes in various places, mostly in the United States.</span> <span id="s72">They all came to United States.</span> <span id="s73">They were not interred in any concentration camp; as were my mother's sisters, they were not interred either.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: And can you tell me what was your family life like?</span> <span id="s75">What was your childhood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Well, my family life was a middle class, upper middle class family life.</span> <span id="s77">We lived in -- in those days, everybody lived in apartment.</span> <span id="s78">I guess they owned it or they didn't own it, I don't really know that.</span> <span id="s79">But we had a lovely apartment.</span> <span id="s80">We always had household help, a maid.</span> <span id="s81">When I was younger, we had a nurse maid, sort of a nanny.</span> <span id="s82">We -- I was -- it was a very nice apartment.</span> <span id="s83">We had a nice life.</span> <span id="s84">My dad was the -- was a CPA.</span> <span id="s85">He was an accountant and financial manager for Auto Mataro(ph), which was the Ford distribution center in Bukovina, and it was all _______ and elegant, sort of Austrian style.</span> <span id="s86">And my mother, as I mentioned, we always had a maid, and it was common in -- in those days in Europe to -- to go on the promenade around noon, between noon and one o'clock.</span> <span id="s87">There were certain main avenues, you went on the prom -- it was true even in Paris and other places.</span> <span id="s88">My mother and her sisters dolled up every day and went to the promenade.</span> <span id="s89">And my dad came home for the midday meal at one o'clock and we ate, and then he took a nap, and went back to the office around four.</span> <span id="s90">And that's what I remember a lot.</span> <span id="s91">I remember my mother's sisters, especially the youngest one, was very beautiful, tall, blonde, and she was sort of assertive and, you know -- I suppose we're not supposed to appear assertive, and they -- she was teased that she walked like a sergeant, you know.</span> <span id="s92">She -- on the promenade, she was sort of assertive.</span> <span id="s93">That was a daily event.</span> <span id="s94">And my parents entertained.</span> <span id="s95">My parents went out to -- for evening functions.</span> <span id="s96">One -- I remember one night there was -- obviously the maid was living in.</span> <span id="s97">My -- my parents were out, and my brother woke up and they weren't there, so he went and woke me up and said "They're not home."</span> <span id="s98">"Okay."</span> <span id="s99">"Come, let's -- let's look."</span> <span id="s100">And we went out on the terrace and we were looking for them.</span> <span id="s101">Well, my parents were coming home, and they could see the children on the terrace at one o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s102">They didn't know what to make of it.</span> <span id="s103">You know, they asked me -- well, they asked him, and I don't know what he said, but they asked me and I said, "I don't know, he told me to get up."</span> <span id="s104">You know, that's about it.</span> <span id="s105">He was two years older and told me and I did.</span> <span id="s106">The maid didn't know about this, and my parents were upset.</span> <span id="s107">So I -- I remember a very nice middle class, upper middle class life.</span> <span id="s108">We had -- we had a car at the disposal of the chauffeur.</span> <span id="s109">I don't think my dad drove.</span> <span id="s110">Certainly my mother didn't.</span> <span id="s111">And my mother spent time with her family -- with her sisters, spent time homemaking.</span> <span id="s112">You know, she baked and cooked and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s113">Holiday dinners, I remember Passover Seders.</span> <span id="s114">Dinner parties, when I woke up and -- and heard voices and got up to -- to go into the dining room or living room and asked what time it was, which, you know, shocked my parents.</span> <span id="s115">There was tea in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s116">Neighbors invited me for tea.</span> <span id="s117">And there were two ladies, or my mother described them as spinsters, and they wanted to pump me about secret -- you know, family secrets.</span> <span id="s118">Not so much family secrets.</span> <span id="s119">I don't know what they were.</span> <span id="s120">But like my mother's two sisters, and the one wasn't married and the other one was just engaged, who were they seeing, you know.</span> <span id="s121">They were pumping me, basically, but I liked it, you know, and I talked.</span> <span id="s122">You know, three years old, anything.</span> <span id="s123">Four years old, anything.</span> <span id="s124">So I remember a very -- my brother had started school before the Soviet occupation.</span> <span id="s125">He went to public school, which took -- because a lot of the Jewish children went to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s126">But my parents -- my dad used his influence and wanted him to go to public school.</span> <span id="s127">He was -- he's very smart, he was very smart, but he -- he was sort of a troublemaker.</span> <span id="s128">He did something, throw it in the garbage, put it on the door, which almost got him expelled.</span> <span id="s129">My dad had to go and use his influence.</span> <span id="s130">I did not start school until the Soviet occupation other than -- than dancing school.</span> <span id="s131">And I had neighbors that I played with and friends.</span> <span id="s132">And it was -- I had a lot of toys and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s133">In fact, ours was a kosher home, and my parents were concerned -- I had been ill when I was three.</span> <span id="s134">I had whooping cough and -- and scarlet fever, so there were a series of some kidney problems.</span> <span id="s135">So my parents were concerned that I wasn't gaining weight.</span> <span id="s136">And, you know, Jewish mother always worries about the kid not eating.</span> <span id="s137">So they felt that maybe ham would -- would put weight on me.</span> <span id="s138">But, of course, they couldn't bring it into the house.</span> <span id="s139">So the maid every afternoon for the -- what is called yowzah, for the -- the tea time, would take me to a -- a place that sold ham sandwiches where I could eat a ham on hard rolls.</span> <span id="s140">I ate part of it anyway.</span> <span id="s141">That was a daily ritual, I remember that.</span> <span id="s142">And I had -- and my closest friend, play friend, was -- well, actually I met a little girl in the park whose father was -- two I had -- her I was just fascinated.</span> <span id="s143">But my closest girlfriend, the -- this girl I met in the park, little girl in the park, her father was a bus driver.</span> <span id="s144">And they lived in a basement one room, and she invited me to come over.</span> <span id="s145">So the maid took me there.</span> <span id="s146">But when the maid told -- yeah, I didn't know one room from three, but I liked being in one room because everybody was in the same place.</span> <span id="s147">So the -- my -- my parents, my mother, was not too excited about that, about this relationship after the maid told her that they live in a basement.</span> <span id="s148">But I -- I did still insist on going.</span> <span id="s149">And since she didn't have too many toys, my uncle had come -- Uncle Jupiter had come back from the toy fair in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s150">Every year, they have this big toy fair.</span> <span id="s151">And he brought me some toys which I already -- some of them I already had like a new baby doll buggy, so I gave them to her.</span> <span id="s152">And my parents may not have liked it, but I don't know what they said.</span> <span id="s153">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s154">But my brother, my brother had something to say about that, and he said, "You are gonna make us poor."</span> <span id="s155">Because I gave my toys away, these toys that Uncle Jupiter brought me.</span> <span id="s156">And the other friend that I spent a lot of time with was a little girl named Anita.</span> <span id="s157">She was -- Anita Gelburd.</span> <span id="s158">She was three years older than I was, and she had four -- I mean three older sisters.</span> <span id="s159">There were four girls.</span> <span id="s160">The oldest one was eighteen, nineteen, and there were a couple in between, and she was seven and I was five.</span> <span id="s161">She was -- since when I was four, and she was going to school.</span> <span id="s162">And I loved being there because there was girl talk, you know.</span> <span id="s163">There was a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s164">Our house was quiet, you know, kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s165">And there it was commotion.</span> <span id="s166">And unfortunately, the whole -- they were deported, all the Gelburds -- the older daughter had gotten married somewhere in between and had a child, but the rest of the family was deported.</span> <span id="s167">And when -- when people were coming back when -- when the nightmare ended, and the oldest sister, whose name I think was Lenny, saw that her family didn't come back, she committed suicide.</span> <span id="s168">Whole family went out {Crying}.</span> <span id="s169">That was my childhood.</span> <span id="s170">Sort of uneventful.</span> <span id="s171">You know, it just -- used to go see my grandparents.</span> <span id="s172">My grandparents were religious.</span> <span id="s173">Shabbat -- Shabbat was Shabbat.</span> <span id="s174">You had Friday night dinner.</span> <span id="s175">I liked my grandparents.</span> <span id="s176">My grandfather was something in a wood factory.</span> <span id="s177">I don't know what he did.</span> <span id="s178">He was a supervisor or something.</span> <span id="s179">And on Shabbat, people would come over and -- and, you know, they'd -- my grandmother would bake stuff on Friday, make challah, and she gave me a piece of dough and I could work -- work the system.</span> <span id="s180">And they were -- they were kind people that I -- I loved.</span> <span id="s181">And didn't see that much of them.</span> <span id="s182">And I -- they were a different way of life than -- than we were used to, but it was a nice life.</span> <span id="s183">The whole town -- you know, there was a main street, and their house was on the main street.</span> <span id="s184">They were all individual houses.</span> <span id="s185">And she -- people would walk by and see you on the porch and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s186">It was different.</span> <span id="s187">They had a garden in the back.</span> <span id="s188">And unfortunately, they were killed in Moghilev.</span> <span id="s189">They -- they died.</span> <span id="s190">They weren't killed.</span> <span id="s191">They died of malnutrition probably, and they were older so didn't see too much of them after that.</span> <span id="s192">You know, after the war started, we didn't see too much of them.</span> <span id="s193">So that's basically -- I didn't start -- when the Soviets occupied the Bukovina, when it was annexed, wasn't occupied, they would like to say it was annexed, in 1940, I started school, in Russian school.</span> <span id="s194">Now, I -- to roll back, when my dad used to come home for -- for his -- the midday meal, then he would lie -- lie down, I guess it was a couch.</span> <span id="s195">I know he was -- he lied down and I lied down right alongside of him.</span> <span id="s196">Had my head on the -- sort of under his arm.</span> <span id="s197">I learned to read.</span> <span id="s198">I learned to read.</span> <span id="s199">We spoke German at home, but I had learned to read Romanian and to speak Romanian, and I also later learned some Russian, even before -- before school.</span> <span id="s200">But Romanian and German I had learned.</span> <span id="s201">And when I didn't learn from -- when I was reading the paper with my dad would -- what I didn't learn, I sort of translated myself, you know, like -- I remember an example that my family had repeated, namely that in German whipped cream is schlagsahne, meaning beating, and sahne -- or schlagobers, the Austrians used to say.</span> <span id="s202">Well, schlag means beating and -- and obers is a colonel.</span> <span id="s203">That's the -- so I had translated __________ batoot(ph), you know, beaten colonel for -- for whipped cream.</span> <span id="s204">That was my accomplishment.</span> <span id="s205">And people teased -- my parents teased, my brother especially teased me about that.</span> <span id="s206">It was a quiet life, pleasant.</span> <span id="s207">You know, no -- no particular drama until just before the Soviet occupation.</span> <span id="s208">I remember my parents, we -- my mother and the children had been visiting the grandparents, and my father came for the weekend and was -- was telling my parent -- my mother and the grandparents that the maids -- they were usually Ukrainian or Lithuanian, and they -- that there -- there is unrest, that there is hooliganism.</span> <span id="s209">But I mean it was abstract.</span> <span id="s210">It wasn't -- nothing had happened to us or to our house kind of thing.</span> <span id="s211">But there was some cloud on the horizon.</span> <span id="s212">And in 1940, the -- the Soviet marched in.</span> <span id="s213">It wasn't -- it wasn't like Army takeover.</span> <span id="s214">It was -- they just sort of marched in.</span> <span id="s215">It was by agreement, although they had bombed, apparently, the airport.</span> <span id="s216">So it was sort of different but much the same.</span> <span id="s217">The -- the Soviet -- the Auto Matoro was eviscerated.</span> <span id="s218">And my dad, they wanted -- some town father or whatever these people had as commanders wanted my dad to be the accountant for Meloche (ph) Trust.</span> <span id="s219">In -- in the Soviet Union, in communistic structures, everything is a trust.</span> <span id="s220">It's the milk trust and the -- the shoe trust and the -- so Meloche Trust was the dairy trust, and my dad became the accountant and chief financial officer for the dairy trust.</span> <span id="s221">And, you know, we basically went on the same.</span> <span id="s222">I started school.</span> <span id="s223">I don't remember whether it was kindergarten or first grade.</span> <span id="s224">I mean I don't know that I would have been able to tell the difference actually.</span> <span id="s225">But it was Russian and -- My parents entertained some -- I remember my parents entertained some -- somebody from the company, some people from the company, Russians, and the guys were amazed how people lived, you know, the beauty, what they considered luxury.</span> <span id="s226">I mean we were upper middle class people, but we weren't by no means rich.</span> <span id="s227">Just well off, I guess, comfortable off, whatever.</span> <span id="s228">And he -- he was just amazed at how people lived.</span> <span id="s229">And he said something to my parents, and my brother felt compelled to answer, so he said, "Yeah, this is all nice, but they call us dirty Jews."</span> <span id="s230">So he said, "Well, you can call me anything you want as long as you feed me honey."</span> <span id="s231">So that was sort of a -- an indication of -- of a perception of what they had, you know.</span> <span id="s232">But other than that, the year went uneventful again, and you went to school and you -- my Uncle Jupiter was not too {Coughs} excited about it because he was a businessman.</span> <span id="s233">He -- he did international business with -- with Austria and Germany and France, and he couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s234">So he was not too excited but, you know, he had to put up and shut up, basically.</span> <span id="s235">And when the Naz -- on July 21, 1941, the war started.</span> <span id="s236">I mean Nazis invaded.</span> <span id="s237">Actually, rolling back, in '39 I remember when Poland was invaded.</span> <span id="s238">How do I remember it is that my mother had taken me for someplace, to some -- somewhere, and we were coming back.</span> <span id="s239">And in front of the perfect _______, the police there, which was the major police entity, there were people sitting on -- on packages on the street and the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s240">And I had asked "Why are they there", and my mother told me that -- this was in September 1939 -- that these people are from Poland and they are refugees.</span> <span id="s241">And -- and just as we were standing there, a dog came by and bit my thigh, you know, chubby little thighs of little girls, and that was a big minor crisis.</span> <span id="s242">You know, I don't think he broke the skin, I don't remember, just that the idea of it was a major thing.</span> <span id="s243">So in 1941 -- and we knew that Hitler had invaded Poland and that there was -- and in 1941, the Nazis, on June 21st, 1941, the Nazis occupied Chernowitz and then everything changed.</span> <span id="s244">That was not benign, that was not -- it was -- first of all, it was war, number one, although you didn't feel it that much.</span> <span id="s245">But there were -- there were a lot of anti-Semitic outbursts.</span> <span id="s246">A lot of windows broke and a lot of Jewish businesses broken and -- I don't -- and lot of Jewish businesses just simply put out of business.</span> <span id="s247">And -- and the Nazis had plans, had made plans to basically make Cherowitz _________, to expel all the Jews.</span> <span id="s248">Although my Uncle Jupiter was not -- he said, "Oh, they're not gonna do it."</span> <span id="s249">And he was -- he was amenable.</span> <span id="s250">He was pleased that -- that the Soviets had gone.</span> <span id="s251">Oh, let me roll back.</span> <span id="s252">In 1939, when Europe was getting just by things not looking so well, the Ford Motor Company in Michigan had -- had offered my father and his family to come to America.</span> <span id="s253">And my mother said, "Who goes to America?</span> <span id="s254">Only people that want to get away from a bad wife."</span> <span id="s255">Because in Europe, divorce was very difficult.</span> <span id="s256">Or people that can't make it financially and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s257">So that was one opportunity missed.</span> <span id="s258">And -- and when the Soviets were retreating, they offered my dad to come to Moscow.</span> <span id="s259">And my parents were sort of torn, I guess, about that.</span> <span id="s260">But Uncle Jupiter said, "No way, don't -- don't you dare", you know, kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s261">So that was the other opportunity that -- that was missed.</span> <span id="s262">And in 1941 -- so when they occupied, Jewish children could not go to school.</span> <span id="s263">And they -- they started forming a ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">All -- all Jews had to move into a certain area where Jews -- let me roll back.</span> <span id="s265">Uncle Jupiter immediately went into business or -- or revived an old business, I'm really not sure.</span> <span id="s266">But food transport, eggs, stuff like that was a big business in Europe.</span> <span id="s267">I -- I didn't really know that until much later.</span> <span id="s268">And he was involved with shipping aid -- you know, transporting food, eggs, dairy, who knows.</span> <span id="s269">That business was not in Chernowitz.</span> <span id="s270">It was, what, 40, 50 miles away in some small town.</span> <span id="s271">So he was back in -- he was in business immediately.</span> <span id="s272">And so when they -- when they tried to make Chernowitz _______, they ordered people to move into ghettos, you know, certain streets where Jews had lived and where the kosher shops were and stuff.</span> <span id="s273">But 5,000 people or whatever thousand, I don't know, maybe -- maybe more, maybe 6,000 were permitted to stay in their homes because they were needed to run the town.</span> <span id="s274">I mean they were the professors and the physicians and the businessmen.</span> <span id="s275">And we were permitted to stay in town, and Uncle Jupiter was permitted to stay in town, and so were -- so was my uncle, my father's brother.</span> <span id="s276">And so we were home but -- and then these people that had gone to the ghetto -- so, there is -- apparently there was a list that they put people on, and these people could stay in their homes.</span> <span id="s277">And those that had been put in the ghetto, some were transported to Transnistria, and some were allowed to go home and they would have transports later on.</span> <span id="s278">Well, we never went so, you know, we were considered not at risk.</span> <span id="s279">And this was like in September or in the fall.</span> <span id="s280">And the next -- so after the winter, the next deportation -- these were deportations, by the way, they were.</span> <span id="s281">The next deportations -- I didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s282">My brother didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s283">I had a non-Jewish friend that I met in dancing school, and then in the year -- her name was Adele Havriluk.</span> <span id="s284">Her father was a prominent attorney.</span> <span id="s285">And then in that one year of schooling that was either kindergarten or first grade, I don't know which one, and they -- they used to come over and bring me school work.</span> <span id="s286">And so to keep me in touch with school work, and -- and bring stuff for my brother.</span> <span id="s287">So then in the -- the next deportations were ordered to take place in June of 1942, and they were to be -- to take place on three consecutive Sundays.</span> <span id="s288">Oh, my dad -- my dad had a job, so Uncle -- he worked in Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food transport, had something to do with eggs and stuff.</span> <span id="s289">And my dad would travel with Uncle Jupiter every weekend.</span> <span id="s290">He would come home every weekend.</span> <span id="s291">He would travel every Monday, go there.</span> <span id="s292">So Jews had to be home on those three consecutive Sundays, and that didn't affect us the first two Sundays.</span> <span id="s293">The third Sunday -- and I had, in fact, said goodbye to some neighbor girl that I knew, whose name I don't even remember, but I know I had said goodbye to somebody.</span> <span id="s294">But the third Sunday, Uncle Jupiter had sent a chauffeur.</span> <span id="s295">So Jews couldn't be out, but he -- he could send a chauffeur.</span> <span id="s296">And my dad had come back on Friday.</span> <span id="s297">He had -- he went to the bank or he picked up money, had a briefcase full of money, real money, two hundred -- the equivalent of $250,000 to pay wages, to buy material, who knows why.</span> <span id="s298">That's what he had.</span> <span id="s299">The briefcase was lying in our hallway, like the entrance hall had like a cabinet.</span> <span id="s300">And Uncle Jupiter sent the chauffeur Sunday evening about eight o'clock or so to suggest that we come to his house, that we stay with -- with them.</span> <span id="s301">And my mother said, "Nah, I don't want to go."</span> <span id="s302">You know, Max is going to -- back to -- I can't remember the town where this business was, and he has this money and, you know, Uncle Jupiter was going with him so he knew.</span> <span id="s303">And, you know, "Bathe the children, put them to bed.</span> <span id="s304">I don't think so."</span> <span id="s305">Well, that was our last chance, because in the middle of the night about midnight, the -- the doorbell rang and it was the police, and they said they wanted us to go to the police station to check the documents.</span> <span id="s306">Don't worry about it, nothing serious, just check the documents.</span> <span id="s307">So we dressed.</span> <span id="s308">My -- I dressed myself.</span> <span id="s309">I remember wearing kneesocks.</span> <span id="s310">That's what every kid wore, kneesocks, little kneesocks.</span> <span id="s311">And we -- when we got out of our apartment, there were -- there was a lot of police and a lot of people in the building that were going, but we also -- my parents saw, I didn't have the perception to understand it, that somebody was giving some policeman a bag of jewelry and they didn't go, they didn't leave.</span> <span id="s312">So -- but, you know, my parents were secure that -- that once he -- they know that he's needed, then the business will open, it won't have any money, that nothing would happen to us.</span> <span id="s313">Well, that was obviously wrong.</span> <span id="s314">We -- we left the house in a -- like a bus, and we were taken to -- to cattle cars, and that was it.</span> <span id="s315">And my dad, we didn't have any -- we didn't pack any luggage, although some people had taken something.</span> <span id="s316">My dad had the briefcase of money, and that's it.</span> <span id="s317">And we learned later that the -- that they were short on the transport.</span> <span id="s318">They had to have 2,000 people in the three -- three transports, and they were short 120 people on this transport.</span> <span id="s319">So they just went into a place where they knew Jews lived and took them, you know.</span> <span id="s320">I mean who's gonna hold them accountable?</span> <span id="s321">So that was basically how we were on the cattle car on the way to Transnistria.</span> <span id="s322">That ended the childhood that I experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you have any sense of what transports meant before that moment?</span> <span id="s324">Had you heard about transports, or was this the first -- your first experience with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I mean I knew what a transport was as a forceable sort of thing, but I -- I didn't really.</span> <span id="s326">Neither did my brother.</span> <span id="s327">We didn't really.</span> <span id="s328">And we sort of relied on -- on something, I'm not sure what that something was.</span> <span id="s329">I cannot articulate now.</span> <span id="s330">But we relied on status or something that -- that it's gonna turn out okay.</span> <span id="s331">And in fact, the train that -- that we were on, the cattle car, it stopped in -- outside of Moghilev someplace, and people were looking for water.</span> <span id="s332">Obviously we had no food.</span> <span id="s333">Oh, the night before when my mother said, "Oh, we'll stay home, bathe the kids, put them to bed", we were having dinner.</span> <span id="s334">Not that -- the big meal was usually at noon, but some dinner.</span> <span id="s335">And my brother who always complained said, "Nah, I don't like this.</span> <span id="s336">It's too greasy."</span> <span id="s337">I don't know what it was, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s338">And my mother said, "Some day you're gonna be hungry and you won't have anything to eat."</span> <span id="s339">Just to, you know, to -- he was getting a little on her nerves, I suppose.</span> <span id="s340">It was a constant thing.</span> <span id="s341">He wouldn't eat, and complain, and she would worry.</span> <span id="s342">It was a merry-go-round.</span> <span id="s343">And there he was, two days later he was hungry, you know.</span> <span id="s344">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s345">So it was like {Coughs} was he clairvoyant, was it a feeling that -- who knows.</span> <span id="s346">She never -- we never discussed it again because -- at the same time, if she had any feelings, she should've -- we should've gone to my uncle's house.</span> <span id="s347">So we were on the train.</span> <span id="s348">And when the train stopped -- well, my uncle, the concierge where we lived, my parents told them to go to Jupiter's, which was I don't know how many -- the distance was, and tell him that we were taken.</span> <span id="s349">And he did do that.</span> <span id="s350">So my uncle put in -- in motion all kinds of -- called all kinds of people by nine o'clock to get us off the train, but you couldn't, I mean -- and to get us out and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s351">So when -- when the train stopped, I went to get some water, and I saw people, and I don't -- I had a container, but I don't remember where I got it and what it was like.</span> <span id="s352">And it was down a hill, and I slipped and I injured my knee.</span> <span id="s353">It might have been something glass that I held, but it was a big cut on my knee, and there was nothing to -- to deal with it, nothing to clean, nothing to clean with, so that became infected.</span> <span id="s354">And for the next three months or more, July, August, September, three months, I couldn't bend the knee.</span> <span id="s355">It was -- it was swollen and hot, and I couldn't bend it.</span> <span id="s356">So -- but I'll tell you once we got to camp, if you wanted to ask me about getting there, so this is how we wound up in Transnistria.</span> <span id="s357">And the camp we were taken was Cariera de Piatra, which is a stone quarry, translated stone quarry.</span> <span id="s358">It was -- it had a Romanian commander.</span> <span id="s359">And we were unloaded, and there were barracks from I guess the people that worked there at the stone quarry, so we were put into barracks.</span> <span id="s360">I don't remember much about the barrack other than that there were a lot of people in each barrack and that we slept on like pallets, wooden pallets, but they were -- they were off the floor, but they were -- they were contiguous, you know.</span> <span id="s361">It was like -- so that's what I remember.</span> <span id="s362">And every day I was sitting outside.</span> <span id="s363">I don't know whether they carried me.</span> <span id="s364">I was sitting on a big rock with my leg, my swollen leg, and it was getting bigger and I couldn't bend it.</span> <span id="s365">And I had little pig -- pigtails and sat there and at some point -- if you want me to continue.</span> <span id="s366">Did you want to ask me something else?</span> <span id="s367">I mean I'll continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Were you together with your family at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s370">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: And how long was the journey from Chernowitz to -- to camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: It probably was about four days, five days.</span> <span id="s373">And if you want me to continue, I'll tell you about being there.</span> <span id="s374">So the camp was commanded by a Romanian officer, and he would walk around every day, and -- and the barracks were like in a circle around the piazza, if you will, or the -- I can't think of another word at the moment -- that round sort of in the middle of it for -- So he would just sort of walk around every day.</span> <span id="s375">He would come by.</span> <span id="s376">And he would see me and he would go by and pull my pigtails and look at the knee and, you know, smile or pat my head or something and -- and walk on.</span> <span id="s377">At some point, I don't know whether -- how my parents heard, but my -- my father figured he has to return the money to the company.</span> <span id="s378">So he gave the -- the camp commander, about maybe a month later, month and a half, the briefcase full of money.</span> <span id="s379">And the commander returned it to the company.</span> <span id="s380">He did not pocket it.</span> <span id="s381">And the -- my uncles -- so with the -- I mean the authorities that could do that were impressed that my father returned the money.</span> <span id="s382">It never occurred to him to buy his way out with that.</span> <span id="s383">And -- and that the camp commander forwarded it on.</span> <span id="s384">So he -- but somehow the camp commander had been told that there are efforts underway -- can I get you more comfortable -- that there are efforts underway to bring us back.</span> <span id="s385">So what we -- you know, we were hungry.</span> <span id="s386">People were dying.</span> <span id="s387">My parents did their best to -- the people -- my parents -- my father had to work on the quarries, I guess.</span> <span id="s388">I don't remember much of that.</span> <span id="s389">Some local farmers came with -- selling food.</span> <span id="s390">If you had money, you could buy.</span> <span id="s391">I don't know.</span> <span id="s392">You had to sell stuff to them.</span> <span id="s393">But I mean food was scarce.</span> <span id="s394">I can't say that I ever complained or that my brother ever complained because we knew that our parents -- somehow that childhood that your parents are always on top of you doing the best for you, you know.</span> <span id="s395">There's so many little things that they demonstrated that.</span> <span id="s396">So that if there was no food, it's because there was no food kind of thing.</span> <span id="s397">Well, in September, around September or early October -- I mean we didn't have a calendar, didn't know one day from another.</span> <span id="s398">My parents might have known when it was.</span> <span id="s399">The -- there was an edict to exterminate the Jews from Cariera de Piatra, basically.</span> <span id="s400">But the -- the people to be sent away were to be told that they're being relocated.</span> <span id="s401">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And how did you -- how did you know that?</span> <span id="s403">Is this something you learned later or is this something that you heard from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Something I learned later, right.</span> <span id="s405">At the time, people didn't know.</span> <span id="s406">Something we learned later.</span> <span id="s407">And so one day, there are all these Nazi people.</span> <span id="s408">There's a setup of tables.</span> <span id="s409">People are told to line up, get their possessions and get in line.</span> <span id="s410">And my family, we were in -- sort of getting ready to go in line, and the camp commander must have signaled -- signaled to my parents for -- there were tables over there and he was standing over here to -- to the right of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s411">They were sort of registering people.</span> <span id="s412">And he -- he -- my mother went up to him and said, you know, "Where -- how will this -- how will this affect our returning home?"</span> <span id="s413">And he looked at her and he said, "Run.</span> <span id="s414">Run over there."</span> <span id="s415">Now, he was standing this way, he was standing this way (indicating).</span> <span id="s416">And the Nazis, they were loading on truck.</span> <span id="s417">He said, "Run to the right.</span> <span id="s418">Right."</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: He told you to run behind him?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yeah, "Run over there."</span> <span id="s421">So my parents ran, my brother, and my knee that I couldn't have -- I ran, and it was oozing.</span> <span id="s422">I ran.</span> <span id="s423">And -- and he said, "Run and hide."</span> <span id="s424">So -- so when -- once we came -- we ran, there were on that part of the -- of the circle, there were shacks that must have been equipment shacks or something.</span> <span id="s425">So we -- we entered a shack and there were other people that -- that he had told to hide.</span> <span id="s426">{Crying} -- this is very emotional, so forgive me, but I think that's -- that's the pivotal thing that happened.</span> <span id="s427">So we went to stay in there, and it turned dark, and water, food, nothing.</span> <span id="s428">One -- before it turned dark, the Nazis went on an ex -- inspection tour with the camp commander, and they said, "What's in there?"</span> <span id="s429">He said, "Oh, nothing.</span> <span id="s430">Old equipment that we don't use and we throw away."</span> <span id="s431">And they said, "Oh, okay."</span> <span id="s432">And they walked away, and then we could hear the trucks left.</span> <span id="s433">The next morning, the camp commander asked everybody to come to the square, ordered everybody to come to the square.</span> <span id="s434">{Crying} and he said, "I saved as many of you as I could."</span> <span id="s435">There had been 4,000 people in the camp {Coughs} and now there were about 300.</span> <span id="s436">And he said {Crying}, "Did my best.</span> <span id="s437">You will have a tough winter.</span> <span id="s438">But if you survive the winter, you'll be okay."</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: So this was in the fall that this happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Yeah, in the fall.</span> <span id="s441">We -- and he sent people back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s442">I don't -- but, you know, here is a guy, here is -- that the Nazis put in there because they -- they saw in him something that they thought would be to their advantage, and it turned out it wasn't.</span> <span id="s443">So he -- he did the best -- he says, "I'll do the best I can to help you."</span> <span id="s444">There was some food provided, and I don't recall how.</span> <span id="s445">My brother got typhoid, got typhus, and then he got some infection.</span> <span id="s446">Do you mind if I get a tissue and some water?</span> <span id="s447">Would you like something?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: No, okay.</span> <span id="s449">One minute.</span> <span id="s450">[Interview paused].</span> <span id="s451">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s453">Are we okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: So my brother had typhoid, and he had an infection in his leg.</span> <span id="s456">And he was -- for about three weeks, he was unconscious.</span> <span id="s457">And then I got typhoid.</span> <span id="s458">And I remember nothing till the spring.</span> <span id="s459">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s460">My -- my parents had nothing to sell.</span> <span id="s461">There was a doctor, but he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s462">I don't know where he got -- they gave people strych -- he gave, to live, I guess, to -- to stimulate the heart, they were giving strychnine shots.</span> <span id="s463">Why that, I don't know.</span> <span id="s464">And where he got them, I don't know.</span> <span id="s465">But my mother gave some of the wedding -- her wedding ring, and they got the strychnine.</span> <span id="s466">And then we both recovered.</span> <span id="s467">I had some other illnesses.</span> <span id="s468">They cut my hair off, you know, my pigtails off.</span> <span id="s469">They were full of lice anyway.</span> <span id="s470">And then I lost my hair, and then it started growing back.</span> <span id="s471">And then the spring came.</span> <span id="s472">And in the spring, we were transported to -- 120 people were transported to the other -- this other camp Capostiano(ph), which is a village, and the people were housed in, I don't know, houses or shacks that -- and they worked, I guess, the fields.</span> <span id="s473">My -- my family and two other families were housed -- it was -- one of the things in Capostiano was that it was a sof-house(ph).</span> <span id="s474">Sof-house, a co-house, is a communal kind of enterprise.</span> <span id="s475">Everybody has a share in the total.</span> <span id="s476">And in sof-house is that you keep your own property but you -- you -- what you har -- harvest is communal.</span> <span id="s477">So in other words, if one grows potatoes and one grows carrots, you -- that's communal.</span> <span id="s478">So we were placed -- three families.</span> <span id="s479">There was the Glotters, which was a husband -- he was a soccer player and he was sort of caught in Chernowitz in a riot, with his wife.</span> <span id="s480">And he had a baby, a young baby when he was deported.</span> <span id="s481">The -- Harry.</span> <span id="s482">By the time we got together, he -- Harry was two years old.</span> <span id="s483">And they were the Glotters.</span> <span id="s484">And then there was a retired couple.</span> <span id="s485">He was -- had been the Postmaster General for Chernowitz, and he was this very distinguished sort of looking man, older man, and his wife.</span> <span id="s486">And my family -- and we -- we received a room on the property of the sof-house, and again it was sort of like a circle for various functions.</span> <span id="s487">And we -- we were housed in two small rooms.</span> <span id="s488">When you walked in, there were -- just you could stand or sit or stretch out, lay down, I suppose.</span> <span id="s489">And across was the dairy -- the milk separators.</span> <span id="s490">They brought all the milk in there and the machines were sep -- making cheese and butter and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s491">So that was on the other side.</span> <span id="s492">So we had the -- several advantages of being in there.</span> <span id="s493">One is that we had -- I don't remember whether -- which room we had, but we had some -- we used to get some little skim milk or something from the separators.</span> <span id="s494">And my dad was immediately recruited to -- to do the bookkeeping for the farm.</span> <span id="s495">I mean that's -- that's -- so he went to work every day.</span> <span id="s496">My mother did not work, was not demanded to work.</span> <span id="s497">She was going around offering -- my mother had been a -- years before she married, she -- she and her sisters, they had a small seamstress designing salon.</span> <span id="s498">They did ball gowns and debutant gowns and things like that.</span> <span id="s499">And so she went around offering her services to the farm women, or to the men telling your wife, and we got some potatoes.</span> <span id="s500">We got to eat -- I love -- I got to love potatoes and even potato skins.</span> <span id="s501">I mean the -- we had -- we were no longer starving as much as we had in the past.</span> <span id="s502">So on the farm, there were two pivotal people that would -- it's like a movie, Matt -- Matt Damon.</span> <span id="s503">He -- there was this guy named Misha.</span> <span id="s504">He was a young guy, about 25.</span> <span id="s505">He appeared to be 25 to me.</span> <span id="s506">Very good looking.</span> <span id="s507">And I was at the time -- when we got to Kazakhstan, I was seven years old, and -- but I knew he was good looking, with a mustache, blonde.</span> <span id="s508">And he was the commander -- you know, he was in charge of the sof-house, and he would go around and scream at people.</span> <span id="s509">But the Jewish -- oh, the other Jewish people, the others that were teens, were in the town.</span> <span id="s510">They worked somewhere in the town on farms.</span> <span id="s511">On the sof-house, there were no other deportees.</span> <span id="s512">Just these three families.</span> <span id="s513">So we had no contact with them.</span> <span id="s514">Not that we knew them, we didn't, but we also had no contact.</span> <span id="s515">So I mean obviously we couldn't leave, or maybe we could, we never -- it never occurred to somebody to go stroll through town.</span> <span id="s516">So there was Misha, and then there was the -- the -- he would come by twice a day or something.</span> <span id="s517">And, you know, demanding -- he was demanding against the fam -- I mean we didn't have -- he had -- maybe he, Mr. Glotter, I think, worked for the farm.</span> <span id="s518">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s519">He -- he'd play with little Harry.</span> <span id="s520">And then the other person that would come by every day was an older man, sort of a heavy man.</span> <span id="s521">He may not have been as heavy, as he wore this big coat, and he wore it all the time, same thing, every day.</span> <span id="s522">He was short and walked slow.</span> <span id="s523">And he was -- they said he was a vet.</span> <span id="s524">And he went to check, every day he checked the milk and checked the -- the separators.</span> <span id="s525">And, you know, would say hello, maybe a pat on the head, that's it.</span> <span id="s526">Would not interact.</span> <span id="s527">Misha interacted more.</span> <span id="s528">So that's how we lived.</span> <span id="s529">We -- occasionally Misha would tell something about the news that's going on in the world.</span> <span id="s530">We lost all hope of -- that we would be brought back.</span> <span id="s531">We knew that the -- so from Misha we knew that the Nazis were losing, that the army was moving forward, the Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s532">So I -- my brother worked in the gardens.</span> <span id="s533">I don't recall what he did.</span> <span id="s534">I know what I did.</span> <span id="s535">Maybe he did the same thing.</span> <span id="s536">I pulled weeds.</span> <span id="s537">I was -- pulled weeds from the plants.</span> <span id="s538">Somehow we heard -- this is actually 1943.</span> <span id="s539">I was eight years old.</span> <span id="s540">My parents heard, and I'm not sure how, that the Red Cross -- oh, I know.</span> <span id="s541">Let me roll back.</span> <span id="s542">The -- we started hearing -- if you envision like this room is round and down there is a forest, and we heard shooting at night in the forest.</span> <span id="s543">And we didn't know what it meant.</span> <span id="s544">Did they -- were they gonna shoot -- were they shooting Jews?</span> <span id="s545">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s546">We didn't know that the Nazis -- that this was the partisans were doing that stuff.</span> <span id="s547">So we -- we learned that the Red Cross was -- this is probably -- should I give you a napkin?</span> <span id="s548">That the Red Cross was -- I think maybe from Misha, that the Red Cross was trying to save the children.</span> <span id="s549">And they were organizing a -- a mercy transport back, kinder transport back to Romania to save us from the -- because they feared that -- the general premise was that the Nazis would kill everybody in their path back, and they (?</span> <span id="s550">withdraw?)</span> <span id="s551">that they would kill the Jews and everybody else.</span> <span id="s552">So they wanted to save the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And who ran the collective that you were in?</span> <span id="s554">Was it run by the Germans?</span> <span id="s555">Was it run by the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Who ran the collective where you were working in Kazakhstan?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, nobody ran it really.</span> <span id="s559">It was -- it ran itself.</span> <span id="s560">The -- the commander, the Misha, was, you know, he said he was a Ukrainian and -- and the people -- the people basically owned it.</span> <span id="s561">The -- there was no guard in control.</span> <span id="s562">And the -- the round guy was -- was just in charge of the farm.</span> <span id="s563">So -- so it wasn't clear.</span> <span id="s564">We were basically free, you know.</span> <span id="s565">We could starve on our own, die on our own.</span> <span id="s566">You know, we probably could have left, but you are in the -- on the corner of nowhere and nowhere without any money and you are in rags.</span> <span id="s567">So the Nazis -- as the Nazis were moving -- I mean the -- as the Soviet Army was moving forward, the Nazis were in retreat.</span> <span id="s568">And we could hear a lot of gunfire, and we -- I can't remember whether somebody told my dad that this was the partisans, you know, that were hiding in the forest, and they -- they were shooting the -- they were destroying the train, the railroad tracks and things.</span> <span id="s569">So when -- when the Red Cross -- somebody told my dad at work that the Red Cross wants to take the children out, out of there, so they would survive.</span> <span id="s570">{Coughs} the -- my parents signed us up.</span> <span id="s571">Well, my parents talked to us first, and I didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s572">I felt that I wanted to stay with my parents.</span> <span id="s573">My brother was not as vocal as I was.</span> <span id="s574">Now, at this I must make a point that this Jagendorf, this guy, says he arranged it.</span> <span id="s575">And that is a lie.</span> <span id="s576">That is not true.</span> <span id="s577">But anyway, they -- it was the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s578">He says with the -- he arrange it with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s579">The Red Cross.</span> <span id="s580">There was a lot going on that we didn't know.</span> <span id="s581">There was a lot going on in the Soviet Union that -- that we didn't know about.</span> <span id="s582">They -- that they knew about.</span> <span id="s583">So they signed us up, and -- and in order to ensure, A, that -- that we stayed together -- that we get -- we get to go.</span> <span id="s584">And he says this was for -- only for orphans.</span> <span id="s585">Not true.</span> <span id="s586">We weren't orphans.</span> <span id="s587">So -- but my parents wanted to assure that we would always stay together, so they made us twins.</span> <span id="s588">So they picked the birthdate, 1931, on November 28th, 1931, so they couldn't be traced back, and -- and signed us up.</span> <span id="s589">But then they were worried about -- also my parents were worried about that I was too young, somebody would -- so they -- they register us twice.</span> <span id="s590">If you -- hopefully I get the list, if not I'll chase the woman down.</span> <span id="s591">They -- they registered us twice; once as twins, and other times as both separately being 11 and 12 years old.</span> <span id="s592">Just to -- to, you know, sort of secure that if somebody can't take twins, they can take one.</span> <span id="s593">Or if eight, they think will be too young to complain or something like that.</span> <span id="s594">So they registered us.</span> <span id="s595">And you couldn't -- you couldn't be sent back to Chernowitz.</span> <span id="s596">You could not.</span> <span id="s597">But you could be sent any other place in Romania.</span> <span id="s598">Well, you know, where to send in Romania, you know, cold, but my -- only where we have friends and family.</span> <span id="s599">We -- my dad had done -- he had done business with Ford, with Auto Motora(ph), the Ford agency in the city called Botoshan.</span> <span id="s600">He knew Mr. Bacall, who was a man by then would have been in his 50s or 60s, and he figured -- and Mr. Bacall also had two -- two sons.</span> <span id="s601">So he figured they -- they -- if they're there, they'll take us.</span> <span id="s602">And so he put them down to -- that's where we were going, to the Bacall's in Botoshan.</span> <span id="s603">We left around -- before Christmas -- and then when my parents a couple of times asked Misha, "What's the shooting up there?"</span> <span id="s604">He says, "I don't hear any.</span> <span id="s605">Shooting?</span> <span id="s606">I never heard any."</span> <span id="s607">So, you know, we -- we just sort of didn't -- didn't press him.</span> <span id="s608">The -- but he would come in and say to us -- "Hold on, ________+ -- just -- just stay."</span> <span id="s609">He -- he invited us -- so he said he was married to this farm woman.</span> <span id="s610">He invited us to his house once for dinner or twice.</span> <span id="s611">And this woman was 20 years older than he was, which that's how it goes.</span> <span id="s612">And had a nice -- you know, it was good.</span> <span id="s613">Anything was nice.</span> <span id="s614">And so, you know, he -- but he always said "Just -- just stay and hold on."</span> <span id="s615">So would the round man, the vet.</span> <span id="s616">And so we -- we -- my parents said you gotta go.</span> <span id="s617">So we went.</span> <span id="s618">We left.</span> <span id="s619">My dad rode with us to Moghilev in a cart with horse, horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s620">And somebody else, which I can't remember who the somebody else was.</span> <span id="s621">Not a child.</span> <span id="s622">It was an adult.</span> <span id="s623">And we stayed in Moghilev for -- for a couple of weeks while the transport was being organized.</span> <span id="s624">And I cried a lot.</span> <span id="s625">I was sick.</span> <span id="s626">I was heartbroken.</span> <span id="s627">My dad returned in that horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s628">And of course, my parents were heartbroken.</span> <span id="s629">But that -- that was the general -- you are heartbroken when you are in a concentration -- Nazi concentration camp.</span> <span id="s630">We eventually made our way to Botoshan in -- in the spring.</span> <span id="s631">There were about 18 children that went to Botoshan from other camps.</span> <span id="s632">Jagendorf says that when -- when -- that he arrange it and the children of Botoshan have a welcoming for them.</span> <span id="s633">Never happened.</span> <span id="s634">So we -- we arrived by train, by a regular train.</span> <span id="s635">And we were in like a large room, and the people that were supposed to pick up children came, but so did a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s636">You know, just -- just to help, just to care {Crying}.</span> <span id="s637">So the Bacalls weren't there.</span> <span id="s638">It was circumstantial, because they were not notified and they were out of town.</span> <span id="s639">But there were other people who said -- numerous other people who said, "We'll take care of them.</span> <span id="s640">We will."</span> <span id="s641">And there was somebody in charge who decided who may and who may not, I guess.</span> <span id="s642">There was this family named Finklestein.</span> <span id="s643">A woman, she was I think 29.</span> <span id="s644">She had a brother that was 25.</span> <span id="s645">They lived with their father.</span> <span id="s646">And they said, "We want them.</span> <span id="s647">We want them."</span> <span id="s648">And they had neighbors, a couple, and -- and two sons, like 18 and 20, and they said, "We want them.</span> <span id="s649">We want them.</span> <span id="s650">All of us want them.</span> <span id="s651">We'll take care of them."</span> <span id="s652">So we went.</span> <span id="s653">They were the most loving, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s654">I mean they were so happy to have us.</span> <span id="s655">You know, we were dirty, we were probably in rags, and I don't really remember.</span> <span id="s656">They -- they fed us.</span> <span id="s657">They caressed us.</span> <span id="s658">They -- they were -- they put us to sleep in their beds.</span> <span id="s659">I mean they were not people of means.</span> <span id="s660">They had a small -- little bit small apartment, but -- and -- and we were so excited, that the -- the son sat up all night and the neighbor, the Marcus, the name was Marcus, he sat up -- the two of them sat up all night to watch us sleep.</span> <span id="s661">They were worried that if something happens in our sleep.</span> <span id="s662">And just the sweetest, kindest people.</span> <span id="s663">And was fine for us, we -- we were happy to stay there.</span> <span id="s664">They cleaned our shoes, such as they were.</span> <span id="s665">I don't remember what kind of shoes I had and what clothes, but they -- they got us some clothes or they gave us theirs.</span> <span id="s666">I don't remember nothing about that.</span> <span id="s667">I was just so taken by their kindness.</span> <span id="s668">That was just -- it was like -- like you're a dream, you know, you're dreaming about this.</span> <span id="s669">And we stayed there for four or five days, and the Bacalls came back, and they found out that -- that we had arrived and they were not there and they were notified.</span> <span id="s670">They were not too happy about it and, of course, they also powerful people and they're also rich people, so they sent a chauffeur and -- to pick us up.</span> <span id="s671">And, you know, the Finklesteins and the Marcuses, they were so upset.</span> <span id="s672">And they -- they called somebody and they were trying to say -- and Mr. Bacall said -- you know, Mr. and Mrs. Bacall, these gorgeous-looking people, like something you see in the movies.</span> <span id="s673">And they said, "No, they -- they -- their parents said they come here.</span> <span id="s674">They come here."</span> <span id="s675">Mr. Bacall, Sr. had died in the interim.</span> <span id="s676">And they had the Ford agency still.</span> <span id="s677">And so, you know, money trumps a lot of things.</span> <span id="s678">We stayed in touch with the Finklesteins though and the Marcuses.</span> <span id="s679">So they -- we stayed with the Bacalls for -- for several months.</span> <span id="s680">They were very kind and very loving, and I guess they bought us clothes.</span> <span id="s681">I don't know where the clothes came from, but we -- they weren't the rags that we came with.</span> <span id="s682">And it was a household where there was a maid and -- and a chauffeur and butler.</span> <span id="s683">So dinner was formal and -- and, you know, you rang the bell if you wanted something, even to make the butler come from a long ways so he open the bottle.</span> <span id="s684">And that -- we stayed there -- of course, when the Soviet occupied, reoccupied the Bukovina, the Bacalls lost their household help.</span> <span id="s685">Apparently, the -- the maid and the butler had been communists.</span> <span id="s686">I wonder why.</span> <span id="s687">And so they -- they quit.</span> <span id="s688">But before -- before this, the occupation, the reoccupation, was not -- was not seamless.</span> <span id="s689">The Soviets bombed the town and bombed -- it was a seder, I remember the seder, and there were people and it was an elegant sort of dinner.</span> <span id="s690">And we stayed -- we went on the balcony and looking over, and then the alarm had gone off for the bomb shelters, and there was a bomb shelter.</span> <span id="s691">But before we could -- could process it, a bomb had hit the house across the street.</span> <span id="s692">And by the time we got to the bomb shelter, the go-round, there were apparently a lot of victims.</span> <span id="s693">And my brother insisted on going to help care for the victims.</span> <span id="s694">The men went, you know, to help.</span> <span id="s695">And I think he was seeing the carnage, the blood and that kind of stuff, and he was severely affected by that.</span> <span id="s696">So anyway, we -- we stayed with the Bacalls.</span> <span id="s697">The Soviets occupied.</span> <span id="s698">And then my -- one day, my mother had notified them that they are planning to get us.</span> <span id="s699">And one day my mother just -- I could see her walking up.</span> <span id="s700">She had -- she had used an Army truck.</span> <span id="s701">She worked her way up on an Army truck, and that was -- by then, that was -- we had stayed with the Bacalls maybe six months already, five or six months.</span> <span id="s702">And we went back.</span> <span id="s703">I don't know whether on a truck or a train.</span> <span id="s704">I was -- we were so deliriously happy, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s705">And we came home, and we didn't even know what -- what my parents found in Chernowitz.</span> <span id="s706">What they found was nothing.</span> <span id="s707">Our -- our home was stripped and our property was gone, and the apartment was -- somebody else was living in it.</span> <span id="s708">And like you didn't even want to start making demands.</span> <span id="s709">So -- but -- so what happened while we were gone is -- is a story unto itself.</span> <span id="s710">So my -- my parents were -- absolutely you hear the shooting, and my parents were obviously very frightened.</span> <span id="s711">Every -- the Glotters and the Steinvitzes, the other two families.</span> <span id="s712">So -- and Misha would come by or -- or the round guy, and say "It's okay."</span> <span id="s713">"Shooting."</span> <span id="s714">"Not shooting."</span> <span id="s715">"How?</span> <span id="s716">I don't hear any."</span> <span id="s717">Well, when the shooting stopped and when -- when Soviet Army had occupied -- reoccupied, Misha came in {Crying} to see my parents and the Glotters and the other people, and introduced himself as Moshe(ph) Wiseman, a Jewish colonel from Moscow, who -- who was a partisan.</span> <span id="s718">And all those shootings were the partisans who were blowing up the -- the rails.</span> <span id="s719">And -- and the round guy was a general.</span> <span id="s720">He was in charge of all the -- the -- the partisans in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s721">But this gave him a good cover.</span> <span id="s722">You know, they -- and the reason he was wearing this round coat was he -- he was carrying a weapon, a long weapon.</span> <span id="s723">And he -- you know, they befriended the parents, my parents, and the other people and helped them leave, get transportation to go back to -- to Chernowitz.</span> <span id="s724">And -- and, you know, it -- it seemed like -- like my dad was saying.</span> <span id="s725">When Misha said he's Moshe Wiseman, a colonel, and that woman he said was a good cover and she knew that -- who he was and what he was doing.</span> <span id="s726">And this -- this guy, they spent time with him and, you know, it's like -- like a novel.</span> <span id="s727">So when we came home, you know, my parents filled us in.</span> <span id="s728">And then my uncle, my mother's brother who had lived in Moghilev, he -- he had been badly beaten, but when the Russians came in they -- all men had to be conscripted.</span> <span id="s729">So they -- they found a job for him and -- but he was very sick.</span> <span id="s730">He -- they said he had a blood disease.</span> <span id="s731">We think he had leukemia.</span> <span id="s732">And he came to live with us.</span> <span id="s733">And we -- we had an empty two-room apartment and a kitchen, a small kitchen, I guess, and the -- the -- the uncle when he came to stay with us, we had -- I think we had cots that -- to sleep on, and I gave him my cot, or maybe my mother told me to give him my cot.</span> <span id="s734">And he -- he stayed with us for a few weeks, and he died in January 1945, the day after my birthday.</span> <span id="s735">And he was lucid.</span> <span id="s736">He was lucid at my birthday.</span> <span id="s737">Wasn't any -- anything done.</span> <span id="s738">I was nine, turning nine, and he -- but he told me I'm gonna grow up to be very beautiful, and I'm gonna be rich and educated.</span> <span id="s739">And I think that took a lot of imagination because this scrawny little girl -- I mean I never became rich but I'm -- I'm okay, you know.</span> <span id="s740">I'm -- I'm no threat to -- to the millionaires, to Gates, to Bill Gates, but -- so he died the next day.</span> <span id="s741">And I went to school.</span> <span id="s742">I don't -- there was no grade.</span> <span id="s743">I mean you just sort of went there and you learned Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: How -- how old were you?</span> <span id="s745">How old were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: In Chernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: In Chernowitz, yes.</span> <span id="s749">So the -- there were all sorts of ages.</span> <span id="s750">So -- because these were the return people and nobody had actually been schooled.</span> <span id="s751">So {Coughs} actually when I started, I think when I started school -- you know, I turned ten.</span> <span id="s752">And I don't remember where I learned it, asked me what I want to be when I grow up.</span> <span id="s753">I said I want to be an architect.</span> <span id="s754">I knew no more about architecture than -- than the cat, but it sounded like a good thing to say.</span> <span id="s755">So I don't recall what we learned, but we -- we went -- there was someplace to go.</span> <span id="s756">And my brother had a different -- for just older kids, but the same thing.</span> <span id="s757">And -- but then he became -- my mother's sisters and Uncle Jupiter had gone to Romania.</span> <span id="s758">They didn't want to live under the Soviet rule.</span> <span id="s759">My dad had a job, I think again at the Meloche Trust, which is the -- the dairy trust.</span> <span id="s760">And -- but we didn't have very much of anything.</span> <span id="s761">So -- and we -- and my uncle persuaded us, persuaded my parents to come to Bucharest, to go to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s762">So that was another sort of using forged papers for -- so they used the -- the different birthdays, and that's how we got to be -- we came to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s763">I -- I remember I was in -- still in Chernowitz when the war ended in Europe May 8th, 1945, and there were thousands of thousands of people on the square in Chernowitz.</span> <span id="s764">And was a woman officer, you know, I never seen women in the Army, and she said, "This is a special day.</span> <span id="s765">Today we -- we celebrate probelov(ph), free -- freedom and peace.</span> <span id="s766">So that -- that was awesome.</span> <span id="s767">And we stayed in Chernowitz a few more months and then went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s768">And I don't -- we -- we got to Bucharest, I think, on a train.</span> <span id="s769">But the -- the -- with the fear of the documents always.</span> <span id="s770">And it became now a fear of documents.</span> <span id="s771">We arrived in Bucharest in 19 -- sometime in 1945, and stayed there until 1946 when the -- when the -- or -- or later, maybe -- yeah, '46, late '46 when the Nazis -- when the Soviets were occupying -- you know, the king -- when the king was -- was being ousted, King Michael.</span> <span id="s772">It was becoming communist and it was gonna be communist, and Uncle Jupiter didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s773">And my -- my parents -- my parents -- an aunt and cousin were in Germany already, and they felt that we should leave there because nothing good is gonna come.</span> <span id="s774">We should leave the area.</span> <span id="s775">So again, you sort of struggle and you -- you -- we lived in a one-room apartment or something in Bucharest, like a studio apartment.</span> <span id="s776">And you struggled to organize documents and visas and all this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s777">{Coughs} -- and in 1946, we were leaving.</span> <span id="s778">We had a visa for Germany, and a pass-through visa to the other countries in between.</span> <span id="s779">My uncle couldn't get a visa, so he just contacted smugglers.</span> <span id="s780">There were always these smugglers and -- Uncle Jupiter.</span> <span id="s781">So he paid somebody a lot of money and they -- on the -- the Hungarian border was still the Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s782">So the smuggler took him to this little town waiting for the train, for a train, for the right conductor to be able to smuggle him over.</span> <span id="s783">Well, it took a couple weeks and he still hadn't gone.</span> <span id="s784">So he said he would send for the women, when -- his wife and my other aunt when -- when he's on the other side.</span> <span id="s785">But then it had become communist already and you couldn't leave.</span> <span id="s786">So -- but the women had become anxious, so they -- they contacted the smuggler who tried to talk them out of it.</span> <span id="s787">They also paid him a lot of money, and they left their -- their beautiful apartment, all their possessions, and he took them to -- to the border town.</span> <span id="s788">Now, these -- these people must have had a brain freeze, because in a -- in a little border town where everybody is -- is a peasant, and you see these beautiful two women, the one with the long blonde hair, you -- you immediately conclude that there is something going on.</span> <span id="s789">I mean so when -- when the smuggler -- the smuggler didn't want to take all three of them.</span> <span id="s790">They talked him into it.</span> <span id="s791">He put them on the -- on a locomotive or something, and of course they were all arrested, arrested and sent -- sentenced to prison for four years.</span> <span id="s792">But in the meantime, our -- we had these visas and we went.</span> <span id="s793">We left Romania and went, and I lived in Prague for a while.</span> <span id="s794">We lived in Prague for several months.</span> <span id="s795">Don't know why.</span> <span id="s796">But we lived in Prague for several months in 1947.</span> <span id="s797">And after that, we -- we went to Munich.</span> <span id="s798">I stayed there until I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s799">And I had -- so I didn't go to school in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s800">I had learned -- had some tutoring, you know, volunteer tutors.</span> <span id="s801">But I learned -- I taught myself.</span> <span id="s802">I was reading and writing and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s803">And the same was in Prague.</span> <span id="s804">And then -- and when we came to Munich, where -- where did we fit in?</span> <span id="s805">We didn't really fit in any particular.</span> <span id="s806">There -- there was a school where, you know, we went every day and, you know, it was sort of teaching you life skills and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s807">Intellectually, we -- we were self-taught.</span> <span id="s808">And came to the United States at the end of 1951.</span> <span id="s809">So I -- when I say I grow up in Munich, I grew up basically there.</span> <span id="s810">And, you know, it was a lot of sort of empty time, a lot of -- grew up fast, dating, older people, you know, was kind of -- And my brother -- my brother went to Switzerland to study some kind of engineering, and he -- he came here two years after us.</span> <span id="s811">He stayed there until he finished his course, his studies, and came to the States in 1953.</span> <span id="s812">'52 maybe.</span> <span id="s813">Yeah, in '52.</span> <span id="s814">It was only a year and some months in the summer.</span> <span id="s815">And then he -- he went to college and -- oh, roll back.</span> <span id="s816">He was drafted, and he was drafted a few months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: By whom?</span> <span id="s818">By who?</span> <span id="s819">He was drafted by whom?</span> <span id="s820">By the -- who -- who drafted him?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: The United States.</span> <span id="s822">He came on a green card and he was arrest -- he was drafted.</span> <span id="s823">He was drafted.</span> <span id="s824">He was multilingual, as I was.</span> <span id="s825">They didn't try _______ at the time.</span> <span id="s826">Don't have to now, I guess.</span> <span id="s827">So he was drafted.</span> <span id="s828">And the funny thing is my parents wanted to stay in Germany, wanted to stay in Europe.</span> <span id="s829">But they were concerned that my brother would have to serve in the German Army, or in the European Army.</span> <span id="s830">They didn't want that.</span> <span id="s831">So lo and behold, we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s832">But once I got here, I had gotten used to it.</span> <span id="s833">And my brother, once he came on a green card, was drafted.</span> <span id="s834">So the -- but he was in basic training.</span> <span id="s835">The -- the colonel -- you know, my parents worried about him.</span> <span id="s836">I worried about him, too.</span> <span id="s837">Because, you know, in the basic training in the Army is a lot of Mickey Mouse stuff, clean your weapon, put it together, take it apart, make your bed, make -- shine your shoes.</span> <span id="s838">Well, we didn't think he knew how to do that.</span> <span id="s839">He's very smart and would become a very successful man, but these things are a skill unto itself.</span> <span id="s840">So the colonel one day heard him -- started talking to him and said to him "Where are you from and what language do you speak?"</span> <span id="s841">And he says, "Okay, you're my aide from now on.</span> <span id="s842">I want to learn French."</span> <span id="s843">So he eventually was sent to Europe.</span> <span id="s844">And I don't know if the colonel went, I don't recall, and he became part of the forerunner of the CIA.</span> <span id="s845">He was for the Army Intelligence.</span> <span id="s846">He was trained and they -- the Army Intelligence, he was -- he served the Army Intelligence.</span> <span id="s847">They gave him a different name.</span> <span id="s848">They put him in a private house -- they -- they rented a house for him in East Berlin.</span> <span id="s849">And he was a spy, basically, for -- for three years.</span> <span id="s850">And he -- they wanted -- tried to persuade him that he should -- he could be this, you know, he was done with the Army, that he should do this as a -- as a job, that he should become -- take this on.</span> <span id="s851">But we try to -- we talked him out of it eventually.</span> <span id="s852">But tried to explain to him, "Listen, they're not gonna send you to Paris, they're gonna send you to Africa or someplace."</span> <span id="s853">Well, anyway, he -- he went on to college and became a -- had a couple of degrees.</span> <span id="s854">And his job, his longest job, was for 35 years at the Rand Corporation, The Think Tank.</span> <span id="s855">He's very smart, and he's very good.</span> <span id="s856">And he died, unfortunately, 11-99.</span> <span id="s857">That's 14 years ago.</span> <span id="s858">So -- and I got married in 1952.</span> <span id="s859">I'd been here just months, here in Buffalo, and had no particular schooling, self-taught, learned -- I learned English by myself, self-taught.</span> <span id="s860">And in -- in Germany, nobody learned English.</span> <span id="s861">The school we attended to periodically didn't teach English.</span> <span id="s862">They just sort of kept you off the street, I guess.</span> <span id="s863">And I -- I taught myself English.</span> <span id="s864">And I tell everybody the story that we lived in -- we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s865">We lived in an apartment and we had a maid, Anna Marie.</span> <span id="s866">{Coughs} -- my mother -- my mother took ill in camp and she never basically recovered.</span> <span id="s867">She had arthritis.</span> <span id="s868">And I think she was emotionally injured as well, but she had a severe arthritis.</span> <span id="s869">And, you know, the meds that you take for arthritis sort of harm you as well.</span> <span id="s870">But so in Munich, people hadn't seen African-Americans.</span> <span id="s871">And Anna Marie, the maid, was in the park and met a soldier that was African-American.</span> <span id="s872">So one day he came to see her.</span> <span id="s873">She told him she lives there.</span> <span id="s874">She didn't tell him she works there.</span> <span id="s875">So people saw him in the building.</span> <span id="s876">And oh, my God, what's gonna happen to us.</span> <span id="s877">And he came to our door and rang the doorbell.</span> <span id="s878">And I opened the door, and he said, "I would like to speak to Anna Marie."</span> <span id="s879">And since I spoke English, I could tell him she doesn't live here, she just works here, and she's not here.</span> <span id="s880">And spoke a few more words to him.</span> <span id="s881">Very nice.</span> <span id="s882">It was all very nice.</span> <span id="s883">He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s884">But the -- the -- I was a star for the neighbors, because it was -- people were frightened.</span> <span id="s885">They had lived through the war and -- and this was a strange sort of person, you know, and they just didn't know what to make of it.</span> <span id="s886">And English was not spoken.</span> <span id="s887">Nobody spoke English.</span> <span id="s888">So it was -- made me a -- that was my good deed for -- for the week.</span> <span id="s889">So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland.</span> <span id="s890">My -- we -- my relatives that were in Munich, my cousin, a physician, well-known physician, had in the meantime gone to New York, moved to New York, so we really didn't have anybody in Munich.</span> <span id="s891">So I mean my dad had a job.</span> <span id="s892">I don't know what -- how good a job it was.</span> <span id="s893">It may have been less than he's used to.</span> <span id="s894">And he provided for his family, I guess.</span> <span id="s895">And he -- so we also came to the United States, not only -- but primarily because my parents worried that Armon would have to serve in a German Army.</span> <span id="s896">So that's what brought me to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: What do you remember about how you and your family were received in the United States as refugees or as survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: In the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Sort of half let's not touch them and half like the circus puppy or the circus performer.</span> <span id="s901">Half let's stay away, they were.</span> <span id="s902">But that's not only in United States.</span> <span id="s903">That's Jews have done that, too.</span> <span id="s904">Jews that were not deported had the same attitude.</span> <span id="s905">And -- and I had come to understand -- to observe that later, that -- that, you know, that's them and that's us, and somehow they deserved being deported.</span> <span id="s906">It was on the merits, not just on -- on some crazed anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s907">It was on some merits.</span> <span id="s908">And that was one -- one part of it.</span> <span id="s909">And the other part of it was curiosity.</span> <span id="s910">Oh, you were in concentration -- you must -- and you look, you know, like everybody else, and so that -- that accounts for -- that sort of registered with me.</span> <span id="s911">That accounts for my never having wanted to talk about it, that I just didn't want -- I never -- I never did.</span> <span id="s912">My -- since I spend a lot of time in California.</span> <span id="s913">You know, Spielberg has a show.</span> <span id="s914">No, I didn't -- and my brother was married to -- his first wife was -- her father was in the studio, a studio man, you know.</span> <span id="s915">And he -- he wanted me to -- my brother I mean absolutely would not, and thought well, maybe she's not as adamant.</span> <span id="s916">So I -- I -- that was in part, I didn't want to.</span> <span id="s917">I mean there is -- there is a population that -- that chose to, and I give them credit that chose to.</span> <span id="s918">I know Gerda Klein.</span> <span id="s919">Gerda Klein lived in my neighborhood in Kenmore, New York.</span> <span id="s920">So it was -- it was -- I give her credit.</span> <span id="s921">It was courageous.</span> <span id="s922">It was -- well, I don't know about being courageous, but it was -- {Coughs} it was an affirmative thing to do.</span> <span id="s923">And it -- it brought attention to it, and she was okay with that, and her family was okay with that.</span> <span id="s924">In fact, my -- my former husband had a business with her husband, Mr. Klein, had a printing shop.</span> <span id="s925">And my former husband was in advertising and, you know, did that.</span> <span id="s926">And the Kleins had three children within the same town, so at some point somebody collides.</span> <span id="s927">But I think that the Kleins, as a model, were not as accepted as you would think.</span> <span id="s928">They were respected but not accepted.</span> <span id="s929">That's my interpretation.</span> <span id="s930">Just because -- you know, I -- some people don't see that distinction, perhaps.</span> <span id="s931">I'm a shrink besides having a law degree.</span> <span id="s932">So the -- I think you can be respected without being accepted.</span> <span id="s933">And I think the Kleins were respected but -- accepted means you're just a regular guy, you're a regular woman.</span> <span id="s934">That's acceptance.</span> <span id="s935">If you are singled out for something that you had no choice about, or you had a choice about, that -- and people give you credit for that, that's not accepted.</span> <span id="s936">That's respected.</span> <span id="s937">But accepted is all the people.</span> <span id="s938">So I -- I don't know if you see the distinction, but that's -- or you've ever noticed the distinction.</span> <span id="s939">But I -- so I -- I didn't put it forth that I am -- when people say to me "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s940">Or you say more.</span> <span id="s941">In fact, I was a college professor at one time, and some of the students didn't -- you know, like they don't know accents.</span> <span id="s942">So they would say "Dr. Schafler, are you from New York?"</span> <span id="s943">{Laughter} "Or where are you from?"</span> <span id="s944">So, you know, I would say "Oh, I'm from some other place."</span> <span id="s945">I didn't want to go into it.</span> <span id="s946">So the -- the -- I did not want to attract attention because of that.</span> <span id="s947">So, but I don't think that Jews were as forthcoming as all that.</span> <span id="s948">They were not forthcoming in many ways.</span> <span id="s949">And -- and the more you -- you look around, there were a lot of Jewish profiteers.</span> <span id="s950">I mean like -- like Mr. Jacobs was a profiteer in the sense that he earned money and he lived better and earned himself positions.</span> <span id="s951">And I was reading a book not long ago about the Wrightmans.</span> <span id="s952">I don't know if the family name strikes you, but the Wrightmans are billionaire developers.</span> <span id="s953">They have developed half of Toronto or three-quarters of Toronto.</span> <span id="s954">And they are Hungarian Jews, and they bought their way out when -- when Hungary was going -- they bought their way out and they went to Tangier.</span> <span id="s955">So they -- so that they wouldn't be considered profiteers.</span> <span id="s956">Oh, and they went into money laundering.</span> <span id="s957">That's profiteering.</span> <span id="s958">And there was so much money.</span> <span id="s959">There was no place to launder money other than in offshore.</span> <span id="s960">So they became very, very wealthy.</span> <span id="s961">So for -- for people that don't know, they said she -- that Mrs. Wrightman had a group of women and they were wrapping packages to send to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s962">Now, that is the stupid -- the second stupidist thing I've ever heard.</span> <span id="s963">I can't think of the first.</span> <span id="s964">The idea that you can send packages to the -- to the concentration camp and they have mail call, and they say "Schmul Kahn(ph), there is a package for you."</span> <span id="s965">Are you kidding?</span> <span id="s966">So they -- and -- or -- or that the Nazis would have allowed packages to Dachau or Auschwitz or even Cariera de Piatra.</span> <span id="s967">That is too stupid.</span> <span id="s968">Oh, and -- and she -- they write -- probably self-written.</span> <span id="s969">I don't recall who wrote it.</span> <span id="s970">But they write that they -- they had difficulty sending them to the camps.</span> <span id="s971">They have to send them through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s972">And the packages had chocolate, coffee.</span> <span id="s973">Now, come on, give me a break.</span> <span id="s974">How ridiculous can you be?</span> <span id="s975">So the -- the -- they had dehumanized.</span> <span id="s976">They dehumanized the experience.</span> <span id="s977">If you think that -- that you can launder money for Nazis but you're sending chocolate -- chocolate to some camp somewhere, how dare you.</span> <span id="s978">So Jews did not -- did not do much, did not do much.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: When did you become interested in researching your own story and really piecing together your family history?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I -- I didn't -- I mean I know -- I knew some of it, you know, as I -- as I went along.</span> <span id="s981">I -- the -- the Schafler side of it was done by somebody else.</span> <span id="s982">When my brother died, the -- the rabbi said, "Schafler, are you related to my best friend Schafler who was a rabbi in -- in Toronto?"</span> <span id="s983">I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s984">And he showed me a picture, and he looked exactly like all the Schaflers.</span> <span id="s985">All the Schaflers are blonde, blonde, blue-eyed or green-eyed.</span> <span id="s986">They have perfect features.</span> <span id="s987">They all look alike, you know.</span> <span id="s988">So I said well, this guy must be related to me because he looks like my dad.</span> <span id="s989">So anyway, he says, "Well, I'll -- I'll -- he died, but I'll contact his widow."</span> <span id="s990">And he contacted this widow, and she -- she lived in Boston at the time, and she had -- but they had lived in Canada before, and then he been a rabbi in Boston as well, and she had seven children.</span> <span id="s991">They're sort of all over Canada and -- and Israel and New York and whatnot.</span> <span id="s992">And she started researching the Schafler family, and she sent me -- she would keep me posted, and she would send me all kinds of stuff about it, and she'd send me -- she'd send me like a matrix outlining who went where and who did what.</span> <span id="s993">But then one day she called me and told me that she's not gonna do -- and she had gone to Israel and she talked to people and she went to Vishnitz.</span> <span id="s994">But one day she told me she's not gonna do that anymore because she's getting married {Laughter}.</span> <span id="s995">And she met this friend she -- who -- who died, and she met up -- she connected to her husband and she is marrying this guy.</span> <span id="s996">So what I know is what I -- about the Schaflers is she did it.</span> <span id="s997">And I -- and I just have it.</span> <span id="s998">I benefited from it.</span> <span id="s999">As far as the Hollars, that's my mother's family, is what I know is just the one generation prior.</span> <span id="s1000">I -- I don't know very much beyond that.</span> <span id="s1001">But what have come to me, what I have -- I never thought much about it, many -- for many years, I ignored the -- it's been too painful to evaluate the Jewish contribution to the Holocaust and to the people that suffered.</span> <span id="s1002">It's been too painful.</span> <span id="s1003">But I have come to understand -- I don't understand it.</span> <span id="s1004">I just notice it.</span> <span id="s1005">The Jewish people had been conditioned by religion that, you know, do what you're told to do by authority.</span> <span id="s1006">No way could -- could ten Nazis with ten guns shoot 6,000 people.</span> <span id="s1007">No way.</span> <span id="s1008">So if they would have shot 200 people, 300 people, fully 5,700 or 4,700, whatever the math is, would have been alive, and -- and they offered no resistance.</span> <span id="s1009">My grandfather said "It's God's will we go" when they were ordered to -- to evacuate or get on the train.</span> <span id="s1010">What I didn't -- what I didn't say is -- about what happened to the other people in Cariera de Piatra.</span> <span id="s1011">The people were shot on the way.</span> <span id="s1012">They were shot just going to -- on the way to Kiev.</span> <span id="s1013">And those that survived {Coughs} were buried, were taken to Kiev, to Babi Yar.</span> <span id="s1014">You've heard -- have you heard of Babi Yar?</span> <span id="s1015">Yevtushenko's poem and stuff.</span> <span id="s1016">I have a -- a picture I'll show you later.</span> <span id="s1017">I went to Kiev to Babi Yar to see Babi Yar a few -- ten years ago.</span> <span id="s1018">And Babi Yar was babi in Russian and Ukrainian means grandmother, and yar means a forest.</span> <span id="s1019">But so this at the time was -- was outside of the city so they -- the Jews were dropped off there and told to dig graves and they were shot right into the graves.</span> <span id="s1020">So nobody survived even for two days.</span> <span id="s1021">That was the end of all the people at Cariera de Piatra is that they -- they were murdered there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: And how did you learn about that, the fate of that particular transport?</span> <span id="s1023">Did you learn about that much later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Later.</span> <span id="s1025">Later.</span> <span id="s1026">Later.</span> <span id="s1027">Later.</span> <span id="s1028">Much later, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1029">We -- we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1030">I -- I learned about it much later.</span> <span id="s1031">And after Yevtushenko's poem, I wanted to go to -- to see it.</span> <span id="s1032">Because we -- we had so many birthdates, my parents -- when my parents were alive, they were very worried about that, that -- that somebody will find out.</span> <span id="s1033">They had been intimidated by -- by Nazis and stuff.</span> <span id="s1034">And -- and they -- they had trouble coping with me because -- and so had my brother, by the way.</span> <span id="s1035">And the interesting part is that he -- he had high security when he worked for the -- for the REC and they never discovered that.</span> <span id="s1036">And -- and he had a different name.</span> <span id="s1037">Armon.</span> <span id="s1038">He was using the same initials, Armon, and I can't remember what last name they had given him, but Armon Schafler was his name.</span> <span id="s1039">So -- but -- so my -- when my parents were alive, they were always worried that somebody is gonna find out.</span> <span id="s1040">What are they gonna do?</span> <span id="s1041">Where are they gonna send me?</span> <span id="s1042">You know {Coughs}.</span> <span id="s1043">But -- but I didn't want to worry them, like why would I -- and I -- my -- so I -- I tell people when I was born, you know.</span> <span id="s1044">And it does not coincide with the -- with my documents.</span> <span id="s1045">So my parents knew that I am doing that.</span> <span id="s1046">Now, I married the second time.</span> <span id="s1047">I had divorced and married in Mexico, because it's difficult to divorce in -- in New York State at the time at least.</span> <span id="s1048">So I {Coughs} need to take some water.</span> <span id="s1049">I -- we arranged that we would -- I would get divorced in Mexico.</span> <span id="s1050">That used to be the divorce capitol of the world, in Juarez.</span> <span id="s1051">And we'd get married ten minutes later.</span> <span id="s1052">My -- I married, my husband was an attorney, and -- but my parents was worried about that, that transaction.</span> <span id="s1053">So -- and we flew right away to California.</span> <span id="s1054">So on the airport, just getting off the plane, my mother said, "Does he know your birthdate?"</span> <span id="s1055">{Laughing} The big secret.</span> <span id="s1056">The big secret.</span> <span id="s1057">So when my parents were alive, I mean this was -- this was one of my instances when my parents were alive.</span> <span id="s1058">I didn't want to cause them grief, you know, to -- to travel, so my -- my passport said born in '81 -- '31 or whatever.</span> <span id="s1059">And did not want to -- but -- but they worried about me going to Russia or the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1060">They worried about that {Coughs} so I did not do that.</span> <span id="s1061">But after they died, I did, and that's what took me -- you know, nobody cares, I don't think they cared, but my parents cared.</span> <span id="s1062">And -- and I went to Kiev and I went to Babi Yar.</span> <span id="s1063">And Babi Yar has now the -- the City of Kiev had grown around it, so it's now just a -- like a park.</span> <span id="s1064">This is a park and it has that -- that statute on it, and I photographed it.</span> <span id="s1065">But most people don't know about Babi Yar and stuff like that so -- But anyway, I went to Moscow, and nobody -- oh, and when I was in Moscow, somebody lost my passport, and {Coughs} -- I -- I didn't think for a second that -- that it was -- had anything to do with -- with the false papers they got out of the Soviet occupied.</span> <span id="s1066">But at the same time, a little bit, you think about it.</span> <span id="s1067">So that -- that fear is {Coughs} -- and I have my driver's license -- my driver's license, if you were to take our driver's licenses, my brother's and me were twins.</span> <span id="s1068">So my brother never told his wife.</span> <span id="s1069">He had been married for 27 years to this -- this woman, and he never told her about that.</span> <span id="s1070">So earlier this year, I went to California and she had -- she had made some reservation for me, and she says, "Well, give me your -- your birthdate as it's written on the -- on your driver's license."</span> <span id="s1071">So I told her.</span> <span id="s1072">She said, "Oh, my God, that's my brother -- my husband's."</span> <span id="s1073">I said, "You're right, it is."</span> <span id="s1074">So you can change it and it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1075">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s1076">But the fear is there and, you know, when I would say "Mom, where are they gonna send me?</span> <span id="s1077">I'm stateless.</span> <span id="s1078">I'm an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1079">Where are they gonna send me?"</span> <span id="s1080">And maybe I'd like it if they do.</span> <span id="s1081">So the -- the fear.</span> <span id="s1082">And -- and I think there is a Jewish fear.</span> <span id="s1083">There is a inherent fear.</span> <span id="s1084">Maybe -- maybe it's just the generation that experienced Naziism.</span> <span id="s1085">Maybe it's still -- although the Jewish paper, somebody sent me this article from the -- the D.C. Jewish paper that it said Jews have no opinion about some political thing.</span> <span id="s1086">Like why should they have an opinion?</span> <span id="s1087">I mean Americans should have an opinion.</span> <span id="s1088">Why should they have an opinion?</span> <span id="s1089">So maybe -- maybe it's not as homogenized yet as I think, that that fear has -- has been left.</span> <span id="s1090">But then Jews don't speak out about -- about Jewish slight.</span> <span id="s1091">Jews were silent in the '30s.</span> <span id="s1092">Business was good, especially in the United States.</span> <span id="s1093">It was after the Depression.</span> <span id="s1094">And they were selling arms, and they didn't want to rock the boat.</span> <span id="s1095">So they were silent.</span> <span id="s1096">I mean having a demonstration in -- in New York City is not enough, so -- but this has come to me later.</span> <span id="s1097">When I married my first husband, he -- he was a staunch -- talked about Roosevelt, his whole family.</span> <span id="s1098">And Roosevelt sat with his lover he had in Bethesda.</span> <span id="s1099">You know, you probably heard that he had on the corner, like the second corner of Connecticut Avenue, there is a house on the hill and he used to go there every afternoon to meet his lover.</span> <span id="s1100">And -- and Jews didn't -- were not an issue.</span> <span id="s1101">Jewish blood being wasted was not an issue.</span> <span id="s1102">So that had come to me later when I -- when I started looking at it.</span> <span id="s1103">And for me that's what I like about Israel.</span> <span id="s1104">They're pugnacious and they -- they -- in a way they are like a four-year-old who's pugnacious but dependent at the same time.</span> <span id="s1105">Israel is dependent on the Western World.</span> <span id="s1106">But at the same time, they're pugnacious, and they -- "Hey, I don't like this crap, yeah?</span> <span id="s1107">I don't -- I'm not gonna take this."</span> <span id="s1108">So -- but that has come to me much later.</span> <span id="s1109">The fear of being Jewish has -- had persisted for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So why did you decide to tell your story now?</span> <span id="s1111">Why did you decide to tell your story now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Well, first of all, because I -- I no longer feel constraint by -- by my constraints.</span> <span id="s1113">As I mentioned to you, when -- when the man spoke, and you can probably look it up in the -- who he was and -- look it up in the calendars, you know, I thought I'm not doing that, you know.</span> <span id="s1114">I'm not looking at -- and, you know, all the people in California, I didn't want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s1115">But -- but I -- maybe it's an empowerment.</span> <span id="s1116">I have empowered myself.</span> <span id="s1117">This happened to -- to me despite what I thought, despite me being innocent, and now I can tell you about it and you didn't help me.</span> <span id="s1118">You did nothing about it.</span> <span id="s1119">The -- the people that we thought were -- we were helped by the people that we thought were victimizing us.</span> <span id="s1120">The camp commander who hid, who said, "I saved as many of you as I could", and he didn't steal the money, he didn't -- he didn't bribe himself.</span> <span id="s1121">He had the opportunity.</span> <span id="s1122">And -- and the -- and Misha and the -- we never -- didn't know his name, the round guy, is {Coughs} that used to give us food and say "Don't worry about that, just hang in."</span> <span id="s1123">Just -- just -- or some days when there was a lot of shooting, he'd say, "Today is not a good day you should look out", you know, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1124">But he'd come by almost every day.</span> <span id="s1125">I can't remember a day that he didn't.</span> <span id="s1126">So these are the people that helped us that we thought were our -- our enemies, our -- that betrayed us.</span> <span id="s1127">They didn't betray us.</span> <span id="s1128">They did what they could to survive themselves.</span> <span id="s1129">And in a way -- in the -- on the way of helping themselves, they helped others.</span> <span id="s1130">This is a huge risk for the camp commander to hide 400 Jews.</span> <span id="s1131">This is a huge risk {Coughs}.</span> <span id="s1132">And -- and to sort of minimize it, and probably he was scared stiff, but he said, "Oh, there's nothing there, just old stuff."</span> <span id="s1133">So this is why I -- I feel empowered now.</span> <span id="s1134">I got it.</span> <span id="s1135">What I didn't get before, I got it now.</span> <span id="s1136">And I think it's a -- it's a moving story to tell.</span> <span id="s1137">It's -- it's -- this kid that didn't have any schooling went on to -- I started -- I took a course in college in interior decorating.</span> <span id="s1138">That's what you did in the '50s, you decorated your house.</span> <span id="s1139">And _______+ went on would take maybe something else similar.</span> <span id="s1140">But later I -- I heard -- I took a psychology class, and I was so enthralled by what the professor had to say that this was my -- going to be my life-long quest to study.</span> <span id="s1141">So I went on and I -- I have a BA.</span> <span id="s1142">I went on for a Master's, and I have a Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1143">I have been in school for, I don't know -- in college, not -- actually for 20 years, yeah, and then I went for my law degree.</span> <span id="s1144">I had -- I had 20 years of college and no nothing.</span> <span id="s1145">And when I started college, you still had to take gym.</span> <span id="s1146">So I had to get special permission, I do not take gym.</span> <span id="s1147">And golf didn't count.</span> <span id="s1148">I used to play golf a little bit.</span> <span id="s1149">That didn't count.</span> <span id="s1150">I used to take ballet lessons for a long time.</span> <span id="s1151">That didn't count.</span> <span id="s1152">Had to be gym, and I'm not sure what it had to be.</span> <span id="s1153">I was just -- you know, I was way beyond that.</span> <span id="s1154">So -- so I have come a long way, I think.</span> <span id="s1155">I didn't become rich, you know.</span> <span id="s1156">I modeled in between.</span> <span id="s1157">I have modeled for artists, for photography, you know, kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1158">I was a college professor.</span> <span id="s1159">I had my own psychotherapy practice and my own office.</span> <span id="s1160">Self-made.</span> <span id="s1161">In fact, my daughter, my children, are highly educated.</span> <span id="s1162">My daughter is a physician.</span> <span id="s1163">She's a distinguished physician.</span> <span id="s1164">She was a rogue scholar and she -- they both went to Ivy League schools.</span> <span id="s1165">And she was a professor at Penn.</span> <span id="s1166">Now she's a big wheel in a drug company in -- drug company -- pharma company, Merck.</span> <span id="s1167">And my son is a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1168">He went to Columbia Law School.</span> <span id="s1169">And Ginsburg was his professor, Justice Ginsburg.</span> <span id="s1170">So -- and even the next generation, the grandchildren, three of them at Cornell and one at Williams.</span> <span id="s1171">How -- how better can it get?</span> <span id="s1172">So -- so it -- it can be done, and I did it.</span> <span id="s1173">So now I -- I feel no -- no constraints.</span> <span id="s1174">I -- if I'm not accepted, I don't care.</span> <span id="s1175">I mean I might be respected, but I don't know that any -- any concentration camp victims are accepted.</span> <span id="s1176">I don't know that.</span> <span id="s1177">I have not seen any evidence of that.</span> <span id="s1178">I think that even those that have reached fame or wealth are sort of more like the circus entertainer than just -- just an ordinary person.</span> <span id="s1179">But that's my own view of that.</span> <span id="s1180">Elie Wiesel is somebody who comes to mind.</span> <span id="s1181">I mean he's not -- he's admired but he's not -- and respected but he's not accepted, you know.</span> <span id="s1182">I mean he's not a regular guy, you know.</span> <span id="s1183">To -- to be accepted, you have to -- you can be respected and be a regular guy, and he's not respected as a regular guy.</span> <span id="s1184">So -- but I don't care now, you know.</span> <span id="s1185">I have accomplished a lot.</span> <span id="s1186">And those that don't want to accept me, go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add that we haven't discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: I -- nothing that, you know, I haven't -- I'm trying to think what I wanted to tell about the camp story that I omitted.</span> <span id="s1189">That to -- to illustrate the accept -- I felt as a child the acceptance versus the kindness.</span> <span id="s1190">And as I told you before -- and I think you may want to -- to make a point of that, that -- I told you that the Bacalls were not there when we were, and there were the Finklesteins.</span> <span id="s1191">They -- they accepted us, you know.</span> <span id="s1192">They -- they didn't do their duty to -- to some unknown whatever.</span> <span id="s1193">They accepted us.</span> <span id="s1194">We were children, and they -- we were special.</span> <span id="s1195">And the way they treated us, you know, sort of -- we were dirty, I'm sure we were, and they -- they put us in their beds and they cleaned our clothes and they watched us sleep.</span> <span id="s1196">That's acceptance.</span> <span id="s1197">And -- and -- and they were poor but they fought for us, to keep us.</span> <span id="s1198">They were not poor -- I mean poor, I'm using it in relation to -- but they were not wealthy.</span> <span id="s1199">And two more mouths to feed, I don't know that it was easy.</span> <span id="s1200">But they were -- they were -- they wanted to share because they -- they accepted us.</span> <span id="s1201">So not a big -- the Bacalls were wonderful and all their friends.</span> <span id="s1202">They had parties and physician there, and he used to examine us and he was their close friend.</span> <span id="s1203">And they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s1204">But then they were rich.</span> <span id="s1205">And the maid did most of it, and the chauffeur did the rest of it, so they -- it's easier kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1206">It was not -- they -- I don't think they accepted us.</span> <span id="s1207">They sort of a "noblesse oblige", if you know anything in French, that so -- that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1208">And I think that -- that the acceptance for minorities in general is just not what it should be.</span> <span id="s1209">It should -- just not what it should be.</span> <span id="s1210">I mean when -- when I came to this country, I thought being Jewish, being a Holocaust survivor, is like being, you know, a toddler, you grow up and you move on, but it isn't.</span> <span id="s1211">Nobody -- you're not treated like that.</span> <span id="s1212">So therefore, you internalize that you're not treated like that.</span> <span id="s1213">We also thought that, you know, we -- we fought for the '60s and all the marches and stuff and we thought well, equality for -- for African-Americans, for black people would come.</span> <span id="s1214">And then you would just think well, this is another woman and she's great or she's awful or just another guy and he's great or he's -- didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1215">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1216">The -- so this is one of the reasons that I decided now to -- she's the one that is the survivor.</span> <span id="s1217">I mean when -- when -- when Madoffs, the people that gave the money, you know -- you know, we all -- you probably know, you saw the list, I'm sure you saw the list, you -- you think -- you thought to yourself how could people that have that much money be so stupid?</span> <span id="s1218">How could they not know what goes on?</span> <span id="s1219">How could they not know that -- that when everybody else pays 3 percent and somebody pays 10 percent that is illegal or -- or fraud.</span> <span id="s1220">But people looked at Wiesel, especially, Elie Wiesel, and thought how could he do that?</span> <span id="s1221">I'm sure you know he lost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1222">And he said he didn't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1223">He feels that.</span> <span id="s1224">He feels that his -- his -- his burden is -- is higher than someone else's burden.</span> <span id="s1225">You know, somebody else had lost that much money.</span> <span id="s1226">A lot of people spoke out.</span> <span id="s1227">He never spoke out, because he feels that -- that he's not accepted, and for him would just be another piece of evidence not to accept him.</span> <span id="s1228">No, another reason not to accept him.</span> <span id="s1229">I had -- I had wonderful childhood, you know, wonderful childhood.</span> <span id="s1230">That's not true.</span> <span id="s1231">I had wonderful childhood until -- until -- but I had like Ruth, I had very good parents, wonderful parents, although they were more conservative and fearful as they got older and fearful because of what they went through.</span> <span id="s1232">They were -- they were just -- we were their priority, and if we -- they didn't give us food when we were in camp was because there was none.</span> <span id="s1233">And we didn't have to ask and say "How come we're not eating?"</span> <span id="s1234">If it would have been possible to get food, they would have gotten it.</span> <span id="s1235">So -- so this kind of total devotion.</span> <span id="s1236">And I remember my -- when we came back from Botoshan and we were walking down the street and we saw my dad come walking, {Coughs} coming towards us, and he hugged me and he said, "You came back to your poor old father."</span> <span id="s1237">And I'm thinking to myself how could he doubt it?</span> <span id="s1238">How could he doubt that we would come back?</span> <span id="s1239">You would make a choice you left luxury and you came to your poor -- poor old, poor father.</span> <span id="s1240">How could he doubt that?</span> <span id="s1241">That he -- they were very loving kind of -- if not dad -- my dad was more affectionate than my mother, but both of them had the priorities taking care of the children.</span> <span id="s1242">So -- so this -- this kind of thing gives you a basis.</span> <span id="s1243">I didn't have to worry about that they would not protect my interests.</span> <span id="s1244">So -- so you take this basis with you into life, this early -- or this -- this approval, you know.</span> <span id="s1245">I had come to -- to -- to -- when you go through marriages and stuff like that, and you realize that only good parents love you.</span> <span id="s1246">Everybody else has a motive, wants you to love them back, wants to be married to you, uh, whatever.</span> <span id="s1247">But only loving parents love you because they -- they wanted to have children and they -- they -- they feel the responsibility to do the best by you.</span> <span id="s1248">And when they led us -- they sent us away, they wanted us to survive.</span> <span id="s1249">If they couldn't assure their survival, they wanted someone else to -- they wanted us to survive.</span> <span id="s1250">So anyway -- yeah, I can think of -- the woman in Ruth, she -- she talks about -- I don't know if you are familiar with the book, but she talks about hers was a more modest.</span> <span id="s1251">They were sort of hand to mouth kind of people.</span> <span id="s1252">And so any -- any bit of deviancy in life affected them immediately {Coughs).</span> <span id="s1253">So different experiences may have made her different -- her attitude different.</span> <span id="s1254">That's all I have to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Conclusion of Interview Interview with Pepi
