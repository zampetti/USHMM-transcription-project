tell me a little bit about your childhood and background before the war.</span> <span id="s15">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Lublin, Poland on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family.</span> <span id="s17">My birth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was a full-time mom.</span> <span id="s19">She used to sing in the path when she was young, but her career ended before I was born, I understand.</span> <span id="s20">My dad was a locksmith and son of 1 of 13 children, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of taking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s21">Naturally, he had to go to work to support his family.</span> <span id="s22">That's why he didn't finish school yet.</span> <span id="s23">Eventually when he married my mom, he graduated from high school, became a locksmith to survive and to earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and going to night school, he became an architect.</span> <span id="s24">So I was raised in a middle class family.</span> <span id="s25">Very, very happy childhood.</span> <span id="s26">I had a sister, was one year older than I was.</span> <span id="s27">We lived in a big apartment house belonged to my grandparents.</span> <span id="s28">The entire family, over 18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day.</span> <span id="s29">Naturally, as you live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise, and this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers.</span> <span id="s30">Now, I was playing violin since I was four and a half years old.</span> <span id="s31">I remember my first violin was bigger than I was.</span> <span id="s32">I couldn't hold the violin properly.</span> <span id="s33">I recall the tortured nights when they put cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the octave on the violin.</span> <span id="s34">Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">04:03:04 I never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in heaven when I start playing particularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing piano, my uncle, my youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: There was four people and I was playing violin.</span> <span id="s37">Of course, we were playing for friends of our parents.</span> <span id="s38">I would rather be outside playing tennis or whatever.</span> <span id="s39">But this was a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked it actually.</span> <span id="s40">But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I want to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s41">I don't want to, would like to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s42">I don't want to be a musician.</span> <span id="s43">I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never understand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing her in the heart.</span> <span id="s44">There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of rebellion, a quiet rebellion.</span> <span id="s45">But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start practicing again.</span> <span id="s46">I was going to school of music.</span> <span id="s47">Eventually I graduate ... in academy of music, and I was full fledged violinist.</span> <span id="s48">In the meantime, my father was involved in expansion of a high school.</span> <span id="s49">This was a Catholic high school where the principal was a bishop.</span> <span id="s50">I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in hallways, accompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know.</span> <span id="s51">To me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here.</span> <span id="s52">We lived in the outside of area where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: It was modern edifice and there were no Jewish people around there.</span> <span id="s54">So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though.</span> <span id="s55">I did understand Yiddish but I could never speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s56">And one day, going back to the principal of the high school, my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now that you have to enter high school.</span> <span id="s57">What you think of my son considered being a student in your high school?</span> <span id="s58">He said "no problem."</span> <span id="s59">As soon as he passes the pre-entrance exam, he accepted.</span> <span id="s60">There is no problem.</span> <span id="s61">But then my dad replied, but this is a Catholic school and we're Jewish.</span> <span id="s62">So, ... the principal replied.</span> <span id="s63">We prefer a Jewish student in a Catholic high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">04:06:05 Believe it or not, I started studying hard.</span> <span id="s65">I was a good student and I passed exam and the reality came through.</span> <span id="s66">I became the first Jewish student in the highly Catholic school, high school.</span> <span id="s67">Well, my days in high school were extremely happy.</span> <span id="s68">They were the best years of my life.</span> <span id="s69">I never felt I'm different.</span> <span id="s70">I didn't look different, but on the street, kids in the area knew who I was.</span> <span id="s71">They called me, you dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s72">You filthy Jew, for no reason.</span> <span id="s73">But my high school I was never approached like this.</span> <span id="s74">I was respected by my colleagues.</span> <span id="s75">I think they liked me.</span> <span id="s76">I was excellent student.</span> <span id="s77">I was even assigned by teachers of certain class like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor my colleagues from the same class that didn't do so well, and all of them went through and passed the exams.</span> <span id="s78">So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in helping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not because they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">And, I was very active in French club which I organized.</span> <span id="s80">I was very active in an art club which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was nominated by the director of the musical department school to participate in our symphony orchestra in high school, to a point on one day we had a contest in our town of different symphony orchestras in different high schools and this took place in one big theaters in the city, and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like today and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then.</span> <span id="s81">She seen certain things, you know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her this kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the road of my future.</span> <span id="s82">I was just insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my mom didn't want me to talk about it about it.</span> <span id="s83">And there were different days you respected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was supposed to be.</span> <span id="s84">Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made quiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">04:09:02 Anyway, my school days were really fantastic.</span> <span id="s86">Sundays was customarily thing that all boys high school all in uniforms would marching to church.</span> <span id="s87">I was in front with the band.</span> <span id="s88">I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the band.</span> <span id="s89">And then when we arrived in the church, 800 or so students, went up to the church and my road led to the choir, and I was playing violin with the choir.</span> <span id="s90">Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the rituals with the prayers for eight years I was in school there and I felt that I'm Catholic, except I was not baptized.</span> <span id="s91">I had Christmas tree at home next to Hanukkah.</span> <span id="s92">And I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do.</span> <span id="s93">No one making fun of this.</span> <span id="s94">But then here and there in the city when I went to the park or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks, and knowing who I was.</span> <span id="s95">One day I remember I was little.</span> <span id="s96">We went to the park, wintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a sled.</span> <span id="s97">I was on the sled.</span> <span id="s98">He was pulling me on the sled.</span> <span id="s99">He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man young in his 20s or so.</span> <span id="s100">It was a scene, a scene I never forget.</span> <span id="s101">Students of the local university, Catholic university attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side curls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades.</span> <span id="s102">They are cutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear.</span> <span id="s103">Blood was flowing and I never forgot.</span> <span id="s104">I was a young kid.</span> <span id="s105">But they seen us watching them from a distance.</span> <span id="s106">They ran toward us, tried to attack us.</span> <span id="s107">But my dad's employee was very fast, athletic and so on, he pulled that sled fast and they were falling, you know, in distance and couldn't reach us.</span> <span id="s108">But eventually, they blocked our path, you know, and they pinned us against the wall.</span> <span id="s109">He made a mincemeat out of them.</span> <span id="s110">He beat them so up, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him.</span> <span id="s111">The fact that we were attacked meant nothing.</span> <span id="s112">I think he put to jail then.</span> <span id="s113">This was one episode I remember.</span> <span id="s114">But this never happened in my school though.</span> <span id="s115">In school, I was person, that I was not a Jew.</span> <span id="s116">I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by everyone.</span> <span id="s117">That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">04:12:02 And, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with my high school and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me survive.</span> <span id="s119">So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: When was that incident with the --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: This was probably in about '32, '34, 1933, '34, about five years or so before the war.</span> <span id="s122">This was not an isolated incident.</span> <span id="s123">There were more incidents like this from then on.</span> <span id="s124">There was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in '33.</span> <span id="s125">Then you seen people very traumatic.</span> <span id="s126">In front of Jewish stores, Polish people standing with signs "do not buy from the Jews, they steal your money."</span> <span id="s127">And in spite of this, many people going to Jewish stores, and then they are leaving the stores they were someone taking their pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in those and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s128">And I seen all those things.</span> <span id="s129">I was already confused.</span> <span id="s130">Here I am in Catholic high school.</span> <span id="s131">I thought I was Catholic.</span> <span id="s132">And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s133">We are not a religious family although my parents had a kosher home, for one reason.</span> <span id="s134">All the Jews had kosher home.</span> <span id="s135">They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic.</span> <span id="s136">Meat was not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some place in a barn, didn't know how hygienic was done.</span> <span id="s137">So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but that's the only reason.</span> <span id="s138">But otherwise, we are not religious.</span> <span id="s139">But to explain yet my parents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they were not religious I say.</span> <span id="s140">Once a year we going to the little Synagogue was actually somebody's like apartment, where the Jews were praying all day long.</span> <span id="s141">I remember that I was little boy then.</span> <span id="s142">I couldn't wait until the service was over.</span> <span id="s143">There was so stuffy.</span> <span id="s144">There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the kids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are allowed to eat.</span> <span id="s145">You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child, you know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know, I remember until today.</span> <span id="s146">And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire a teacher which they call a Rebbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">04:15:07 Rebbe is not a rabbi.</span> <span id="s148">It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings, you know, and the religious laws and so on.</span> <span id="s149">And he was coming, I don't recall, three or four times a week to my home, and I remember he was falling asleep while he was reading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know.</span> <span id="s150">I was turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know.</span> <span id="s151">And when he woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even.</span> <span id="s152">But, I got the touch of it anyway, you know.</span> <span id="s153">Not that I learned anything from him.</span> <span id="s154">But there is somethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not very comfortable being in a Synagogue because I didn't grow up in that kind of surroundings you know.</span> <span id="s155">But I knew who I was.</span> <span id="s156">Then since there was a Catholic schools and there was so many other Jewish students in different schools.</span> <span id="s157">None Catholic but state schools who didn't had no formal Jewish education.</span> <span id="s158">So once a week one of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our school Catholic school teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from Egypt and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less were not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report.</span> <span id="s159">But I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the New Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two grades.</span> <span id="s160">And this was very happy solution to me until summer of '39, prior to September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s161">Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to Poland.</span> <span id="s162">We invade Poland.</span> <span id="s163">We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews belittle the rumors.</span> <span id="s164">All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to cut short vacation and come home.</span> <span id="s165">Sure enough, September 1, '39 war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Polish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks.</span> <span id="s167">The whole army fall apart.</span> <span id="s168">Our government left Poland, first to escape, and only one that stood up yet was Warsaw, was defending self for several weeks.</span> <span id="s169">And Germany have a hell of a time, the whole of Poland was invaded already and Warsaw was still fighting.</span> <span id="s170">In the meantime the Germans entered our hometown.</span> <span id="s171">First thing they did, all the Jews have to register.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">04:18:01 All the Jews have to give up their possessions.</span> <span id="s173">Their music instruments, piano, grand piano, furs, jewelry, libraries, whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give it up.</span> <span id="s174">And of course, means of communications, telephones and radio.</span> <span id="s175">Germans were afraid of the local population listening to the radio, to BBC maybe.</span> <span id="s176">So we're not allowed to have the radios, and one day I remember my dad came home bloodied up.</span> <span id="s177">He was beaten by the Pole and the Germans.</span> <span id="s178">He was caught on the street.</span> <span id="s179">He was there to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a prepay and sent him home.</span> <span id="s180">When I seen this, I seen what was to come here.</span> <span id="s181">I recall we sitting together, the whole family at the table, discussing what should we do.</span> <span id="s182">It was too late to run.</span> <span id="s183">West we couldn't go, wanted us to know that Russia divided Poland with the Germans.</span> <span id="s184">The Soviet Army actually came from the East going West and they stopped at the River Bug and the German Army stopped at the River Bug too and our town was slightly west of the River Bug so we were at the fortune to be under German occupation.</span> <span id="s185">Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go eastward, to the Germans.</span> <span id="s186">With the blessing of my family, I took a bicycle.</span> <span id="s187">My parents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and money didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s188">So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially Soviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out.</span> <span id="s189">There was not documents except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach destination far east in Poland.</span> <span id="s190">A little town named Rovno.</span> <span id="s191">Why do you go to Rovno?</span> <span id="s192">Rovno was a city where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I thought at least I find somebody a relative of course.</span> <span id="s193">I arrived there.</span> <span id="s194">My ultimate goal was to enter the school there and study medicine.</span> <span id="s195">But I was not accepted, maybe as much as good as I thought I will be.</span> <span id="s196">Mainly, because food was a problem.</span> <span id="s197">Staying in this small, cramped quarters, you know.</span> <span id="s198">He was married.</span> <span id="s199">Had one boy, baby boy, and I know it was very difficult for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">04:21:02 So I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to Lvov, the Germans call Lemberg, which was a big city, about 250,000 people, site of university, formally under the jurisdiction of Austria, Hungary.</span> <span id="s201">Many intelligent people spoke German, and it was just a beautiful city and I was very fortunate to take my pre-entrance exam and be accepted in medical school.</span> <span id="s202">Now you have to understand, that I was a refugee.</span> <span id="s203">I had nothing with me.</span> <span id="s204">I had no money.</span> <span id="s205">I had no clothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time.</span> <span id="s206">But I still felt ... I always promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an obligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too.</span> <span id="s207">I always wanted to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s208">So I was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the school cafeteria.</span> <span id="s209">I cleaned the tables.</span> <span id="s210">I was getting three meals and then knowing the people, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a bed and in a room for students, like a dormitory.</span> <span id="s211">And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from my hometown.</span> <span id="s212">We became good friends and I was doing well in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: This is 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And you were how old then?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I was 19.</span> <span id="s217">And through 1940 I was doing nothing but studying.</span> <span id="s218">I wasn't hungry no more, and that's a time that we didn't have no communication with my home, Lublin.</span> <span id="s219">I was very bothered with the fact that I didn't know what was going on with my parents and my older sister.</span> <span id="s220">There was no way you could communicate there.</span> <span id="s221">I sent a few messages through people, peasants they used to smuggle items going one way or the other to the border, but allegedly they never received letters from me, which I later found out.</span> <span id="s222">One day who knocks on my door?</span> <span id="s223">I open the door.</span> <span id="s224">Who is there?</span> <span id="s225">My dad.</span> <span id="s226">He swam through the River Bug and being pursued by the Germans and the Russians, arrested by the Russians as a spy and he bought his way out, explained he was not a spy, a Jew looking for his son.</span> <span id="s227">They let him go.</span> <span id="s228">Happened to be a Jewish officer understand.</span> <span id="s229">He came to Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">04:24:07 He found me and looked at me and he was crying because I never looked so dilapidated, so abandoned like.</span> <span id="s231">And I didn't have a coat.</span> <span id="s232">I didn't have a blanket.</span> <span id="s233">At night I covered myself with my overcoat, my blanket, but I was not cold.</span> <span id="s234">But he didn't get used to this picture because I was always well-dressed and a well-to-do family, and so on and here -- I try to explain to him not to worry about me here.</span> <span id="s235">At least nobody is going to kill me here.</span> <span id="s236">Nobody was going to shoot me.</span> <span id="s237">I still get my education and I asked him maybe to stay with me, and we looked for ways to bring my mother and my sister to us.</span> <span id="s238">There was no way.</span> <span id="s239">My dad refused to do that.</span> <span id="s240">"There was no way to do that."</span> <span id="s241">And he is stay with me for a few days only.</span> <span id="s242">I remember today, he sat on my coat.</span> <span id="s243">A button was missing.</span> <span id="s244">He said, if your mother would see that she would be very unhappy.</span> <span id="s245">And he got a button someplace and a thread and sew the button on my coat.</span> <span id="s246">I never forget those little things ... Then we parted...while I thought I would never see him again.</span> <span id="s247">But the meantime life was going on.</span> <span id="s248">I was going to school.</span> <span id="s249">1941, July, war again.</span> <span id="s250">Germany, in spite of their pact with the Soviet Russia, they invade Eastern Poland and first thing what happened, Ukraine students in the dormitory, Knew who was the Jewish student.</span> <span id="s251">They grabbed me, one of my good friends, Ukrainian, grabbed me beating the hell out of me.</span> <span id="s252">Forced me to scrub the floor of a pub they had opened up for German officers.</span> <span id="s253">From then I was taken to a labor camp in Janowska street in Lvov.</span> <span id="s254">It was not a concentration camp, it was a labor camp, but the way they treated us was just like concentration camp.</span> <span id="s255">We lying on wooden boxes really.</span> <span id="s256">Not in bed, boxes.</span> <span id="s257">There was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s258">And we had to be on a field at 5 am.</span> <span id="s259">wintertime.</span> <span id="s260">If you didn't stand straight, they beat you.</span> <span id="s261">They kick you from the front, from the back, from the side.</span> <span id="s262">You couldn't go down or they would shoot you.</span> <span id="s263">So the awareness of not to go down, the beating always kept me aware of it, to stand up and I was numb.</span> <span id="s264">And after a while I didn't feel the beating even and then maybe at 7am.</span> <span id="s265">or so we marching to the city to work, and after a few days I thought well, there was nothing to expect.</span> <span id="s266">I run away.</span> <span id="s267">And, where you going to go?</span> <span id="s268">I run away to the dormitory.</span> <span id="s269">That's the only place I knew.</span> <span id="s270">However, I found three of my colleagues, Jewish students, hiding in the basement.</span> <span id="s271">How they escape I don't know, because they went through the building very thorough, using the Ukrainian police with the Germans.</span> <span id="s272">We decided to go eastward.</span> <span id="s273">The Russians were still not too for from the city, so hiding, going to the fields at night or so.</span> <span id="s274">We try to stop some of the Russian trucks so they can maybe pick us up so we can go with them east to Russian.</span> <span id="s275">Well, they pointed their guns to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">04:28:02 They didn't know who we were.</span> <span id="s277">They were afraid too.</span> <span id="s278">They were running away themselves.</span> <span id="s279">So walking about 70 kilometers, mostly during the night, some during the day, especially through the forest so we would not be visible.</span> <span id="s280">We reached the town named Zolochev.</span> <span id="s281">It was a town of about 35,000 people, I would say 80 percent Jews.</span> <span id="s282">With my luck, wouldn't you believe we walked in at a time when there was a big pogrom taking place.</span> <span id="s283">Right away we were caught by the Ukraines, brought us to a square, town square and put in front of a small building which was the administrative building, I understand.</span> <span id="s284">Here in front of us were bodies of Jews, piled one on top of each other, dead.</span> <span id="s285">They said to line up, four of us, with hands up, and there were about few thousand maybe 2000 to 3000 spectators in the town square, mostly Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">And we seen the SS or Gestapo, I don't remember which.</span> <span id="s287">I think it was SS and firing squad.</span> <span id="s288">Before you knew you were there, right there and we supposed to be executed.</span> <span id="s289">Well, you know, this moment my whole childhood went through my mind.</span> <span id="s290">I close my eyes.</span> <span id="s291">I seen everything.</span> <span id="s292">I remember first time, I recall any event which was a funeral when I was five years old.</span> <span id="s293">From then on, my childhood, my sister, my parents, my high school, the principal, the bishop, everything until this moment and like a movie.</span> <span id="s294">I said, that's a very short life though.</span> <span id="s295">And I didn't hear nothing.</span> <span id="s296">I just became totally numb.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">04:30:05 Maybe it's like a self-defense mechanism with your body that if you know that you were facing your final hour, maybe that's what it was.</span> <span id="s298">I was never a victim of execution.</span> <span id="s299">So you don't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s300">It was so quiet, so peaceful, and I didn't hear a thing.</span> <span id="s301">And I was totally frozen.</span> <span id="s302">There were four of us lined up and I was second from the left.</span> <span id="s303">And then after a while, I don't know how long it lasted, I slowly opened my eyes, slowly.</span> <span id="s304">I thought, I cannot be dead.</span> <span id="s305">Its so quiet and peaceful.</span> <span id="s306">Where am I?</span> <span id="s307">Slowly, I turn to the left, slowly to the right, mostly with my eyes only, and I seen my colleague to the right.</span> <span id="s308">The last one was slumped over on the ground, so I didn't know if he was dead or not.</span> <span id="s309">But all my other colleagues, one on the left, one on the right, were standing like myself, erect and still.</span> <span id="s310">Slowly I turn more and more and I look around and I see nobody.</span> <span id="s311">Totally turning around I look, thousands of bodies on the ground.</span> <span id="s312">I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s313">They looked like Muslims praying, you know.</span> <span id="s314">And they were all dead.</span> <span id="s315">Making a long story short, I found out that two Russian planes came in, seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the area.</span> <span id="s316">One colleague was killed.</span> <span id="s317">We believed he was most likely killed by the Russians accidentally, not by the execution, the firing squad.</span> <span id="s318">When see what was going on.</span> <span id="s319">The three of us grab my little suitcase, tiny little satchel actually, and run to the river.</span> <span id="s320">The pogroms were still going on in the rest of the city.</span> <span id="s321">We hid in the river, up to our necks.</span> <span id="s322">We took some bushes to cover our heads.</span> <span id="s323">We stayed there at least three or four days or nights.</span> <span id="s324">Until we frozen to death.</span> <span id="s325">We couldn't stand it no more.</span> <span id="s326">We were hungry, exhausted.</span> <span id="s327">We didn't care.</span> <span id="s328">We're desperate and we just didn't care what happened to us no more.</span> <span id="s329">So we decided to get out the river, and walking toward some buildings we heard Ukrainians say, Oh, three more Jews not killed?</span> <span id="s330">How comes?</span> <span id="s331">You know, we kept walking, walking.</span> <span id="s332">I don't know how we happened to -- we walked into a hospital, local hospital, happened to be a Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s333">Pogrom was over.</span> <span id="s334">Whoever was killed was killed.</span> <span id="s335">Thousands of people were killed and they accepted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">04:33:05 They fed us.</span> <span id="s337">They cleaned us, gave us some clothing and shelter and bed and asked us to work in the hospital.</span> <span id="s338">But I didn't know what happened to my family.</span> <span id="s339">This was a very close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not.</span> <span id="s340">I didn't know how to make contact with the family.</span> <span id="s341">So I decided to go back to Lvov, Lemberg, which was my university, and I thought we knew some Polish people there.</span> <span id="s342">Maybe somehow they heard something, what happened to my hometown at least.</span> <span id="s343">So again, smuggling our way through, all three of us went back to the Lvov and I did visit one of the families.</span> <span id="s344">They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer some of my message to the family if I know the address.</span> <span id="s345">But I didn't know the address.</span> <span id="s346">But there was no problem finding where the Jews are living now in Lublin.</span> <span id="s347">After a while, someone came to me, I was staying with those people, the Polish people.</span> <span id="s348">The ghetto was not fully forming yet at that time so Jews were moving around, not freely, but they could move around.</span> <span id="s349">They had to be at dusk in their quarters, you know.</span> <span id="s350">And a Polish fellow came to me and said my father contacted him to bring me back home.</span> <span id="s351">He was a cab driver who drove all night, only during the night, so he wouldn't be caught either.</span> <span id="s352">He had some false papers on some kind of Polish mission and I went with him back home, leaving my two friends behind, not knowing if we ever see each other, saying good-bye to each other.</span> <span id="s353">Driving at night, we arrived home.</span> <span id="s354">Of course, I found my family not in the original home anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">They were moved to a ghetto area which was behind ... the old town, the Jews used live there before, was a gate entrance.</span> <span id="s356">You had to go, pass through, show your ID You go could to work through the gate again into the city.</span> <span id="s357">My father worked as an architect.</span> <span id="s358">Again, he worked for the German railroad, so right away I was a medical student.</span> <span id="s359">But he got me a job on the construction of the railroad as a medic.</span> <span id="s360">I had a white band with red cross on it.</span> <span id="s361">I didn't have nothing else with me.</span> <span id="s362">I could do nothing for anybody who got sick.</span> <span id="s363">I didn't know nothing about.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">04:36:00 Anyway, I was not a doctor yet, but this was a way of surviving, you know.</span> <span id="s365">And with him every day to construction and I made a lot of contacts there with many Polish people.</span> <span id="s366">I contact some of my school friends and they were happy to see me I was still alive.</span> <span id="s367">They ask me what they can do for me.</span> <span id="s368">At that time I didn't know what they could do for me.</span> <span id="s369">We are not still in the situation very desperate yet ... and ... we were going through several selections what they used to call.</span> <span id="s370">Selection was the means of when the Germans coming to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s371">One night they arrive, maybe one in the morning.</span> <span id="s372">They want to have a grand piano.</span> <span id="s373">Where we going to get a grand piano?</span> <span id="s374">We were not allowed to have a grand piano.</span> <span id="s375">Remember, in '39 all the Jews have to give up all the musical instruments.</span> <span id="s376">So they didn't care where to get a piano.</span> <span id="s377">Buy it.</span> <span id="s378">Where you a going to buy a piano at one o'clock in the morning even if you have the money?</span> <span id="s379">So the people had to be taxes, I don't recall the sum of money needed, but early the morning they went to town and they bought a grand piano and delivered a grand piano to the Germans.</span> <span id="s380">So we got a reprieve.</span> <span id="s381">A month later another selection.</span> <span id="s382">People were not necessary for the German government to sustain the war machine were eliminated.</span> <span id="s383">They were selected left, and right, left and right, and whoever was not needed were disappeared actually.</span> <span id="s384">They took them by trucks and they left, no one knew where they went.</span> <span id="s385">We were fortunate.</span> <span id="s386">We were still together, the whole family until about April of 1942.</span> <span id="s387">In 1942 in April, the rumor was that the Germans are going to move all the Jews outside the city, there special quarters made for us.</span> <span id="s388">It's going to be like a summer home for the Jews there.</span> <span id="s389">Little gardens we could go till our soil, and we still working for them.</span> <span id="s390">Whoever is working is going to be working.</span> <span id="s391">From about 60 or 70 thousand Jews there were only four thousand Jews left then.</span> <span id="s392">Mind you, that many Jews were eliminated during my absence when I went East.</span> <span id="s393">So I came back there was just about 4000 Jews.</span> <span id="s394">We had to march by the foot about 15 kilometers without belongings to new quarters.</span> <span id="s395">We took place the little -- village name was Majdan Tatarski.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">04:39:06 This was a little village of horse thieves and some peasants.</span> <span id="s397">They had a little cattle, like a pig or two, dogs, and you know, and they put the Poles and the Jewish in the apartment balconies.</span> <span id="s398">You could see a pig on the balcony and they were not very unhappy about it.</span> <span id="s399">They were not used to living in an apartment house, and the Jews were in a little town not far away from the city, about several kilometers away from the city, and this little town was surrounded by empty fields.</span> <span id="s400">So was at that time no one thought about it that.</span> <span id="s401">This was strategically figured out by the Germans because they won't be able to hide.</span> <span id="s402">There are all empty fields around this little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Unbeknown to us they are building already a concentration camp, Majdanek, which was only three or four kilometers away from this area.</span> <span id="s404">Some of my fathers Polish friends were employed as carpenters, came back and told my father.</span> <span id="s405">They are building some there, something very suspicious.</span> <span id="s406">We are working on it.</span> <span id="s407">We don't know what is it.</span> <span id="s408">It is some kind of barracks, but maybe its for the German Army, for the soldier or so.</span> <span id="s409">But then they building something like ovens, or something.</span> <span id="s410">We don't know what it's for and some of the Polish people say, I bet you they crematorium to burn the Jews.</span> <span id="s411">And that's how the rumor started.</span> <span id="s412">But where you going to go?</span> <span id="s413">There is no place to go.</span> <span id="s414">And in January I think, January ... No, no I'm sorry, not January.</span> <span id="s415">November 9 was total liquidation of our ghetto.</span> <span id="s416">Early in the morning the Ukraine Army, not Army, the soldier and the policeman surrounded the ghetto with some Lithuanian policeman too, and they said everybody has to report at different gate and they will be deported to labor camps.</span> <span id="s417">That's all that was said.</span> <span id="s418">As my wife said in her statement before, my father built a little hiding place by doubling a wall through a hidden door.</span> <span id="s419">We could stay there in, only in standing position.</span> <span id="s420">This was not a hiding place for a long lasting type of escape or so, hiding.</span> <span id="s421">You could maybe hide there for a few hours or so, a day maybe and that is about all.</span> <span id="s422">We see the futility of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s423">Because the announcement you could hear through the loudspeakers while were hiding.</span> <span id="s424">Anybody found hiding after such and such a time, 7 am will be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">04:42:01 So your only time to escape now is to get out now.</span> <span id="s426">My parents decided to leave and go.</span> <span id="s427">They want me to save myself.</span> <span id="s428">I took Lucine my friend at that time to my hiding 1 Majdan Tatarski: or Maydan Tatarski.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">place away from her parents because they had no place to hide at all.</span> <span id="s430">After we seen the futility of our hiding place there was no point in doing that, and my parents decided to go with the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s431">We escaped from this hiding place, went to the attic of the Jewish Administration Building where Lucine's father was still active there, and through the hole in the wall I see my parents and my sister walking with hundreds of people to unknown, to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s432">That's the last sight of my parents I seen.</span> <span id="s433">I try to grab my sister to try maybe to escape together, but I didn't know how and where and when.</span> <span id="s434">She didn't want to leave my parents.</span> <span id="s435">My parents insisted I don't go with them, so I stayed with Lucine, not knowing what we going to do next.</span> <span id="s436">And the picture of my parents huddling, holding each other, embracing each other, and the snow falling down called November, early morning, never leave my life, always remember that picture.</span> <span id="s437">We still have about two hours time to the deadline.</span> <span id="s438">Her father bribed the Ukrainian guard some gold coins and the a fountain pen, a bottle of vodka I think, so he would just ignore us, not to look our way while we try to lift the barbed wire, sneak right under the wire, escape.</span> <span id="s439">That's what we did.</span> <span id="s440">One of the -- one, myself, my wife, her little brother was about eight or nine years old at that time.</span> <span id="s441">From under the wire we run away.</span> <span id="s442">We running zig zag fashion.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Ukrainian guards and other guards are shooting after us but didn't hit us, and, after running for two, three kilometers we found a Polish peasant who was going home in a wagon, horse-driven wagon.</span> <span id="s444">He gave us a lift, you know.</span> <span id="s445">He probably suspected who we were because there was no other people in this area.</span> <span id="s446">He didn't said nothing then, nothing to us.</span> <span id="s447">He pretend that he didn't know nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">04:45:04 And where we go from here?</span> <span id="s449">No plan, no money, no documents of any kind.</span> <span id="s450">First thought was to go to a bishop's palace.</span> <span id="s451">This was not the bishop who was the principal at the high school, but the gardener at the bishop's palace.</span> <span id="s452">Their son was a friend of mine that I tutored in high school.</span> <span id="s453">We knock on their doors early in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">When his mother seen me, she cross herself.</span> <span id="s455">She said, My God, where is your mom and dad?</span> <span id="s456">I said, they left already.</span> <span id="s457">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s458">We looking for shelter.</span> <span id="s459">Can you help me?</span> <span id="s460">She took us to greenhouse.</span> <span id="s461">It was nice and warm there but she said, look, you can only stay here until early in the morning because this was Sunday, because next Monday morning the workers coming in they find you hiding, they would denounce you to the Gestapo or the Polish police, and you know what they do with us they find you hiding here?</span> <span id="s462">They kill us all.</span> <span id="s463">So we stayed there.</span> <span id="s464">She fed us, gave me a coat and a jacket, of her husband.</span> <span id="s465">Her son was missing in the war.</span> <span id="s466">She didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s467">He turned out to be later on in the British RAF.</span> <span id="s468">He survived the war, but she never forgot what I done for her son.</span> <span id="s469">He passed all the grade because I tutoring him, French, Latin, math, history and she felt very bad.</span> <span id="s470">She wanted to help but she was scared stiff and I understood.</span> <span id="s471">I don't know if situation be reversed how would I behave?</span> <span id="s472">Would I have the guts to hide those people under a death threat?</span> <span id="s473">In all honest, I don't know if I could do it.</span> <span id="s474">I did understand their motivation and their fears but was grateful, they kept me at least overnight to get our thoughts together.</span> <span id="s475">And then I remember my dad's associate, a Polish fellow.</span> <span id="s476">My dad gave him all the shops.</span> <span id="s477">Give to him as a present since he couldn't keep it himself.</span> <span id="s478">So he inherit all the tools and the machinery, so on, and he not too far away from the bishop's palace.</span> <span id="s479">So, early in the morning before the workers arrive, we went there and knocked at the door again, and the same story.</span> <span id="s480">He crossed himself.</span> <span id="s481">My God, where's your dad?</span> <span id="s482">Told him the whole story again.</span> <span id="s483">He said, let's go right now through warehouse and nobody will see you.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">4:47:59 So he hid us for several days there brought us a little food there, and he gave us names of people to contact in the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s485">Maybe they can do something for us.</span> <span id="s486">While I was waiting there hidden with her little brother, my wife, without documents, went to Warsaw by train, which was a life-threatening situation, to contact some people who knew how to get the documents.</span> <span id="s487">Mind you we have no money, no money.</span> <span id="s488">This was name of the game.</span> <span id="s489">You're not alive you have no money.</span> <span id="s490">She contact some people.</span> <span id="s491">She was directed to some hotel where the Polish underground was there and they were manufacturing false documents.</span> <span id="s492">Over there she met a friend of her father who was already ... domesticated, so to say.</span> <span id="s493">He had his documents.</span> <span id="s494">He lived on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s495">He tried to seduce my wife, at that time not my wife yet.</span> <span id="s496">Tell her he would help her only if she would stay with him.</span> <span id="s497">Of course, she rejected the whole thing and she left him.</span> <span id="s498">She came home back with false documents.</span> <span id="s499">Now, how do you move from a hiding place broad daylight if your hometown, not too big of a town, but people might know you and you didn't know who was going to denounce you?</span> <span id="s500">We couldn't go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s501">The station was surrounded by police and Gestapo, but at least we've had documents, so we are hire a driver with a buggy whom took us to next little town which was about 15 kilometers away, at night.</span> <span id="s502">How this man never suspected.</span> <span id="s503">If he did suspect, he never said a word to us.</span> <span id="s504">Who we were.</span> <span id="s505">It was obvious, you know.</span> <span id="s506">We were like odd people, odd couple.</span> <span id="s507">Myself, little boy didn't look like our son.</span> <span id="s508">Too young for that.</span> <span id="s509">It was unusual situation so anyone with common sense would know who we are.</span> <span id="s510">Arriving in the darkness in a little railroad station and we boarded a train.</span> <span id="s511">I was very upset, very nervous on the train.</span> <span id="s512">I had documents, but, they're false documents.</span> <span id="s513">And after maybe two, three hours ride on the train, all of a sudden train stops.</span> <span id="s514">Doors open.</span> <span id="s515">German Gestapo, SS walks into each car.</span> <span id="s516">Asks documents, everybody's documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">04:51:00 Well, we are not sitting together.</span> <span id="s518">I pretend I do not know my wife, my Lucine, I mean, my friend, in front at that time in case one is caught, maybe other escape and little boy sitting with her, just in case, her brother.</span> <span id="s519">And then one of the officers comes in and points out to young man.</span> <span id="s520">You, you, you, you.</span> <span id="s521">One of them was me.</span> <span id="s522">This is it.</span> <span id="s523">But there were mostly Polish people there.</span> <span id="s524">I was kind of confused.</span> <span id="s525">What's going on?</span> <span id="s526">Well, they were catching Poles too to send to labor camps you know, to send most to Germany.</span> <span id="s527">Get out they say.</span> <span id="s528">So I got out.</span> <span id="s529">I line up with a few other people.</span> <span id="s530">Maybe one of us young guys -- and go with me.</span> <span id="s531">I thought we shot probably.</span> <span id="s532">So what happened?</span> <span id="s533">We went to the first car and we start going to car to car, through the whole train.</span> <span id="s534">They were liquidating all the ... tobacco, food, hams, meats, that the Polish peasants were smuggling to the city to sell in the black market.</span> <span id="s535">And we are the people that supposed to carry all the stuff to their cars.</span> <span id="s536">And this took about two hours, and at the end this, he gave me a big ham.</span> <span id="s537">Payola, and back to the train.</span> <span id="s538">And so went back to the train and arrived at midnight in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s539">You know by now that we were accosted by a rickshaw driver.</span> <span id="s540">We request to go to same hotel that my wife knew about when she got the false papers.</span> <span id="s541">This was the headquarters of the refugees.</span> <span id="s542">How the Gestapo didn't know about it yet I don't know, but it's the only place we knew of.</span> <span id="s543">The ultimate plan was either to make contact to stay in Warsaw proper on the Aryan side, or if not, go back to the Warsaw ghetto which was still big and maybe look up her uncle who lived there.</span> <span id="s544">Maybe he be instrumental in assisting us.</span> <span id="s545">So we gave him the address where to go but we see he is going to the opposite direction and we ask him, where you going?</span> <span id="s546">He said, oh, you know where I am going.</span> <span id="s547">I'm going to, you know, I'm going to Aleja Szuchawhich is known headquarters of the German Gestapo.</span> <span id="s548">Why you take us there?</span> <span id="s549">You filthy Jews.</span> <span id="s550">I'm going to be paid for you very well.</span> <span id="s551">And I said, how much can you get paid for that?</span> <span id="s552">So we didn't deny the fact anymore.</span> <span id="s553">We didn't admit who we are, but it was obvious.</span> <span id="s554">I said, look, take whatever we have.</span> <span id="s555">We don't have much but whatever we have is yours.</span> <span id="s556">What you going to gain?</span> <span id="s557">They going to kill us.</span> <span id="s558">So, he took my coat, my boots, left me with my socks, scarf, a fountain pen, little money we had, not much, took her purse, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">04:54:04 Left us in the middle of the street past midnight, that if we could be caught by any patrol, you know, and killed right away.</span> <span id="s560">Anybody moved after midnight was a game, you know, they were shooting.</span> <span id="s561">They didn't ask any questions, and we found a way to this hotel.</span> <span id="s562">Over there we made contact with some people.</span> <span id="s563">We see we have no way of staying outside the ghetto, so we contact a man who was involved in the labor groups going in and out of ghetto.</span> <span id="s564">One of them was a friend of my father.</span> <span id="s565">He was from my hometown.</span> <span id="s566">He knew my father very well.</span> <span id="s567">So when he recognized me he said, come in at four o'clock.</span> <span id="s568">I will take you to the ghetto when the group is finished working.</span> <span id="s569">We arrived there at four o'clock.</span> <span id="s570">He took us all, my wife, her little brother, myself to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s571">Was a horrifying sign in the picture of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s572">I'm not used to it.</span> <span id="s573">Even in our ghetto in Lublin, the situation was not as desperate as in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s574">There was about 60,000 Jewish living in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s575">There were many dead bodies lying in the street covered with newspapers.</span> <span id="s576">The stench of the bodies, you know, flies, and people bypassing them like nothing happened, just macabre sight.</span> <span id="s577">This is what we came to ghetto for.</span> <span id="s578">People dying like this.</span> <span id="s579">Better off dead, being shot by German.</span> <span id="s580">We found our way to Lucine's Uncle's house.</span> <span id="s581">He was very well-to-do person.</span> <span id="s582">He was employed 2 Alea Szuch A. Szucha Avenue, or Lane.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">by American Joint Committee before the war in a very high position.</span> <span id="s584">Very wealthy person.</span> <span id="s585">They had a little baby girl so we said look, we don't have no place to go.</span> <span id="s586">We have no money.</span> <span id="s587">We have nothing.</span> <span id="s588">Could you help us.</span> <span id="s589">So he said, well, I don't know temporarily, why don't you sleep on the floor in the kitchen and Lucine -- her name was Estera at that time -- you sleep upstairs in the attic.</span> <span id="s590">He never asked us if we wanted to eat anything or not.</span> <span id="s591">We were hungry and we were depressed and devastated morally and broken down, sleeping at nights.</span> <span id="s592">Maybe 2:00, 3:00 AM I seen candlelight.</span> <span id="s593">I seen waking up at night her uncle and her aunt eating food, you know.</span> <span id="s594">They never ask us if we want to eat anything.</span> <span id="s595">They didn't want to share the food with us.</span> <span id="s596">There was not much food at that time, so they tried not to share it with us.</span> <span id="s597">I couldn't blame them really, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">04:57:04 But we seen how can we live like this, you know.</span> <span id="s599">Then they got the bright idea you cannot live under one roof without being married.</span> <span id="s600">Well, Lucine was only 16 years old and he said we have a friend who is a rabbi, a friend of your father -- meaning Lucine -- I'll try to contact.</span> <span id="s601">Maybe he marry you since he knew your father.</span> <span id="s602">Turned out he was sick at that time with typhus, and so he found another different young rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Without having a ring, without having any proper clothes or suit or a dress for her, we got married.</span> <span id="s604">There was a young couple before us.</span> <span id="s605">Somehow they got us bottle of wine.</span> <span id="s606">We got married.</span> <span id="s607">We toast each other with their wine and after the wedding ceremony, which only the two people, the previous couple witnessed and also her cousin -- which survived the war too, he witnessed so till today were the only ones witnessed our wedding.</span> <span id="s608">Leaving the ceremony, she run into a lady who recognize her, friend of her mother, who was just out with her husband.</span> <span id="s609">So she said, we just got married but no rings.</span> <span id="s610">She took the ring off her finger.</span> <span id="s611">Why don't you take my ring?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Maybe bring you good luck, and she give her ring.</span> <span id="s613">And this was our honeymoon in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s614">We decided to move out of her Uncle's house.</span> <span id="s615">We had to really.</span> <span id="s616">We found one little rooms, cramped, with other people.</span> <span id="s617">They allowed us to use one bed.</span> <span id="s618">There were no mattresses.</span> <span id="s619">You just improvise by taking a sack, a canvas type of sack filled with straw and put some towels over it and no sheets.</span> <span id="s620">That was your bed and, but I had contacts.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">04:59:22 End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s623">05:00:32</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Let's got back and tell me the incident in the garage.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I have to regress and recall some incidents I would like to mention maybe.</span> <span id="s626">When I came back from Zolochev back to Lvov or Lemberg, when before I met my three other colleagues from medical school.</span> <span id="s627">During the one occasion when I was I was caught by my Ukrainian colleague and he asked me -- he forces me to clean the pub, the floor etcetera.</span> <span id="s628">One of the days I went to work they asked some people, who’s a mechanic?</span> <span id="s629">This was a good profession to be in.</span> <span id="s630">Without hesitation I raised my hand.</span> <span id="s631">I mechanic.</span> <span id="s632">I never touched anything mechanical in my life, but many people were doing the same thing, and they took me on the side and one mechanic came in, turned out to be a Jewish boy too, and ten of us we took the police garage.</span> <span id="s633">They gave us some quarter there, a bunk bed.</span> <span id="s634">They fed us good and asked us to work on their cars.</span> <span id="s635">I admitted to the man, chief mechanic, that I have no blind idea about mechanics.</span> <span id="s636">He said, shhh, be quiet.</span> <span id="s637">We'll help you what we can.</span> <span id="s638">I'll tell you what to do.</span> <span id="s639">Just unscrew this portion and then oil this part and so on.</span> <span id="s640">We'll tell you what to do so don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s641">I'm running the show.</span> <span id="s642">You do what I tell you to do.</span> <span id="s643">Was very nice about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">And so I was there for maybe a few weeks.</span> <span id="s645">We're fed well.</span> <span id="s646">We're not beaten.</span> <span id="s647">The Germans usually say hello to us.</span> <span id="s648">The German Police, it was not the Gestapo, this was not the SS.</span> <span id="s649">And one day during the evening, one of the German officers approached me in the garage and took me on the side and asked me, is it true you're medical student?</span> <span id="s650">And I said, yes.</span> <span id="s651">He said look, I want you to be aware of it that as of tonight they're going to liquidate the garage and they'll take you all of you away.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">05:03:04 I don't know where, you won't stay here.</span> <span id="s653">I want you to know there's a stable on the left wing of the building there, and I will give you something to carry for me to the stable now and I will meet you over there.</span> <span id="s654">I was very puzzled with the whole thing but you do obey orders.</span> <span id="s655">I went there, I followed him, went there with this big box.</span> <span id="s656">Then he show me behind where the horses are placed.</span> <span id="s657">there's a little hiding place.</span> <span id="s658">You stay there.</span> <span id="s659">They will never find you there and at night after they liquidate this garage, and so on.</span> <span id="s660">You can stay until next day or so and somehow you have to get out of here and go to town and I'm bring you something.</span> <span id="s661">He went, came back maybe a few minutes later, and brought me a whole chicken.</span> <span id="s662">He said, that's all I can do for you.</span> <span id="s663">I can do nothing else for you.</span> <span id="s664">I'm so sorry, and he left.</span> <span id="s665">I don't know his name, don't know who he was.</span> <span id="s666">I know he was a doctor in German Army.</span> <span id="s667">He was not a Gestapo, he was not an SS man, he was not a policeman.</span> <span id="s668">He was a physician, very young.</span> <span id="s669">In his upper 20s maybe.</span> <span id="s670">That's the only benevolent act I have encountered from Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Did you hear something that night while you were hiding there?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I heard some voices only, noises, but not very loud, and then everything was quiet.</span> <span id="s673">And the next morning gates were opening and closing and cars trucks moving out, and the whole regiment of the police left the compound and there was no one left behind, and I waited until night, following night, and I through the fence I find my way back to the city, to the ghetto area.</span> <span id="s674">And I approach some of the Jewish people there and they let me sleep in one the rooms there, and that's next day I went out to the ghetto with the work battalion.</span> <span id="s675">And I approached one the Polish people that I knew from before who could contact my father, which I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s676">This was on one episode.</span> <span id="s677">Then when I came back home and prior to liquidation of the ghetto few days before, I did try to escape.</span> <span id="s678">We did know that the ghetto was going to be liquidated completely and I tried to run away, and going under the barbed wire the Ukraine were shooting at me.</span> <span id="s679">I was running like a wild beast and they wouldn't have caught me if not the police dog.</span> <span id="s680">He grabbed, forgive my French, my buttock, ripped a piece of flesh out and my calf and subdue me.</span> <span id="s681">I was bleeding all over.</span> <span id="s682">Then I was caught by the Ukrainian guards and they brought me back to the ghetto and handed over to the Gestapo, and they start beating me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">05:06:19 They were beating me, standing behind me with a -- we call it a peitsche.What it was is actually is a handle made out of leather, hard leather, at end of which like a whip.</span> <span id="s684">Actually was a hard, metal ball with points on it.</span> <span id="s685">Standing behind me he was hitting me from the front so it was injured, my face actually standing behind me.</span> <span id="s686">And I have a little scar and I ... until today I am impaired vision in left eye ... was bleeding from the eye.</span> <span id="s687">But I couldn't go to a doctor of course.</span> <span id="s688">I will stay like this until two days later until finally, when finally the ghetto was liquidated and I escape again.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">With Lucine, my future wife and her little brother under a barbed wire, and you know the story then that we were hiding in the bishop palace, which I mentioned before, then went to my father's friend who hid us in a warehouse.</span> <span id="s690">Then Lucine went to Warsaw to secure some papers for us.</span> <span id="s691">Then she come back.</span> <span id="s692">We had the papers all together but no money.</span> <span id="s693">Lucine remembered her parents left some jewelry and silver, a candelabra with a neighbor and a friend who lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s694">So we went to her and Lucine approached her.</span> <span id="s695">Would you mind at least give us one candelabra so we can sell it, maybe find a way to Warsaw so -- and if we don't survive, whatever else my family gave you is yours.</span> <span id="s696">She said, well, but, you know, I don't have it in my home everything.</span> <span id="s697">Is hidden in the attic and I cannot go to the attic tonight because the neighbors would be very suspicious, what am I doing in the attic.</span> <span id="s698">But come tomorrow and I will prepare everything for you.</span> <span id="s699">I will wrap it so people won't know what it is.</span> <span id="s700">Come back tomorrow at two o'clock.</span> <span id="s701">Having a suspicious mind, and you felt a certain extra instinct, like a hunted animal, I just felt maybe the whole thing sounded fishy.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Instead of coming two o'clock, we approached the area about noon time, 12:30.</span> <span id="s703">Now,</span></p> <p><span id="s704">3peitche: whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">we're locating ourself across the street from the main entrance to the building that the lady lived, and this area was bombed out, lot of ruins, you know.</span> <span id="s706">You could hide very easily there, and behind us was a little street and a small apartment like a street apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">05:09:03 Actually, that my colleague from high school lived there.</span> <span id="s708">His father was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s709">I was tempted to go there, now stay there maybe and watch the house, but then I didn't want to expose them to this kind of danger either.</span> <span id="s710">So I decided to wait on the street behind the ruin, and sure enough about one o'clock we see two police cars pulling over to the curb of the house and two or four Gestapo people got out of the cars and rushed up stairs.</span> <span id="s711">Within about 15, 20 minutes they came out and they split.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Two people went one way, the other two people went the other way, looking for us.</span> <span id="s713">I assume they meant us.</span> <span id="s714">We didn't wait too long there.</span> <span id="s715">We knew she had denounced us to the Gestapo because of a silver candelabra.</span> <span id="s716">And I just remember now talking about Judas sold Jesus and the situation was so analogous to it, you know.</span> <span id="s717">But anyway, we didn't know what to do so we run into my friend's house.</span> <span id="s718">The parents recognized me right away, what happened?</span> <span id="s719">I told them what happened very briefly and shortly.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Gestapo looking for us.</span> <span id="s721">What going to do?</span> <span id="s722">And she very, old lady, you take your coat off.</span> <span id="s723">Here, take your shoe off and start putting nails in your shoe, in my heel.</span> <span id="s724">She gave a apron to my wife and she was cooking something on the iron stove.</span> <span id="s725">Said, you pretend you cooking dinner right now and your little brother, put him to bed.</span> <span id="s726">He's asleep.</span> <span id="s727">Now we'll cover him up with blankets.</span> <span id="s728">There was a curtain separating a one room apartment, a curtain separating the one bed area from the work place and the kitchen, and this old lady took a blanket outside, start dusting the blanket, calmly, quietly.</span> <span id="s729">All of a sudden, two people approach her.</span> <span id="s730">Did you see Jews here?</span> <span id="s731">So she pretended.</span> <span id="s732">Jews here?</span> <span id="s733">There no Jews here.</span> <span id="s734">They all dead.</span> <span id="s735">There not nobody here.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Whose house is that?</span> <span id="s737">My house.</span> <span id="s738">My father's working here.</span> <span id="s739">My husband's client is here and my daughter is there.</span> <span id="s740">She cooking right now, dinner, and they walked inside to see.</span> <span id="s741">Didn't ask for the paper, although we did have documents, false.</span> <span id="s742">They looked like they didn't believe they would be fresh enough to be so blatantly, you know, or stupid or to stay right near the scene of a crime.</span> <span id="s743">And they left the house and start looking for us again.</span> <span id="s744">Of course, we didn't wait too much longer.</span> <span id="s745">We took off.</span> <span id="s746">That's when we went back to the warehouse the same night we took that horse and buggy type of thing to the near railroad station near Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">05:12:12 Well, going back to the ghetto area.</span> <span id="s748">So, we lived in one little room and from there I had to go on to work detail.</span> <span id="s749">Each morning a group of maybe 40, 50 people gathered in the ghetto area with a leader.</span> <span id="s750">The leader was a friend of my father, and with him we're going to the railroad station over there.</span> <span id="s751">We're unloading cars.</span> <span id="s752">They didn't beat us there but didn't pay us either.</span> <span id="s753">Didn't feed us either.</span> <span id="s754">The only pay off was I could take as much coal as I could carry on my back as my payment for days work.</span> <span id="s755">So I of course, I put as much coal as I could.</span> <span id="s756">I was bent over on all fours practically, carrying the big sack of coal back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s757">It was cold but we couldn't afford to heat our apartment because this was all our food depend on the coal.</span> <span id="s758">I was carrying to the third story with some the richer, older Jews you know.</span> <span id="s759">We were buying the coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">With the money we collected for the coal we could buy some food.</span> <span id="s761">We lived on carrots, cabbage, turnip from which, of course, we got diarrheas.</span> <span id="s762">We were sick, stomachaches.</span> <span id="s763">There was no bread.</span> <span id="s764">We couldn't afford any bread.</span> <span id="s765">There was nothing, nothing cooked.</span> <span id="s766">There was nothing to cook.</span> <span id="s767">And on one of my trips I notice a familiar face in a uniform of a Polish railroad man and I thought, I know this face.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">And as I said before, you develop a certain instinct.</span> <span id="s769">You just aware of your surroundings.</span> <span id="s770">Who is around there.</span> <span id="s771">Who, is he a friend or an enemy?</span> <span id="s772">And finally I approach him.</span> <span id="s773">I start working the area he was standing.</span> <span id="s774">I said do I know you?</span> <span id="s775">Aren't you from Lublin.</span> <span id="s776">He looks at me.</span> <span id="s777">He said, who are you?</span> <span id="s778">I said my name, it is Horn from Lublin.</span> <span id="s779">He said, yes.</span> <span id="s780">Don't show any emotion.</span> <span id="s781">I know you, yes, I am so and so.</span> <span id="s782">His name was Lowloc Rice (ph).</span> <span id="s783">I said, I know, I thought that was you.</span> <span id="s784">He said, pretend we don't know each other, and let's not talk to long.</span> <span id="s785">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s786">I said I wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s787">What can I do to get out?</span> <span id="s788">So he said, why don't you come tomorrow again same time and we talk in details.</span> <span id="s789">I can't talk to you now right now.</span> <span id="s790">I couldn't wait.</span> <span id="s791">I came back to the ghetto with my sack of coal.</span> <span id="s792">Next day early in the morning went back to work in the detail group and sure enough he was there.</span> <span id="s793">And he said, I can get you out of the ghetto but it cost a lot of money.</span> <span id="s794">I said, I don't have no money but, you know what before I left the ghetto in Lublin, my father show me a spot in his shop that he buried a case.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">05:15:22 It's a steel case with jewelry, gold, watches, bracelets, my family's jewelry, and one of our friends who was a jeweler.</span> <span id="s796">Whoever survivor the war, if ever then you can live the rest of your life on it.</span> <span id="s797">I remember that spot.</span> <span id="s798">That's the only thing I know.</span> <span id="s799">I hope it's still there, but I cannot give guarantees.</span> <span id="s800">But I know this spot.</span> <span id="s801">If you were willing to talk to your people and they are willing to take a chance, whatever we will find, half is theirs.</span> <span id="s802">I need only a little bit to survive.</span> <span id="s803">You can take more than half.</span> <span id="s804">I will leave it up to you, how much you want.</span> <span id="s805">How much you leave to us.</span> <span id="s806">He said, let me talk to my people.</span> <span id="s807">I said, who are your people?</span> <span id="s808">Well, I can tell you that that's Polish Underground, Armia Krajowa, or Home Army.</span> <span id="s809">They need money to buy ammunition, arms, etcetera.</span> <span id="s810">I don't know if they will go for this kind of deal because it is complicated, but if they will, I'll let you know.</span> <span id="s811">I will be here in a day or two.</span> <span id="s812">But I don't know what day, but I'll find you.</span> <span id="s813">So I was coming to work every day with the hope, my dreams kind of encouraged, maybe he'll find him.</span> <span id="s814">Maybe is something work out.</span> <span id="s815">Otherwise, I see the doom.</span> <span id="s816">Sure enough, one day he's there, again same spot in the uniform.</span> <span id="s817">He said, I talk to my people.</span> <span id="s818">They went for it, and on such and such a day you lead off.</span> <span id="s819">Your leader of your group is part of us.</span> <span id="s820">He part of us, our group too.</span> <span id="s821">He knows all about it.</span> <span id="s822">So you will be snatched too.</span> <span id="s823">Make sure your wife goes to work too and her little brother too.</span> <span id="s824">Children were going to work too.</span> <span id="s825">No one question anything.</span> <span id="s826">And sure enough, at that given early in the morning by carrying a sack of coal to the side, we're snatched by a group of people from the Polish Underground waiting with a car, and then a streetcar.</span> <span id="s827">We change streetcars to different streetcar and people were changing to our guards.</span> <span id="s828">Our guards were changing.</span> <span id="s829">They all armed in case they caught us there would be a fight.</span> <span id="s830">And we arrived to a house, to an apartment house which one of the -- not headquarters but one the apartments were the Polish Home Army was meeting was meeting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">05:18:00 I was surprised.</span> <span id="s832">We found maybe 10 or 12 Jewish people there, hiding.</span> <span id="s833">I found out that he is helping lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s834">I looked at it and I met this man.</span> <span id="s835">I asked him why do you do that.</span> <span id="s836">The first man I seen so definitely show the effort and the risk to help the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s837">Why?</span> <span id="s838">You like the Jews?</span> <span id="s839">He said, no I don't.</span> <span id="s840">So why do you do that?</span> <span id="s841">Well, I show you.</span> <span id="s842">He took me another room.</span> <span id="s843">Now listen to it.</span> <span id="s844">And I listened.</span> <span id="s845">There were noises over the wall, people talking Yiddish, arguing and fighting with each other.</span> <span id="s846">He said, what kind of people are you?</span> <span id="s847">I'm risking my life and here they start I fighting about, they fighting about stupid things and the neighbors they hear those things.</span> <span id="s848">They denounce it and we're all dead.</span> <span id="s849">I never see people in danger who do this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s850">I don't respect your people.</span> <span id="s851">I have no answer to it.</span> <span id="s852">What can I say.</span> <span id="s853">They're old orthodox people.</span> <span id="s854">For some reason they felt they should continue their orthodoxy, their sacred needs.</span> <span id="s855">They want kosher food.</span> <span id="s856">You know, where you going to get kosher food there?</span> <span id="s857">One of the men died, older man died, but he was very religious.</span> <span id="s858">What the Home Army did, they put him in a an orthodox kind of a canvas sack.</span> <span id="s859">That's how the Jews are buried you know.</span> <span id="s860">Not in the coffins, and they threw him over the wall in the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s861">They didn't bury him there and but left him there in the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s862">And I think this was more than anybody could expect.</span> <span id="s863">But this was just one the examples what those people did for us.</span> <span id="s864">And, they described the whole plan what we're going to do.</span> <span id="s865">First thing, I got the papers as a railroad man and they give me a uniform with a cap, a jacket, slacks, you know, the typical railroad uniform, with documents employed by railroads in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s866">And he said, you going to go with a group of few people.</span> <span id="s867">One is a Volkes Deutch and I don't follow, Volkes Deutch is a German who lived in Poland for generations, but he still did not lose his German identity.</span> <span id="s868">He could be Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s869">And this was, one was by your German.</span> <span id="s870">He was just an excuse to get all the country German Army.</span> <span id="s871">He knew where they are and he had a special privileges as a German citizen really, and he pretend to be always humiliated by the Poles and so on.</span> <span id="s872">So it's special right and privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">05:21:02 He was our protector on the trip on the rail to Lublin with guarded by two Polish Underground people, armed all the time.</span> <span id="s874">We arrived at the scene and sure enough, the location used to be a shack was a street now.</span> <span id="s875">The shack was raised.</span> <span id="s876">To explain a little bit yet more about the situation, Lublin was at site where the Jewish POWs from the Polish, from the former Polish Army where stationed there, and they were doing the dirty work for the Germans.</span> <span id="s877">They were digging in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s878">They are leveling the ghetto.</span> <span id="s879">They were removing the door-frames, the window-frames, the door, the hinges, where the Jews were hiding gold and coins, and jewelry, diamonds, everything they could.</span> <span id="s880">And they were taking everything apart piece by piece, and they leveled that hut, the little shack.</span> <span id="s881">There was nothing ... but I seen the spot.</span> <span id="s882">I knew the spot right way.</span> <span id="s883">And I said, I'm going to stand up on that spot.</span> <span id="s884">That's where it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">But he said, that's a street now.</span> <span id="s886">He said, well, okay.</span> <span id="s887">We'll come back tomorrow and we left.</span> <span id="s888">He took me to one of the people home.</span> <span id="s889">I stay overnight.</span> <span id="s890">They fed me.</span> <span id="s891">They treated me nicely, and next day they took me back to same location.</span> <span id="s892">What do I see?</span> <span id="s893">The whole street is blocked off, detour.</span> <span id="s894">The signs of detour.</span> <span id="s895">Broad daylight.</span> <span id="s896">A tent is erected middle of the street and the a sign, and A big roll of cable standing next to the tent, the German Post Office and telegraph.</span> <span id="s897">And people, helmets and overcoats are digging in the middle of the street right where this thing is, the understand was when they find the case that I described.</span> <span id="s898">They lit a torch and this was a sign that they found it.</span> <span id="s899">Now, I was hiding across the street and behind a door there was a little window there.</span> <span id="s900">There were people passing.</span> <span id="s901">It was a big apartment house and I was standing there, and looking through a little window there and watching if they lit the torch.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">When this was torch be lit, this was a sign for me to get out and mean they got the case and they won't need me no more.</span> <span id="s903">They will take me away and we'll go back home and, I am of course, I'm standing there, very nervous, very upset.</span> <span id="s904">Don't forget, this my hometown.</span> <span id="s905">I could run into somebody I knew, somebody knew me, and this would be the end of it.</span> <span id="s906">But I was guarded people with arms, you know, so I knew it wouldn't be easy for anybody, so they told me not to worry about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">05:24:09 If this happen that Poles recognize me they will fix him right away.</span> <span id="s908">Germans don't enter this area anyway.</span> <span id="s909">They were not concerned at all, but I was nervous and maybe took about two, two and a half hours, I see them stopping working and one of them reaching down and then straightening out and taking a torch and lighting a torch.</span> <span id="s910">And I was sweating and I thought that was a sign.</span> <span id="s911">I was coming out right into the middle of the street and here is the case opened up, completely empty, open up empty.</span> <span id="s912">I don't know what to say, but at least I knew this was true.</span> <span id="s913">They knew that I didn't lie to them.</span> <span id="s914">But where's the gold?</span> <span id="s915">Where's all the goodies?</span> <span id="s916">We found out later on that the Jewish POWs were digging everywhere and they opened this thing and left the empty case there and closed it up.</span> <span id="s917">They didn't report to the Germans cause the same day, understand, people are selling watches in the camps of the POWs.</span> <span id="s918">Watches and gold they were selling everywhere.</span> <span id="s919">Well, this was the end of our trip and I knew we were going back to the ghetto because they did not receive what they are supposed to get.</span> <span id="s920">On the way back home on the train we talked about it.</span> <span id="s921">We had one compartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">There was no other people there and I said, well, obviously we cannot afford to be out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s923">We cannot pay you people.</span> <span id="s924">I want you to understanding that I didn't lie to you about it.</span> <span id="s925">Yes, we know that.</span> <span id="s926">You going to send me back to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s927">He said no.</span> <span id="s928">Why?</span> <span id="s929">What would you do in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s930">You would perish in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s931">Maybe you can help us here on this side.</span> <span id="s932">You can work for your upkeep.</span> <span id="s933">We'll discuss the detail and come home.</span> <span id="s934">So we turn back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s935">And you know the rest of the story.</span> <span id="s936">That important fact I omitted that we got married in Warsaw Ghetto and my wife, with the help of the Polish Underground got us a little apartment, one little room.</span> <span id="s937">I was hiding there.</span> <span id="s938">I did go to a hiding place in the washroom, boarding up the walls of the washroom and creating a hiding door.</span> <span id="s939">When you lifted the boards of the wall was a secret door that you open up, and behind the door was a little hiding place accommodating maybe eight or nine people.</span> <span id="s940">I built a little bed so we could lie there and so on.</span> <span id="s941">Now this part of the building was totally destroyed during the bombing of Warsaw, so there was a way we could have run away from this hiding place any case of a danger, if someone entered the front of the apartment, with a signal which was dissident in the beginning.</span> <span id="s942">In case any danger, Lucine would knock on the door twice, and we would know to run.</span> <span id="s943">We did have an emergency address where to go, another hiding place through the Home Army, hiding Jews in case of different location.</span> <span id="s944">In case of emergency we could find a spot there until situation would clear up.</span> <span id="s945">And sure enough one day the janitor became suspicious because Lucine was bringing too much food in her little basket and he thought two women living in that apartment, and she bringing food galore, and he notified the Polish police.</span> <span id="s946">One day when she came in from work -- and what kind of work she was doing.</span> <span id="s947">She was selling women’s nets on the market, flea market and so on.</span> <span id="s948">Nobody knew she was Jewish, of course.</span> <span id="s949">She had good looks as an Aryan person.</span> <span id="s950">She seen policeman at the door.</span> <span id="s951">She didn't want to go in so she went to a store in the same building, grocery store.</span> <span id="s952">First thing she did was took the key out of her purse.</span> <span id="s953">She drop the key in a sack of beans and while doing this the policeman entered the store and arrested her.</span> <span id="s954">They when through her purse and ask her where her key.</span> <span id="s955">Oh, I guess I lost it.</span> <span id="s956">They look on the street everywhere, they couldn't find it.</span> <span id="s957">Which is your apartment?</span> <span id="s958">What do you want?</span> <span id="s959">What do you want?</span> <span id="s960">We understand you are hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s961">You are accused by the janitor that you bring too much food for two people there.</span> <span id="s962">We want to see your apartment.</span> <span id="s963">This conversation was very loud going on while they entering the apartment on the third floor, and on stairway we could hear the steps of the boots and the noise and the argumentation.</span> <span id="s964">And then my wife said, there is nobody there unless my aunt is.</span> <span id="s965">She working too.</span> <span id="s966">She is not home yet but let me knock on the door.</span> <span id="s967">She knocked twice which was danger signal.</span> <span id="s968">And we also had some rabbits in the apartment, just in case some neighbors hear some footsteps, we can always say the rabbits walking around.</span> <span id="s969">And they could hear some noise in there.</span> <span id="s970">Is there somebody in there?</span> <span id="s971">Well, maybe the rabbits.</span> <span id="s972">So they broke down the door.</span> <span id="s973">They look over.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">They went to the washroom.</span> <span id="s975">They did not discover our hiding place at all, although we are not there no more.</span> <span id="s976">They seen the rabbits and said, what are you talking about.</span> <span id="s977">And they left, but they took per purse with her, took her documents with them and she stayed without any papers which was like a death sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">05:30:02 She discussed this thing with our friends from the Polish Home Army, and they suggested that one of them would go with her to get a copy of it.</span> <span id="s979">And she went to the office.</span> <span id="s980">Behind was a gentlemen armed just in case.</span> <span id="s981">Without any difficulty she got a copy of ID and she left, no problem.</span> <span id="s982">During one of the trips on the streetcar they stole her purse again.</span> <span id="s983">She lost the documents again.</span> <span id="s984">Same history repeat itself.</span> <span id="s985">She went back there and got ID, no problem.</span> <span id="s986">I had to occasionally had to run from place to place and I did need ID too, so the Home Army organized arranged for me to go with them to the main office there with my real birth certificate of a person that passed away, young man was two years younger than I really was.</span> <span id="s987">His name was Wojick (ph), Felix Wojick.</span> <span id="s988">So I assumed his identity.</span> <span id="s989">So this birth certificate, I entered the main office and I received a ID without any difficulty whatsoever, with two guards behind me.</span> <span id="s990">No one suspected anything and now I was equipped with real documents, and they could check it I was registered everywhere and I was not a Jew anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">But I had more Semitic looks than Lucine and with a man you know, it was not difficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and know who we are.</span> <span id="s992">Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the danger spot, but I tried to avoid situation like this.</span> <span id="s993">So Lucine was working for the Polish Underground actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s994">They were taught how to make woman's hair nets.</span> <span id="s995">It was a fashionable thing at that time to do.</span> <span id="s996">They were taking the car inner-tubes or truck inner-tubes and cutting into small strips, very narrow strips.</span> <span id="s997">Then they could buy white silk and then they are dying the silk different colors.</span> <span id="s998">Was it a gold, gray, brown or black or navy blue.</span> <span id="s999">So making any net color you desire with the orders they receive.</span> <span id="s1000">So I was taught by the group how to wrap this little string of rubber with a silk.</span> <span id="s1001">So I was making the elastic, actually.</span> <span id="s1002">The other group people were making the nets themself by hand of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">05:33:00 And somebody design a little cardboard paper how to wrap it around and look very professionally.</span> <span id="s1004">And Lucine, as having good Aryan looks with another lady, also Jewish person, good looks.</span> <span id="s1005">They were spreading all over the city, market places and flea markets etcetera, and our life was more or less stable from then on except I was like a prisoner in my own house which I readily assumed and took.</span> <span id="s1006">I was taught how to do those things and finally our benefactor said, why do you start doing these too and do it on the side and Lucine can sell for you too.</span> <span id="s1007">So be it.</span> <span id="s1008">We did.</span> <span id="s1009">We started to accumulated a little money.</span> <span id="s1010">We felt a little more comfortable.</span> <span id="s1011">We were not that poor no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Was Lucine's brother still living with you then or is this after.</span> <span id="s1013">What was it like hiding with him in that little cubicle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: It was very pathetic.</span> <span id="s1015">He was little boy.</span> <span id="s1016">He was like a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1017">It was hard for him to understand why he was hiding.</span> <span id="s1018">He knew he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1019">He knew he could not show his face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants down, they know who he is.</span> <span id="s1020">So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the time.</span> <span id="s1021">He was pale.</span> <span id="s1022">He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine.</span> <span id="s1023">He couldn't play.</span> <span id="s1024">I tried to be very near him, put arms around him.</span> <span id="s1025">He miss his parents.</span> <span id="s1026">He was at the age he understood.</span> <span id="s1027">He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course.</span> <span id="s1028">There were times that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on.</span> <span id="s1029">He was still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age.</span> <span id="s1030">The political situation just forced the people to grow up very fast.</span> <span id="s1031">So he was aware of what really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you know.</span> <span id="s1032">I couldn't replace his father.</span> <span id="s1033">I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried to do best I could.</span> <span id="s1034">I try to be the disciplinarian.</span> <span id="s1035">Sometimes he want to do certain things he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm.</span> <span id="s1036">And he tell, me you're not my father.</span> <span id="s1037">I said, I know.</span> <span id="s1038">I don't pretend to father.</span> <span id="s1039">But you cannot do it because all of us would be in danger, you including.</span> <span id="s1040">So it was a very tragic thing to see him going through all this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">05:36:00 I did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen, when we run away from the apartment that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to emergency hiding place.</span> <span id="s1042">That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who turned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s1043">She knew she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1044">She said, what you doing here?</span> <span id="s1045">She was afraid to tell anything, because we didn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now.</span> <span id="s1046">Is she pro Gestapo or is she going to tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all.</span> <span id="s1047">But she finally told her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you know.</span> <span id="s1048">But you know I remember your parents.</span> <span id="s1049">I can help you maybe.</span> <span id="s1050">So she, Lucine, told her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have apartment anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">We stay only a few days.</span> <span id="s1052">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1053">Next we have brothers with us and she said, you know, what this was is this Hotel Polski, Polish hotel, that the Germans with a lot of money taking people and they go to southern France.</span> <span id="s1054">The letters arrive from those people who went on transport to southern France, writing back to their relatives in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1055">Right at the sea, sunning ourself.</span> <span id="s1056">Life is different.</span> <span id="s1057">We waiting for visas to go to South America to North America, to the United States and I hope you can join us.</span> <span id="s1058">And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters, except that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick.</span> <span id="s1059">When we wanted to register they said, well, the next transport not going to a week later, but this time it was totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this kind of money.</span> <span id="s1060">So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1061">We want to go.</span> <span id="s1062">She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for nothing, but you have to come up with money.</span> <span id="s1063">So we said we have no money.</span> <span id="s1064">So she promised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through certain stages of hiding and before reaching that hotel because you went in there was only Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1065">You didn't know if Gestapo waiting outside or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of this hotel and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very nice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called paradise, southern France.</span> <span id="s1066">We did receive one postcard from a train in Germany someplace that everything fine from him.</span> <span id="s1067">It was his writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">05:39:03 But did he really write what he meant?</span> <span id="s1069">Was he forced to write it?</span> <span id="s1070">We don't know, but this was the last thing we ever heard.</span> <span id="s1071">The final thing what we heard actually after of the war, that the whole train went to Northern Germany near Hannover someplace to a concentration camp and they were all eliminated.</span> <span id="s1072">So, the whole thing was a stage, a plot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the safety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later get out.</span> <span id="s1073">So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on transport to Southern France.</span> <span id="s1074">Unfortunately, we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1075">We had no money, not that kind of money.</span> <span id="s1076">So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst because we didn't hear nothing for months to come.</span> <span id="s1077">We suspected he probably perished, but for sure we didn't know at that time.</span> <span id="s1078">Life was going on and Lucine was selling her hair nets.</span> <span id="s1079">I making the hair net and off and on we lost our hiding place due to some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance.</span> <span id="s1080">So we jumped from one place to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews, and they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their apartment was suspected of being not in order they run to us.</span> <span id="s1081">And one day one of her schooling girlfriends notify Lucine that her apartment is no good and her husband is going to go to Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter.</span> <span id="s1082">So we took him to our house, our apartment.</span> <span id="s1083">He slept to with us, one bed, all three of us.</span> <span id="s1084">And two days later he left us and went to Polish Underground.</span> <span id="s1085">I understand he perished there and his wife perished too.</span> <span id="s1086">So we one day we looking again for another apartment.</span> <span id="s1087">This was a constant situation every few months we looking for another apartment because people are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might suspect it and you can't take a chance.</span> <span id="s1088">They might call the police or so.</span> <span id="s1089">One day she met a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet, and she knew that the lady recognize her already.</span> <span id="s1090">And they hug and kiss and so and she was a widow.</span> <span id="s1091">They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from store to store.</span> <span id="s1092">She had one room apartment, little kitchenette, that's all.</span> <span id="s1093">Lucine told her we're without apartment.</span> <span id="s1094">She said, why you don't come to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">05:42:01 She said yea, but, you know who we are?</span> <span id="s1096">Oh, yes, I know who you are.</span> <span id="s1097">You know what we doing?</span> <span id="s1098">Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it.</span> <span id="s1099">We have little money.</span> <span id="s1100">What will this cost us?</span> <span id="s1101">Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100 Zlotys per month, and I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1102">I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys.</span> <span id="s1103">I'm not sure exactly the amount.</span> <span id="s1104">That's what she requested.</span> <span id="s1105">She was very happy to get that kind of money.</span> <span id="s1106">She was struggling economically.</span> <span id="s1107">So we moved in.</span> <span id="s1108">Move in, we didn't have nothing to move in with.</span> <span id="s1109">A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my little factory with me.</span> <span id="s1110">I was making those little hair nets, producing.</span> <span id="s1111">Lucine was selling it.</span> <span id="s1112">Now, we have to think about safety.</span> <span id="s1113">I don't flush the toilet because both ladies, Lucine and this house-lady, were working so I couldn't walk around.</span> <span id="s1114">I couldn't flush the toilet.</span> <span id="s1115">I waiting until they came back home not to create suspicious.</span> <span id="s1116">Floors were wooden.</span> <span id="s1117">You afraid to put your weight down because the floors were squeaking.</span> <span id="s1118">Be very, very, careful.</span> <span id="s1119">I used to walk on the board next to the wall where the floor was more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without creating a noise.</span> <span id="s1120">Then this was in the corner of the room, there was a ceramic heater.</span> <span id="s1121">I don't if you're familiar with European heating system.</span> <span id="s1122">It's made out of ceramic tiles, squares up to the ceiling almost, and connected to the chimney, and you were heating with coal there.</span> <span id="s1123">There was a little door, metal door you put your wood or coal this was.</span> <span id="s1124">Well, I decided to do to hollow out that stove.</span> <span id="s1125">I disassemble the whole stove.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Lucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag.</span> <span id="s1127">I use a fork and a knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles.</span> <span id="s1128">Don't forget this was old stove, and from the base on I rebuild the whole stove using clay and water.</span> <span id="s1129">And I remove the top, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a wooden planking and put the tile on top of the wooden planking so I would get cover.</span> <span id="s1130">But you have to heat it so what are you going to do.</span> <span id="s1131">So we bought a little iron stove with a pipe.</span> <span id="s1132">The pipe was going right in the middle of the stove into the chimney.</span> <span id="s1133">There was a little stool and a table next to the stove in case of emergency.</span> <span id="s1134">I could step on the stool on the table inside the stove.</span> <span id="s1135">I was sitting like on horseback on the pipe.</span> <span id="s1136">Only thing I forgot not being professional, what am I going to do if the pipe is going to be hot because the stove is being used for cooking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">05:45:22 Didn't think about it and I didn't think about the possible gases emanating from this contraption.</span> <span id="s1138">I was not a scientist.</span> <span id="s1139">I'm not a professional bricklayer or stove layer, whatever.</span> <span id="s1140">But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it.</span> <span id="s1141">All of a sudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the village near Warsaw, who one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the door, I had only maybe a minute time to get into the stove.</span> <span id="s1142">I got in the stove.</span> <span id="s1143">He came in.</span> <span id="s1144">They tried to get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't.</span> <span id="s1145">Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1146">I stay here overnight.</span> <span id="s1147">I go home tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1148">So I stayed in the stove all night.</span> <span id="s1149">When he left following morning, I was totally unconscious, overcome by fumes.</span> <span id="s1150">They couldn't call a doctor.</span> <span id="s1151">They couldn't pull me out because very awkward, was way up top to the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1152">They were two women, one old lady.</span> <span id="s1153">Lucine was young but alone she couldn't do.</span> <span id="s1154">I was a heavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I got out of that stove and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration, springing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">This was my first experience in hiding place like this.</span> <span id="s1156">The other experience, I had, another cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog.</span> <span id="s1157">I had no time to get to the stove.</span> <span id="s1158">There was a cabinet against the wall so I hid in cabinet behind coats and so on.</span> <span id="s1159">All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming toward the cabinet and barking and barking and barking.</span> <span id="s1160">Didn't want to leave, and this cousin of this house-lady said, what are you barking?</span> <span id="s1161">What do you see in that cabinet?</span> <span id="s1162">Oh, I probably have a little ham there.</span> <span id="s1163">I'm peddling ham, and so on.</span> <span id="s1164">He probably want this.</span> <span id="s1165">So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and he ate it and stopped barking.</span> <span id="s1166">And there were few episodes like this where I was hiding.</span> <span id="s1167">But each time I escape without any problems.</span> <span id="s1168">Until one day our benefactor from the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the Polish Underground is staging an uprising.</span> <span id="s1169">In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're located next to the former ghetto.</span> <span id="s1170">We see the ghetto burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">05:48:02 We see people dancing and is laughing outside the ghetto walls saying the Jewish bed bugs are frying.</span> <span id="s1172">Finally, we got rid of them and so on, you know.</span> <span id="s1173">I didn't hear it myself.</span> <span id="s1174">I just heard the noise.</span> <span id="s1175">I heard the explosions in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1176">This was the Jewish uprising and we didn't hear no cries.</span> <span id="s1177">Nothing, just explosions, shots, and then the fire and eventually of course, after almost what?</span> <span id="s1178">Less than a month, the whole ghetto uprising, went under and the Germans sealed up the area and there was no more ghetto.</span> <span id="s1179">Then our captain came and said you better start storing some food because there is going to be uprising Warsaw proper.</span> <span id="s1180">We don't be able to get anything at all.</span> <span id="s1181">If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the money will be worth nothing.</span> <span id="s1182">Prior to this, he came to us once and he took a loan from us.</span> <span id="s1183">He needed money to transport some Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1184">He had no money to save them.</span> <span id="s1185">So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep of those people.</span> <span id="s1186">We gave him the money.</span> <span id="s1187">He returned the money to us eventually.</span> <span id="s1188">So Lucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the jeweler stores.</span> <span id="s1189">You couldn't buy nothing else but wedding rings.</span> <span id="s1190">We ended up with several, maybe 10 or 11 rings which we could not get rid of afterwards.</span> <span id="s1191">After the war they are worth practically nothing.</span> <span id="s1192">The uprising started.</span> <span id="s1193">Our Polish captain said, I want you to be part of our group.</span> <span id="s1194">We won't ask you to fight directly for us, it's not your fight.</span> <span id="s1195">I said, your fight is my fight.</span> <span id="s1196">You saved my life.</span> <span id="s1197">Whatever you want me to do, I will do.</span> <span id="s1198">We need somebody to attack the German warehouses to steal the provisions, food for our soldiers and so on.</span> <span id="s1199">It's under fire.</span> <span id="s1200">And, I agreed to it immediately, and at night we're a group of five, six people from the Home Army ,Underground don't forget the basements were connected to each house next to each other.</span> <span id="s1201">They cut through the walls of each house so we did not have to be on the surface, which was deadly, but underground we moving the whole underground city.</span> <span id="s1202">We moving from one end of Warsaw to the other end underground.</span> <span id="s1203">And that's how we knew which was the exit where to go, where the warehouses were and when we grabbed the supplies, what we could of course, we didn't have no transportation.</span> <span id="s1204">All on our backs, you know, and pockets, pants, hands, you tied to your belt, whatever you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">05:51:01 We disappear in the underground.</span> <span id="s1206">The German looking for us and couldn't find us.</span> <span id="s1207">We disappear.</span> <span id="s1208">Then that's how we brought the supplies for the fighting boys you know.</span> <span id="s1209">Then the Germans seen that the uprising is continuing and decided to do more drastic type of move and they decided to bomb the city.</span> <span id="s1210">In the meantime, the political situation change all bad.</span> <span id="s1211">We already knew that the Soviet troops on the other side of Wisla River, which the eastern part of Warsaw.The name is Prague, like city of Prague in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1212">People were hiding there that were liberated.</span> <span id="s1213">We on the western part were not liberated yet.</span> <span id="s1214">Some Jews thought that in case they have to die now they try to swim through the Wisla River on the other side going east, and they caught by the German fire of course.</span> <span id="s1215">Some of them try to support themself with their hands under the bridge, holding on to different pipes and cables, only holding on with their hands cross the bridge underneath to reach the other side, and some of them succeeded.</span> <span id="s1216">Some of our friends did succeeded to do that.</span> <span id="s1217">It requires a tremendous physical strength to do that unless you accustomed to it.</span> <span id="s1218">And many people undernourished and weak and so on couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1219">Even swimming through the Wisla River in the part of Warsaw which was pretty wide and deep was suicidal, so we wouldn't dare.</span> <span id="s1220">So we took our fate the way it is.</span> <span id="s1221">So the German troops start to bombing the city and they done it systematically, street after street, so we knew which street bomb today, so we knew which street would be bombed tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1222">So running from one type of a block to another block, but the bombing caught up with us finally.</span> <span id="s1223">We are at our home, our home, our apartment that we stay with the Polish lady which I mentioned before selling ham and etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1224">The bomb hit one of our wings and the whole stairway collapsed.</span> <span id="s1225">Lucine was upstairs.</span> <span id="s1226">She went right onto the main floor under the rubble.</span> <span id="s1227">I couldn't get to the other side to save her so I took a plank, a wide plank, maybe a foot wide.</span> <span id="s1228">It was a corner wing and so I put one end of the plank on the window frame, the other plank was four story and the other window, and all my fours I crossed from one wing to the other one, not looking down.</span> <span id="s1229">Because if I look down I probably get dizzy and go down, and I was able to reach her area and recover her by pulling her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">05:54:07 I see her legs sticking out and by pulling her, debris and bricks and cement and piece of wood and so on.</span> <span id="s1231">She sustained fairly intensive injury and her whole right side of the face, ear, neck, chest, breast, right side of abdomen, was scraped from falling debris and so on.</span> <span id="s1232">Bleeding so on, I was wounded in the mean time.</span> <span id="s1233">I don't know what from.</span> <span id="s1234">It was a piece of shrapnel I thought.</span> <span id="s1235">My abdomen, I was bleeding a little bit but I felt good otherwise.</span> <span id="s1236">I put her on my back and carried her on my back to the first aid station.</span> <span id="s1237">There were signs in the city where the first aid station don't forget it was our 4Wisla River: Vistula River.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">area, the Polish Home Army not the German area yet, and I found my way to what they say is the lazarett.The lazarett and the first aid with the red cross on it.</span> <span id="s1239">I bring her on my back.</span> <span id="s1240">I crawl in practically through the door and whom do I find is a doctor.</span> <span id="s1241">I almost fainted.</span> <span id="s1242">Then with together with Lucine on my back, my classmate who was my partner in crime and was supposed to be executed by firing squad, he was hiding in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1243">He finished his medical school underground.</span> <span id="s1244">He just whispered to me, we don't know each other, and that was all, I was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Lucine was the only one who get tetanus shot.</span> <span id="s1246">There was not tetanus for nobody.</span> <span id="s1247">She was the only one who received it.</span> <span id="s1248">They tended her wounds and so on.</span> <span id="s1249">Squeeze my hands and couldn't hug and kiss each other and just wish each other best of luck and we left.</span> <span id="s1250">And after several weeks, few weeks, I think about a month, the uprising went down under.</span> <span id="s1251">German triumphed and they announced loudspeakers, all the inhabitants of Warsaw now going to be evacuated to a camp near Warsaw by foot.</span> <span id="s1252">We walked several kilometers by foot to a little town name Pruszków.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">05:56:14 I was wearing my uniform, had my bandages on.</span> <span id="s1254">Lucine had bandages on and at that time nobody suspected any Jews left, and we approaching the camp we see a doctor there and several nurses.</span> <span id="s1255">Lucine thought they were nuns.</span> <span id="s1256">They were not nuns.</span> <span id="s1257">They were nurse and I told them I am a medical student and one of the doctor said "go to the right, go to the right."</span> <span id="s1258">This was the building -- I forgot the number of the building.</span> <span id="s1259">We didn't know where to go to right or not.</span> <span id="s1260">The first intuition was maybe we shouldn't, but why would he steer us wrong.</span> <span id="s1261">He is not working for the Poles, not for Germany.</span> <span id="s1262">As we found a lot of older people meantime getting out of one barrack to another one, and we see an older lady, old lady on a stretcher lying there, moaning, and no one was there.</span> <span id="s1263">So I grab another guy.</span> <span id="s1264">Why don't you help me get this lady to the barracks, and we carry the lady that behind us and they thought that we're part of the troop over there caring for the sick and disabled, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1265">We came to there barrack and we see a lot of elderly people, sick people and so on.</span> <span id="s1266">And at this time I wonder if we made the right decision cause we know from the ghetto days yet, sick and disabled people are garbage.</span> <span id="s1267">They going to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s1268">Why didn't they put us with the younger people?</span> <span id="s1269">We young people, young really.</span> <span id="s1270">Younger people just go to Germany to work, but this was no way out.</span> <span id="s1271">There a guard at the door.</span> <span id="s1272">If you want to get out, even go to the washroom or something, there some containers and the women and men together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">End of Tape #2 5lazarett: (German).</span> <span id="s1274">Hospital or clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: So we looking around the barracks and seeing all the older people we don't know what we're doing there actually.</span> <span id="s1277">And a thought went through our minds, and maybe this a group of peoples going to go for final resolutions of their problems.</span> <span id="s1278">Probably Auschwitz or so, and then after two or three nights staying on straw mats on the floor, you lying down one night, you woke up the next night about three feet away because the straw mats were moving.</span> <span id="s1279">That's how people were talking about, lice, horrible situation there, and they one morning they decided to let us out the of the barracks and direct us toward the railroad track where open cars, cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1280">While to me this was nothing new.</span> <span id="s1281">I read it very well and I knew what's happening now.</span> <span id="s1282">First thought was, we probably going to go to Auschwitz or one of those places.</span> <span id="s1283">But the young people think maybe this get to Germany for work.</span> <span id="s1284">But the old people, sick people, people on stretchers and so on that's what they do with us.</span> <span id="s1285">They seal the cars, but through the upper little windows they actually wired type of upper portion.</span> <span id="s1286">The car were wired.</span> <span id="s1287">You could see through and standing on somebody's shoulders you could see outside.</span> <span id="s1288">I seen there were only two guards, soldiers or what ever, Gestapo I'm not sure who they were.</span> <span id="s1289">One near the locomotive, the beginning of the train and one at the end.</span> <span id="s1290">This was not really clear to me what the purpose of this transport.</span> <span id="s1291">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s1292">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s1293">Everybody was asking the same question.</span> <span id="s1294">People were squashed like cattle, you know.</span> <span id="s1295">About maybe close to 100 people in the car.</span> <span id="s1296">Woman, man, there were no toilet facilities of course, and people just relieving themselves the way they were, standing and so on.</span> <span id="s1297">And everybody, you know, without any concentration.</span> <span id="s1298">The fear, you know, not knowing where we going.</span> <span id="s1299">I was conditioned to it a little bit, and the other Poles weren't.</span> <span id="s1300">The rest the Poles weren't, so that's the first experience they had.</span> <span id="s1301">So I was kind of over hand but the final destination was still the same.</span> <span id="s1302">So what am I going to win here?</span> <span id="s1303">We going to go together as a Pole maybe, but still.</span> <span id="s1304">All of a sudden one night one very important railroad stations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">06:03:00 The place was bombed by allies.</span> <span id="s1306">They destroyed the railroad lengths you know, and the train couldn't go any further.</span> <span id="s1307">This detained us for about two or three days until they repaired the tracks.</span> <span id="s1308">And to say there were no food given, no water given, there were no people outside.</span> <span id="s1309">There was nothing and then the car start rolling again and after unknown number of days, we are arrived in a little town.</span> <span id="s1310">The name was Jedrzejow a town with maybe 8, 10,000 people and all of a sudden the train stopped.</span> <span id="s1311">The car doors open up.</span> <span id="s1312">Polish Red Cross appeared.</span> <span id="s1313">Woman with band, red cross on it and they directing this car, this car going left, this car going straight, the other car going to the right and we found ourselves in front of many horse carriages, you know, driven by the local peasants.</span> <span id="s1314">And in front of the carriages there were tables and Polish woman was sitting there registering everybody.</span> <span id="s1315">They want your IDs.</span> <span id="s1316">So you give IDs.</span> <span id="s1317">I was in railroad uniform at this time.</span> <span id="s1318">My wife was with me and registered, and she assigned us to a certain village, to a peasant that was forced to take us as guests and to feed us and be responsible for us.</span> <span id="s1319">And they let us go free.</span> <span id="s1320">We didn't go in any jail.</span> <span id="s1321">We didn't go to any concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1322">No one ever informed us what going to happen, nothing until this moment.</span> <span id="s1323">We're driven, by, it turn out later, by the mayor of this little village to a different farmer.</span> <span id="s1324">He brought us there, knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s1325">Here they are and he left.</span> <span id="s1326">Of course, we speak very fluent and clean, very intelligent Polish.</span> <span id="s1327">Peasant Polish is a little different Polish and they hate the city people you know, and he told me right away in slang, "I am not taking freeloaders to my house.</span> <span id="s1328">I cannot afford you people."</span> <span id="s1329">I said "I was wounded.</span> <span id="s1330">Lucine was wounded too, my wife, you know."</span> <span id="s1331">She was bandaged up.</span> <span id="s1332">I said, but "look, as soon as we feel better we going to help you.</span> <span id="s1333">We help you on the farm."</span> <span id="s1334">He said, "I'm not going to take no body."</span> <span id="s1335">And, he shut the door.</span> <span id="s1336">We standing there maybe, most of the day outside.</span> <span id="s1337">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1338">Mind you this was already either end of October or so, beginning of November, it was cold, raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">06:06:02 We hugged each other, standing, didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1340">He refused to take us in and we stayed like this way all night under the little roof, thinking what next.</span> <span id="s1341">Early in the morning, the mayor of the village appeared there.</span> <span id="s1342">Allegedly, he knew that we were not taken in by this farmer.</span> <span id="s1343">He asked us to go with him.</span> <span id="s1344">We didn't have no luggage with us, of course.</span> <span id="s1345">So we walked with him.</span> <span id="s1346">He took us to the only building made out of brick.</span> <span id="s1347">The rest were huts and he say, you stay in this house now, and the people walked out, the farmer, middle age people.</span> <span id="s1348">Maybe she was 40, 42, he was maybe 45, with two little kids and very friendly invited us in.</span> <span id="s1349">Knowing that we were wounded so they give us their own bedroom and bed so we can sleep and rest.</span> <span id="s1350">She said she making chicken for me, chicken broth and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1351">Very, very friendly and accepting us, and feeling sorry for us probably.</span> <span id="s1352">Well, at this moment I didn't care.</span> <span id="s1353">I just wanted to lie down and rest.</span> <span id="s1354">I didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s1355">I was sick.</span> <span id="s1356">I was weak.</span> <span id="s1357">I was bleeding a little bit.</span> <span id="s1358">All the turmoil and what was happening next and so on.</span> <span id="s1359">I didn't look beyond that moment.</span> <span id="s1360">The same night I woke up with a light flashing in my face.</span> <span id="s1361">Who are you?</span> <span id="s1362">I thought maybe Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1363">Right away you know you always live with that fear it's always in your end.</span> <span id="s1364">And here was a man said, I am from the underground from Home Army in this area, we heard that you people were from Warsaw, uprising from Warsaw, and we just want to tell you we very apologetic we couldn't come to your help.</span> <span id="s1365">You know, those days you couldn't take a train or trucks or cars to Warsaw to help the other groups of the Home Army you know but he said they couldn't do nothing for us and so on but they make sure not a hair on our head here in this village.</span> <span id="s1366">As a matter of fact, they hear about the other farm and they took care of him already.</span> <span id="s1367">They went that night before they came to us.</span> <span id="s1368">They woke up the whole family, the farmer refuse our entry asked him to strip completely from the waist down.</span> <span id="s1369">Bent over a trunk of a tree and so on they beat him up with some ... branches of trees and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">06:09:02 They were bleeding.</span> <span id="s1371">They beat up the whole family.</span> <span id="s1372">The farmer, his wife, his grown-up sons and so on.</span> <span id="s1373">The farmer beg us to return to his home, but we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1374">We didn't have nothing to do with them beating them up.</span> <span id="s1375">But they aware that we're from Warsaw uprising.</span> <span id="s1376">They thought that we really some important people from the Home Army, which we're not.</span> <span id="s1377">I was a small fish there, you know.</span> <span id="s1378">But, anyway I was proud to be one of them and he said they make sure that if we need a doctor they provide medical me care and so on and nothing would happen to us.</span> <span id="s1379">And believe me our care was the best care any hospital could give us and after I got a little better, I got worse again and I got sick with high fever and yellow jaundice.</span> <span id="s1380">My nights were horrible.</span> <span id="s1381">I didn't know what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s1382">Lucine said I was talking nonsense through my sleep and so on.</span> <span id="s1383">They were scared I might die, temperature 103, 104, yellow jaundice, you know.</span> <span id="s1384">Finally, the farmer said I take you to the doctor, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1385">Can't let you dies like this.</span> <span id="s1386">So he took his two horses, you know, and his wagon, you know, and took me to nearest town.</span> <span id="s1387">There was Polish doctor there.</span> <span id="s1388">This town was about 15 or 20 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s1389">In the meantime, Lucine was very, she recovered faster than I did.</span> <span id="s1390">and she was very helpful in the farmhouse.</span> <span id="s1391">She was helping with chickens and cooking and peeling potatoes and bringing in water and whatever was necessary and feeding the pigs, you know.</span> <span id="s1392">And they liked it very much because they, we didn't have to be paid for it.</span> <span id="s1393">You know, they just supported us.</span> <span id="s1394">And they were very grateful for this.</span> <span id="s1395">It showed the way they treated us.</span> <span id="s1396">And I was just a victim of this.</span> <span id="s1397">I was in no shape to do any of it.</span> <span id="s1398">And I went to this doctor, was on the second floor.</span> <span id="s1399">I remember like today they had to practically carry me upstairs.</span> <span id="s1400">I couldn't walk straight.</span> <span id="s1401">There was a little waiting room.</span> <span id="s1402">There was no one in the waiting room, but I had to wait.</span> <span id="s1403">To my left was a little table.</span> <span id="s1404">On the little table was a little box, looked like from medical instrument something.</span> <span id="s1405">I glance at the box.</span> <span id="s1406">There was a label on it.</span> <span id="s1407">Dr. Grayefski (ph) Praga, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1408">Just I notice this that's all.</span> <span id="s1409">I was still in my uniform.</span> <span id="s1410">That's the only clothes I had.</span> <span id="s1411">Finally the door opens up.</span> <span id="s1412">The nurse calls me in, said Mr. Wojick?</span> <span id="s1413">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s1414">And she asked me my history, what happened to me and so on.</span> <span id="s1415">So I told her the whole story about Warsaw uprising, my wounds.</span> <span id="s1416">my wife being hurt and so on, I thought maybe a results of this result of my wounds, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">06:12: So they wrote everything down.</span> <span id="s1418">The doctor comes in and he said what's your name?</span> <span id="s1419">And I said Wojick.</span> <span id="s1420">He looks at my uniform.</span> <span id="s1421">Where you from?</span> <span id="s1422">I said, Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1423">Are you a railroad man?</span> <span id="s1424">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s1425">Which division, department?</span> <span id="s1426">I said, we're Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">You must know me.</span> <span id="s1428">I was your doctor of the railroad.</span> <span id="s1429">So I look at him, look at him, look at him.</span> <span id="s1430">I said, "you're not by any chance Dr. Grayefski?"</span> <span id="s1431">He said, of course I am.</span> <span id="s1432">You know me.</span> <span id="s1433">This name I memorize from this little box on the table.</span> <span id="s1434">And from then on was such a bond, such a contact, you know.</span> <span id="s1435">I didn't worry about any suspicions or so.</span> <span id="s1436">He gave me a shot.</span> <span id="s1437">I turned back, he gave me a shot.</span> <span id="s1438">He didn't know who was, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1439">Gave me some vitamins, some medications and so on.</span> <span id="s1440">I went back home and from then on I started my miraculous recovery.</span> <span id="s1441">The people were nice to me.</span> <span id="s1442">There were some other Warsaw refugees there, Polish refugees.</span> <span id="s1443">One was a shoemaker and I felt very uneasy about him.</span> <span id="s1444">For some reason he look at me all the time and I was worrying if he maybe recognize me from somewhere or suspect who I am.</span> <span id="s1445">And during Easter holidays he invited us, me and Lucine to his house.</span> <span id="s1446">He was all alone.</span> <span id="s1447">I think he was single, but he was middle age person.</span> <span id="s1448">And we would talked.</span> <span id="s1449">He ask me questions, where I from and so on.</span> <span id="s1450">Very inquisitive you know, which school I went to.</span> <span id="s1451">So I told him, Lublin.</span> <span id="s1452">I told him the story.</span> <span id="s1453">I told him all these things which was true.</span> <span id="s1454">My Polish misled everybody because my Polish was the best, if I brag about it, one thing, I brag my language.</span> <span id="s1455">I speak several languages my Polish is exquisite.</span> <span id="s1456">Is perfect, really perfect, literately Polish.</span> <span id="s1457">They couldn't understand it because Jews don't speak that kind of Polish.</span> <span id="s1458">None of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1459">So, but he never said nothing.</span> <span id="s1460">He was very cordial.</span> <span id="s1461">Treated us, Polish sausage and this and then apologize he not a good cook, but he done what he could.</span> <span id="s1462">By being fellow from Warsaw and so on we have something in common, he thought he invite us be the holidays with him.</span> <span id="s1463">He didn't want to be alone.</span> <span id="s1464">And slowly I was recovering.</span> <span id="s1465">Then I got the idea how could I repay those peasants, for they're their ... being so good to us.</span> <span id="s1466">And I thought since the schools were illegal and schools closed I would organize a secret Polish school.</span> <span id="s1467">And I suspected that mayor of the village was somebody that maybe I don't know exactly who he was.</span> <span id="s1468">He was more than just the mayor.</span> <span id="s1469">And one day I approached him.</span> <span id="s1470">I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1471">I feel strong enough.</span> <span id="s1472">I like to teach the children Polish language to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">06:15:05 Little math, geography, whatever I can, and the political situation.</span> <span id="s1474">Let them be aware of what was going on now.</span> <span id="s1475">But I have no books.</span> <span id="s1476">How we going to get books?</span> <span id="s1477">The area we located was far away from our normal area where we used to live you know.</span> <span id="s1478">I didn't know anyone there.</span> <span id="s1479">o he said, "well, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1480">I'll give you a name.</span> <span id="s1481">You can go to next village."</span> <span id="s1482">As a matter of fact, on Sunday I go to the town.</span> <span id="s1483">Maybe I take you with me, in the wagon, and then I don't know want to go with you, to this place, to that person.</span> <span id="s1484">Just tell them I send you and you tell them what you need.</span> <span id="s1485">But I said I don't have money either -- "don't worry about that, just don't worry about that.</span> <span id="s1486">Just tell him what need."</span> <span id="s1487">I will straighten it out.</span> <span id="s1488">And I met this person.</span> <span id="s1489">He looked at me suspicious look, asked for my IDs, my documents.</span> <span id="s1490">Asked I was from Home Army.</span> <span id="s1491">I said, yes, I was wounded during the uprising.</span> <span id="s1492">So he had no reason to doubt me, which was true.</span> <span id="s1493">I didn't say who I was.</span> <span id="s1494">He gave me about ten difference books.</span> <span id="s1495">Polish readings, simple arithmetics, art, crayons, all the pencils, all the little things, erasers.</span> <span id="s1496">Here I am, educational director.</span> <span id="s1497">I'm organizing a school.</span> <span id="s1498">I took the kids together in one house.</span> <span id="s1499">I told them what we going to do and I told them we have to be smart about it because if the German find out that we have a secret school, they are going to burn the village and we have to have a school.</span> <span id="s1500">So we taught the kids that each day, one of the kids, they were mostly boys if I remember, will stand guard outside on the top, on the roof of the house.</span> <span id="s1501">Our village was top of the hill so you can see the road down there in the next town.</span> <span id="s1502">If the Germans coming to the village, they had to come to this road.</span> <span id="s1503">So if you watch this road, you will find out who was coming to the village.</span> <span id="s1504">Then you can take proper precautions.</span> <span id="s1505">We told the kids if anything suspicious, right away they dispenses each one runs to his own house.</span> <span id="s1506">Each one runs, takes the book with him right away, there not be a trace left of any educational type material on the tables.</span> <span id="s1507">And we conduct school very nicely with no problem, with no difficulty.</span> <span id="s1508">Kids were very nice.</span> <span id="s1509">They obey.</span> <span id="s1510">And one day during the classes, all of a sudden a door opens up and two men with hats, long gray leather coats, boots, typical Gestapo detectives walk in.</span> <span id="s1511">And right away ask me, "Are you Mr. Wojick?"</span> <span id="s1512">Well, I don't have to tell you how I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">06:18:02 I knew this was it, someone denounces me.</span> <span id="s1514">You come with us.</span> <span id="s1515">I was ready to faint.</span> <span id="s1516">Try to regain my composure.</span> <span id="s1517">Tried to ask him what it's all about.</span> <span id="s1518">They said "you go with us."</span> <span id="s1519">I walked out into the hallway, and they stopped.</span> <span id="s1520">They start shaking my hand.</span> <span id="s1521">We came in on orders of the Polish Government Exile who found out that someone is organizing a secret Polish education for the children, and we just want to thank you and congratulate you.</span> <span id="s1522">We want to assure you that the end of the problem is soon.</span> <span id="s1523">The war is almost at the end.</span> <span id="s1524">The Germans are losing the war.</span> <span id="s1525">There was no news.</span> <span id="s1526">We don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s1527">The Russian Army is advancing and they should be here within weeks probably, and with this they left.</span> <span id="s1528">Until today I don't know what happened to that boy on the roof of the house, that he didn't detect the two men walking in there.</span> <span id="s1529">Could be Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1530">Anyway, I was continuing teaching then all of a sudden we heard rumblings from the front nearby, the noise of the war.</span> <span id="s1531">The explosions and the artillery was getting louder, louder every day and of course, our hope was building up each minute.</span> <span id="s1532">But the awareness that we could lose our lives, the end, the last hour of life was still with me.</span> <span id="s1533">And I decided one day one of the sons of the neighbor came in.</span> <span id="s1534">Was a member of the Polish Underground but a different underground what they used to call the N.S.Z.which a Polish nationalist alliance group, together with Polish Hitlerites, they just found in the forest a bunker, a woman, two children, hidden.</span> <span id="s1535">So they killed them.</span> <span id="s1536">He came to our house to tell us about it.</span> <span id="s1537">Thought we would rejoice it, and we had, I had to hear that.</span> <span id="s1538">And he told us that he's leaving, go west with the Germans because the Russians are coming in.</span> <span id="s1539">If they catch him he will be sent to Siberia because his group was cooperating with the Germans, of course.</span> <span id="s1540">And he left.</span> <span id="s1541">I talked to the peasants, my friends now.</span> <span id="s1542">I said, "You know, I would like to meet the Russians.</span> <span id="s1543">Said, please, please don't, and Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Wojick don't do that.</span> <span id="s1545">They won't come here anyway.</span> <span id="s1546">Don't do that it's dangerous.</span> <span id="s1547">You don't want to go in the field of action, but I had to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">06:21:01 So I was crawling out the village on all my fours.</span> <span id="s1549">There was a little forest next the 6N.</span> <span id="s1550">S.Z.: Narodowe Sily Zbrojne.</span> <span id="s1551">Soviet backed Polish partisans village and I could see the tanks for maybe, like a hundred feet away, only the Russian tanks.</span> <span id="s1552">I recognize the star on the tank and I recognize their faces because their head was up out the tank, you know, looking with field glasses where they are or something, and I start getting up, to try to greet them and they start shooting at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">The tank, thank Gods, the they didn't hit me, didn't get near me.</span> <span id="s1554">You know, I crawled right back, right back to the village scared stiff.</span> <span id="s1555">Before I knew it the Russian entered the village.</span> <span id="s1556">They asked for the mayor and asked how many people there was in the village and so on.</span> <span id="s1557">And I was stopped.</span> <span id="s1558">They asked me who I was.</span> <span id="s1559">I speak fluent Russian so I said, "I'm the teacher here."</span> <span id="s1560">Then the Russian tell him I'm also a Jew.</span> <span id="s1561">He said, "A Jew.</span> <span id="s1562">You're lying, there are no Jews here.</span> <span id="s1563">You must be a spy.</span> <span id="s1564">How come you speak Russian?</span> <span id="s1565">Only a spy speak Russian.</span> <span id="s1566">And the Jews, there are no Jews left.</span> <span id="s1567">They are all killed."</span> <span id="s1568">I said, "That's not true.</span> <span id="s1569">Myself and my wife, we escaped and we hiding under false names."</span> <span id="s1570">"False names, you must be a spy," and I said, "No, I'm telling you I am Jewish."</span> <span id="s1571">And he said, wait and minute, and he called another officer.</span> <span id="s1572">His name was Lev.</span> <span id="s1573">I remember like today.</span> <span id="s1574">It was a typical Jewish first name in Russian.</span> <span id="s1575">Lev, come over here.</span> <span id="s1576">Take a load of this.</span> <span id="s1577">This guy telling me he is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1578">Now, you Jewish.</span> <span id="s1579">You find out.</span> <span id="s1580">He comes to me and about 45-year-old man.</span> <span id="s1581">He said, I am from Leningrad.</span> <span id="s1582">I'm a plumber by profession.</span> <span id="s1583">I'm officer in the Russian Tank Division.</span> <span id="s1584">“Now, you tell me you're Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1585">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1586">So he start talking me Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1587">I do not understand Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1588">“You tell me you're Jewish and you don't understand Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s1589">“I don't.</span> <span id="s1590">Because my family always spoke Polish to me.</span> <span id="s1591">My parents spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1592">I understand Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1593">I can tell you what you say.</span> <span id="s1594">But I can not talk.</span> <span id="s1595">“There’s no way.</span> <span id="s1596">No Jew--If you Jewish, you speak Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s1597">I said, “Believe me.</span> <span id="s1598">I am a Jew but I do not speak Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s1599">“No, you cannot be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1600">He might be right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">You must be a spy.</span> <span id="s1602">How come you speak Russian?”</span> <span id="s1603">So, I told him my story.</span> <span id="s1604">I was in Lvov medical school, I learn Russian from some colleagues that spoke Russian and I told him and he said that's all baloney, I don’t believe one word you say, you must be a spy.</span> <span id="s1605">Then .</span> <span id="s1606">I remember a prayer in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1607">At that time rabbi that come to my home teach me a few things.</span> <span id="s1608">I forgot most of it but I remember one prayer.</span> <span id="s1609">I said, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1610">You know how to pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">06:24:00 He said, well, I forgot.</span> <span id="s1612">I said, but if I tell you a prayer will you remember that?</span> <span id="s1613">He said, yes.</span> <span id="s1614">So I start praying in Hebrew, just the beginning of the prayer.</span> <span id="s1615">I don't remember too much of it.</span> <span id="s1616">He look at me, look at me, he start crying.</span> <span id="s1617">... He was close to me.</span> <span id="s1618">He put his arms around me.</span> <span id="s1619">He embraced me, hugged me, kissed me.</span> <span id="s1620">Said, yeah, you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1621">This was all in Russian.</span> <span id="s1622">I didn't want the Poles to know that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1623">I asked him that please, I don't want to disappoint them.</span> <span id="s1624">They were so nice to us.</span> <span id="s1625">We going to leave the area very soon.</span> <span id="s1626">He told us where to go, how to get to our home, where my hometown was.</span> <span id="s1627">I don't have to tell you the good-bye was very sad.</span> <span id="s1628">... The village's, the mayor, they want me to stay.</span> <span id="s1629">They gave me a school.</span> <span id="s1630">They want me to stay and be their teacher there.</span> <span id="s1631">They give me a little plot of land next to the school.</span> <span id="s1632">They--you were good to us.</span> <span id="s1633">Our kids adore you.</span> <span id="s1634">Why don't you stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">You don't have to worry about nothing and the war is over.</span> <span id="s1636">Start from scratch.</span> <span id="s1637">I said, look, my hometown is Lublin.</span> <span id="s1638">I have to go and put the pieces together.</span> <span id="s1639">Maybe, maybe, somehow I can find anybody from the family.</span> <span id="s1640">I don't know where they are, you know.</span> <span id="s1641">Warsaw destroyed too and I lie a little bit and say I look for a family in Warsaw and so on, and they did understand.</span> <span id="s1642">And on the way out the mayor squeezed my hand and I do feel he knew who I was.</span> <span id="s1643">... And, one morning the peasants, they prepared a little bag for us, food, you know.</span> <span id="s1644">They made us handmade kind of boots you know, made out of felt and rabbit fur for Lucine, you know.</span> <span id="s1645">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1646">We had nothing, no coats, nothing and with their blessing we left.</span> <span id="s1647">And we walked by foot maybe 80 kilometers cold, winter, 20 below.</span> <span id="s1648">...We crossed to a little town, a little village.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">06:27:03 We seen a man standing in front of a little shack, red head, he looked typical Jewish.</span> <span id="s1650">There is a word in Hebrew, they say amcho, amcho means are you one of us?</span> <span id="s1651">Means are you our people.</span> <span id="s1652">And I ask him amcho?</span> <span id="s1653">He look at me he was afraid to say anything.</span> <span id="s1654">Even the Russian there already.</span> <span id="s1655">He was still scared.</span> <span id="s1656">Finally I said don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s1657">We are, but Lucine don't look at all.</span> <span id="s1658">And I said what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1659">I survive in the forests in the bunker and everybody is killed.</span> <span id="s1660">I said to him, I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1661">I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1662">I don't have anybody to talk to and the villagers were not friendly to me.</span> <span id="s1663">I said, why don't you go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1664">He said, I don't know what I'm going to do.</span> <span id="s1665">Anyway, he asked us if we need anything, bread or something?</span> <span id="s1666">We had some supplies and I said no, and thanked them and we parted, total stranger.</span> <span id="s1667">We found our way to our hometown and here already was a Jewish committee working, organizing.</span> <span id="s1668">The first thing we did was approach the Red Cross, try to find out if my wife's little brother survived or not.</span> <span id="s1669">We knew his name was Kowalski on his papers and there was a name Kowalski as surviving one the camps but turned out to be not him.</span> <span id="s1670">We later found out that he perished in one the transports at that time and one of the concentrations camps forgot the name near Hannover in Germany.</span> <span id="s1671">We registered in the Jewish Committee and tried to look for survived who was left.</span> <span id="s1672">We had a large family, over a hundred people.</span> <span id="s1673">Anybody ask for is not there.</span> <span id="s1674">One day I went to my home, used to live, our home.</span> <span id="s1675">Our whole family lived there.</span> <span id="s1676">I thought maybe some neighbors, maybe she seen somebody.</span> <span id="s1677">Anyone survive would come to the place where you were born where you live.</span> <span id="s1678">You have to start some place.</span> <span id="s1679">To my amazement they all crossed themselves to see I survived.</span> <span id="s1680">Most of them very grateful I did survive.</span> <span id="s1681">Because they were good to my family, my family good to them.</span> <span id="s1682">We owned the building.</span> <span id="s1683">My grandfather actually, not my parents, and he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1684">One of your uncle, he survived.</span> <span id="s1685">He was here.</span> <span id="s1686">He tried to sell the building.</span> <span id="s1687">I said, how can you sell the building.</span> <span id="s1688">First, it is not his.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">06:30:01 Number two, how can he think about selling something, you know, when you looking for members of family.</span> <span id="s1690">You thinking about the house.</span> <span id="s1691">Who cares?</span> <span id="s1692">He is in uniform.</span> <span id="s1693">I knew who it was.</span> <span id="s1694">It was a younger brother of my father who used to be a lieutenant in Polish Air Force.</span> <span id="s1695">And they told me where I could reach him.</span> <span id="s1696">In a small apartment there.</span> <span id="s1697">When he seen me he put his arms around me, but rather coldly I would say, like, he was not surprise I'm around.</span> <span id="s1698">More or less.</span> <span id="s1699">"Oh, that's your wife."</span> <span id="s1700">"Yes, that's my wife."</span> <span id="s1701">He introduce himself.</span> <span id="s1702">He was wearing a Polish officer uniform, looked much like a movie star, and I said, I don't know what do now.</span> <span id="s1703">Is anybody left?</span> <span id="s1704">He said, "yes, my younger brother with my other uncle and my father's youngest brother is alive.</span> <span id="s1705">He is in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1706">He was a musician.</span> <span id="s1707">He was right under Marshall Tito.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">He organized a military band for Marshall Tito in Yugoslavia when he lost his family his little son in Rovno."</span> <span id="s1709">If you remember, a little town east Poland when I escape from my home and I went to Lvov.</span> <span id="s1710">This was him.</span> <span id="s1711">He lost his wife, lost his little son.</span> <span id="s1712">And he escaped through the mountains, Carpathian Mountains to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1713">He survived there he might be on his way home now.</span> <span id="s1714">He's looking for his wife, maybe he finds her.</span> <span id="s1715">So he said, "that's the key to my apartment."</span> <span id="s1716">You can only stay there maybe two days because I need the apartment myself.</span> <span id="s1717">He was single.</span> <span id="s1718">He was dating already and so on.</span> <span id="s1719">He needed his apartment and I couldn't get to my house either because other people lived there.</span> <span id="s1720">My house but I couldn't kick people out of there.</span> <span id="s1721">So, in meantime, we met other friends of ours from high school yet.</span> <span id="s1722">Lucine's friend and so on.</span> <span id="s1723">So we managed to rent a little room someplace and so on, and each day going the Jewish Committee to see whom we going to find because this was a gathering place.</span> <span id="s1724">That if someone survive, had to go there first and look at the list of registrants.</span> <span id="s1725">Who is there.</span> <span id="s1726">Everyone coming home.</span> <span id="s1727">Unfortunately nobody else came from my family.</span> <span id="s1728">And one day my uncle asked me, what you plan to do?</span> <span id="s1729">I said, I promised my mom that if I survive ever I go back to school.</span> <span id="s1730">He said, if you don't want to be musician you want to be a doctor, do whatever you want to be but pursue your career.</span> <span id="s1731">And I felt I promises I should do it and that's what I want to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">06:33:01 So we went to a town.</span> <span id="s1733">The name is Breslow in Polish.</span> <span id="s1734">I register in medical school and the first words I was noticing I heard of students.</span> <span id="s1735">Students themselves saying " another Jewish student."</span> <span id="s1736">Another, Hitler didn't kill them all and this was in my mind in every place I turn around.</span> <span id="s1737">I was not used to it because in my high school days the kids knew I was Jewish but never told me you're, a Jew.</span> <span id="s1738">I knew who I was I. I didn't have to be reminded about it.</span> <span id="s1739">After the war things were worse.</span> <span id="s1740">Instead of telling me I'm so happy you survived.</span> <span id="s1741">Did anyone else survive?</span> <span id="s1742">Can we do anything for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Can we help you, books whatever?</span> <span id="s1744">They tell me another Jew survive.</span> <span id="s1745">It was like a burden on my mind and I was kind of crowded in this classroom, you know.</span> <span id="s1746">I didn't feel good there.</span> <span id="s1747">And I met contact with some other students, not medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Jewish students who were architecture, art and so on and we organize a student group in this town who performed music, dancing for the remaining Jewish refugees that came back from Russian.</span> <span id="s1749">Everyone was coming and going nobody stay in one place.</span> <span id="s1750">More people coming, some going away, gone to look for relatives and so on.</span> <span id="s1751">The borders were open.</span> <span id="s1752">You can go through in and out nobody ask you any questions.</span> <span id="s1753">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1754">Looking for my mother, looking for my father, looking for my brother, looking for anybody, and everybody understood this.</span> <span id="s1755">So there was a kind of a chaos on the border but it was not used up as a chaotic type of political purpose or so.</span> <span id="s1756">Everybody knew this was a purpose of family reunions, and we one day in this group everybody was saying remarks, you know, that we shouldn't stay here.</span> <span id="s1757">We shouldn't stay here.</span> <span id="s1758">So we thought maybe we should leave Poland and go someplace outside of Poland.</span> <span id="s1759">Czechoslovakia, Austria maybe, France, we didn't know yet.</span> <span id="s1760">So this was in the talkative stages and in the meantime, my uncle didn't show too much a ties to me.</span> <span id="s1761">And he was doing his things, busy dating and doing other things you know.</span> <span id="s1762">And in meantime, he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1763">He was the commanding officer of the Polish Pilot school.</span> <span id="s1764">Instructor and commanding officer there for stealing a blanket or something, selling on the black market.</span> <span id="s1765">That was what he was accused of.</span> <span id="s1766">Could be they wanted to get rid of him too because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1767">They knew he was Jewish see, and was he thrown out.</span> <span id="s1768">I never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">06:36:01 I know he went to jail, maybe two years in jail.</span> <span id="s1770">In the meantime, I was without any money and so on, so I decided to sell my house.</span> <span id="s1771">It was a beautiful building.</span> <span id="s1772">But I didn't have nothing to live on.</span> <span id="s1773">No suits, no dress for my wife, nothing.</span> <span id="s1774">So I approached somebody who was an attorney.</span> <span id="s1775">If you have any customer for the building and said, yes, and found a butcher, Polish butcher want to buy my building.</span> <span id="s1776">I said, why you pay the building?</span> <span id="s1777">Everything is nationalized by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1778">You cannot own it.</span> <span id="s1779">They said I know, but I made so much money during the Germans times, illegally slaughtering cattle and so on, I had all this cash lying around.</span> <span id="s1780">I won't benefit.</span> <span id="s1781">Maybe someday my kids will benefit from it.</span> <span id="s1782">They'll have the building at least.</span> <span id="s1783">I said, okay.</span> <span id="s1784">I sold it for $1,000.</span> <span id="s1785">The attorney took $400 so I was left with $400 American dollar which was a fortune.</span> <span id="s1786">I buy a new suit.</span> <span id="s1787">The only picture I have right now is in the museum is with Lucine when we both were dressed.</span> <span id="s1788">She bought a new hat.</span> <span id="s1789">I bought a suit and shoes and we are in the park, and our kids look at the picture, Dad, you don't look like you just survived the war.</span> <span id="s1790">You look like you came from a country club.</span> <span id="s1791">I was shaven, lean, smiling, pale maybe, but smiling.</span> <span id="s1792">I said, look, we're young.</span> <span id="s1793">We cannot bring back what we lost.</span> <span id="s1794">We can live with the past, we can live with our memories.</span> <span id="s1795">We can start from scratch and build our home again from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1796">So that's what we did.</span> <span id="s1797">I bought her a delayed wedding present.</span> <span id="s1798">I bought her a ring, small ring and a watch, gold watch with the money and one day the whole group, with the help of Bricha.</span> <span id="s1799">I don't know if you know who Bricha is.</span> <span id="s1800">Bricha is the Palestinian underground agency which is helping the Jews escape from Soviet Russia coming to Poland want to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1801">They were smuggling those people, those young people to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1802">With their assistance we crossed the border one cold night in November, 1946.</span> <span id="s1803">The only thing I took we me is my student papers, my books and so on in case I ever go back to school and to save my papers.</span> <span id="s1804">And on their advice they took us to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1805">We met a lot of Jewish students already, Americans, first time I seen Americans, life full of music and laughter.</span> <span id="s1806">I didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s1807">I didn't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s1808">I was afraid of this thing.</span> <span id="s1809">I thought it was sacrilegious; to laugh and to smile and go to night clubs, coffee houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">06:39:09 I couldn't cope with it.</span> <span id="s1811">I wasn't ready for it you know.</span> <span id="s1812">But we stayed together the whole group for about 2 year and one when his own way.</span> <span id="s1813">They graduated -- one architecture, one electrical engineer, few medical students.</span> <span id="s1814">One boy couldn't cope with the situation.</span> <span id="s1815">Went back to Poland, Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1816">Didn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1817">And, then each one went his own way.</span> <span id="s1818">With the help of the American Joint Committee we getting a stipend to pay for our tuition.</span> <span id="s1819">To my amazement when they accepted me to medical school they accept all the papers translated by the Jewish Committee in Vienna found out I need my high school diploma which I didn't have with me.</span> <span id="s1820">I didn't know what happened to it.</span> <span id="s1821">But my high school still stand.</span> <span id="s1822">I wrote to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1823">They sent me a copy of my high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1824">For whatever strange reason, I had 6 years of Latin and a degree of Latin was a dash, like I never had Latin.</span> <span id="s1825">The professor looks at it.</span> <span id="s1826">I'm sorry everything is in order but you have no Latin.</span> <span id="s1827">You have to take a pre-entrance exam in Latin.</span> <span id="s1828">I said you know if after all these years I don't know if I remember too many things and my German was very poor.</span> <span id="s1829">I just started learning German.</span> <span id="s1830">What language do you speak?</span> <span id="s1831">Polish, Russian.</span> <span id="s1832">Okay.</span> <span id="s1833">You speak Russian.</span> <span id="s1834">I speak Russian.</span> <span id="s1835">So he give me two days to come back and take an exam in Latin in the Russian language which I did and I passed it.</span> <span id="s1836">He said, I want to know if you ever took Latin.</span> <span id="s1837">It is not exam for grading.</span> <span id="s1838">I want to know if you were acquainted with Latin, if you remember something and so on, which I did many things.</span> <span id="s1839">And he was satisfied.</span> <span id="s1840">He gave me a passing grade and here I was back in medical school.</span> <span id="s1841">So, we struggled quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1842">It was very difficult financially, but the Zionist Organization in Vienna, helped us out.</span> <span id="s1843">They rent a school for the whole group of us.</span> <span id="s1844">And we lived in that school.</span> <span id="s1845">They fed us, warm, you know.</span> <span id="s1846">They gave us blankets, gave us suits, you know, from American Joint.</span> <span id="s1847">We felt like human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">We did regain our dignity, slowly, and one day somebody came to us and said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1849">I just came back from the British Zone in Germany and I was on a train to Germany.</span> <span id="s1850">Run into somebody who is a relative of yours.</span> <span id="s1851">So I said, what?</span> <span id="s1852">What's his name?</span> <span id="s1853">So, he mentioned first name Baruch, Baruch.</span> <span id="s1854">I don't have anybody in my family named Baruch.</span> <span id="s1855">Then Lucine remembered, you know what, that my cousin, who was our only witness on our wedding in Warsaw ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">06:42:04 He must be him.</span> <span id="s1857">Well that’s the address.</span> <span id="s1858">We wrote a letter to him.</span> <span id="s1859">He wrote back.</span> <span id="s1860">It was him.</span> <span id="s1861">He survived the concentration camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s1862">He made contact with an aunt in New York City.</span> <span id="s1863">It was his real aunt.</span> <span id="s1864">It was my wife's second line aunt actually because the aunt with the baby in the Warsaw ghetto that went to the Hotel Polski was her sister in New York.</span> <span id="s1865">But we wrote a letter to them.</span> <span id="s1866">We didn't ask for anything, but they start showering us with gifts, packages, food, chocolates, cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1867">I didn't smoke.</span> <span id="s1868">I was selling on black market.</span> <span id="s1869">He, her uncle asked me if I needed anything.</span> <span id="s1870">He can send me to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1871">He said, "do you want papers?"</span> <span id="s1872">I try to get you papers to come to United States.</span> <span id="s1873">But first you have to graduate and get your diploma.</span> <span id="s1874">Don't you ever come to the States without diploma.</span> <span id="s1875">You'd be nobody.</span> <span id="s1876">If you be medical doctor then you be somebody.</span> <span id="s1877">Your future be assured.</span> <span id="s1878">As difficult it might be for now, I remind you of a family in New York, mind you, people I never met, I never knew, Lucine never met, never knew.</span> <span id="s1879">She knew of this them but was a distant family through marriage of her uncle.</span> <span id="s1880">He start sending me packages of certain things, medication.</span> <span id="s1881">I sell on black market.</span> <span id="s1882">And we live like kings then.</span> <span id="s1883">So after graduate medical school, we throw a party for maybe 50 people, our friends and so on like one family.</span> <span id="s1884">We became one 93 family all the refugee, students and their relatives were all one family.</span> <span id="s1885">They substitute for our lost brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s1886">Their parents were our parents.</span> <span id="s1887">We used to call them mom and dad, you know.</span> <span id="s1888">Some of them fortunately survived, some parents of my colleagues.</span> <span id="s1889">They were very good to us and it helped us to regain our composure you know and maybe regain faith in humanity.</span> <span id="s1890">And slowly we registered in American Embassy, and here we met a little difficulty with one lady.</span> <span id="s1891">This was the time of Korean War.</span> <span id="s1892">We registered with all the proper documents.</span> <span id="s1893">We got a visa to enter United States.</span> <span id="s1894">The only thing still, I didn't finish my final exam to get my diploma.</span> <span id="s1895">She said, you have a deadline to meet.</span> <span id="s1896">You have to go right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">You have three weeks time to go.</span> <span id="s1898">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s1899">I cannot get my diploma in three weeks.</span> <span id="s1900">My final exam is not until a few months from now on.</span> <span id="s1901">She was very annoyed with it.</span> <span id="s1902">She said "I have my son fighting Korea and you have a chance to go to United States and you refuse to."</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">06:45:03 I said, "look, I'm not refusing.</span> <span id="s1904">And I try to explain to her where I stand, what's the problem."</span> <span id="s1905">She was not very compassionate, couldn't understand, and said, well, if that's how it is, then you might lose your entry.</span> <span id="s1906">I said, well, if that's what's going to be, that's what's going to be.</span> <span id="s1907">If I go there now I be nobody.</span> <span id="s1908">I only ask you to allow to finish my studies.</span> <span id="s1909">It's only a few months, can you ask for an extension?</span> <span id="s1910">No, I can't.</span> <span id="s1911">So we walked out.</span> <span id="s1912">This was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1913">We are very depressed, upset and depressed.</span> <span id="s1914">We worn out.</span> <span id="s1915">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1916">I knew we could not stay in Vienna because foreigners were not allowed to stay and practice in profession.</span> <span id="s1917">You could only study.</span> <span id="s1918">And the one day we get a note, a letter from the embassy to report to the embassy.</span> <span id="s1919">It was a different person.</span> <span id="s1920">It was a man, A different lady and they are telling us that we got our visa extended and when do we think we can go.</span> <span id="s1921">Is our time to go.</span> <span id="s1922">When can we go?</span> <span id="s1923">We can go any time now.</span> <span id="s1924">I just graduate and got my diploma.</span> <span id="s1925">So, I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1926">Either this first lady had second thoughts.</span> <span id="s1927">Maybe she was bitter that her son was in Korea fighting.</span> <span id="s1928">I felt very bad for her.</span> <span id="s1929">I was very sad but, maybe she did understand my problem and quietly maybe she helped me.</span> <span id="s1930">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1931">I never seen her.</span> <span id="s1932">I wish I would.</span> <span id="s1933">And we packed and went to the States.</span> <span id="s1934">We arrived in New York.</span> <span id="s1935">We are greeted by my wife's family.</span> <span id="s1936">They treated us very nicely.</span> <span id="s1937">They were very well-to-do people.</span> <span id="s1938">And they were very instrumental in our well being and he asked me, what can I do for you?</span> <span id="s1939">You need money, tell me.</span> <span id="s1940">I said, look, I’m young, I have ten fingers, I have both hands, thank God I am not lame.</span> <span id="s1941">I want to work.</span> <span id="s1942">I do the right thing to do, only I need advice.</span> <span id="s1943">And we survive.</span> <span id="s1944">We survived so far.</span> <span id="s1945">I didn't want nothing from them and I know he told me, you know, Felix, you're the only relative -- we brought quite a few from Europe -- you're the only one that never asked for money.</span> <span id="s1946">I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1947">It is a very strange thing.</span> <span id="s1948">I learned from the past several years to do without money.</span> <span id="s1949">I survived.</span> <span id="s1950">If you have less, you do less.</span> <span id="s1951">You did what you could without money and this is not the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">06:48:03 We have goal ahead of us, a purpose in life.</span> <span id="s1953">I want to start as soon as I could.</span> <span id="s1954">We want to leave New York.</span> <span id="s1955">It was a jungle.</span> <span id="s1956">Too many refugee and I wanted to mingle with American people.</span> <span id="s1957">I didn't know any English, I want to start learning and I want to get on my foot all by myself without any assistance.</span> <span id="s1958">So went to the Jewish Committee in New York.</span> <span id="s1959">Where should we go?</span> <span id="s1960">We opened a map and the social worker put her finger on the spot.</span> <span id="s1961">And she said "that's Rochester, New York.</span> <span id="s1962">What about that?"</span> <span id="s1963">That's fine wherever it is.</span> <span id="s1964">We went to Rochester, New York.</span> <span id="s1965">Nice, cultural town with a decent school of music, beautiful medical schools and so on.</span> <span id="s1966">Got acquainted with proper people.</span> <span id="s1967">We got refuge from a German Jewish family.</span> <span id="s1968">We stayed with them for several months.</span> <span id="s1969">They were beautiful people.</span> <span id="s1970">Very nice to us and right away I got acquainted with the hospital.</span> <span id="s1971">The chief of the hospital was a Jewish fellow, Dr. Stapens (ph) who was fascinated with my stories.</span> <span id="s1972">He wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1973">He supposed to ask me medical questions, if I equipped to start, what my internship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Mind you, not speaking English was very difficult to establish that fact.</span> <span id="s1975">He spoke some German, very little, but one the chief surgeons was fluent in German so he called him in, and the three of us sitting in his chambers in medical school and talking German and what he was asking my whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Tell me about going back and going back to the woman with the candelabra?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: After we come back to Lublin, we couldn't forget that lady, that she was selling us for a silver candelabra to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1978">How could a person who was a neighbor for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Her kids grew up with my wife Lucy, a neighbor.</span> <span id="s1980">She was a patient of my mother-in-law, who was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1981">How could she?</span> <span id="s1982">Could I do the same to anybody?</span> <span id="s1983">So I came -- we both came to her--we confronted her.</span> <span id="s1984">She became pale like a ghost.</span> <span id="s1985">She went down on her knees.</span> <span id="s1986">She crossed herself.</span> <span id="s1987">She didn't believe, that's us, that we survive.</span> <span id="s1988">She didn't know, she probably thought maybe they caught us that famous day that she called the Gestapo on us.</span> <span id="s1989">And I said, "you sold us to the Gestapo and here we are."</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">06:51:08 Now your life is at stake.</span> <span id="s1991">Don't have to do is point a finger, what you did to us and you be sentenced immediately, swift justice.</span> <span id="s1992">They shoot you right away.</span> <span id="s1993">She begged us, she was crying, screaming to spare her life in the name of her son and her departed husband, who died in the meantime, arrested allegedly by the German and so on.</span> <span id="s1994">I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1995">My wife inquired to some friends what can be done, if anything.</span> <span id="s1996">I wouldn't let them be killed but I felt she should be aware of what she did and they told my wife.</span> <span id="s1997">Unless she has witnesses that we're there at that time, there is nothing she can do.</span> <span id="s1998">But the fact that the woman went through facing us was enough of pay back, what she owed us.</span> <span id="s1999">I don't know if she's alive or not but if she died by now, she died with the fact what she tried to do to us.</span> <span id="s2000">That day Christian blame the Jews.</span> <span id="s2001">Crucify Jesus or Judas selling Jesus for silver.</span> <span id="s2002">She tried to do the same thing only she had killed Jews doing that.</span> <span id="s2003">If she was a religious person, real Christian, how could she do that?</span> <span id="s2004">Where was the church all the time.</span> <span id="s2005">Single people, priests did help us.</span> <span id="s2006">They help us to get the real birth certificate.</span> <span id="s2007">You need ID.</span> <span id="s2008">Fakes were no good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">They checked it right away.</span> <span id="s2010">But we received through the Home Army the real birth certificate.</span> <span id="s2011">The church was instrumental in helping us.</span> <span id="s2012">There certainly was a certain group of Polish people, definitely the intelligent people, people-- the real Polish patriot who knew who the real enemy is, not the Jews, and the little shopkeeper in the village or so, and the milkman, the Jewish milkman was not a dangerous person to the Pole, and the intelligencia the Jewish professionals, doctors, lawyers, CPA, and so on.</span> <span id="s2013">What a threat to the population?</span> <span id="s2014">None.</span> <span id="s2015">No one, maybe more or less.</span> <span id="s2016">That was a little jealousy, maybe because the Jewish professionals lead a more, extravagant life, maybe and it was striking something easy, visible.</span> <span id="s2017">See, the Jews were traveling abroad overseas, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2018">Most Poles, even the ones that could afford it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">They didn't do these things.</span> <span id="s2020">So there was certain differences, that the Poles did resent and I won't go into details.</span> <span id="s2021">I'm not a social workers and I never did any studies on the subject.</span> <span id="s2022">This is just my person observation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">06:54:00 But my thanks are due to some people.</span> <span id="s2024">We did survive thanks to some Polish people.</span> <span id="s2025">And we grateful to the Polish Home Army, the leaders, the people directly involved with us who saved many other Jewish people, poor people, without any compensation.</span> <span id="s2026">Risked their own lives, and I said it before, could anyone of us?</span> <span id="s2027">Try to inspect my own soul.</span> <span id="s2028">Could I do the same thing?</span> <span id="s2029">What those Polish people did?</span> <span id="s2030">I honestly don't know.</span> <span id="s2031">I was never a hero.</span> <span id="s2032">Maybe I'm a coward, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2033">But, they were heroes in my eyes, they were.</span> <span id="s2034">Maybe they were cowards too.</span> <span id="s2035">Maybe, they’re running only because they're human beings, and I remembered the words of my friend who said, "I don't like you Jews.</span> <span id="s2036">I do it because I--nobody was going to help you."</span> <span id="s2037">He was a humanitarian.</span> <span id="s2038">He meant he was upset.</span> <span id="s2039">He was upset and was angry that they were arguing and in the Jewish -- in the Yiddish language where the neighbors could hear and jeopardizing his life, his whole operation, his whole army.</span> <span id="s2040">So I understand.</span> <span id="s2041">But in order to understand my early days, my high school gave me a lot of happiness, the Polish people.</span> <span id="s2042">I was their Jew maybe, but I never had a bad word from them, never.</span> <span id="s2043">The only complaint I might have when I was young, I never dated Jewish girls, and many Jewish girls felt I am a snob, or I don't know.</span> <span id="s2044">I only dated Polish girls.</span> <span id="s2045">Because I was more comfortable with them because I was raised with them.</span> <span id="s2046">I grew up with them and I was more at ease with them, and I was not comfortable with the very religious Jews.</span> <span id="s2047">Because I was ignorant about the Jewish religion and the prayers, and so on.</span> <span id="s2048">My parents did the best they could to instill in me, but they were themselves not guilty of that.</span> <span id="s2049">They never give them that proper education, Jewish education.</span> <span id="s2050">And I don't know if I should blame them for that or not, because we're the orthodox people the right people, or less orthodox or the less religious people the wrong people who should be sentenced to die just -- they were serious religious orthodox, orthodox people going to their death.</span> <span id="s2051">They were the real heroes.</span> <span id="s2052">They were going there with the words in their mouth Shema Yisrael means, that's the prayer for the dead.</span> <span id="s2053">They were heroes.</span> <span id="s2054">They didn't run.</span> <span id="s2055">They didn't try to dodge or nothing.</span> <span id="s2056">They were killed right and went to their graves right in front of them.</span> <span id="s2057">I think they are the brave people.</span> <span id="s2058">Are we the heroes?</span> <span id="s2059">No.</span> <span id="s2060">I think we survive by accident, instinct maybe.</span> <span id="s2061">But, we're here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">06:57:01 We have to build our life again from beginning.</span> <span id="s2063">We have a nice family.</span> <span id="s2064">We are a special family.</span> <span id="s2065">I think, everybody my not think that way.</span> <span id="s2066">We are very close, our children.</span> <span id="s2067">They are very close to us.</span> <span id="s2068">We talk to each other every day.</span> <span id="s2069">We are fortunate we're in the same town.</span> <span id="s2070">We are 15, 20 minutes away.</span> <span id="s2071">We are blessed with three and a half -- half is coming, the fourth one is coming -- grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2072">We have three granddaughters, fourth on the way.</span> <span id="s2073">I gave the promise to my parents that we try to be decent, honest.</span> <span id="s2074">... We never ask anything from anybody.</span> <span id="s2075">We didn't have any, we did without it.</span> <span id="s2076">We're not a burden to society.</span> <span id="s2077">We grew up.</span> <span id="s2078">I'm proud of my children.</span> <span id="s2079">I feel they are decent citizens and I feel as difficult as it is to talk about it absolutely must, we don't know how long we'll stay here.</span> <span id="s2080">If you have the history deniers, the lies spread now.</span> <span id="s2081">Whatever good this will do, it's a living testimony.</span> <span id="s2082">It happened.</span> <span id="s2083">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">06:58:44 End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
