id="s2">PS: This is Phil Solomon interviewing Mr. William McCormick.</span> <span id="s3">The date is January the 11th, 1988.</span> <span id="s4">Bill, can you please tell us where in Europe, and in what unit you were serving before you arrived at the site of the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">WM: I was in the 15th Recon group attached to Seventh Army headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">PS: Did you know of the existence of this particular camp that you would liberate before you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">WM: No I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">PS: You knew nothing at all about its existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">WM: No, I knew nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">PS: Before you arrived at the camp, had you heard anything at all about the mass murder of political prisoners and Jews in Europe?</span> <span id="s11">If so, can you please describe what you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">WM: To be honest with you, I really didn't, I can't recall ever knowing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">PS: You knew that people were disappearing, that political prisoners and say Jewish people were being rounded up...</span></p> <p><span id="s14">WM: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">PS: But you didn't know what was being done with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WM: No, I thought that they were in labor forces fixing the highways and roads.</span> <span id="s17">That's about all I knew about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s19">Can you please give the name of the camp that you liberated, and its location?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">WM: It was Dachau, I think, called Dachau Prison Camp.</span> <span id="s21">And it was on the road to Munich.</span> <span id="s22">That's about all I can tell you.</span> <span id="s23">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s25">Can you remember approximately the date that you arrived at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">WM: No, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s27">Nope, I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s28">I really couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">PS: Yeah, I think, I was in that area myself, and I believe the liberation of Dachau was somewhere around, I think around the 1st of May, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">WM: As far as I, as far as I can recall, it was in that area, you know.</span> <span id="s31">But as far as the exact date I couldn't tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s33">[tape off then on] To the best of your memory, can you please describe what you saw at the camp, and what you felt at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WM: Well, when I first went into the camp, the first thing I saw was people walking around and they looked like skeletons.</span> <span id="s35">And you could look like, you could almost imagine, you could see through them.</span> <span id="s36">They were so thin, and they looked like zombies walkin' around.</span> <span id="s37">And you couldn't believe that a human being could be so thin, and still be on its feet.</span> <span id="s38">We had orders not to give them no cigarettes, no candy, or nothin'.</span> <span id="s39">And I tell you it was a terrible, terrible sight to see them poor people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">PS: Can you estimate how many prisoners there were, if any of them were dead, and if you were able to save any that were near death?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WM: Well, I imagine, I'd say there was approximately, I'm just sayin' real figures about 100 people.</span> <span id="s42">We could see that they didn't, that they haven't, that they didn't take to medical as of yet.</span> <span id="s43">And as far as bodies, I couldn't estimate how many I seen in boxcars.</span> <span id="s44">I'd say there was 25 boxcars just full with bodies that were just laying there.</span> <span id="s45">And they threw lime on these people to keep the smell down.</span> <span id="s46">It didn't help too much.</span> <span id="s47">You could st--the odor was still terrible.</span> <span id="s48">And I had a, I'd say there was, I couldn't estimate, but there was thousands of people dead there.</span> <span id="s49">It was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PS: Thousands of dead and possibly, you think just about maybe 100 that were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">WM: Well, of what I seen.</span> <span id="s52">Now I came in the day after that they had liberated the camp.</span> <span id="s53">And I would say that I don't know how many they had already taken away, taken to hospitals, but the ones that I seen were, I couldn't tell you how many they took away.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">PS: Had you been assigned any responsibilities in arranging for the transfer and care of prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WM: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s56">I was, actually I was just on, I was on Recon and when we heard of the c--when I heard of the camp we--I was a buck Sergeant--and myself and another fellow went there.</span> <span id="s57">And we had to write a report out of what we seen and turned it over to the, to our commanding officer.</span> <span id="s58">And we stayed there, I stayed there for two days.</span> <span id="s59">And I was only too glad to get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">PS: Bill, you mentioned boxcars that were filled with bodies that had been treated with lime?</span> <span id="s61">Those bodies, do you have any idea whether these boxcars had been bringing these people in, or whether they were evacuating?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WM: No, these bodies were from the gas chambers that they had there.</span> <span id="s63">They had a building, it was a one-story building, and the boxcars came up as far as I can remember on the opposite side of the building.</span> <span id="s64">And these people would come up and take their clothes off, thinking that they were gonna get a shower, I imagine.</span> <span id="s65">I guess that's what they told them.</span> <span id="s66">And then they would close the door and gas them.</span> <span id="s67">I imagine they was gassin' like 100 at a time.</span> <span id="s68">And the fellow told me there that they had a system where they just sucked the gas back in the, back out so they could use it again, and just--And, in this building you wouldn't believe that a human being could scratch a wall with his fingers and put imprints in the cement in the wall, like trying to dig themselves out.</span> <span id="s69">And there were imprints of their hands were in the wall.</span> <span id="s70">You couldn't believe a human being could do that.</span> <span id="s71">But that's how frightened I guess the poor people were when they were gettin' gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">PS: I heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">WM: You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">PS: I mean what you describe.</span> <span id="s75">Yeah, it was fact.</span> <span id="s76">I, of course I've heard it.</span> <span id="s77">Were there, in other words there were no ovens, crematorial ovens in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WM: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">PS: Oh there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WM: They had, they, I don't know how many they had.</span> <span id="s81">Like it wasn't an oven as far as I'm concerned.</span> <span id="s82">It was a, just a big pit fire, furnace, and as I understand it there was a man, there was a guard behind the door when the people walked in.</span> <span id="s83">They hit them with a mallet, and two guys would grab them and throw them right in the oven.</span> <span id="s84">And, as far as I know, when I came there there was boxes outside of these places I would say, I don't know how many was there, a dozen or a half a dozen.</span> <span id="s85">And they were full with ashes.</span> <span id="s86">And the guy told me that they're ashes of human beings.</span> <span id="s87">And how many is in one of them boxes they couldn't estimate.</span> <span id="s88">I, of all these years I remember, I have, I had three hats, well they were like, they were tahzes [phonetic, probably fez] like the Lulu Temple people wear, and I think they call them tahzes, and that's for the ex--I had three of those, and they were what they call the executioners hats.</span> <span id="s89">And I have never heard nothin' about 'em in all them years, and on the hat it had the swastika and crossbones.</span> <span id="s90">And I don't know anybody, I have never heard of anybody talking about them.</span> <span id="s91">But I had three of them, and whatever happened to them, I, when I left my outfit a fellow was gonna send a box of my souvenirs home that I never did get them.</span> <span id="s92">So I don't know whatever happened to them.</span> <span id="s93">But, they would be some piece to have today.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">PS: They actually were hats that were used by the executioners with a combination of swastika, skull and crossbones, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WM: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s96">And it is terrible that you know, that I never heard nothing about it.</span> <span id="s97">That's what really gets me.</span> <span id="s98">You know, I, anybody I ever talked to, and they never heard of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">PS: Can you describe the reactions of the prisoners at the point of liberation when you entered Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WM: Well, they just walked around and they didn't know, it looked like they didn't know what day it was and, they were so pathetic.</span> <span id="s101">It's hard to describe what they, they just, they looked like they were zombies.</span> <span id="s102">They were just walking around in a fog.</span> <span id="s103">That's all I can tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">PS: And their physical condition certainly must have been very, very low and...</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WM: You couldn't believe that a human body could be as thin as them people.</span> <span id="s106">All you could see was, they like, the skin just hangin' on bones.</span> <span id="s107">And they, and the look in their eyes.</span> <span id="s108">They just didn't know what was goin' on.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">PS: Did you or others in your unit, or others who you observed, American troops, come prepared with food and medical supplies?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WM: Oh yes, they had it, they had, the medics were one of the first called in there, but we wasn't allowed to give them people a cigarette or a candy bar or nothin'.</span> <span id="s111">And, you felt like giving them something, but you couldn't.</span> <span id="s112">If you gave them a candy bar, you're liable to kill them.</span> <span id="s113">They had to give them--I don't know how they ever got them back to being normal again, but they did.</span> <span id="s114">I have seen some of the people afterwards that were in them camps.</span> <span id="s115">You know, years later you heard them talking.</span> <span id="s116">And you couldn't believe that they would be the same people.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">PS: Now we did hear that they had to be brought along very, very slowly.</span> <span id="s118">In the beginning when they first fed them, many, many died while they were being treated or while they were being fed.</span> <span id="s119">When you entered the camp, were there any German guards or other guards still left within the camp when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">WM: Well, they had, as far as I know that they had rounded up the guards that were still there.</span> <span id="s121">But I understand some of the inmates naturally--I understood that they killed about a half a dozen of them, which I couldn't blame them.</span> <span id="s122">Heh, for the way they were treated, my God, you wouldn't treat a dog.</span> <span id="s123">I can't believe that another human being could treat another human being like them poor people were treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">PS: You mentioned about all the bodies, the bodies, the carcasses that were in the boxcars.</span> <span id="s125">Did you also see in walking through the camp, did you also see bodies that were scattered around the camp that hadn't been gathered up as...</span></p> <p><span id="s126">WM: No, well, I do remember they had a big, when I got there they had a big pile of bodies they had put up on the side.</span> <span id="s127">Wherever they came from I couldn't tell ya.</span> <span id="s128">But they were all just like skeletons and what they were gonna do then, I didn't stay there, but as I understood they were gonna have a mass burial for all these people.</span> <span id="s129">I don't know how they could bury the poor people unless they did it all in just dig a big hole and put them all in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s131">Mass graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">WM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">PS: Bill, did the experience of seeing the prisoners have any effect on your feeling about being part of the war and fighting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WM: Yeah, well, I tell ya, it took me a long time to even think about likin' German people.</span> <span id="s135">I couldn't believe that the German people didn't know that that was goin' on.</span> <span id="s136">I can't, when you're talking about millions of people being killed and, I understand before we got to Dachau, that they had killed at least, I, I'm gonna estimate it, the people said that three or four days before we got there that they killed about 30,000 people.</span> <span id="s137">Now can you believe they could do something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">PS: You did say 30,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">WM: 30,000 they said they killed in about a week before the American troops got there, trying to get rid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">PS: Do you recall the reactions of other men in your unit?</span> <span id="s141">Did you talk with them afterwards about the experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WM: Yeah, well, most of the guys felt the same way as I did.</span> <span id="s143">I guess they, that the--I really hated the German people.</span> <span id="s144">But, then I guess you start to think and you think, "Well, maybe they didn't know."</span> <span id="s145">And, it was pretty hard to find, to believe that all of them didn't know.</span> <span id="s146">Some of them knew.</span> <span id="s147">There were a lot of them had to know.</span> <span id="s148">They had to see them bod--people coming in there and never coming out.</span> <span id="s149">So, I don't know what, how you could explain it, but I know that I was awful hateful at the time.</span> <span id="s150">And I was only 22 years old, so I guess time heals everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">PS: How long did you remain in the Dachau Concentration Camp after the, well, how many days did you remain there?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WM: I was only there two days, two full days.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">PS: Now, from what you've said, obviously the experience lingered with you after you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">WM: It sure did.</span> <span id="s155">I'll tell ya.</span> <span id="s156">I guess being young you try to forget, but I'm now 65, and that's a long time ago, and I sure do, every once in a while you wonder about your experiences and how you ever got over it.</span> <span id="s157">The cruelty of one person to another, you couldn't, I don't know, I couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s158">I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">PS: Bill, were you aware when you, now, until you entered Dachau, which was only, oh, I believe it was about three weeks before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s160">The war, after all those years, the war was almost over.</span> <span id="s161">Up until the time that you saw Dachau, were you, you were not, I believe you did say that you were not aware that there was such a thing as these death camps, the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">WM: No, I really, I really and truly, I truly can't say that I was.</span> <span id="s163">I now, this has been so long ago, but I really don't think that I ever thought of it like that.</span> <span id="s164">I thought that they built them highways, them beautiful highways they had in Germany, by the prisoners.</span> <span id="s165">I thought that they'd done all that, and that's what they were doing with them.</span> <span id="s166">As far as, but as far as being exterminating them, I figured that maybe they killed a few people, like, but nothing, God Almighty, nothing like I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">PS: Now after you did see Dachau, were you aware that this was only one of many concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WM: Yes.</span> <span id="s169">We found that out later.</span> <span id="s170">You know, I found that out later that it was only, that Dachau was only a small one as far as I know and, if that was a small one, God help, what are the big ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">PS: In your own mind, can you explain German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">WM: No.</span> <span id="s173">The only thing I can say is that the leaders must have been mad men to try to exterminate the amount of people that they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">PS: After you left Dachau, was there any official or unofficial meeting of your unit to discuss what you had experienced at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">WM: No there wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">PS: Do you know if there was any regimental history that included this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WM: I personally don't know of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">PS: Later on, did you hear of any other servicemen who were involved in the liberation of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">WM: Yeah, every once in a while you met a guy in a bar havin' a beer or something, and he said that he was in Buchenwald, or he went to Buchenwald or something like that.</span> <span id="s180">But I, that's, as far as their names, I cannot recall them.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">PS: Did you have any idea of the number of camps, or the number of prisoners in captivity?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">WM: No, only thing I, we would, heard, what was just hearsay, you know, like the amount of people that were exterminated, like, I think it was between four and six million or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">PS: Do you have any recollection as to when you first heard of the mass gassing as you just mentioned, that you did hear later the figure of four to six million Jews who were gassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">WM: I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s185">PS: Do you recall...</span></p> <p><span id="s186">WM: I guess it was right after the war, waitin' to be discharged, talkin' to fellows in camp, you know.</span> <span id="s187">And talking about our experiences.</span> <span id="s188">And to tell you the truth, I know, I have ten children and I don't think I have discussed it twice with any of them.</span> <span id="s189">I don't like to bring them kind of things up.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">PS: How long did you remain in Europe after the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">WM: Oh, I was there, I was one of the few soldiers that got, that had, got home on recuperation leave early in, early that year.</span> <span id="s192">I was home for 30 days, right before the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s193">And naturally when I came back [phone rings; tape off then on] I came back I, naturally, they were gonna keep me there, because I was already home.</span> <span id="s194">So I stayed till about, I think it was the end of July, and then I came home and was discharged.</span> <span id="s195">Because I was in the service almost a year before the war had started, and that's about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">PS: The end of July, that would have been, you were there about two months...</span></p> <p><span id="s197">WM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">PS: After the German surrender.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">WM: Yeah, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">PS: Do you think that you would have the same feelings about the war if you had not been an eyewitness to the Nazi atrocities?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WM: No, I don't think I would have.</span> <span id="s202">I would have thought that it was just a war, you know.</span> <span id="s203">I would never have thought about something like that.</span> <span id="s204">I don't believe anybody in their right mind could even think that anybody could do something like that to another human being, whether if you were Black, White, Pink, or what you are!</span> <span id="s205">And I can't see how anybody could do such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">PS: Bill, we've reached the end of the list of questions.</span> <span id="s207">Would you like to add anything at all to your testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">WM: No I, that's about all I can recall I guess.</span> <span id="s209">The only thing I can say is [pause] it's a great, it's a good thing that we won the war, or I guess we'd all be in death camps.</span> <span id="s210">Heh, God, it'd be terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">PS: Bill, thank you very, very much for your very valuable testimony.</span> <span id="s212">Thank you.</span></p></body></html>
