id="s4">...Eastern Poland...</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: How many brothers and sisters do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I had three brothers and two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: And did they make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Nobody made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: You’re the only one who made it out of the -.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I made it, and only – again, I don’t know if this is the – if this what you are looking for but it’s an interesting story, too – I made it because I made up my mind that I want to live.</span> <span id="s11">And I was with the Germans a couple of months...when the Germans came into our town, it was a couple of days before Rosh Hashonah.</span> <span id="s12">The first day of Rosh Hashonah, I was in shul...it was in the middle of laining and a woman came in and started to yell about her husband (needs translation) and I was at that time, 18 years old...</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was born in ’21.</span> <span id="s15">And when I heard that, I got like all shook up, you know...(needs translation).</span> <span id="s16">.</span> <span id="s17">there was one (lavatory?)</span> <span id="s18">in shul and there was like (one in a) a house and there was a little – an alleyway, and I figure I’m gonna go out and see what was wrong.</span> <span id="s19">And as I was coming out the other way, you know, in small towns, you didn’t have no fancy facilities when you had to go, so there was what they call (needs translation - outhouses)....you go down on the road to the mikvah, you know, to the beitel what they call there – what they call there, because they washed...and as I came out from that alley, I saw the Germans approach, coming with the – you know, with their weapons drawn.</span> <span id="s20">I got scared and I ran back to the bais midrash.</span> <span id="s21">And I was sitting next to my grandfather near a window, and the minute they came in, they started shooting without a word, without anything, they started shooting.</span> <span id="s22">Everybody went under the benches, and said, ‘Shema Yisrael...’ and as the shooting subsided a little bit, and I saw one person, another person, they jumping out from the window, and that was like – there was underneath was a – where they have the poor people sleep – it was like two flights up and there was an old (needs translation - #51) and as they jump, I jumped right after them, and I started running and here I heard something whistling in my ears.</span> <span id="s23">I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s24">Later I realized that these were bullets.</span> <span id="s25">Anyhow, run into – until there was a hole in the gate and – in the fence – and I jump out, and I went up there, and I was hiding there, and then a goya came to house, and she saw me lying there, naturally I couldn’t run no more.</span> <span id="s26">That’s why I just crawling.</span> <span id="s27">So she called her husband to cover me up with straw, and I was landed, and as I landed, somebody stepped on me.</span> <span id="s28">You know, people that were running away, that I recognized later in the voice.</span> <span id="s29">I said, ‘What’s going on there?’</span> <span id="s30">‘Oy, don’t ask me.’</span> <span id="s31">Anyway, to make it (needs translation) after all this (inaudible – resided?)</span> <span id="s32">and when I came home, like hours later with all different ways you know, like under the town, when I came back...then I found out that after they start the shooting, they ordered everybody out, and they took like boys – under 14 they let go home and men over 65 they could go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: That was in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: How many Jews were there living in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: In the town, there may have been like, three hundred, maybe Jewish families.</span> <span id="s37">But the whole town was Jews.</span> <span id="s38">Maybe three goyim.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Were your parents Hassidim?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Well, my father used to be a (needs translation) he used to travel to the (bais a chevras?)</span> <span id="s43">...</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: What kind if work did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: We had originally (needs translation) something like a bar.</span> <span id="s46">Not exactly like an American bar.</span> <span id="s47">Selling liquor and beer you know.</span> <span id="s48">But I think the main living they made from the Thursdays.</span> <span id="s49">This was the market day.</span> <span id="s50">And there was a big trading, the cows and the horses.</span> <span id="s51">And every time a trade was closed, they went to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Your parents didn’t make it through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No.</span> <span id="s54">So this was the town, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: You said that you were running, and they said, ‘Don’t ask,’ and only a few hours later you found out what happened when you came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s57">I came and they told me that they made them to take all the Sefarim.</span> <span id="s58">I remember that this boy, you know, he used to always to talk about this sefer’s six hundred years old...and they made him carry all this out.</span> <span id="s59">And, they made a fire outside there and they burned the (inaudible) and while they carried the Sefarim, they hit them and so on.</span> <span id="s60">And there was a time like, I don’t remember, if there was eight – ten dead.</span> <span id="s61">(inaudible) and a couple wounded which they took to...another town, to a hospital, because that was a small town, we had no hospital.</span> <span id="s62">And, after that, so, it started the business every day they would go out and grab people to take them to work.</span> <span id="s63">So as you heard, (needs translation) everybody started to hide.</span> <span id="s64">And I was nervous type.</span> <span id="s65">I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s66">And one day, one day is, ehr, I don’t know, there is something going from house to house, and I remember I was just standing there, one second, and my father he wanted to run away or something, and the Germans just saw him run, that they just put the gun right to his throat (inaudible) after Succos, we started hearing news about the part of Poland that the Russians took over, that Jews have freedom.</span> <span id="s67">Some people had those radios – the crystals...the neighbors, one or two...and they used to listen privately to radio.</span> <span id="s68">And that they could hear Jewish programs, and Jews had freedom, and this and that.</span> <span id="s69">And here it was – I remember the eating.</span> <span id="s70">We still had food.</span> <span id="s71">We had flour.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: You decided to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: ...I don’t go, I was there yet, so, I remember that we had food...(needs translation) you had to listen to the door if somebody’s coming...we decided to make a succah...a couple of minutes before licht benchen, the Germans were walking around and they notice...people putting candles and laughter, and you know...so it started, ‘What is this?’</span> <span id="s74">They want to know what this is all about...once they heard that...they took it apart...and later on we ate.</span> <span id="s75">You know you have to sit with the spoon in the (inaudible) tremble.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: So what happened – you decided to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: So then, when I heard that there’s more fear...I said I got to leave.</span> <span id="s78">I was eighteen, but by us, 18 – a boy here of 12 has more world – the world that I had at 18 because I never traveled maybe further than like to the next town.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Did you work at the age of 18 or 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Nay...even if I would wanna work, I was learning from clothes, what they call and then I started – which it was against my father’s wishes – I wanted to learn a trade.</span> <span id="s81">I don’t know why...they made arrangements somebody to teach me how to sew shirts.</span> <span id="s82">There was no industry in our town...there was those people who sold shirts...they went out to the market...every day in a different town...they’d come back whatever they needed, they cut it right away by hand knife, of course, and they’d give it out to people to houses to sew overnight...shirts (had no) buttons, no button holes, all you needed was a bandle here and a bandle there.</span> <span id="s83">Because it was very primitive.</span> <span id="s84">I learned for a while to make the shirts, and I got like eight, nine cents a shirt.</span> <span id="s85">.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: So you couldn’t become a millionaire from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Well I didn’t do it – but to me, it was a thrill, you know, whatever I had, I went to the – there was no banks...but the Post Office...had government bank so I used to accumulate my money and see that the pennies growing...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So, in this case, you decided to go to Russia –</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I just wanted to tell you, when I started saying I want to go, they wouldn’t let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Who was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: My parents, - I had two older brothers, older sister.</span> <span id="s92">So it so happened that things opened up and Jews could start to travel out by train...it came one time that they came and took away the licenses from a lot of Jews to sell liquor and they gave it to the invalids from the first World War, the, mainly goyim...so remained only with the beer which it was hard to make a living, alright, so they sold liquor under the table, (needs translation) finally they decided, when my other brothers grew up (needs translation) they started to, also travel around with textiles, piece goods...every day was in a different town...within a radius of 15 or 20 miles...and...we had a typhoid epidemic...so they closed down that shank completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So they didn’t want you to go anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: They didn’t want me to go.</span> <span id="s95">But as things opened up...my mother...went into the rebbe and she tells him, ‘my son’s stubborn, he wants to go away.’</span> <span id="s96">So he said, ‘if he wants to go away, let him go!’</span> <span id="s97">So when she came back with this, (needs translation) we started looking already of ways I’m gonna go.</span> <span id="s98">And you know, it’s like I see it as a miracle ‘cause right then something happened that you see that the (needs translation) ...(town leader?)</span> <span id="s99">when the Germans came he went away, some place else.</span> <span id="s100">Because he was a rich man.</span> <span id="s101">And he was afraid...so he was in another town...and he had a son who was a little older than I was, he stayed in our house...and comes a letter from his father that he should come there to Nebulitz and from there we’re going to smuggle over to the Russian side...that was an opportunity for me also...the son...insisted that they took me and a cousin of mine and we traveled to Nebulitz.</span> <span id="s102">And at that time I remember that my mother was following the horse and buggy, and begging me, (needs translation) so I said (needs translation) I remember these words I said to her.</span> <span id="s103">(inaudible) I made had made up my mind I gotta go.</span> <span id="s104">I mean, something was driving me to go.</span> <span id="s105">It’s – I couldn’t understand it...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: You were in Siberia during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: You didn’t start off in Siberia, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: ...I smuggled the border once, then they caught us...I did it right away again and other occasion I had to be smuggled the border...so I ended up in (inaudible town) when I came to the Russian side.</span> <span id="s110">There I was a while -</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Did they have an order that all the Jews had to go to Siberia – after you came to (Langbert?</span> <span id="s112">inaudible town?)</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: ...when I came to (Langbert?)</span> <span id="s114">it was like this.</span> <span id="s115">At first, you were free.</span> <span id="s116">I mean, they didn’t do anything for you...you got nothing.</span> <span id="s117">You lucky if they gave you a room there to sleep on the floor.</span> <span id="s118">And this what happened, we had to go to certain place, (inaudible - needs translation)...but there wasn’t even work, you had to –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So how did you come to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: ...they had like a registration, supposedly, whoever wants to go back to Germany, so I registered.</span> <span id="s121">In the meantime, I got a letter from home and I burned it...(needs translation – a warning?)</span> <span id="s122">they had another registration...I didn’t register no more.</span> <span id="s123">They started a rumor, whoever is not gonna work, they’ll send them on to Russia...I managed to get a job...so one day, when I came from work at night, the house where we were sleeping...was surrounded...(inaudible)...and they come over to me, so I told them I work (?)</span> <span id="s124">and I show them my paper said that I work on the railroad there.</span> <span id="s125">Anyhow, they collected all the Jews, all those they could lay their hands on, and shipped them to Russia.</span> <span id="s126">And this is how I happen to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s127">They took...all the refugees that they could surround, they took them, and -</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Made them work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Made them, and shipped them out...I was lucky I ended up in a camp where they had families.</span> <span id="s130">I was a single boy.</span> <span id="s131">And the singles ended up in much worse places than I did...</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: You just had luck you wound up in -</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I wound up...with a family.</span> <span id="s134">Again, they didn’t give you anything.</span> <span id="s135">They brought you into the middle of a forest.</span> <span id="s136">And they had the barracks which, they weren’t even finished, and each family got a tiny little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And you got a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: I got a room with four single people...we weren’t provided with anything except, we’re gonna work, and right they took us out...to show us how to cut down trees...get them ready for export...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: But they fed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No.</span> <span id="s141">You had to buy.</span> <span id="s142">They paid you...I used to get paid every two weeks...the transport took about 7 or 8 days...on the train they gave us like soup, and some bread each day, but if you wanted to grab something else, like on the station where we stop...by the time I came to the camp there, I had very little...we went to the commander...he gave us from his own pocket.</span> <span id="s143">He happened to be a VERY nice man...finally...the war started with Germany, they released all these people...they gave you a piece of paper...that said you were Polish, that said you were free to go...and you could go wherever you wanted...most of those people they decided and they went to middle Asia.</span> <span id="s144">You know, to Afghan, to Georgia, Pakistan, where it was a warmer climate...I went to the central town and I got a job...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: In the camp, how hard was life in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Well, I would say that the regime was very liberal, I would call it.</span> <span id="s147">As a matter of fact, in the beginning, if you had clothes or whatever to exchange with the – they allowed you go to the nearest village.</span> <span id="s148">And the village bread was a commodity.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Would you say that the people there were as anti – Semitic as the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No, they didn’t know what Jews were.</span> <span id="s151">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s152">This was very far out.</span> <span id="s153">Later, when I was on the field and I was working, we got in the skins...from the cattle...when those the skins were ready to be packed for transport, they came down from the laboratory, and they cut off a little piece from each skin for testing...and there were two girls who started talking, so I tell them, ‘I’m a Jew from Poland,’ she looked at me like this: ‘Jew!’</span> <span id="s154">So I said, ‘What are you looking for?’</span> <span id="s155">‘We thought that Jews were some kind of cattle’...they didn’t know what a Jew looked like...so I wouldn’t say that there was any.</span> <span id="s156">The older ones probably were...</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: After the war, did you go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeh...in 1943 I enlisted in the Polish army...</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: After the war, did you go back to (inaudible – Furstik?)</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No...by me the survival started, I would say, in 1944...when I was in the army...until we came into Poland...I went from town...all those little towns...it was ?</span> <span id="s161">Judenrat?</span> <span id="s162">You couldn’t see a Jew.</span> <span id="s163">And, I was thinking back, I said, I always thought I’ll never make it to see my parents ‘cause I’m not gonna make it!</span> <span id="s164">You know, from all what I’ve been through, it somehow never dawned on me that my parents are not gonna make it, or my family is not gonna make it.</span> <span id="s165">So, but by then, I said, if I saw everything was no Jew around, you know my whole thinking started changing...and I didn’t think I’ll see anybody and then was survive for me then started, me started, what do I do from now.</span> <span id="s166">What do I do from here.</span> <span id="s167">And, I’ll tell you the truth, there was moment when I said, the best thing is to lose yourself as a Jew, you know, settle among the Poles, and you live your years whatever you have (inaudible) I mean, there was no life.</span> <span id="s168">Just like to survive, that’s all there is.</span> <span id="s169">And, after a while...the towns I came from were still occupied by the Germans ‘cause this was early 1944...one thing, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s170">I was never in the real combat.</span> <span id="s171">I was in the telephone...and again, I say (needs translation)...’besheret’)...our unit...communications.</span> <span id="s172">We grew with the army...the bigger it got, the further away from the front line we were because we stayed always with the highest command.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So what changed your mind when you said ‘best thing is to lose yourself?’</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: What changed my mind is, when you started to find out that, that the anti – Semitism.</span> <span id="s175">That is – and I realize that it’s not gonna help that either.</span> <span id="s176">I mean, I says to myself...in the meantime I wrote to my town when once our area was liberated...I wrote to...a goy...there...he never answered...but gave the letter over to the town hall...and I got an official letter from them that nobody survived...in 1944...we were staying on this town...and we got free time to go to a movie...and I heard somebody call...I start looking around...(needs translation)...he tells me who he is...(a friend)...so then I I found out that my family was all done except there was one aunt and uncle that survived...and another aunt with a boy...we used to get Jewish holidays off, in the Polish army, so I tell them...it’s gonna be the high holidays...so I planned I’ll go for 13 days...the minute the war ended...my aunt and uncle say they are going to Czechoslovakia...and I should come.</span> <span id="s177">And I said, ‘No.’</span> <span id="s178">We were twelve Jews in a company of 120...and I said I’m not going to desert the Army.</span> <span id="s179">And when I came back, they look at me like crazy.</span> <span id="s180">And I didn’t really know what happened so much...</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Because the papers didn’t print it...</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Why did they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Why?</span> <span id="s185">Because they went to shul there in Warsaw for Shavuos, and they told the stories that’s going on – they killed here, they killed there Jews and so on.</span> <span id="s186">‘You had a chance to go, and you didn’t go?’</span> <span id="s187">That they thought I was the biggest fool...and it so happened my aunt and uncle didn’t leave that time but they telling, right after Succos we going...this time I said, ‘alright.’</span> <span id="s188">...I took off my uniform...and they got me papers as a German Jew...the German Jews they could go freely...this is how we got out of Poland...and from there we smuggled to the American Zone...from there I ended up in a D.P. camp...(Tseson?)</span> <span id="s189">.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: There I was until 1946, December.</span> <span id="s192">I arrived in America March 3rd, 1947.</span> <span id="s193">Because they had the strike.</span> <span id="s194">The shipping line was striking and I had to stay in a camp until they had the – the ship started to go (inaudible) was delayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: In the D.P. camp you had your own room?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: I lived together with my aunt and uncle...we had more like two rooms, I think.</span> <span id="s197">But you know, whoever came there, if you knew him, everybody got a bed to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: So then you left, by boat.</span> <span id="s199">Did you leave from Bremerhaven?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s201">We left from Bremerhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: What was the name of the boat you left on?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Marine Marleen...I think the journey took about ten days.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You left on the boat with your aunt and uncle, but you didn’t all have a room together on the boat, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: ...my uncle didn’t go.</span> <span id="s206">I went before them.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: How come he didn’t go?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: His papers didn’t come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What kind of affidavit did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: I got an affidavit that...(laugh needs translation)...as far as coming to America, I came under false pretenses.</span> <span id="s211">You never know – I know you’re not gonna talk about it, but -</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Except to say, that thousands of people came this way, and the HIAS knew about it, but the HIAS wanted to make sure that people came.</span> <span id="s213">So now you traveled with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: No, they came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: The boat – how was the trip?</span> <span id="s216">What do you remember about it.</span> <span id="s217">Now, I want to see if you can give me the same details as you gave me about Europe about the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Well, the boat – I would say, not adventurous excerpt it was a small boat.</span> <span id="s219">You know, once we reached the...English Channel it was very rough.</span> <span id="s220">I – uh, everybody got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Did you get seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Everybody got sick.</span> <span id="s223">Practically everybody got –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Where did you sleep, in a big room?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: In a big room, and they had those...bunks.</span> <span id="s226">Look it was an army -</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: How many people were there in a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Oh, must have – oh, I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s229">Forty, fifty – I have no idea...it was a big compartment, like, with all bunks and sleeping one next to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did you see anyone you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s232">There were some people that I knew just by sight – as a matter of fact I know some people that they here in America, that they were on the same boat with me.</span> <span id="s233">One of them is a very rich man.</span> <span id="s234">He’s a builder in Squaretown...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: So, you stayed on the boat.</span> <span id="s236">What were the people like to you?</span> <span id="s237">First of all, were they all Jewish – the people on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, I wouldn’t know, I mean of course, I associate only with Jews.</span> <span id="s239">With friends, so – ya, there were some from the same camp that we...we kept together.</span> <span id="s240">I wasn’t interested in the others...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: When you got up in the morning, what did you do first?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: First, we davened.</span> <span id="s243">(inaudible) we had minyan.</span> <span id="s244">Like a small minyan we used to –</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: You stayed religious through the whole war?</span> <span id="s246">You were able?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Well, ah – in Russia, I stayed religious in my heart, but I trefes, I mean, of course, to eat – to survive.</span> <span id="s248">I’ll tell you one thing, that in the, in the army, when of course you ate trefe, (inaudible) but somehow, I – you know, I had a..</span> <span id="s249">.</span> <span id="s250">razor blades...and this, in Russia, this was a fortune.</span> <span id="s251">So, when I was in the army, very few soldiers had ah, what to shave, so everybody used my shaver.</span> <span id="s252">So, on Shabbas, they knew my shop was closed.</span> <span id="s253">I didn’t shave on Shabbas.</span> <span id="s254">And the goyim, there knew where the sha – and there was other things like, eh, when they came in already from Poland...once they liberated Poland...the Poles...they sent them to the Army, and they didn’t know Russian and if they wanted to write home, they would have to write it in Russian.</span> <span id="s255">I used to write for them the Russian addresses.</span> <span id="s256">(inaudible) and they knew Shabbas (inaudible) I didn’t write...I wouldn’t say I religious...</span></p> <p><span id="s257">END OF SIDE ONE----TAPE ONE.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">TAPE ONE------SIDE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: You came back, you found out that your parents hadn’t survived, and your brothers and sisters hadn’t survived, what was your first reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, ya, a reaction, how should I tell it?</span> <span id="s261">It’s, it’s, ah, well I told you the first time that I had concrete evidence that they didn’t survive was when I met this guy -</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Sam, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: And I remember there was a little like a (inaudible) where you could go in and this man had, had gone in there first, register, to do something – well, I-I don’t know how to describe it.</span> <span id="s264">I must have cried for weeks.</span> <span id="s265">I mean, you know, also, I knew already.</span> <span id="s266">Because like I said, I got a letter but this was sort of the clincher.</span> <span id="s267">You know?</span> <span id="s268">There still was some kind of a hope.</span> <span id="s269">– I was-s-s-s (MT drags out the ‘s’ in ‘was’) devastated.</span> <span id="s270">I don’t know how, uh, what words you use.</span> <span id="s271">I was very, very, -</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: But did you feel like going on after learning this all – after hearing this all – to hear that your whole family is wiped out?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s274">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s275">Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What did you do about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: And I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s278">A lot of times I felt sort of guilty.</span> <span id="s279">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Because you went away?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Because (inaudible – he is stumbling over words) went away, and this, and, and, it’s, it’s very – it was very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: But could they have gone with you too?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Why didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Why?</span> <span id="s286">Well, now, I’ll tell you – it would take us maybe too much time to go into because people were too much attached to their miserable belongings I would say, because I would say that the very real rich, I mean, we weren’t rich by the sense of the word, but – they had a home, they filled with furniture, they had a bis schmates you know, they were afraid to part with it.</span> <span id="s287">Because I – before I went, I argued with my, with my mother mostly, you know my father was a little too (inaudible) you know how it is.</span> <span id="s288">You didn’t have the approach to my father as much as to my – and when I used to pleaded that I want to go out, said, ‘Momma, (der hasted mon?</span> <span id="s289">translation needed) they were afraid – well it’s hard, to uproot I mean, I understand, I think of it so much.</span> <span id="s290">I think of it so much, even until this day.</span> <span id="s291">It’s not easy to argue with – you, you nothing, and going to, you’re not likely, like she said to me, (needs translation: Voses stolte, voses de essen?)</span> <span id="s292">I mean, you pick up and you going to nowhere, you don’t know what’s goin to be, I mean, it’s not easy...nobody even thought that it’s gonna go a war so fast.</span> <span id="s293">But here, to go into the nowhere especially smuggle into Russia, and, and was Russia in itselves was scaring...</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Do you think maybe your outlook on life was maybe different than your brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Why” I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s298">I think it has to do with nature, and to a great degree, or maybe a lot times you’d like to say, ‘besheret.’</span> <span id="s299">I mean, I really felt all the time, that somebody was pushing me.</span> <span id="s300">That there was somebody behind me in and not just this, in – I mean, I skipped all that – to be at certain incidence, that, that – even with the army where I was here, (inaudible) even in the other particular cases, that I was more like I – like I was spared...</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: You mean, by accident, it wasn’t in your control?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: By accident, and my control, definitely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So, if it wasn’t in your control, you don’t have to feel guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: (He grapples for an answer) True, but – ehhhhh – no I don’t feel about that part, but in general, you know it’s – why did I have (Germany?)</span> <span id="s305">It’s hard to explain.</span> <span id="s306">I mean, I myselves, now I’ll tell you my, my thinking here changed maybe a million times, and my whole outlook of life I would say transformed maybe ten times you know from what it was until what it’s today.</span> <span id="s307">I mean, uh, as you go on, and as you live, and as you see things you -</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: You ask about religion, right?</span> <span id="s309">You say you daven on the boat, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s311">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Did you feel at any point to question that if there is a G-d, why this would happen to so many Jews, and why it would happen to so many frum Jews, and why it would happen to your own family?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, I do, not that deeply.</span> <span id="s314">I mean, I know it’s a question I question, but somehow, I, I don’t know, I never – I always questioned more why did I survive?</span> <span id="s315">You see, and this brings me, which it will come later, let’s say, I – read it like my article (?)</span> <span id="s316">I had told you that my mother was pulling the horse and buggy when I was leaving, and she was was (needs translation) and this left such an impression on me, I mean, but that’s and, and, coming – but after the war I sort of was resigned from that in marrying?</span> <span id="s317">(needs translation).</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Because, it’s, yes, I mean, I-I-I never could forget my mother’s face (his voice catches with emotion) so, but again, like I say, you get transformed.</span> <span id="s320">But, an – and then it so happens I married late.</span> <span id="s321">I was already 30 when I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: You lived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Yeh...we got married in 1952.</span> <span id="s324">So, so it so happens that we didn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s325">We couldn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s326">You know, we went to doctor’s, this, that and – so, we decided to adopt – I mean, you see, this I’m trying to tell you.</span> <span id="s327">At once, I wouldn’t want to know about children.</span> <span id="s328">Later, when I wanted children, I just – we didn’t, we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s329">So I actually was against adoption, I myselves.</span> <span id="s330">Not so much against adopting, because other things, I-I-I was – I saw there could be problems in adopting.</span> <span id="s331">You know, it wasn’t that important, I mean, it wasn’t that important to me to have a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: To your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: My wife wanted it.</span> <span id="s334">She wanted a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What were you worried about in adopting.</span> <span id="s336">You mean, you didn’t know where the child is from, you didn’t know what its problems are?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yeh, a lot of things.</span> <span id="s338">Actually, before we came to adopting...it was another thing.</span> <span id="s339">I went to doctors, my wife went to a doctor.</span> <span id="s340">And, when they, finally one doctor he said, ‘Look,’ because you know, I went to treatments and this, and my wife went, - so we finally ended up with one doctor.</span> <span id="s341">He said, ‘Look, don’t run around.’</span> <span id="s342">He said.</span> <span id="s343">‘Save your heart, you should, you should have kids...’ He suggested artificial insemination.</span> <span id="s344">(His voice drops to a whisper) And the doctor’s name was a Dr. Kurland, he had a, uhm, Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s345">So, to me, I got like, all, ahh, taken aback and astonished.</span> <span id="s346">So he says, ‘No, it – it’s permissible.</span> <span id="s347">And he knows that, uhh, a rabbi in England permits it.’</span> <span id="s348">So, you know I, ehr, I wasn’t, I wouldn’t I mean to go to ask a local rabbi a question like this.</span> <span id="s349">I mean, you know, you didn’t feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s350">And, my wife at one time worked for the OU (inaudible) she worked for the OU and we used to get the Jew – they had that magazine, ‘Jewish Life.’</span> <span id="s351">And I even think that I once saw they have some article by Rabbi Brody who was the chief Rabbi and I decided I’ll write to Rabbi Brody a letter and he, uhh, wrote what the din is.</span> <span id="s352">I mean, to my wife was a-but me, it started (drops voice – inaudible whisper) I mean, how do you take it.</span> <span id="s353">It, is it a sins if not, I can’t do it, and all (inaudible) besides the religious aspect of it, also psychological, also mean, it’s not an easy – first of all, when he told me that, we’ll never have children, I – I would say it was like the second the time was when I found out my parents are gone.</span> <span id="s354">I- I was, I was, also totally devastated.</span> <span id="s355">By then, you know, it’s like -</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: You changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: I changed.</span> <span id="s358">That’s why I say, you don’t say the same.</span> <span id="s359">I mean, things change.</span> <span id="s360">That time I wanted already a child because I started reasoning already.</span> <span id="s361">Why did I survive?</span> <span id="s362">I mean, the time that I’m gonna bring another generation?</span> <span id="s363">What was the purpose of my survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well, it, before I didn’t think this way.</span> <span id="s366">I had another way of thinking.</span> <span id="s367">I mean, you don’t want to know (inaudible) but then you change.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: You mean, you felt that everything would end with you.</span> <span id="s369">And you would be the only member of your family -</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Right.</span> <span id="s371">Right.</span> <span id="s372">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s373">So, so again, so if this was the purpose (needs translation) will this satisfy me.</span> <span id="s374">There was a lot of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: So what happened?</span> <span id="s376">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: So, I wrote – I decided I’ll write to this Rabbi Brody.</span> <span id="s378">I got a reply that he cannot answer (this?)</span> <span id="s379">I should go to (inaudible) Rabbi Soloveitchik.</span> <span id="s380">And I said to my wife, look, that’s one thing, that if I EVER do that, this is something that this must stay strictly confidential.</span> <span id="s381">You don’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s382">Not to your mother – her father wasn’t alive any more, to nobody.</span> <span id="s383">This is something that’s got to be between the two of us, and the doctor.</span> <span id="s384">I don’t want – should be nobody.</span> <span id="s385">So, and, while I was waiting for the reply, from Rabbi Soloveitchik, ya, so I went and wrote to Rabbi Soloveitchik...then I found out that she had a discussion with a girl friend and, and she just told her that, that we are considering (his voice drops) artificial insemination.</span> <span id="s386">And, well, after that, I got a reply that I should come that and that date, to Yeshiva University and Rabbi Sovoleitchik will see me.</span> <span id="s387">But once she had blurted it out, I said, look, now (inaudible) if there’s gonna be one person, that is gonna know about us (grapples for words) that shouldn’t then the whole thing is over .</span> <span id="s388">And I said, so I don’t know what the, eh, the din is, but I heard sometimes they did allow, some – I mean, this wasn’t to me, ‘cause it was already immaterial.</span> <span id="s389">Because the same thing was with the, with the abortion laws, if I, used to figure and start talking about abortion I used to say to my wife it’s like this: IF I know that the child will never know that he’s adopted, I wouldn’t be against it.</span> <span id="s390">But, if not, I mean, I felt it’s not gonna – am I gonna support the (needs translation) but the thing is, that this was (inaudible) like I used to say, that what you don’t know, don’t hurt.</span> <span id="s391">Because, now we went to Steven Weiss first.</span> <span id="s392">We went to counseling, (inaudible) and they asking the same question also.</span> <span id="s393">‘Would I tell him’ and I said, in my opinion, I said I would not.</span> <span id="s394">That I feel that if the child don’t know, and if it’s raised – so she brought a, suppose he’s gonna find out – or it is gonna find out through somebody else, what are you gonna do?</span> <span id="s395">Well, it is a valid question.</span> <span id="s396">I wouldn’t say no, but I felt that, ‘if you don’t know.’</span> <span id="s397">So anyway, they refused us on account of because I was too old by then.</span> <span id="s398">You know, I was about forty when I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Refused to allow you to adopt?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Ya, because I was too old.</span> <span id="s401">They said they wouldn’t give me.</span> <span id="s402">I mean, they should give me, you see, you know, they had an agency there -</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Steven Wise, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s405">So they – when they said that I was already too old.</span> <span id="s406">I mean, that was at least the official refusal.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: You think it might have been because of the way you answered them?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Maybe, maybe other things.</span> <span id="s409">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s410">They saw maybe I didn’t see things the way my wife saw.</span> <span id="s411">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s412">Anyhow, this was – so – it couldn’t be started privately.</span> <span id="s413">And I sort of accepted –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: in the late ‘50’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: You were 24 when the war ended in ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Right...I was 30 when I got married...my son was born in ’62...I mean the one that I adopted...his birthday was the first day Chol Hamod Pesach...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: So you adopted...privately...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I was able, we got a lawyer...he was a crook...finally we got a child...and we had to go Chol Hamod.</span> <span id="s420">We got the word maybe the first day after (Pesach)...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: You have one child?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: One child.</span> <span id="s423">So, of course, I came around as far as this.</span> <span id="s424">I figured (inaudible or translate word) if you adopt, and everybody around you knows how you gonna keep it a secret.</span> <span id="s425">I mean, if I would – have the means, to pack up and go somewhere I’m not known, I felt it would be better for me for the whole situation.</span> <span id="s426">It so happens with the child we ran into something is wrong there.</span> <span id="s427">He was fine when he was young, nobody saw anything.</span> <span id="s428">But when he – we gave him a yeshiva – and he was – and I wanted him to be in a Yiddish speaking Yeshiva on Eastern Parkway (YEP), and I would say, by eight – nine years I hear trouble with learning disabilities...in the beginning, I took it as laziness...but I really didn’t know to what extent things were going on in the school...the school then, wasn’t at the level that they should have been...but they knew he was troubled in certain ways...I moved from East Flatbush...to...Sheepshead Bay...and a friend (son’s classmate) came for Shabbas...and tells me...(my son) stays in the hall a whole day.</span> <span id="s429">‘What do you mean he’s in the hall the whole day?</span> <span id="s430">‘He disturbs the class so the teacher sends him out.’</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So you ask, ‘Why didn’t you tell me?”</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Ya – but I heard that, so Sunday right away I go right down to the Yeshiva, ‘What’s going on here, I heard so and so - ?’</span> <span id="s433">‘We... we can’t keep him in class, he yells out,’ so I said, ‘So how come nobody called me up to tell me look they have a problem with my son?’</span> <span id="s434">There was nobody to talk to...I’m not blaming them, but things were bad, you know, so we started ourselves with counseling, and go for counseling, alright in the beginning, had a problem with my wife, she wouldn’t go to counseling, you know, she was worried about ‘what people gonna think of me’ and she was willing to give him up and that’s all, ‘cause, you know she’s a German, ahhh, type of Jew.</span> <span id="s435">And her, (inaudible) there was more important, you know, the ‘looks’ what people are gonna think of her, is more important than – and I used to have arguments with her, ‘What the hell do you care what people gonna think?’</span> <span id="s436">I mean, we have a sick child here.</span> <span id="s437">Finally we had to go.</span> <span id="s438">We went for counseling and then, we had the – all the counselors, we had the religious counselors...so then this doctor, he said that (inaudible) is coming out with a special school with, like for, this type of children.</span> <span id="s439">And we got him into that school.</span> <span id="s440">But it didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s441">And they closed down.</span> <span id="s442">And he started (doing?)</span> <span id="s443">– he had some teachers that he liked.</span> <span id="s444">And he did not bad, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: What was his disability?</span> <span id="s446">What couldn’t he do?</span> <span id="s447">He couldn’t read?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: The trick is, he couldn’t concentrate.</span> <span id="s449">Actually, the thing was that I saw that he knew, but he just wouldn’t admit it.</span> <span id="s450">He wouldn’t do us the satisfaction (inaudible) Like you take something, I used to learn with him chumash, so he would go along.</span> <span id="s451">And my wife, she handled the other, you know, like the social studies, this and that.</span> <span id="s452">And she would sit with him, and (needs translation) you ask him a minute later like he never heard of these things.</span> <span id="s453">Like he never heard of these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: He could have a conversation with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Oh...yea, but he – but once you see, when like I say, from the beginning I didn’t realize that I deal with – that I deal with – that there’s some kind of sickness involved.</span> <span id="s456">I thought he got lazy, so I got stern with him and this and that.</span> <span id="s457">So, the more angry, if I’ll punish him with something it got worse.</span> <span id="s458">You think that you punish somebody so they’ll learn, they’ll know better, and this case, it worked just the opposite.</span> <span id="s459">The more he was punished, the worse it turned.</span> <span id="s460">So, finally, what happened is...we went to – for counseling.</span> <span id="s461">I went quite a while for counseling.</span> <span id="s462">I the meantime he was like 12, bar mitzvah’s coming up, we start make plans for bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s463">So, I realize you can’t force him already by then and I said, ‘Sam, what do you want?</span> <span id="s464">Do you want a weekend bar mitzvah, do you want this – ‘ He wants a weekend bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s465">Because, I said, ‘you know for a weekend bar mitzvah because for a weekend bar mitzvah you may have to learn to lain, and so and so’ (inaudible) it doesn’t have to be a weekend ‘No,’ he wants to have a weekend bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s466">So, you know you have to make it at least more than a year at a time had it in Belle Harbor, Washington Hotel and we engaged a rabbi to teach him the reading.</span> <span id="s467">And I saw, when I ever wanted to listen to something, it was like, maybe, yah, and then we went to this counselor and he started to say, ‘maybe it’s too much for him?</span> <span id="s468">Maybe he can’t take it.’</span> <span id="s469">So I said, ‘Look,’ so, again, you want, gornish, I mean, I said, ‘I don’t care, but I got my nephew to do the reading and so one, so he’ll say the haftorah.</span> <span id="s470">It was like two weeks before the bar mitzvah, and I went with him to this rabbi that gave him the instructions and he hardly knew what to say.</span> <span id="s471">The rabbi tells ‘Look, don’t be afraid (inaudible) he knows most of it and do you think that people are going to care how he says it?</span> <span id="s472">So, just let it run as it goes and so on.</span> <span id="s473">Well, we are a little, uh, well sure enough when the (inaudible) they call him up, and he said by the way it’s going to be this week’s translation we picked a small haftorah...so, he said haftorah with the brachos that everybody opened their mouth.</span> <span id="s474">In other words, he knew.</span> <span id="s475">But somehow he wouldn’t show – whether in spite, or he didn’t trust – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s476">But everybody was surprised the way he said it.</span> <span id="s477">And the same thing I noticed – things that he wanted to know – songs with the English, with the Hebrew, we used to send him to Camp Aguda he used to go in the summers.</span> <span id="s478">We be sending him to Israel...to (inaudible – yeshiva in Israel – illegible in original transcription...) twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You sent him to pretty religious places.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes, because, I tried...I learned one thing.</span> <span id="s481">The more you put in, the more of a chance that some – I would take the example from myselves.</span> <span id="s482">I mean, from what I’ve been through in the war years, in Russia, and in the Army, and me, it was so baked in, you know, it so ingrained that Saturday I would work, you know, and I would sing the Shabbasdica meals to myselves.</span> <span id="s483">It was in me.</span> <span id="s484">A lot of things.</span> <span id="s485">And I figured that if you put in, there’s a chance something will remain.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Where did he go to high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: He went...to already a special school...(MT trying to think of the name of the school) Mandelwitz – principal of the religious part of the Yeshiva...so he went to this school and that’s where he finished.</span> <span id="s488">He got, like a, equivalency diploma.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: What became of him after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: What became?</span> <span id="s491">No good.</span> <span id="s492">No good.</span> <span id="s493">Ehr, ehr.</span> <span id="s494">I had to throw him out from the house.</span> <span id="s495">As a matter of fact, this lady when we went for counseling to this, their was a Rabbi ?</span> <span id="s496">Helbistom?</span> <span id="s497">– Avenue M in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s498">He was part of the Torah Umesorah and later, when they closed down, I kept going to him for counseling.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: He was a psychologist?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: He’s a psychologist.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: He lives in Queens?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No.</span> <span id="s503">That time he lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s504">He moved since.</span> <span id="s505">Avenue M was his office.</span> <span id="s506">He had a little ?</span> <span id="s507">sheikel?</span> <span id="s508">there and in there he had his office.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: What was he?</span> <span id="s510">He was a counselor?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: He was a counselor.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Psychologist?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Psychologist, ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Thanks G-d, as far as with – somethings got progressively worse with school, and with everything.</span> <span id="s516">And, he got bad.</span> <span id="s517">It changed a certain things that was impossible.</span> <span id="s518">And he said to us one thing.</span> <span id="s519">‘Throw him out of the house cause you have no other choice.</span> <span id="s520">Throw him out of the house.’</span> <span id="s521">He says, ‘He’s no good, and - .</span> <span id="s522">And, you know, you don’t do things like this so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: No, not if you’re the parent.</span> <span id="s524">Easy for someone else to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Exactly!</span> <span id="s526">So we struggle.</span> <span id="s527">We struggled.</span> <span id="s528">Once.</span> <span id="s529">We had to go for a weekend bar mitzvah and he was home for Shabbas.</span> <span id="s530">He was already (inaudible) He must have been at least 16 years old or so.</span> <span id="s531">And we come home Saturday night, and my wife started looking around – she takes a look in the oven and she noticed that the oven was used...so she said, ‘You know, he used the oven today.</span> <span id="s532">That the oven was – ‘ ‘Ya,’ she starts yelling, ‘he moves out today...(inaudible).’</span> <span id="s533">We started looking around.</span> <span id="s534">I mean, of course we had left him food...so I go down and I look in the garbage and sure enough I find two empty trays there like a, I don’t know, whatever these trefe prepared, dishes...Chinese food...I don’t remember...I mean, I saw that there was a big problem...(needs translation)...alright, he used the – maybe he didn’t use dishes, but the spoons he used and we have to kasher (inaudible).</span> <span id="s535">And then, I remember once, Yom Kippur, he goes with me to shul, and then, all of a sudden he disappears from shul.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: He must have been then, about 16, 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q:: And this, what happened when you came home...the oven – he was older?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: This was before that.</span> <span id="s540">This was before...I mean, I didn’t leave him home alone after that.</span> <span id="s541">This was maybe a year later...and he disappeared, so I looked around and I didn’t see him.</span> <span id="s542">When we came home – Ya, and he used to take money.</span> <span id="s543">Whatever he could lay a hand on.</span> <span id="s544">He would take money.</span> <span id="s545">So, finally, erev Yom Kippur we went to shul.</span> <span id="s546">Whatever had, I tried not to have too much money.</span> <span id="s547">But you have to have some money on you.</span> <span id="s548">So I locked up in my, like a – in an office cabinet, you know.</span> <span id="s549">I locked it up with a key.</span> <span id="s550">I come home from shul, Yom Kippur (inaudible) I see he broke open this thing.</span> <span id="s551">He took whatever there was.</span> <span id="s552">And he went some place.</span> <span id="s553">(inaudible) and I gave him a stern warning, and said, ‘Look.</span> <span id="s554">If anything like this happens again, that’s it!</span> <span id="s555">You have no room in this house.</span> <span id="s556">I mean, if I can’t leave you, and know that there was – and sure enough, a short time later, I come home and I see walls and, the, the, and the – I mean, the walls were punched in.</span> <span id="s557">Holes in the walls, the doors, and this.</span> <span id="s558">(inaudible) a lot of damage.</span> <span id="s559">I don’t know if he was – I could never find anything on him.</span> <span id="s560">(inaudible) And that must be shortly after that, and I went down – and I had prepared myself – so already, a lock I went downstairs.</span> <span id="s561">I changed the lock outside.</span> <span id="s562">And he came there like 2 o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s563">We don’t let him in anymore.</span> <span id="s564">And the next day I went to work, you see, he rang the bell, he saw there was no answer, - I went to work.</span> <span id="s565">And he thinks he wants to come in and take clothes.</span> <span id="s566">My wife wouldn’t let him in.</span> <span id="s567">So he started to knock at the door, break down things, so she called police.</span> <span id="s568">The police came and she let them in, and he came up with them, and she showed him, ‘Look, this is the kind of (inaudible) he left us.</span> <span id="s569">I, uh, we can’t keep him any more.’</span> <span id="s570">The policeman told him, ‘Look, you want your clothes there, pick up where you can, and go and don’t you ever come back to this place again.’</span> <span id="s571">And, that, but, we didn’t wash off our hands from this.</span> <span id="s572">My cousin told me, ‘Look, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s573">He is a sick person.</span> <span id="s574">Alright, he can’t live in the house is one thing.</span> <span id="s575">Cause he’s a sick person.</span> <span id="s576">So you can’t just abandon him completely.’</span> <span id="s577">And we had, like money, that uh, I would give him let’s say, birthday, this or whatever, that I had him count.</span> <span id="s578">You know, I always tried to interest him in things.</span> <span id="s579">He had a nice couple of thousand dollars in his name.</span> <span id="s580">And, you know, before, let’s say two, three years before, any little thing I tell him, he going – ‘I’m going away, and I’m never coming back.’</span> <span id="s581">Later on I said, ‘Fine.</span> <span id="s582">Good.</span> <span id="s583">Pack up and go.’</span> <span id="s584">I said, ‘As a matter of fact, I’ll give you all your money, and GO!</span> <span id="s585">.</span> <span id="s586">I don’t want to see you any more.’</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Do you feel you didn’t love him?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: It was hard then.</span> <span id="s589">Maybe that, that we didn’t love him.</span> <span id="s590">I think that by then I realized that there’s something wrong with him.</span> <span id="s591">I wouldn’t say so.</span> <span id="s592">You know, there’s one thing.</span> <span id="s593">We tried to think maybe because we – Ya, if we told him that he’s adopted, maybe, yet, I don’t know, three-five – I don’t think you could understand what it means.</span> <span id="s594">But we – finally we were advised telling him at early stage tell him, and he never showed any concern, whether adopted, or not adopted.</span> <span id="s595">But when we moved – so apparently this didn’t bother him, because when he got new friends, he told them he’s adopted.</span> <span id="s596">So they didn’t want to believe him.</span> <span id="s597">So he called the whole gang in front of the house and calls, ‘Daddy,’ I come up on the porch, ‘Isn’t it true that I’m adopted?’</span> <span id="s598">I say, ‘Yes.’</span> <span id="s599">‘See?’</span> <span id="s600">He told me he didn’t care.</span> <span id="s601">I mean, there was something – you say maybe he would be ashamed or concerned.</span> <span id="s602">He wasn’t.</span> <span id="s603">But when the counseling, during the counseling, you know, they try to get to it.</span> <span id="s604">They never could come close to him.</span> <span id="s605">To anything.</span> <span id="s606">I remember when he was younger, and when he went to his first doctor, so, he mostly would play games with them.</span> <span id="s607">So, as long as he played games, everything was fine.</span> <span id="s608">He didn’t get out much.</span> <span id="s609">But when he get down to serious talk, he closed up.</span> <span id="s610">And later, he would tell me, ‘What’s it his business – why should he ask me all these questions.’</span> <span id="s611">So, I said, ‘You know, Sam, he wants to – he’s trying to be a nice guy, he wants to know what the problem is.’</span> <span id="s612">He would never open up.</span> <span id="s613">Nobody could come close to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: So what’s the story today?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: So the story, is, the story is finally, then he was out, I gave him little by little his money.</span> <span id="s616">What did he do – he goes no other place but the – there’s a Golden Inn Motel in Sheepshead Bay, he paid forty dollars a night or something like this, that goes back a nice number of years already.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So he used up the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: He used up the money very fast and he comes to me.</span> <span id="s619">And I said, ‘I’m sorry,’ I said.</span> <span id="s620">‘I told you.</span> <span id="s621">You, you spend – ‘ Finally I tried to get him a room.</span> <span id="s622">Like a furnished room.</span> <span id="s623">So I gave him, he went and took the check, he didn’t want to stay there.</span> <span id="s624">He enlisted in the Army.</span> <span id="s625">One day he comes, he enlisted in the Army.</span> <span id="s626">Fine.</span> <span id="s627">I was very happy...</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: He was a strong fellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: He’s.</span> <span id="s630">he’s ah, he’s very muscular, you know, and all that.</span> <span id="s631">So they took him right away, and I didn’t think that they gonna take him.</span> <span id="s632">But apparently they’re not too bright there, I guess...he’s very good looking.</span> <span id="s633">Believe me, you talk to him , you’ll never know there’s something wrong with him.</span> <span id="s634">He can tell you jobs he’s doing, and how important he is.</span> <span id="s635">So, and I was happy.</span> <span id="s636">First of all, I wouldn’t have to – because even I threw him out of the house, I didn’t sleep much.</span> <span id="s637">I was going, ‘where’s he sleeping, what’s he eating, what’s a this – then he used to come around, and I said, ‘Look, Sam, you wanna eat supper once?</span> <span id="s638">Anytime.</span> <span id="s639">But you cannot sleep in my house’ I said, ‘this is final.’</span> <span id="s640">Cause he tried, you know, like, eh, you threw him out the door, he would try to come in the window.</span> <span id="s641">All kinds of gimmicks.</span> <span id="s642">I said, ‘Forget it.’</span> <span id="s643">You know.</span> <span id="s644">And at one time even, I took out an Order of Protection.</span> <span id="s645">To keep him out of the house.</span> <span id="s646">‘Cause I realized that he cannot live with us.</span> <span id="s647">This was one thing.</span> <span id="s648">You know, help him is one thing.</span> <span id="s649">But have him in my house was impossible.</span> <span id="s650">So he enlisted in the army, and after like two, three months, he calls me, ‘Hello, Daddy.’</span> <span id="s651">‘What’s the matter?’</span> <span id="s652">‘I’m coming home.’</span> <span id="s653">‘What do you mean, you’re coming home?’</span> <span id="s654">‘Well, the food here, it’s not kosher, I spoke to the Chaplain, and - .’</span> <span id="s655">All of a sudden he became kosher, and things like this.</span> <span id="s656">And he’s gonna come back, and he’s gonna go enroll in college and things like that he’s gonna do.</span> <span id="s657">Well, I knew the whole talk is, is nothing.</span> <span id="s658">But I couldn’t stop it either.</span> <span id="s659">I said, ‘Sam, try to stay there, maybe – ‘ ‘You know, but you don’t understand, they don’t – they send me out.’</span> <span id="s660">I mean, they realize - as a matter of fact he go his discharge paper.</span> <span id="s661">It was an honorable discharge, but, I remember like, it said there something, like, ‘marginal’ – he’s not unproductive or something, that was it.</span> <span id="s662">They finally realize that they can’t do much with him.</span> <span id="s663">So he came home again.</span> <span id="s664">And he thought that he’s gonna walk right into my house, and I said, ‘Sam, forget it.</span> <span id="s665">I told you, you cannot stay in it.’</span> <span id="s666">We got him a furnished room.</span> <span id="s667">And my cousin always used to tell me, ‘why don’t you file for the social security disability, this, that – And, I, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s668">First of all I was working, and I know it’s gonna take a lot of time.</span> <span id="s669">And I didn’t have time.</span> <span id="s670">And I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s671">But when I went on (inaudible) I lost my job, and I went on social security.</span> <span id="s672">And even then, I didn’t do anything for maybe two – three years.</span> <span id="s673">But, finally I said, it’s no more – and he didn’t really work.</span> <span id="s674">He didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s675">And I said, ‘What can I lose?’</span> <span id="s676">I went down to social security myselves and I told him that this and this is the case.</span> <span id="s677">I support him, and I can’t do it on what I get on social security, I cannot.</span> <span id="s678">And they file paper, and all that – they refused all the time until it came to a administer the lower judge.</span> <span id="s679">So, the lower judge , when I came in and he would go the papers and I came in there, he says, ’You did a good job with him.’</span> <span id="s680">So I thought he’s trying to give me the needle there.</span> <span id="s681">So I said, ‘Look (inaudible).’</span> <span id="s682">He says, ‘No, I’m very serious.</span> <span id="s683">I mean all you did for him.</span> <span id="s684">That you tried everything possible.’</span> <span id="s685">And he says, while we’re here, we’re gonna –</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: I think you had a lot of patience with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: I had a choice?</span> <span id="s688">What should I do?</span> <span id="s689">The only thing is, to throw him out and wash you hands of him.</span> <span id="s690">We couldn’t.</span> <span id="s691">We couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: I would say, you say you had no choice.</span> <span id="s693">You’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s694">Somebody not Jewish, they wouldn’t have said, ‘Oh, he’s my son!’</span> <span id="s695">They would have said, ‘Goodbye.’</span> <span id="s696">Right away.</span> <span id="s697">They wouldn’t have put money in the bank for him -</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Well, when we started putting money, he wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s699">You know...it didn’t interest him.</span> <span id="s700">He just needed money to spend it now.</span> <span id="s701">The rest didn’t interest him.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: So, who were his friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Now, don’t ask me because I don’t me ‘cause I don’t know them.</span> <span id="s704">See, I mean, he is now 28...</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: I mean, when he lived with you.</span> <span id="s706">Did he have bad friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: In the beginning, as a matter of fact, no.</span> <span id="s708">He found friends, like, let’s say, his type of friends.</span> <span id="s709">My wife used to say, ‘How can he be any good if he, uh, what can learn from these friends.</span> <span id="s710">Look at the friends...’ I said, ‘Look, it’s not that these friends are bad.</span> <span id="s711">This this is what you look for.’</span> <span id="s712">I mean, he well, this came as a natural process by, because.</span> <span id="s713">you see, like I said with the bar mitzvah and then with the school, from the beginning, (needs translation) some used to call him, what the homework was, and so on.</span> <span id="s714">Whether he knew it because my wife worked so hard with him.</span> <span id="s715">But later on, you know he went to a lower class.</span> <span id="s716">And then, you know, all his friends grew up, went to high school (inaudible) and he was further down, down and out.</span> <span id="s717">He had nothing in common any more with his original friends.</span> <span id="s718">So, I don’t know what kind of friends now.</span> <span id="s719">I don’t even know where he lives exactly.</span> <span id="s720">The last time – and that was my biggest problem – every Monday and Thursday he had no place where to stay because noise, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s721">Every time I was busy looking for him, just a shelter.</span> <span id="s722">I didn’t care much – but he should have a shelter...</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: But it’s very hard in a Jewish community for people to talk about their children.</span> <span id="s724">When you don’t know how -</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: This I’ll tell you, I didn’t think much – I didn’t have as much as a problem, because I say like this: ‘I don’t care what people think about me.’</span> <span id="s726">I mean, this is my nature.</span> <span id="s727">I say, ‘Look, this is what I am.</span> <span id="s728">You like me – good.</span> <span id="s729">You don’t like me?</span> <span id="s730">–</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Let me go back to when you first came here.</span> <span id="s732">You were on the boat.</span> <span id="s733">You talked, I suppose, with your friends, -</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You thought about America?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yes, but not too deeply.</span> <span id="s737">I’ll tell you, we didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s738">The only thing I remember, which made an impression, I was in the D.P. camp, and there was Rabbi Lookstein, and so he painted the American Jew.</span> <span id="s739">I’ll never forget that he says, the custom was that every Jew had a ( illegible in original transcription copy) in shul.</span> <span id="s740">Know what I mean by a (illegible in original Transcription copy) in shul(needs translation) It was a long bench, but you get an assigned seat (needs translation) I mean I didn’t understand what it meant.</span> <span id="s741">Whether it meant that all the shuls were mortgaged.</span> <span id="s742">(needs translation).</span> <span id="s743">And another thing, when, already from the HIAS, they had a man like that was in Bremerhaven...when we get the assignments for the boat.</span> <span id="s744">So he had a speech, and he started telling, ‘Do me a favor,’ he says, ‘don’t tell your relatives that you coming,’ he says, ‘on the boat, ‘cause when you arrive they may have moved by then.’</span> <span id="s745">...he meant in a joke but –</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: To every joke, there’s a little bit of truth...you mean, you were already afraid that the people here, even if they send you an affidavit, they weren’t so excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s748">And that turned out to be truth.</span> <span id="s749">Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s751">What do you mean”</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Why”.</span> <span id="s753">What I mean.</span> <span id="s754">You see, the papers were sent to me by an uncle – not the uncle that was suppose to be with my brother, incidentally – it was sent by another uncle, actually he was married to my mother’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: How long was he here in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: He was here a long time – he came before the war.</span> <span id="s757">As a matter of fact, he came before the war to take his wife over and she couldn’t make it because she had glaucoma.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: But you knew him?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Oh, yeh, I knew him...I saw him once or twice...he was the man, he sent me the papers and a son of his, at the time was a rich man.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: That’s who came to pick you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No.</span> <span id="s762">Other cousins came to pick me up...he made the headlines in the Times one day.</span> <span id="s763">He kidnapped his son, you know, he divorced (inaudible) and he run away with him to Israel...that must have been in the late ‘40’s or early ‘50’s...so he happened to be a rich man, and he of course signed the papers, so the main papers I remember I still have some place...so I didn’t care much about who came...but this uncle that was married to my mother’s sister...he was a very nice man so he sent me the papers.</span> <span

id="s773">Wherever I was, I never forgot that there was a Jew in me.</span> <span id="s774">And I never forgot the lifestyle in the home at each holiday.</span> <span id="s775">Even to this day, any

id="s848">A: They didn’t bother much.</span> <span id="s849">As much as I can remember they came aboard, and I don’t even think that we had any papers.</span> <span id="s850">I think the HIAS must have been somebody from the HIAS a representative, and that he had all the papers.</span> <span id="s851">And they just stamped them.</span> <span id="s852">As far as I can remember, because I still have the paper that I got coming off the boat.</span> <span id="s853">I think I still have the steamship ticket.</span> <span id="s854">I keep it as a souvenir.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: You know, there are these survivors, that made it really big, you know, you see their names...how do you think they did it?</span> <span id="s856">They came to America, they had nothing.</span> <span id="s857">Then they became millionaires.</span> <span id="s858">They became real estate builders.</span> <span id="s859">Where do you think that they got the strength to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Well, ehr, I would say, it takes – there’s different types of people.</span> <span id="s861">That’s a good question which I many times – you see like I, myselves, was never dreaming of big monies.</span> <span id="s862">It was never important to me.</span> <span id="s863">I was in business too.</span> <span id="s864">I was never successful.</span> <span id="s865">But – because I was in the needle trade and that was – first we started the business in the time from the Korean war.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: What did you start?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: I was in the – I started – I learned shirts home.</span> <span id="s868">To make shirts home.</span> <span id="s869">But a home is – we didn’t have no electricity in the town.</span> <span id="s870">I didn’t know to already handle an electric machine.</span> <span id="s871">So when I came here, the first job I got was this uncle that send me the papers.</span> <span id="s872">His mehutten was making a better quality shirt.</span> <span id="s873">It was on ?</span> <span id="s874">Herzal?</span> <span id="s875">and Dumont?</span> <span id="s876">Like a stall.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Brownsville?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yeh.</span> <span id="s879">I was living in East Flatbush.</span> <span id="s880">I was living in 52nd Street with an aunt that was here a long time in America and Lenox Road.</span> <span id="s881">And I used to walk to work.</span> <span id="s882">And he got me the job there, to sew shirts.</span> <span id="s883">I had to learn how to operate an electric machine.</span> <span id="s884">And I wasn’t much of a (needs translation) but I was young, and I learned fast, especially the American way.</span> <span id="s885">And I started with $35.00 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s886">And, after a couple of months, I saw that I surpassed all the other workers there as far as production.</span> <span id="s887">And I could see, and I knew, that they made more money than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: I was young, and there, the older ladies there mostly.</span> <span id="s890">I could see what they produced, and what I produced, you know.</span> <span id="s891">Alright, of course, it took a couple of months, so in, like after – Pesach, I started going to night school.</span> <span id="s892">And I met there, there I first met up with some other newcomers.</span> <span id="s893">The greeners, so to speak.</span> <span id="s894">‘Cause otherwise I didn’t see much in my neighborhood where I lived, didn’t see much.</span> <span id="s895">But once I came to school, I met -</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: What school was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: It was on Eastern Parkway.</span> <span id="s898">I don’t remember the name...</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Night school?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Night school to learn English, ya.</span> <span id="s901">So then we start talking, so this one tells mehe makes so much, this one makes so much, and I only make $35.00.</span> <span id="s902">So I went and I once talk to him and I says, ‘I want a raise.’</span> <span id="s903">‘No,’ he can’t give me, and this, that.</span> <span id="s904">I say, ‘Don’t wanna give me a raise,’ I says, ‘Next time I’m gonna leave ya.’</span> <span id="s905">And one of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: This was the mehutten?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: I’m a mehutten to my uncle.</span> <span id="s908">Well, I spoke to my uncle about it.</span> <span id="s909">I said, ‘Look, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: So, you went into business?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: No, not right then.</span> <span id="s912">So, one guy there from – that I met, he told me, he took me the job, and right away I made $55.00 a week...</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Not bad.</span> <span id="s915">Especially at my (inaudible)...so, but the needle trade, I worked maybe, I don’t how many weeks and it got slow.</span> <span id="s916">So it got slow, so I started looking for job, as soon as somebody else told me about another job when I came to a job and I made over $100.00 a week.</span> <span id="s917">This was in 1947 – 48.</span> <span id="s918">It was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s919">And they made the Eisenhowers – they used to work for the Army.</span> <span id="s920">The Eisenhower jackets...mine came out beautiful...and I made good money.</span> <span id="s921">But again the same thing.</span> <span id="s922">The season only lasts so long...and I remember the union guy came up.</span> <span id="s923">Walked over to everybody asking about did you join, do you have a book...to me he didn’t come.</span> <span id="s924">So I didn’t know what that meant...when the season finished,,,the boss comes over to me and says, if you want, you can stay on until we open the next season.</span> <span id="s925">I have odds and ends to fix up...I – ‘okay’...I went down to $40 or $50 I don’t remember...then came a holiday...and he didn’t pay me for the holiday.</span> <span id="s926">So this bothered me.</span> <span id="s927">As a week worker, he paid them all...me he didn’t pay for the holiday.</span> <span id="s928">So this annoyed me...so I left him.</span> <span id="s929">And again I found another job...I met a friend...and we planning to go into business...</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: But eventually you sent into business.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Eventually, I went into the shirt business.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: How was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: I didn’t do too good ‘cause it was in a bad location, I guess.</span> <span id="s934">It was in Washington Manor in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s935">I didn’t have enough work.</span> <span id="s936">So what we do, we started taking in blouses.</span> <span id="s937">In order to fill in.</span> <span id="s938">Once we start getting blouses, how many blouses can you make in a small place...so finally we went out and bought a small factory all the way down in East New York.</span> <span id="s939">So, we were both single.</span> <span id="s940">And...we made a living...we work and work, and one guy didn’t pay us, and we start putting in money to pay the workers and finally, he went bankrupt...finally, he (my partner) was in the National Guard...and they started talking that his unit is going to be drafted to be sent away to Korea.</span> <span id="s941">At the same time I met my wife and started making plans to get married and I figured that what we drawed there in that business, can’t get married on it.</span> <span id="s942">So we decided, look, he wanted out too, and we gave up the business.</span> <span id="s943">And, so, I started looking for jobs...I could have had ten jobs (inaudible – work on Shabbas?)</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s946">I didn’t mention.</span> <span id="s947">In other words, I’ll see, if they like me, they’ll keep me.</span> <span id="s948">Like once I remember I had lined up a job.</span> <span id="s949">They like me.</span> <span id="s950">He says, ‘You know what?</span> <span id="s951">We have another factory in Utica, New York.</span> <span id="s952">And every Friday we go out there.</span> <span id="s953">I would you to come along to see our plant there.’</span> <span id="s954">I said, ‘ When we gonna be back?’</span> <span id="s955">‘Oh, by 8, 9 0’clock.’</span> <span id="s956">And that was like before Pesach...and I said, ‘No, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s957">I would have to be back Friday before sundown, because I don’t work on Saturday.’</span> <span id="s958">‘Oh, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s959">You can’t work for us.’</span> <span id="s960">So, (inaudible) we take it like this.</span> <span id="s961">Finally, it was like a week before Pesach and I answered an ad and I come up to a place, and...I told them the truth.</span> <span id="s962">I made blouses and this and that.</span> <span id="s963">So he asked me about this.</span> <span id="s964">‘Don’t worry,’ he said, ‘I’ll teach you.</span> <span id="s965">I mean, whatever you have to know, I’ll teach you.</span> <span id="s966">I see that you understand the business.</span> <span id="s967">I’ll teach you.</span> <span id="s968">Alright?</span> <span id="s969">Come in Monday.’</span> <span id="s970">So I said, ‘No, ah, I’m in the process of moving,’ which it wasn’t all the way a lie ‘cause I was in the process of moving, but I wanted to postpone it ‘til after Pesach.</span> <span id="s971">I didn’t want to tell him that next week is Pesach.</span> <span id="s972">So he says, ‘Come in Monday.’</span> <span id="s973">I said, ‘No,’ he says, ‘I need you, this and - He tried to explain to me that there were two brother – in – laws owning this, and the other fellow was running the factory and he was running the other department there, and he needs somebody badly.</span> <span id="s974">I said, how can I?</span> <span id="s975">So I had no choice.</span> <span id="s976">I said, ‘I’ll tell you, there’s another thing.</span> <span id="s977">If I come in early, I don’t work on the Jewish holidays.’</span> <span id="s978">I think Thursday and Friday must have been...Pesach...he says, ‘that’s okay, come in for the three days and then we’ll see.’</span> <span id="s979">So I came in, I worked the three days, and then of course, I and I come back Monday and there the girls...came in early before the boss...they all looking, ‘What you doing here?’</span> <span id="s980">I said, ‘What do you mean?’</span> <span id="s981">‘Oh, we thought you gone already.’</span> <span id="s982">‘Why?’</span> <span id="s983">‘Oh, we had here so many men already, nobody lasted more than two days.</span> <span id="s984">And you lasted three days so we figured you gone already, too.’</span> <span id="s985">So I said, ‘No, I don’t work on Jewish holidays.’</span> <span id="s986">So, then the boss comes in, calls me in and gives me my pay for the three days, and says, ‘Look.</span> <span id="s987">If you gonna stay with me, I’ll pay for the Jewish holidays too.’</span> <span id="s988">And I worked there over five years.</span> <span id="s989">He was a very, very nice man, and he paid me and so, but, again, after five and a half years...it was too hard for me, for one man to handle...everything fell on me, and I used to tell him, ‘You know, it’s too much.’</span> <span id="s990">...in the meantime, my old partner, we started talking, you know, to go into business again.</span> <span id="s991">So finally I decided I’ll quit this job and try business again.</span> <span id="s992">I figured, well, the uncle tried.</span> <span id="s993">So we tried business, this time also from the beginning, we had a very rough time.</span> <span id="s994">First of all, we didn’t go in with enough money...(needs translation) First of all, we did contracting...it was a union place, and it was all settled with the manufacturer you get so much, you pay out so much, you’re left with so much.</span> <span id="s995">So as long as he gave us enough work, it was alright.</span> <span id="s996">We could make a living from it.</span> <span id="s997">But if he got slow, we had to go fishing for work some place else.</span> <span id="s998">We go to the association, the union, they were sending you places, go here, go there.</span> <span id="s999">We would come there, let’s say, we settled for a skirt, we used to get fifty five cents.</span> <span id="s1000">We had to pay out, I don’t remember, forty three (cents) or something like this, and here they offer us forty cents for a skirt, thirty eight cents...finally we had to look for work for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1001">So we went into the better houses where we could get over a dollar for a shirt, so that was already good...he paid us, we had no problem but he didn’t pay his dues to the association...(needs translation)...the guy went out of business and one day the union comes to us, whatever he didn’t pay, we have to make good for it.</span> <span id="s1002">Then we worked for another guy, and he owed us money.</span> <span id="s1003">So, by right, if the association sent us there to take work, they were suppose to be responsible for the money.</span> <span id="s1004">They didn’t do anything, so we stopped paying out dues to the association.</span> <span id="s1005">So they threw us out...so I said, ‘alright, so I’m not a union man anymore, because we never signed anything with the union, it was only through the association.’</span> <span id="s1006">It went on for a while, and we worked, and, alright, they did nothing for us, so we worked.</span> <span id="s1007">One day, when the new season start...we start to manufacture our own jackets.</span> <span id="s1008">It was hard from the beginning with no credit, nobody knew you, it was, I remember one case where we ordered some merchandise, and they sent it out with the truck, and we were suppose to send them a check.</span> <span id="s1009">When the truck comes, ya, then he calls one morning, ‘when the truck man comes please tell him the first thing to call, it’s a very urgent matter.</span> <span id="s1010">Let him call the office.’</span> <span id="s1011">He calls the office, they tell him, ‘Don’t deliver the merchandise,’ they didn’t get the check.</span> <span id="s1012">So they wouldn’t give us – so he says he’s taking – so I says, ‘What’s the matter?’</span> <span id="s1013">So, he tells me.</span> <span id="s1014">‘You didn’t send the check.’</span> <span id="s1015">I said, ‘Look, we send you the check.’</span> <span id="s1016">So, finally give...the truckman another check, and about two days they got the original check, and they saw that we didn’t lie to them.</span> <span id="s1017">So he calls up, ‘Alright,’ they were German Jews (needs translation)...he says from now on, your credit is (inaudible)...once you had credit in one, you know, it got easier.</span> <span id="s1018">So, we started working up our business (inaudible) so all of a sudden, we started making plastic jackets, like knits, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1019">It was a good – eh, we could start working up a little.</span> <span id="s1020">But one season we can’t sell...a jacket...we start to go around to department stores, looking for styles...we saw there, beautiful jackets made in Japan.</span> <span id="s1021">The store sold them for less than what we would have to charge them.</span> <span id="s1022">In the meantime, we kept on enlarging...and all the money we made went into enlarging, and we put into equipment, and we had already a nice big place, and here business drops off...money, you couldn’t make.</span> <span id="s1023">‘Cause if you worked up a short season, and then you had to stay three months closed, until the next season...so we decided to give up.</span> <span id="s1024">I went out from the business it’s already over twenty years.</span> <span id="s1025">We finally had to give up the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: You had to give it up.</span> <span id="s1027">So what did you do in the last twenty years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: So, then I started looking for job.</span> <span id="s1029">But again, after all this experience, I mean, I wasn’t gonna become a foreman in a factory.</span> <span id="s1030">So I started looking something –</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: An operator?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Operator I gave up a long time, because I was a foreman in the other place.</span> <span id="s1033">I was a foreman, and that was a very good (inaudible) and I really learned a lot.</span> <span id="s1034">So, I started thinking, first of all, I went to F.I.T., I figured I’ll learn pattern making...but meantime I got a job as a quality control man...also, see, this was years later and Shabbas wasn’t as much of a problem and I got the job...</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: What about your wife?</span> <span id="s1036">Was she working all these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No.</span> <span id="s1038">She worked when we married like I mentioned, she worked for the OU.</span> <span id="s1039">And she worked for Barton’s for a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: What did she do for the OU?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: In the kashrut division.</span> <span id="s1042">In the office...and then she worked for Modern Tours.</span> <span id="s1043">It was a tour on the East Side...</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: So she worked, and you worked, so what did you do?</span> <span id="s1045">You worked in quality control - ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: This was before.</span> <span id="s1047">As a matter of fact, when I started the business, if my wife wouldn’t have worked, I couldn’t have think of going into business.</span> <span id="s1048">But in the beginning, I actually lived off what my wife brought home.</span> <span id="s1049">But when things got better, and we started talking for adopting a child, so she stopped.</span> <span id="s1050">That time she didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1051">She was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: You are married to her for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Thirty seven years.</span> <span id="s1054">We got married in ’52.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Remember I asked you a question –</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yah, I was coming to that about how the other people, how they – I was coming to that – that I see that (inaudible) people that money is all important to them.</span> <span id="s1057">To me it isn’t.</span> <span id="s1058">I – I mean, it’s not that I don’t want money – I was always was let’s say, striving.</span> <span id="s1059">To have a comfortable living.</span> <span id="s1060">But I never dreamt of millions.</span> <span id="s1061">It didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s1062">I saw it went so fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: What’s the most important thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: To me, it’s like now, to be able to live in comfort, without worries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: You’re retired now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: I’m retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: What do you do during the day?</span> <span id="s1068">Let’s say, you get up in the morning – describe to me just a typical day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1070">I go to shul.</span> <span id="s1071">I go to minyan.</span> <span id="s1072">Then, you see, it’s also, I help out a lot.</span> <span id="s1073">You see, this is part of it.</span> <span id="s1074">Why I retired at 62.</span> <span id="s1075">Normally I had planned to retire at 62, because also, I said, (needs translation) ‘I don’t need so much,’ I mean, G-d willing, if we be healthy, we, we feel, my wife in this respect, we agree.</span> <span id="s1076">We can manage.</span> <span id="s1077">(?</span> <span id="s1078">As a man I’ll tell you something just interesting in confident?</span> <span id="s1079">Inaudible) Is, ah, so – and, I had planned to retire at 62.</span> <span id="s1080">but, you know, I plan, but there’s somebody else here who plans differently.</span> <span id="s1081">So my boss, which I happened to have a good job, I worked there for about 13 years.</span> <span id="s1082">And, you know, we had two lofts also he had in Manhattan, and all of a sudden...they tripled his rent...so he decided to move out to New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1083">Harrison...he didn’t last a year there.</span> <span id="s1084">Apparently, I don’t know whether this was planned, because it was a good way to go into bankruptcy.</span> <span id="s1085">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1086">Funny, it was the last year, like, it’s Succos, something, he comes over to me – ‘From now on,’ he says, ‘You’ll give me every week, you’ll make out a list of petty cash what you spent, you give me a list.’</span> <span id="s1087">In other words, instead of a raise, he’ll give me like in cash – very nice of him.</span> <span id="s1088">He, in general, he didn’t throw out with money.</span> <span id="s1089">This enough, I was a little suspicious of it.</span> <span id="s1090">But then a lot of things, I saw a lot of piece goods start disappearing.</span> <span id="s1091">The end of the year, like in October of that year, all of a sudden, ya – see in the summertime I couldn’t take vacation because that’s the height of the season so, - so here I had made already plans like mid – week to go to Grossinger’s.</span> <span id="s1092">Because I would never go to Grossinger’s on Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1093">I was there once when my son was in Camp Agudah.</span> <span id="s1094">And I didn’t like the atmosphere...but mid – week, I had chance to go to Grossinger’s.</span> <span id="s1095">So, and I want to go, and he comes, ‘No, I need this and I need that,’ and I was that time supervising the sample, and we had a couple of girls making samples because the production itselves was like after the season.</span> <span id="s1096">So I didn’t want to take this, but we made samples for the following year.</span> <span id="s1097">And I said, ‘I’m sorry, I made reservations already.</span> <span id="s1098">I have to go.’</span> <span id="s1099">So I go away, and I come home from vacation, while in the night, that morning, before I was suppose to go in to work, he calls me up, ‘Mark, don’t bother going in, I’m closed up the shop.’</span> <span id="s1100">So, alright, I had this uncle, so I went there.</span> <span id="s1101">So they told me that on a Monday, people came in, and they just literally, they took the girls on the chair, they carried them away from the machine, they packed up everything (MT laughs.)</span> <span id="s1102">He had, ya, it was on Thanksgiving, I remember, usually, the Friday after Thanksgiving, some times they wouldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1103">This time he says, ‘Look, you must come in because (inaudible) insurance,’ he’s, a, - I knew the guy, he has a place, where he sells machines, and this and that – ‘for insurance purposed he has to make an inventory this, so, Myron so – so’s coming in, I – I, say, please be there on Friday.’</span> <span id="s1104">So, I come, and this guy comes, and so – he writes down everything what’s there.</span> <span id="s1105">Ahk, for insurance, for insurance.</span> <span id="s1106">So I said, ‘Was lucky the place wasn’t (inaudible) maybe he needs insurance.’</span> <span id="s1107">But he was already backing down.</span> <span id="s1108">He’s holding everything.</span> <span id="s1109">(inaudible) ‘so I have no job.’</span> <span id="s1110">I said like this.</span> <span id="s1111">‘Look, I’m approaching 62.</span> <span id="s1112">I’m planning to retire.</span> <span id="s1113">What am I gonna look then, for a new job?</span> <span id="s1114">When I came here I was in...the ‘40’s, so it was easy to get a job.</span> <span id="s1115">At 60, I said, ‘where am I gonna start looking for a job?</span> <span id="s1116">First of all, is, I’ll collect unemployment, until I – then I’ll retire at 62.’</span> <span id="s1117">So he gives me, ya, but the reason I decided to retire at 62, because it was too hard on my wife.</span> <span id="s1118">You know – once my son reached like 10 or 11 years, you know, she went back – she started with a part time job, then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: So then you retired, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: So, what do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Well, I’m coming.</span> <span id="s1123">The reason I told you this, because I decided I could help my wife a lot in the house.</span> <span id="s1124">She, like this, she came home late so on a Thursday night to prepare everything, the cholent, so that it should be easy for Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1125">Friday she would come home, just to put in, just to warm and so and so.</span> <span id="s1126">And I had a knack for cooking.</span> <span id="s1127">It’s a little hobby for me.</span> <span id="s1128">So, I used to help in the house a little.</span> <span id="s1129">So I say, ‘Look, you know what?</span> <span id="s1130">If I retire, I’ll help you.</span> <span id="s1131">It’s gonna be easier for you.’</span> <span id="s1132">What I’m trying to show you is that the money wasn’t that important to us, so, (needs translation) so, this is how I started.</span> <span id="s1133">So then I was walking around...I started looking, I saw they looking for somebody like in the neighborhood, in a shirt place, for help.</span> <span id="s1134">I go in, they offered me bupkus (needs translation) but I figured, to go in for a couple of hours or so, it’ll keep me busy for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s1135">So I worked like three days for a while.</span> <span id="s1136">As a matter of fact, my wife goes to – she works in Brooklyn College.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: What does she do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: She in the library...she is in the technical services, it’s called.</span> <span id="s1139">Cataloguing the books and things like this.</span> <span id="s1140">So she works like 12 years already.</span> <span id="s1141">So, she has a car, she has a parking in the college, so it takes a couple of minutes to go to work.</span> <span id="s1142">She used to drop me...it was very easy...but I got tired of that to and I decided, ‘Look, it’s enough.</span> <span id="s1143">I reached my –</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: So, now, -</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: So now I’m retired.</span> <span id="s1146">So what am I doing?</span> <span id="s1147">This is what I’m doing.</span> <span id="s1148">In the morning I get up, I go to minyan, then I come home, it’s like this.</span> <span id="s1149">I bought material, I made for my wife some clothing – like I said, I help out.</span> <span id="s1150">I cook for Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1151">Alright, she cleans the chicken, let’s say, Thursday night she cleans the chicken, she gets every detail – and I cook it and I make the cholent...</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Do you and your wife go out during the week ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: During the week, not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Do you socialize?</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1156">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Do you have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: But socializing is like this.</span> <span id="s1159">We had several circles of friends, you know, we used to get together in this house every Saturday night, and that house, but unfortunately, the time takes it’s course, you know.</span> <span id="s1160">This one lost his wife, and this one lost her husband, so those couples broke up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Were your friends mostly survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes...Maybe not the wives, let’s see, because like we have some friends that the wives were born here in America.</span> <span id="s1163">But the men are survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Do you think that American Jews can ever understand what happened to the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No.</span> <span id="s1166">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: How do you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: I’ll tell you the truth, I see them as ordinary people.</span> <span id="s1169">I don’t think anybody could imagine, anybody could picture, what really happened.</span> <span id="s1170">Even as a survivor, or even after that too.</span> <span id="s1171">What you go through.</span> <span id="s1172">I mean, I don’t expect that of people to understand such a thing.</span> <span id="s1173">I mean, I myselves, if I wouldn’t be there, I’ll, I’ll give a fer instances.</span> <span id="s1174">When I was in Russia, and it was in 1943.</span> <span id="s1175">You know, in Russia, the radio, some had like a horn, you know on the wall, and when they decided to play on the station there, you could listen too.</span> <span id="s1176">And the same thing where with the post office was, they had like a loud speaker, and you could sit there and listen to news.</span> <span id="s1177">So I remember that was in winter time and when they started give some news about the Warsaw ghetto, the uprising, you know, and all this and there were people there where there from Poland, you know, and all this, ayyy, thought propaganda, they want us to join the army.</span> <span id="s1178">I saw the massacre Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s1179">For me it was easy to believe.</span> <span id="s1180">And I, I, (inaudible).</span> <span id="s1181">Nobody would believe it.</span> <span id="s1182">So how can I expect people here in America who never saw hardship.</span> <span id="s1183">Who never came CLOSE to any – why should they understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Do you think they are prejudiced?</span> <span id="s1185">Do you think they are prejudiced against people who come from Europe?</span> <span id="s1186">Against greeners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I wouldn’t think so.</span> <span id="s1188">Maybe at certain times, they say the ‘greener have’ but I don’t really think.</span> <span id="s1189">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1190">If you want to say, you can say the same thing now.</span> <span id="s1191">In other words, there are a lot of Russian people and they come in here and you’ll see they did in weeks.</span> <span id="s1192">They are on the way in going.</span> <span id="s1193">They have nice jobs.</span> <span id="s1194">They in business, and this and this.</span> <span id="s1195">Some of them, ya, that they – I – I can hear something talk and, ‘Oh, they just like for especially the elderly to come, and the the ?</span> <span id="s1196">wife?</span> <span id="s1197">to get the ?</span> <span id="s1198">society?</span> <span id="s1199">whatever.’</span> <span id="s1200">They want your (inaudible) what’s coming.</span> <span id="s1201">I wouldn’t say this is something.</span> <span id="s1202">But on the whole, I don’t see that they should be ?</span> <span id="s1203">jealous?</span> <span id="s1204">.</span> <span id="s1205">I think mostly at my age, (inaudible) I myself, too, that they are so fast on – I mean, it’s different.</span> <span id="s1206">But apparently it doesn’t work, because I would see people that come from a free world, and they were business people and so on, they come here, it’s to step in.</span> <span id="s1207">But I, I myselves can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1208">They – they’re not in business for themselves.</span> <span id="s1209">If they can help you, how well they know the tricks of the trade.</span> <span id="s1210">And by the way, when I worked in the shirt place there lately, and there was a young man, a Russian.</span> <span id="s1211">And I discussed this with him, and I said to him, ‘How is it,’ and you know, the language that he used, and he speaks Yiddish incidentally.</span> <span id="s1212">He’s a young man in his early thirties.</span> <span id="s1213">He says, (needs translation)...you should excuse me, I don’t want to be crude.</span> <span id="s1214">He says, (needs translation).</span> <span id="s1215">He says in Russia, (needs translation) if you didn’t know how to do it, you couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1216">And he tells me how (illegible in original transcript copy).</span> <span id="s1217">So I asked him, I say, ‘If it was so good, how come you came?’</span> <span id="s1218">He said, ‘Because you don’t know how long it’s gonna go on.</span> <span id="s1219">You don’t know when they’ll catch you.’</span> <span id="s1220">(inaudible) So but here, that’s what he says.</span> <span id="s1221">That, that they had – he says, ‘All those tricks.’</span> <span id="s1222">(inaudible) They know ALL the tricks of the trade, you know.</span> <span id="s1223">And you would think, ‘How did I - .’</span> <span id="s1224">So he says, ‘You had to live like this there.</span> <span id="s1225">You have to.</span> <span id="s1226">Otherwise you couldn’t – (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: When you think back, you know, you didn’t have an easy life.</span> <span id="s1228">Not the way you described it to me.</span> <span id="s1229">You had a pretty tough life.</span> <span id="s1230">What is it, what achievement, or what that you did, would you say that you were most proud of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: An achievement?</span> <span id="s1232">Well I would say that my biggest achievement is that I managed to remain sane.</span> <span id="s1233">I – I really mean it.</span> <span id="s1234">That I can have a family – ahhh – alright, we have no children, but with my wife, the kind of life we lead.</span> <span id="s1235">I – uhh, we’re not millionaire, but we managed to live like menschen, sort to speak.</span> <span id="s1236">(voice drops very low) Socially and this and that and this is – uhhh, I mean after all that I think it’s an accomplishment.</span> <span id="s1237">I mean, financially, it was hard on me - to me this is, it’s not important.</span> <span id="s1238">It’s not that important.</span> <span id="s1239">Look, it’s only important to the degree that I need to support me for what I want.</span> <span id="s1240">That I can go on living with a certain degree of dignity, let’s say.</span> <span id="s1241">My wife says that’s what counts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Do you feel you have an optimistic nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s1244">I’m rather, I would say, I was very – I would say to a certain degree, this changed too.</span> <span id="s1245">But, ahh, I was pessimistic.</span> <span id="s1246">If you’ll tell me like for the outlook for the future I don’t see too good an ou----.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: I was going to ask you next.</span> <span id="s1248">What do you see for the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I, I see, and especially for the Jewish, also, it’s encouraging to see, (kinahora needs translation) you know, I get such a kick out – when I came to America to live, so I was religious.</span> <span id="s1250">I wouldn’t dare walking around with the yarmulke in the streets somewhere, or go to a job with this on.</span> <span id="s1251">(inaudible) here I see those young doctors, lawyers, there.</span> <span id="s1252">You know, in all the the yarmulkes, I even years ago, when I saw a person with a yarmulke, I had such a warm came in my heart.</span> <span id="s1253">I said, ‘Oh, this is the future of Yiddishkeit,’ you know?</span> <span id="s1254">I mean, this how I saw.</span> <span id="s1255">And, well, other people, you know, they would criticize my beard, (inaudible) and tsitsit (needs translation) so I used to have arguments with people.</span> <span id="s1256">But I would (needs translation) If you believe in democracy, and if you believe that this is a free country, why shouldn’t we be able to, to walk the way you feels.</span> <span id="s1257">I mean, this how I see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So, what are you pessimistic about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: In general.</span> <span id="s1260">I’m pessimistic about the way I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1261">The way I see life now.</span> <span id="s1262">The homosexualism.</span> <span id="s1263">In the open.</span> <span id="s1264">Now, I think this cannot lead to, to, towards, to a better future.</span> <span id="s1265">I mean, we can argue, yes.</span> <span id="s1266">(needs translation) Well, look, it wasn’t in the book of (inaudible) I mean, if it’s written (inaudible) it existed.</span> <span id="s1267">But some – I said, if it was, it was under the cover.</span> <span id="s1268">People – here, it’s nothing to talk about, ehr, we just live together, or something.</span> <span id="s1269">Or, or we are (inaudible) that homosexuals that they can go out and have demonstrations, and fight for their rights – to me, I see this as degrading.</span> <span id="s1270">It’s storm.</span> <span id="s1271">I mean, it’s storm in coming.</span> <span id="s1272">That’s why I look at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: It’s storm in the coming, I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Storm coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Storm!</span> <span id="s1277">Storm!</span> <span id="s1278">Sodom and Gemorra.</span> <span id="s1279">Sodom and Gemorra.</span> <span id="s1280">I mean, I say, (needs translation) That’s how I see it.</span> <span id="s1281">It’s not that I’m such a fanatic religiously, but just, ehr, as human beings, I think there has to be a certain – even one is not 100% - at least, a degree of biesh – You know, the shame.</span> <span id="s1282">And now, there’s no shame.</span> <span id="s1283">And, and I don’t think this gonna lead to anything.</span> <span id="s1284">I mean, I am very pessimistic about –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: And this crime too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Crime is another thing.</span> <span id="s1287">But crime was always there.</span> <span id="s1288">I mean, not to this (inaudible) crime doesn’t disturb me so much.</span> <span id="s1289">Not that I like it.</span> <span id="s1290">But this is somethin – it’s a phenomenon that it’s new.</span> <span id="s1291">And it’s so open that people have no ?</span> <span id="s1292">hibition?</span> <span id="s1293">no more.</span> <span id="s1294">There’s no – Oh, even divorce.</span> <span id="s1295">The rate of divorce, the rate of divorce among religious couples, this is something that that it’s disappointing.</span> <span id="s1296">I mean, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1297">And I’ll tell you another thing that I have many times like in my – our circles.</span> <span id="s1298">I – I have something to say, that people think I am crazy.</span> <span id="s1299">Is, is about women.</span> <span id="s1300">First of all, I – like a, take the women’s lib, the (gentile’s?)</span> <span id="s1301">women’s lib I wouldn’t even discuss, this is a (needs translation).</span> <span id="s1302">But among religious women, with their own minyunim alright, this I wouldn’t think this is gonna bring, chas va shalom, to the – world should collapse, you know.</span> <span id="s1303">.</span> <span id="s1304">But, it shows you that the respect of, of law, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1305">If you’re religious, why accept what’s written, and, - look, they don’t ask anything from you, be happy.</span> <span id="s1306">But, ‘No,’ they insist they must daven, they must lay tfellin, I think all these things eventually, they have to lead to – to worse things.</span> <span id="s1307">That’s how I see things.</span> <span id="s1308">I’m not ever think that I don’t like, in Jewish circles.</span> <span id="s1309">And I say it, I have cousins but they were, they, they the cousin he’s a doctor and the wife is a doctor.</span> <span

good.</span> <span id="s1313">I say, and I can understand that each individual women, if she wants to be a doctor, I mean, she has every right to be.</span> <span id="s1314">Ahh doctor, or whatever she wants to be.</span> <span id="s1315">But I say, eventually, this is gonna affect the nature of the life.</span> <span id="s1316">The nature of life in the community.</span> <span id="s1317">Because, you say, I believe a mother, is at least when the kids are young, should stay with the family.</span> <span id="s1318">And he says, ‘Until you become a doctor and leave the kid there with a svartze, or with a Polish woman, and, I don’t think that this is ahh, it’s gonna bring up a better generations.</span> <span id="s1319">I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Do you think that what happened in Europe could happen here in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Well I would say, like some pessimists would say that they see it coming.</span> <span id="s1322">I wouldn’t say that that I see it coming.</span> <span id="s1323">But it certainly could happen.</span> <span id="s1324">I don’t think that any place in the world (inaudible) especially with such a, kine hora, a Jewish kibbitz – you know.</span> <span id="s1325">That ah, well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: You don’t think that anti – Semitism in America is the same as the one in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Oh, they are the same, but it’s different in, in a certain place.</span> <span id="s1328">First of all, Jews here, they have power.</span> <span id="s1329">It’s not like in Europe.</span> <span id="s1330">In Europe Jews, they organized, I mean, they have organizations, but it was different.</span> <span id="s1331">You didn’t have Jewish politicians that they could protect us, and here they politicians, I mean, I think they do some good.</span> <span id="s1332">I mean some are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Do you like Kissinger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Kissinger – well, I have mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s1335">Why?</span> <span id="s1336">Well, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1337">I don’t think that we know the whole truth about him.</span> <span id="s1338">Like, at one time you know, I thought that he was the one that he was pressing on Golda Meier, and the others like to relinquish this and that.</span> <span id="s1339">I don’t know if we know the whole truth what was going on.</span> <span id="s1340">What would have been the consequences if they wouldn’t listen, but he threatened, or what – I mean, if I’m gonna give an opinion, I mean, I would have to know more background...</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">END OF SIDE ONE---TAPE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">TAPE TWO---SIDE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Did you like Reagan?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Yes, to an extent.</span> <span id="s1345">Of course, I didn’t approve of everything he did, but, incidentally, I am a registered Democrat.</span> <span id="s1346">Always was a Democratic.</span> <span id="s1347">But since Nixon, at the second time, I think, I’ll voted for Nixon and since then, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: You came to New York.</span> <span id="s1349">Do you think that things would have turned out different for you if you had moved to another part of the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: It’s hard to tell.</span> <span id="s1351">But, ah, well, coming back, I’d like to make the point about staying religious, and of course you had asked me, and I told you about my uncle, about, I told you he wants to take me to the movie.</span> <span id="s1352">But while I told him ‘No,’ the other uncle, the one that send me the papers, came like, the next day or so.</span> <span id="s1353">And he started talking and he says, ‘Look, Marcus?</span> <span id="s1354">, I know your family, I know, I mean even with my parents, (inaudible) I know who are.</span> <span id="s1355">And who you come from.</span> <span id="s1356">And let me tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s1357">Like he was a religious man.</span> <span id="s1358">He says, ‘I’m not gonna tell you what you should do, ‘cause you are a free man.</span> <span id="s1359">But let me tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s1360">If you gonna make up your mind, that you want to remain a Shomer Shabbas, you’ll be able to do it.’</span> <span id="s1361">He says.</span> <span id="s1362">‘Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s hard, that it’s this, and this.’</span> <span id="s1363">And I took this to heart –</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Let me put it to you another way.</span> <span id="s1365">Forget about if you lived elsewhere in the United States.</span> <span id="s1366">If you had your life to live over again, from the time that you came here to America, is there anything you think you would have done a little differently?</span> <span id="s1367">Is there anything you wouldn’t have done, or anything, if you did it, you would have done another way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: You mean, since I came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Since you came to America.</span> <span id="s1370">With family, with business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Ya, I understand.</span> <span id="s1372">I – I really don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1373">I mean, ahh, I don’t think there was much – ‘cause I, what I usually say, I would probably make the same mistakes over.</span> <span id="s1374">I mean, I really mean it.</span> <span id="s1375">Whatever we did, I’m not a guy that does things harshly, you know.</span> <span id="s1376">We considered every move I made I considered, that doesn’t mean I came to the right conclusion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: With the child you couldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Well, with other things too.</span> <span id="s1379">Like with business.</span> <span id="s1380">You start a business, do you know how it’s gonna work out?</span> <span id="s1381">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Do you think you would have gone to school more?</span> <span id="s1383">Maybe studied more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Had I known then, what I know now, how important education is, maybe I would.</span> <span id="s1385">Then’s a question, ‘Could I?’</span> <span id="s1386">I mean, ahh, you know – I think when we came here, my nerves were shot.</span> <span id="s1387">I mean, like most of them.</span> <span id="s1388">Some managed to go for better education.</span> <span id="s1389">Higher education.</span> <span id="s1390">I don’t think I was geared for it.</span> <span id="s1391">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Are you friendly with the relatives you do have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Yah, most of them.</span> <span id="s1394">I’m certainly not on bad terms with any of them.</span> <span id="s1395">But you see, there was a, I would say, a gap about – with the religious ones.</span> <span id="s1396">I mean, mostly that came after the war we are all – all religious.</span> <span id="s1397">Those that were here before, I mean, the elder aunts in other words, they’re gone.</span> <span id="s1398">And the cousins, they’re not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: How many cousins do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: How many cousins?</span> <span id="s1401">It’s hard to tell ‘cause some of them I don’t even know if they still live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: I mean, that you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: That I see?</span> <span id="s1404">Oh, it’s very few.</span> <span id="s1405">Because like I myselves have very little time.</span> <span id="s1406">But I have cousins – actually the one uncle that survived he has a son, and then the aunt.</span> <span id="s1407">So they have the two sons, one is a psychologist, he is at Maimonedes, and the other one has a business of his own, he’s in the microwave – so that’s two.</span> <span id="s1408">And then I have cousins – well, these are those from Europe, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1409">And then the American cousins, with some them, we are close sort to speak, but,...</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Was there a chevra from your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: There was when I came.</span> <span id="s1412">There was something.</span> <span id="s1413">I went once but it falled apart...</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Do you belong to any survivor groups today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Do you ever think of joining them – like this Ben Mead, American gathering –</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: No.</span> <span id="s1418">I’ll tell you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: What do you think of those things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: I sort of – maybe I’m too individualistic.</span> <span id="s1421">I mean, I don’t like that somebody should control my thoughts, you know, my ideas.</span> <span id="s1422">This way, I never joined – I like I said once, I was anti – Zionism meant nothing to me.</span> <span id="s1423">But after a while, I really was a very strong supporter of the Agun, let’s say.</span> <span id="s1424">But I never joined any organization.</span> <span id="s1425">Even if I had certain sympathies with them, ‘cause I like to be liking them.</span> <span id="s1426">I have my independent thinking.</span> <span id="s1427">I like to hold on to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Maybe you feel they’ll take it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: I n your shul, you friendly with the rabbi at all – besides saying ‘Good Shabbas.’</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Well, ah, it’s a (MT laughs) funny question you ask me because with our rabbi, we are a little – he’s already in his eighties.</span> <span id="s1432">And we’re trying to get him to retire, so I can’t say I’m friendly with him.</span> <span id="s1433">I used to go to his shuirim and like it, but there’s – he’s already, really, it’s not that the age that that’s why we wanted him to have a – because he’s not really functioning so, and he didn’t want to retire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: When in the early years, people came over from the other country, and they saw each other, and they felt they had something in common with each other, did you ever get together with people, like go to a certain park on Shabbas, or certain cafeteria, a certain club or school, where you got together with other immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Oh, yes, when I was younger, yes, especially in the single years – There was a park on Rochester Avenue we used to go with to, Prospect Park, a whole group of boys, we kept together, go to Prospect Park, and – my wife I met in front of the Lubavitcher Rebbe.</span> <span id="s1436">We used to – whole groups, like I lived in East Flatbush, it was quite a distance.</span> <span id="s1437">But like, Simchas Torah, (inaudible) a whole group of us would go to Hakkofot to the Lubavitcher and we met a group of girls, and we started talking in front of the Lumavitcher – and so I know it’s not in you concern, but it’s a very interesting story how my wife and I got together.</span> <span id="s1438">It’s a, -</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: No, it is interesting –</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Well I’ll tell you something, this what I say, you know, I’m a very true believer in (needs translation) ‘cause, it – like, I skipped a lot of things, because you know, (needs translation) so I didn’t give you my whole story with the – how I..</span> <span id="s1441">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Does this help you?</span> <span id="s1443">When you had problems –</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Oh, yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: My question is, when you had problems with your son, did believing in G-d help you?</span> <span id="s1446">Did (needs translation) help you?</span> <span id="s1447">Did it help you get through some of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Well, maybe it get, maybe it help me get through my agony.</span> <span id="s1449">And of course, my son it didn’t help.</span> <span id="s1450">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: I mean, if you went for counseling, that didn’t help much, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: It didn’t.</span> <span id="s1453">Well, it didn’t help much as far as my son is concerned.</span> <span id="s1454">But it helped a great deal as far as my wife and I were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: It did help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Yes, because you know, this – that whole thing caused a lot of friction between us.</span> <span id="s1457">I mean, I’m sure you understand that ummm, I blamed her for a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1458">I thought she demanded too much of him, or she did too much for him.</span> <span id="s1459">You know, she’s a very good person.</span> <span id="s1460">Whoever knows her will tell you she’s a (needs translation).</span> <span id="s1461">She’s a very good person.</span> <span id="s1462">And I always thought she did too much as a child, I thought she didn’t let him grow up independently.</span> <span id="s1463">I don’t know if it would have turned out differently, but I used to have arguments with her about she did this for him, I mean, I don’t even gonna mention things, because I don’t think this is what, ahh – but, so – but the counseling definitely helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: But (needs translation) also helped you.</span> <span id="s1465">You had a tough time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: Well in a lot of things, I mean, I know, I don’t know how you see these things, but to believe in your rebbe, so also, I could not attach myself now to become a Hussid like that to a rebbe that, that tell this.</span> <span id="s1467">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1468">I have observed some - -</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: I wouldn’t say this, but I would say this, now, that you sit, in 1989, and you know that 6 million Jews died in WW2, and you know that a high proportion of them were frum –</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Most of them.</span> <span id="s1471">I would say 90%.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Because the non – frum ones came here already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: It must cross your mind to ask yourself, ‘How could a G-d who’s a G-d of rachamin, of mercy, of compassion, how could HE allow it to happen.’</span> <span id="s1475">And what I want to know is, when you think about it, do you ever think about – well, do you ever question it?</span> <span id="s1476">And if you do, do you ever have an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: Oy, I have no answer.</span> <span id="s1478">Well my answer is, that we can’t ask questions.</span> <span id="s1479">I mean, I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: In other words, you have emunah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: It does, of course, it crosses my mind, and why, I ask always, like, let’s see, my – my father, my brothers, were they better than I was.</span> <span id="s1482">Why?</span> <span id="s1483">So of course there’s questions.</span> <span id="s1484">But I say, (needs translation).</span> <span id="s1485">But what can you say?</span> <span id="s1486">I really believe that’s – I – why did I survive?</span> <span id="s1487">This is another question, of which I can’t understand, why was I – because of that, what I say, I was just left from like, like, by the handle – some would leading me away from one thing to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: But on the other hand, you decided on your own to leave that town and go to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Nobody led you to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: True.</span> <span id="s1492">True.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: You said you were driven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1495">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: But you had the initiative to be independent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1498">I – yes.</span> <span id="s1499">But then there’s so many incidents I mean, it’s gonna take days, I’m afraid, to – it’s a whole – (needs translation) truth</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: That’s luck, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: That certain things that happened, some people would - would describe luck.</span> <span id="s1502">I don’t think it was luck.</span> <span id="s1503">It was everything practically, like, ehr, that it led one to the other, one to the other, one to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Go back to what you were saying, about how you met your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: Oh, yeh.</span> <span id="s1506">But I just want to bring one thing up about emunah and this, and so on.</span> <span id="s1507">Before my emunah was set, when I remember when I was in the D.P. camp, and I wouldn’t say that I was already – that so hard set, you know, (inaudible) about – but, I tried to come back.</span> <span id="s1508">Let’s say, my first job in the camp there, I took in the Kosher kitchen, so I shouldn’t have to go work in the so and so on.</span> <span id="s1509">And I remember that there was a whole group of guys that they worked there in the magazine and I went there like to pick up the products for the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1510">And, uh, (inaudible) about working in the kosher kitchen, you know, and so on, then it start making (needs translation), ah, (needs translation) and then there were two boys, coming – they came from another camp there, with the beards, and peyas, you know, I think they were (needs translation) whatever, and I saw that I – it (inaudible) I went over and said, ‘ What – what’s the matter?’</span> <span id="s1511">(needs translation) that’s what they said: ‘What kind of religion is it?’</span> <span id="s1512">They said, ‘Look what Hitler did – you wanna know something (needs translation) he won over you not over them.</span> <span id="s1513">That’s what I told them.</span> <span id="s1514">They survived (inaudible).</span> <span id="s1515">They conquered Hitler.</span> <span id="s1516">They didn’t give up anything (inaudible).</span> <span id="s1517">Can you imagine that if your father would live, how he would look?</span> <span id="s1518">Did he, did he have a beard and peyas before he was killed or, or (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: I think what you say makes a lot of sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: I said, I said, ‘They conquered over Hitler.</span> <span id="s1521">(needs translation) They didn’t change one iota.</span> <span id="s1522">They dressed like they dress, they dress, (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: When you give money today, do you give money to Israel?</span> <span id="s1524">Or the Yeshivas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: I give to Israel.</span> <span id="s1526">I give to Yeshivas, as a matter of fact, I – I figured maybe it’ll come to the – you see, I had a big problem.</span> <span id="s1527">I’m not an ?</span> <span id="s1528">oysha?</span> <span id="s1529">you know?</span> <span id="s1530">But, look, for all these years, work, my wife, and this, we have a couple of dollars.</span> <span id="s1531">And, to me, it was a big problem what happens after 120 years.</span> <span id="s1532">I mean, I don’t know, maybe every person would think, in my – is it – listen, am I gonna live it to my son?</span> <span id="s1533">To him, like I said, he can go over money like, ahh, money like, ahh, within a month he can spend everything what he has.</span> <span id="s1534">This, this is the kind of person he – like, an incident I’ll just throw it in, I finally managed to get for him social security.</span> <span id="s1535">He’s getting social security on my social security...so then there was always my impression.</span> <span id="s1536">What happens after 120 years?</span> <span id="s1537">Leave it to him?</span> <span id="s1538">(needs translation) so I had an idea I should try to get some kind of organization that I’m willing to leave everything to them.</span> <span id="s1539">In other words,, when, after hundred and tvenze (Yiddish – 120 years) provided they should provide for my son monthly, or whether private or whatever, for his life that he should get whatever.</span> <span id="s1540">Now I tried it to here, there, and I’ll tell you, I called Lubavitch.</span> <span id="s1541">And I made them a proposition.</span> <span id="s1542">Look, (needs translation) I give to quite a few Lubavitcher institutions...Chabad, Yeshivas, the Hebrew Fund which originally it was (inaudible) and we adopted a child through them, it was – we gave.</span> <span id="s1543">I think maybe more than, than a lot of people that have much more than I do.</span> <span id="s1544">I mean, uh, in this respect I say, my wife, she’s also very ?</span> <span id="s1545">charitable?</span> <span id="s1546">.</span> <span id="s1547">Whatever I’ll say, agree, she’ll never argue with me, so so when I came up with an idea like that, (inaudible) so I called Lubavitch (needs translation)...’What you do for me?’</span> <span id="s1548">‘We’ll call you back.’</span> <span id="s1549">‘Ya, they call me like you call me back.’</span> <span id="s1550">Then (needs translation) I’ll be honest with you, (needs translation) if I would only give my money to a Yeshiva, I would give it to the most religious (inaudible)...’cause like I said, I always believed that the more extreme you are, the more of a chance is survival.</span> <span id="s1551">I mean, I really, ahh, I would like to see that the Jewish, ahh, nation should survive.</span> <span id="s1552">You know, (needs translation) and I would go to the most extreme.</span> <span id="s1553">So I tried with Lubavitcher...(needs translation)...it would have suited my purpose, but I saw they not businessmen.</span> <span id="s1554">I mean, I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1555">So, finally...and believe me, I was nights, laying and thinking...this while I had other problems with him that I had to worry about, so this was one of the problems.</span> <span id="s1556">So finally, I thought of Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s1557">So, also, I’m a slow doer, let’s say, I’ll think of something, I don’t rush into things –</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: You’re a cautious person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: So – must be.</span> <span id="s1560">(Laughs and needs translation).</span> <span id="s1561">Anyhow I got up the nerve, or maybe I didn’t have the nerve, I didn’t think, so – I called up the Yeshiva there, and I told whoever I spoke to what’s in my – purpose of the call is.</span> <span id="s1562">So he says, ‘Alright, we’ll have somebody call you.’</span> <span id="s1563">So Rabbi Dubrinsky called me, I spoke to him on the phone briefly, but we made an appointment, and I went down first by myselves, and I really made a very good impression on him.</span> <span id="s1564">‘Cause number one, I saw he wasn’t out to grab, - He made a very good impression – a gentleman.</span> <span id="s1565">And I told him my problem, and this and that, and, so this actually was the easy part.</span> <span id="s1566">To leave everything – after 120 years, I would say this was an easy part.</span> <span id="s1567">But you see, my question was other things.</span> <span id="s1568">You know, we only human beings.</span> <span id="s1569">And then I said it to this Rabbi Dubrinsky, I said, ‘What can I do” Like, G-d forbid sickness or something, and you know how it is.</span> <span id="s1570">Before you don’t exhaust the last penny, you can’t go in on the public – I mean, I would like to know what happens then, and then, if I leave nothing for my son, what happens to him (needs translation) I – I, this, this is – the – We discussed about annuities and this, and I think I found a solution which I should say, that after this year, I probably (inaudible) maybe 300 %.</span> <span id="s1571">It was a big load off my head.</span> <span id="s1572">Because first of all, I established like annuities in my, you know like scholarships in my parents name.</span> <span id="s1573">And my wife’s parent’s name.</span> <span id="s1574">And then I – which it’s going to be like a scholarship in my brother’s – my whole family, which it’s like a unitrust...where I committed myself...in other words, after we are gone, if G-d forbid, I mean, if there is no...estate left...as least that’s what’s gonna build up...as long as he’s gonna be alive, he gonna get this.</span> <span id="s1575">Alright, it’s not much.</span> <span id="s1576">But, G-d willing, if we live on, and my – and we pay in, and pay in, so – I’ll have security at least, a certain amount for him, after we are gone.</span> <span id="s1577">(needs translation).</span> <span id="s1578">I say, under normally circumstances, we are not big spenders (needs translation)...this year we didn’t even go to Florida, because my wife had a bad case – last Shauvos all of a sudden she went blind in one eye.</span> <span id="s1579">She was operated.</span> <span id="s1580">I mean, when you look at her, you wouldn’t even know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Is she okay now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: She is not – the right eye she sees very, very little...and she, to her, it’s yet psychologically...</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Nobody can tell, though, right?</span> <span id="s1584">If they look at her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: No.</span> <span id="s1586">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s1587">You see, that’s the thing...it turned out it was a detached retina and she was operated on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: How did you meet her?</span> <span id="s1589">You were going to tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1591">Coming back to the how I meet her.</span> <span id="s1592">Originally I told you I met her the first time in front of the Lubavitcher Simchas Torah.</span> <span id="s1593">So, I - we were there a couple of friends.</span> <span id="s1594">And I, at that time, my mind wasn’t yet set on really ahh, getting married or anything.</span> <span id="s1595">So another friend of mine, and, and, she seemed like a nice girl.</span> <span id="s1596">You know, she was younger, about 17, you know, that was of the time I think in 1948, after the creation of the state, and there was a whole discussion there between, you know, about this and that.</span> <span id="s1597">She prepared a good impression but I wasn’t prepared, ready, besides, I thought she was young, she was 10 years my junior.</span> <span id="s1598">So I said definitely I wouldn’t even think about it.</span> <span id="s1599">So my friend took her out.</span> <span id="s1600">They went out for a while.</span> <span id="s1601">Then, I don’t know, they stopped seeing each other.</span> <span id="s1602">So then, through another friends, I met a boy – incidentally, his father was from my town, I knew his whole family there, a religious fellow – and I had a friend I met in the night school, we’re friends ‘til this very day...so he comes from a town...called Ullinoff.</span> <span id="s1603">So my wife’s mother also comes from Ullinoff.</span> <span id="s1604">But she left Ullinoff when she was a baby, and went to Germany.</span> <span id="s1605">So, I don’t know, come and talking one to the other, and so when I told this friend that, you know I met a girl that her parents were (inaudible).</span> <span id="s1606">So he once went over there, spoke to his mother...then we started talking with this guy that his father was from my town...he sees a girl, and suddenly he’s into it.</span> <span id="s1607">He says, ‘You know, incidentally, her mother comes from Ullinoff,’ You know, he said it to my friend...the way he described it, and I said, ‘I think I know the girl.’</span> <span id="s1608">And I told him so and so this is the name, and ‘Yes, how do you know?’</span> <span id="s1609">So, alright.</span> <span id="s1610">So in other words, there was a connection here.</span> <span id="s1611">That he knew the same girl, and this was going on and I still was not interested.</span> <span id="s1612">And then, one time, they going out quite a while, and nothing happens.</span> <span id="s1613">So once I decided it’s time – time is running out, I mean, maybe I should try to settle.</span> <span id="s1614">I should - (inaudible) and I always liked this girl, but like I said, she was younger than I. And I didn’t think – so once he says to me, ‘Why don’t you take her out once.’</span> <span id="s1615">It seemed he wanted to cut out, and he just – didn’t have the nerve just to leave like this.</span> <span id="s1616">So she after she made a party there, I should come to the party.</span> <span id="s1617">And I didn’t know she arranged another girl.</span> <span id="s1618">He was supposed to be paired.</span> <span id="s1619">We didn’t go we stayed in the house.</span> <span id="s1620">And, I was that time in business, and Sunday morning, I went into the place, and sure enough, she called me up, and she says, ‘ Nu, how do you like Barbara Sokol?’</span> <span id="s1621">I said, ‘ Why do you ask?’</span> <span id="s1622">...(needs translation)...I’m not really interested in dating her, but how about if I take you out...’ ...so we sent out...this is nothing unusual I would say.</span> <span id="s1623">One day she calls me up, ‘You know the father of this boy that she was going out with passed away,’ And being that he was my landsman, would I care to go for a shiva call, and she wants to go.</span> <span id="s1624">Well, we made up...we’ll meet and we’ll go together there for a shiva call.</span> <span id="s1625">And there...there was a man coming there selling the corrugated boxes.</span> <span id="s1626">He was living in the same house where I lived that time with my uncle, we davened in the same shul, he always told me, ‘Do I have a girl for you!</span> <span id="s1627">Do I have a girl for you!’</span> <span id="s1628">And I told him I’m not interested, (needs translation).</span> <span id="s1629">And the same thing, when he came there, he always told (her) he ‘Has a boy!</span> <span id="s1630">He has a boy!’</span> <span id="s1631">She didn’t know who he was talking about, and I didn’t know who he was talking about.</span> <span id="s1632">So that day, when we made up to go there for ac shiva call, he comes to her place again to sell boxes, and again he started talking to her about the boy.</span> <span id="s1633">And...she says, ‘Isn’t his name sometimes Mark Tepper?’</span> <span id="s1634">;Yes, how did you know?’</span> <span id="s1635">I’m seeing him tonight, we going for shiva.’</span> <span id="s1636">I mean, it’s a funny thing that he tried to shadekin us, for months, her, and he, and I wasn’t sure – and here we was suppose to go for a shiva call, and then she asks me, is this so and so, and I say, ‘Yes, how do you know?’</span> <span id="s1637">So, in other words, that was, and then, what’s funnier than that, that, ehr, I remember when I was in Germany, and there was this Rabbi ?</span> <span id="s1638">Vogelernta?</span> <span id="s1639">who spoke and he told us stories about Seattle, when those Russian Jews arrived, and what didn’t, and spoke to a child, ask a certain questions, and when I heard she was in Seattle, you know, I asked her, (inaudible) she says, ‘Yes, that was me’...</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Well I think it all goes along with your basic philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1642">That there’s something with besheret.</span> <span id="s1643">This is what I’m trying to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Do you think that there’s something different about the German Nazi’s than other nationalities, like the Poles, do you make it a point, for example, not to buy anything from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: I must say, I do not.</span> <span id="s1646">I do not.</span> <span id="s1647">I don’t think it’s – number one, I don’t think feasible.</span> <span id="s1648">Let me say – or, I’ll put it this way.</span> <span id="s1649">Israel is flooded with German merchandise.</span> <span id="s1650">And, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: How do you feel about Germans today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Certainly no great love for them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: I mean, do you see them at all as Nazi’s?</span> <span id="s1654">The ones that were born after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: I understand.</span> <span id="s1656">Well, I wouldn’t call them Nazi’s, but, uhh, well, it depends.</span> <span id="s1657">I – I would say that the younger ones, I don’t know if they know much on their own, that, that – speak the hate, but uhh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Do you think that there’s something special about the Germans, that only they were capable of doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1660">I think the Poles were just as capable, or maybe even worse.</span> <span id="s1661">I think that the fact that all the concentration camps, or the extermination camps, they weren’t all in the – is no accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Do you think Jews will disappear from here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Do you think that Jews will disappear from here in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: No.</span> <span id="s1666">In a way – I don’t know, in the very, very far future, I don’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s1667">It’s not bright.</span> <span id="s1668">Let’s put it this way.</span> <span id="s1669">When I look at the intermarriage, what’s going on – it’s, it’s not ahh, the only, I would say, conciliation is that, (inaudible – needs translation) that there’s also growing a Yeshiva – you see, I see with each Yeshiva young men that comes out with a doctor or a lawyer and they raise such a beautiful families.</span> <span id="s1670">(inaudible) So there’s some hope there, but if this is gonna be able to offset the loss, this is a big, big question.</span> <span id="s1671">It’s not bright.</span> <span id="s1672">It’s not a bright picture.</span> <span id="s1673">Just, ahhh –</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: What did you think of Watergate?</span> <span id="s1675">I remember you mentioned Nixon before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Yeh.</span> <span id="s1677">Well, Watergate, I think it was ahh, stupid of Nixon and the whole thing was stupid ‘cause he didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s1678">He could have won the election without all that.</span> <span id="s1679">See, if you ask me already this question, I – I would come a little closer and take now the North case.</span> <span id="s1680">Now, my personal opinion is that Reagan knew all about what was going on.</span> <span id="s1681">Alright, maybe not to every dollar.</span> <span id="s1682">Whether he stashed away a dollar or not, this I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1683">But the basic thing, I’m sure Reagan knew about it.</span> <span id="s1684">And I believe he had to deny it.</span> <span id="s1685">And in my opinion, they did nothing wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Why?</span> <span id="s1688">Alright, it’s against Congress, you understand, I say a Presidents, then he feels strongly about something, and he can’t it through Congress, he has to do it somehow.</span> <span id="s1689">I mean, I, like this, I say I feel a leader has sometimes to go out on a limb to accomplish what he wants to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: What about a local politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: I’ll come to that.</span> <span id="s1692">But just – I would like, just one more point.</span> <span id="s1693">Because why do I say all that?</span> <span id="s1694">‘Cause I remember I read a book...and he writing about Roosevelt when he started to help Churchill and send his armaments to England...it was also against Congress...maybe he ( illegible in original transcription).</span> <span id="s1695">It’s true, I don’t see no big deal.</span> <span id="s1696">If this was ahh, he thought that it’s was important to help the country, so he had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: What paper do you read in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: The Times.</span> <span id="s1699">I buy the Times every day except Shabbas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: How come you don’t read the Daily News?</span> <span id="s1701">Or the New York Post?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: The New York Post, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1703">I bought it one day this week, because I don’t know, somehow the guy didn’t get the Times.</span> <span id="s1704">It’s to me it’s a schmata...Murdock – I think he was ?</span> <span id="s1705">terrible?</span> <span id="s1706">to Israel, and so on.</span> <span id="s1707">And I thought that we should support th – th ah paper like this.</span> <span id="s1708">But I didn’t find – I mean, the format I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1709">The way they put the news together with the stupid story...</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Do you ever read a Yiddish paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s1712">By the – I subscribe to the (inaudible).</span> <span id="s1713">Ya.</span> <span id="s1714">The Forward’s I could never read it.</span> <span id="s1715">Before that ehr – alright, that was the uh, the (needs translation) since I came to America...</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Tell me something.</span> <span id="s1717">You read the (needs translation – Morgan?)</span> <span id="s1718">when you came to America.</span> <span id="s1719">Do you remember that did the (Morgan--?)</span> <span id="s1720">have any articles about survivors in the early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Not so much about survivors.</span> <span id="s1722">They would write certain things about uhh, what happened in Europe I would say...</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Do you read books?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yah, not too much lately.</span> <span id="s1725">But I like to read.</span> <span id="s1726">If I read, I like to read historical.</span> <span id="s1727">Novels don’t interest me.</span> <span id="s1728">I like to read historical books.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Something that’s true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: Not necessarily true, but makes sense where I think I think I’ll learn something that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1731">Q: Are you encouraged by the fact that people talk more about the Holocaust, that they show the films, I mean do you think that it’s very important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: Yah, I think that’s ah – that’s good.</span> <span id="s1733">I – I, because I don’t think that you should be forgotten.</span> <span id="s1734">I mean, it’s ahh, or ignored.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">END OF TAPE TWO---SIDE TWO.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">END OF INTERVIEW.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">INTERVIEWER NOTES: I would to add at this point, that Mr. Tepper, is a man who claims he is a pessimistic type of person, but he really doesn’t present himself as one.</span> <span id="s1738">And was it with a certain degree of enthusiasm that he approached me in the hotel and said he wanted to conduct the interview.</span> <span id="s1739">He dressed simply in a white cloth ivy league cap, thin windbreaker type jacket, and inexpensive, unpretentious but comfortable walking shoes, and he is – the one interesting thing that I found in the course of the interview was that he didn’t object to telling me the whole story about his son.</span> <span id="s1740">And told me that he doesn’t care what people think about him.</span> <span id="s1741">And he’ll just tell it the way it is.</span> <span id="s1742">BUT he was very nervous about telling me about how he came into this country.</span> <span id="s1743">The way he came into this country was that he had a man who was his uncle, claimed to be his brother, and sent him an affidavit, and the man claimed that this Mr. Tepper was his brother.</span> <span id="s1744">And as a result, he was able to get an affidavit because they accepted in Europe, just the statement of the letter that said, ‘You’re my brother.’</span> <span id="s1745">And that’s how he came into this country.</span> <span id="s1746">And he was afraid, even 45 years later, that since he came in this way, that he might get into trouble for it.</span> <span id="s1747">He also assured me that HIAS knew very well what was going on, but that they didn’t care, because they just wanted to help people to come in.</span> <span id="s1748">This was, of course, in ’46 before the whole process had become much more sophisticated.</span> <span id="s1749">I think it’s important to mention this.</span> <span id="s1750">He is an interesting man, a man with patience.</span> <span id="s1751">It is also interesting that he remembered what happened to him during the war, much more clearly than he did the things that happened to him after the ware.</span> <span id="s1752">It’s almost by rote repetition, he is able to categorize and chronical things, but when it comes to America, he has a little more difficulty remembering – certainly the early years of his arrival into the country.</span> <span id="s1753">Nevertheless, it was a very interesting interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">END OF
