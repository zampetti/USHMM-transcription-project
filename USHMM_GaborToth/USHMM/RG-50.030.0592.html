and hikes, and we used to go – when – Mannheim is located about half an hour’s by train or car from Heidelberg, we used to go to the Heidelberg area, and went hiking into the mountains.</span> <span id="s56">And in winter I went there skiing with my father.</span> <span id="s57">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: So, you attended school?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Was it a Jewish school, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No – well, yes and no.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: There were both Jewish and non-Jewish students?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, I attended so many schools you got to – if you – if you le –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: I saw that – 11 –</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: 11 schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So, what about the first – the first schools that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Was a – was a normal public school in Germany.</span> <span id="s70">In fact, interesting, I met a guy upstairs yesterday who went to the same school the same year.</span> <span id="s71">We started here the same year, or he started one year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Did you remember each other, did you recognize him?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s74">But we just recognized the town, and we found out we had some common friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s76">So did your family practice their religion at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you have re – in your childhood, did you have both Jewish and non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So, did you ever experience anti-Semitism growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s82">Yeah, this was – as I di – I stayed in Germany, let’s see, there were four, yeah, four grades of – of public school, grammar school.</span> <span id="s83">And then I went for two years to German high school.</span> <span id="s84">And then there were restrictions and getting to – and then my parents were in a position to send me to private boarding schools in Italy; one on the Riviera, near Portofino, apart – over that area.</span> <span id="s85">And the second one was near Merano, in the Dolomites, in the mountain areas.</span> <span id="s86">So nice.</span> <span id="s87">Stayed there from about April ’37, til – I can give you the exact date, September thirt – 30th, 1938.</span> <span id="s88">That’s it.</span> <span id="s89">September has 30 days or 31?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, August has 31, September has 30, September 30.</span> <span id="s92">And then I went by train ba – the school had to close.</span> <span id="s93">Somehow thar – Mussolini got – close it together – and I took the train from northern Italy, over the Brenner Pass into Munich and back into Mannheim, where my parents were living.</span> <span id="s94">And that was – on the train I found every town, every station had a lot flags out.</span> <span id="s95">Why?</span> <span id="s96">Because they saw me going – no, there was somebody else who took the same train ride, the same day.</span> <span id="s97">[indecipherable] You’re not a history major, are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: I am.</span> <span id="s99">I’m going to let you answer this.</span> <span id="s100">Who was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, check the dates.</span> <span id="s102">September 30th.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s104">Was it Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: I was going to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: What happened on October first in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Hitler was doing something.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: The Munich Conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: That’s the one where Chamberlain was fooled by Hitler, that he’s for peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Oh, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: That’s when Daladier was there from France, Chamberlain from England, Mussolini and Hitler.</span> <span id="s114">And they met, and that was, as far as I’m concerned, the start, the prelude to World War II, because that’s when the – the British and the French said Hitler could annex Sudetenland, which is the ethnically German part of Czechoslovakia, which is the one that – and then a couple – not too long afterwards, Hitler annexed all of Czechoslovakia, and renamed it Birman(ph), which is the classy German name for that part of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: How – I’m going to back up just a little about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: How old were you when you first went to school in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Let’s see, I went – I was not yet 12.</span> <span id="s119">Was born in 30 – I was born in ’25, so – in June, and that was in April, ’37, so I was – I was nearly 12 years old, not quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Well, was it – was it – di-did your sisters go with you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Was it difficult to leave – leave your family?</span> <span id="s123">Were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, at that time it was – it was lot of good discipline.</span> <span id="s125">Before – when you went to the dining hall, they checked your fingernails, so make sure they’re clean.</span> <span id="s126">They had somebody – some teacher there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s127">And that was a very interesting life, we experienced people from all over the world.</span> <span id="s128">They were not only Germans, they were also loyalists from Spain who were fleeing after the Spanish – during the Spanish Civil War, which was going on at that time.</span> <span id="s129">And the school was very good, not too many students there.</span> <span id="s130">The student to t-teacher ratio – ratio was good, and we got a lot of personal attention, and a lot of sports.</span> <span id="s131">We didn’t have that much contact with the Italians, except we played soccer against them.</span> <span id="s132">But then, I went swimming, I even – that’s the first time I did diving.</span> <span id="s133">There was har – hard hat diving, which is hardly done any more.</span> <span id="s134">But in the bay, catching squids and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: What language were – what language did you speak when you were at school in Italy?</span> <span id="s136">Was it German?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: There were different things.</span> <span id="s138">The primary language was German [indecipherable] but everybody had to take Italian, and I was reasonably fluent, and later on I went for a while to a German – to Italian public high school.</span> <span id="s139">And I had troubles with it, which I wasn’t that good.</span> <span id="s140">Then my first language before I went to Italy was French.</span> <span id="s141">And my mother was a expert in – in the French language.</span> <span id="s142">In fact, she used to tutor PhD students in the States, who were preparing for their language exam.</span> <span id="s143">You know, they had to pass a language exam if they took the thing.</span> <span id="s144">And the th – interesting thing is, the school will send you right home twice a week, one postcard and one letter.</span> <span id="s145">And my mother insisted that the postcard be written in French.</span> <span id="s146">So it’s – and then at dinner, you were assigned to sit on different tables, and at different tables, there was only a certain language spoken.</span> <span id="s147">So if you went this week to the French table, that’s – that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: The language you spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So, did you – was it a positive experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">Oh well, tha – I mean, this is – they were great in doing things like, we were harv – harvesting the seeds from luk – eucalyptus trees, and then we learned how to distill and make eucalyptus oil from it.</span> <span id="s153">And we were – we – not only academically, also had to work, we – in the garden, we were harvesting figs and oranges and lemons and –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: My favorite thing was harvesting figs, because I liked them.</span> <span id="s156">Fresh ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Why did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was the situation, why did you have to leave Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: That school?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well, it was – these schools closed.</span> <span id="s163">First the school at the Mediterranean closed.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t know what the reason is they closed, I don’t – but then they moved some of the kids into a neighboring town, and a few of the teachers created their own boarding school.</span> <span id="s165">But we were actually staying in a pensionne.</span> <span id="s166">And what – they had lessons, and we were located next to the Mediterranean, we could go – the first kids to go swimming, and see the fisherman coming in, and see them eat little fish, bian – biachettis.</span> <span id="s167">They eat them all live.</span> <span id="s168">And – well, you also can cook them, but when you cook them, the fish turns white, except the eyes, and the tail stays silver.</span> <span id="s169">And for beginners, you eat that with tomato sauce, but it tastes better with lemon.</span> <span id="s170">But then you see the eyes as you’re putting it in your mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: That sounds gross.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Well, I’ve eaten – many years later I’ve eaten something that was even more difficult to eat, and that was called balut.</span> <span id="s173">I ate that in the Philippines.</span> <span id="s174">That is the egg of a duck, soft boiled, about four days before the egg is hatched.</span> <span id="s175">And you eat everything except the beak, you use that to cl – to clean your teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Gross.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: And when I was in the Philippines and working there, when – and we went out one evening – I mean, I’m going way back –</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: – way in [indecipherable] we went out with a couple of the other engineers, we went to places, and they – the last thing on the evening, they saved for me, is a balut.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Were you surprised?</span> <span id="s181">Did you know what it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s183">I think I heard about it lately, but I had a lot of beers with it, and just swallowed.</span> <span id="s184">But in the next day, when I went back to the plant, it’s like having passed the initiation test.</span> <span id="s185">I was not – not just a gringo, or whatever they call them there.</span> <span id="s186">I was initiated –</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: – in their food, and I got better response from the workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: They all knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: So, when you left Italy in ’38 –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: It was Sep-September first, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No, September 30th.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: 30th.</span> <span id="s196">When –</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: The conference was October first.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: The Munich Conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, I went for a short time back to Mannheim, and then I went to a Jewish boarding school in Germany, in Halingen.</span> <span id="s202">That’s near Ulm.</span> <span id="s203">And that was probably the biggest Jewish boarding school that was still remaining in Germany.</span> <span id="s204">And that was closed, but [indecipherable] very long, except I think they tortured us there, but that’s the teachers.</span> <span id="s205">Because every morning, before anything else, we had to run for about half an hour through the woods, hilly and through the woods.</span> <span id="s206">There was a command, wald lauf, which means wood – running through the wood.</span> <span id="s207">And none of the guys, and there were – they always were may – everybody who went there remembered, that was the worst command that was given there.</span> <span id="s208">But then when that school closed after Kristallnacht – we did not experience anything at Kristallnacht, at that school, but it was closed afterwards.</span> <span id="s209">And the different buildings were sold to various people.</span> <span id="s210">And the person who bought the boys’ dormitory was Field Marshal Rommel.</span> <span id="s211">So I lived – I lived in – slept in Rommel’s house before he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: My goodness.</span> <span id="s213">So, after the school closed, where did you go to then?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Well, I went for a short time back to Mannheim, there was a Jewish school there, and I went there for a couple of weeks, and then I went to Kindertransport.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: So, where were your sisters during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Friend of our – that friends of ours took my sisters to Holland, couple days after the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: And they put them into private families, and they were treated very well.</span> <span id="s219">The first one was manufacturers of a cheese – of a cheese man – at a cheese factory in a town called Budehaven(ph), which is in the – one of the bra-branches of the Rhine, before it gets into the North Sea.</span> <span id="s220">And – but then they couldn’t stay there very long because it’s – the wife got very ill and they couldn’t – they couldn’t do it any more.</span> <span id="s221">And then they went to another family, where the father was a diamond merchant.</span> <span id="s222">They lived in a tremendously big house, and they sent their kids, including m-my sisters to the best school in Holland, which is the same school that the present queen attended.</span> <span id="s223">Not at the same time.</span> <span id="s224">She’s younger.</span> <span id="s225">But it’s the kind of a reputation of the – that time current princess was s-scheduled to go to that school and it’s probably – it’s probably wa – the best high sc – high school or something like this in Holland.</span> <span id="s226">Because of that it got that royal ey – interjection.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s228">So when you went from the boarding school in Germany, back home, was – did your parents discuss with you that you were going to be leaving on the Kindertransport?</span> <span id="s229">Like did you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yeah, when we became available, it was [indecipherable] short notice.</span> <span id="s231">It didn’t – I think it was in about January ’39, or something like that.</span> <span id="s232">No, and then my father was arrested and until then he could practice because he was a wounded veteran of World War I. And then he was put in Dachau for a while.</span> <span id="s233">And then he was later released because he was able to get sponsorship by – by the Bishop of Litchfield in England.</span> <span id="s234">A funny thing, on one of our trips, when my parents were visiting me up in Italy, there was a lady staying in the same hotel as my parents were staying, and they became friendly, and she was a secretary to the b – to the Bishop of Litchfield, and somehow my mother contacted her and – which they could do and so there was a way, people – some adults could go there, and he spent time til – he probably went there in January or February ’39, and he stayed there til April ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s236">So, how long was he in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I don’t know, about three or four weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s239">So, when he came back, you – were you in Mannheim?</span> <span id="s240">Or were you still at the school and –</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No, I was – I was in Holland already.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s243">So what – what kind of things did you have to do to prepare to leave?</span> <span id="s244">Like what kind of things did you pack, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: No, it’s no different than going to a boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Right, I guess, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I mean, I had my experience, having been in four boarding schools; three – three in Italy, and one in Germany, and so I – I pretty well knew what was needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: So you – did you feel – do you recall leaving your family?</span> <span id="s249">Was it different than the other times you had left for boarding schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No.</span> <span id="s251">So this was in the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s253">You took a train there, to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s255">We first – they took it from Mannheim, then they had us stay overnight, either in Frankfurt, or in Cologne, I forgot.</span> <span id="s256">And they collected people from other locations, and they put them on a common train and took us into Rotterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Where did you go from Rotterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Well, we first of all, I had – at Rotterdam we stayed for a while in the quarantine station.</span> <span id="s259">That happened to – every port at that time had a quarantine station.</span> <span id="s260">And – cause they didn’t know whether the sailors came back with tropical illnesses or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s261">But there was a facility, was guarded by Dutch military.</span> <span id="s262">We could not leave, but we could have visitors.</span> <span id="s263">For instance, my sisters and theirs – and their foster parents, that cheese manufacturer, they came and visited me there.</span> <span id="s264">But we stayed in big barracks.</span> <span id="s265">There wasn’t much to do, but then a short time afterwards, I was able to go do what is mispronounced in the States as gouda, what should be pronounced howda(ph).</span> <span id="s266">And there we were in a – in an old orphanage, and in that orphanage we also had quite a few refugee teachers.</span> <span id="s267">And since the academic training some of the kids had, was quite different between them.</span> <span id="s268">And if you were, let’s say at – some more advanced training in languages and literature and math or science, and you had the math teacher there, and you knew you were interested in that, he really spent a lot of time.</span> <span id="s269">But I must give credit for being able to graduate from a U.S. high school on the week of my 16th birthday, after having been in the country about 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: That’s pretty impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: And I still had language problems with it, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: What language did you speak when you were in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: I think – well, among the kids where we were staying, there was primarily German, and the teachers, these were all German speaking teachers.</span> <span id="s274">[indecipherable] it’s a mass instruction, only you had literature, you had German literature.</span> <span id="s275">Maybe a little – little English, or I don’t know, we spo – we learned some Dutch, we had some Dutch people coming in and –</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: But you lived primarily with other German children?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s279">How long were you in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Well, from about January ’39 til April ’40.</span> <span id="s281">And I was in – after about – I was for a short time in Amsterdam, which was also a quarantine station, it was a holding place.</span> <span id="s282">And they did a few things – for instance, I learned glass blowing there.</span> <span id="s283">But very primitive, I mean, the very beginnings of it.</span> <span id="s284">But they kept – they had some vocational instructors.</span> <span id="s285">And then I went to Wieringen.</span> <span id="s286">Now that is a important place.</span> <span id="s287">It is what used to be known as an aliyah ca – preparation camp.</span> <span id="s288">Familiar with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: For – the term?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Mm-mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Aliyah.</span> <span id="s293">That is the mo – Zionist movement to go – preparing you to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s294">So we had academic training, and we had agricultural training, and vocational training.</span> <span id="s295">And this is the first time I was involved with oil and gas, because we f – they found out the thing is, for the training, this – that was in the place of the Zuiderzee, which had been reclaimed from the sea, that land.</span> <span id="s296">But you had swamp gas coming up through the water.</span> <span id="s297">And we collected the swamp gas and f – and had the equipment, that it could be used productively for heating and agricultural and cooking things.</span> <span id="s298">And this is not in the area of – farther east in Groningen, where they discovered afterward were two – some very big gas fields.</span> <span id="s299">But this is probably not related.</span> <span id="s300">I never heard of this, what we found there, because it was only bubbling up.</span> <span id="s301">And we had a container that collected it, and so we – they had – we built, and then we did agricultural things.</span> <span id="s302">For instance, it’s interesting using that kind of a country place to prepare people for Israel, where this was too much water, as compared to Israel having lack of water.</span> <span id="s303">But they – they built that particular facility there, and it was a productive fa-farm.</span> <span id="s304">I think they produced or – everything was consumed that was produced.</span> <span id="s305">They raised all kind of big animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Were you in contact with your family at this – at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Were they in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No, my mother was in Germany.</span> <span id="s310">She did not go to England because her parents were too old to go to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: But your father was in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Wha-What was your – tell me about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Well, my mother was born in Berlin, but her parents moved to Mannheim when they retired, when they got old enough, they needed somebody, one of their children to – when the mother – my mother, taking care of the thing.</span> <span id="s315">And then she is – was academically trained, she never got her full degree, but she couldn’t make up her mind whether to study law or medicine.</span> <span id="s316">She did some of each, but never finished it – it, and after – when the war had started, and after Paris had fallen, and the Vichy government was established, they made that province, which was Baden, which is where Mannheim, Heidelberg ar-are located, they made it Judenfrei.</span> <span id="s317">Free of Jews, and they de-deported all of them to a concentration camp in the Pyrenees called conda – called Gurs, g-u-r-s.</span> <span id="s318">You heard about that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Yeah, I know that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s321">[indecipherable] Gurs.</span> <span id="s322">Actually the – the S is not pronounced in – in the French thing, and she stayed there for a while, together with her mother.</span> <span id="s323">Her father did not survive the transport.</span> <span id="s324">And – yeah.</span> <span id="s325">They lived pretty well in the mud.</span> <span id="s326">These – this was built for Spanish loyalists who fled across from Spain to the French border, when they were being defeated.</span> <span id="s327">And so it didn’t have too many comfort, it was for young military people, but there was – food was somewhat limited.</span> <span id="s328">But since my mother was fluent in French, she was part of the delegation that went to local farmers and try – tried to talk them out of more food, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s329">And then she and her mother were transferred to Marseilles, and my mother had a vi-visa to go to the States also.</span> <span id="s330">Otherwi – in the meantime, lotsa thing; I had been – we had been in the States.</span> <span id="s331">I went from Holland, picked up – we picked up my f – my sisters and I, we picked up my father in Southampton, and went to the States.</span> <span id="s332">And then we lived in New York for a while.</span> <span id="s333">But then my mother was in Marseilles, and she was able to catch a boat, a French boat that was going to Martinique, which is the – one of the French states or provinces.</span> <span id="s334">And – but since France, Vichy, France was at war with England, a British warship captured that ship and brought it into Trinidad.</span> <span id="s335">So they were interned as, I guess enemy aliens in Trinidad.</span> <span id="s336">But then from there we were in contact with her in the States, we were able to get arrangements to get a boat to go from Trinidad to New York.</span> <span id="s337">And she just got there in time to see me graduate from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Let’s – let’s back up, back to you being in Holland.</span> <span id="s339">So y – how long – how long were you in Holland, total?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Let’s see.</span> <span id="s341">’39 to – about 14 months.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: So how did you get from Holland to America?</span> <span id="s343">Did you have to get a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s345">That visa had been put in, and there was – when it came, you know, number came up, and somebody was – from the committee there, took us to the pier.</span> <span id="s346">We left from na – we didn’t leave from Holland, we left from Belgium.</span> <span id="s347">The ship left in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s348">And then by that time, Germany and England were already at war.</span> <span id="s349">And we went to – on the way to Southampton we spotted floating mines near Southampton, but none of them were set up.</span> <span id="s350">I saw them later on when I went from France to England – from England to France with the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s351">And the other G.I.s tried to shoot and set off the floating mines, but they never hit the right spot.</span> <span id="s352">You got a pl-place about this big, at a long distance, to – you know, this is to set it off [indecipherable] point.</span> <span id="s353">If you just hit the body, the body of the floating mine is heavy steel, and the machine guns did not penetrate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: But anyhow –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Where did your sa – where did your family settle when you emigrated to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: First we were staying with the family of my father’s brother, who had been there for a while.</span> <span id="s358">And – in Manhattan, on 91st Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: And you – you attended high school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Was it difficult ler – did you have to learn the language?</span> <span id="s362">Had you spoken English before?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: So was –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: But I learned it after a while, and they – I – the teachers were actually excellent.</span> <span id="s366">That was a – not a particular prestigious high school.</span> <span id="s367">In fact, about half of them came from Harlem, and one-third c-came from Hell’s Kitchen.</span> <span id="s368">So the teachers were very happy to have some kids who had more academic training.</span> <span id="s369">In fact, the interesting situation, the kids who made the honor roll, two-thirds of them were foreign born.</span> <span id="s370">The ones who competed for valedictorian, nearly all of them spoke with an accent.</span> <span id="s371">I don’t – I was competing for it, but I had a big argument with my English teacher, who was a reviewer of the thing, and an argument when we read Julius Caesar, and I argued with her when – either, I think, either Cassius or [indecipherable] says, I forgot, because he was ambitious, I killed him.</span> <span id="s372">And I wrote my speech on the necessity for ambition.</span> <span id="s373">And the teacher recognized that argument I had with her, so I was blackballed on that.</span> <span id="s374">I had made the honor roll when I graduated, but I did not get the valedictorian speech.</span> <span id="s375">But then I did something else.</span> <span id="s376">Since I had such a mixed up previous education, I went to the different departments, and in some case I took a regent examination, and I passed it and then I got credit for the course, that got me through that fast.</span> <span id="s377">And some of them I just talked my way, I think.</span> <span id="s378">I got some credits in art appreciation because I reviewed all the things I had seen in the – in the Italian and the Dutch and the German museums.</span> <span id="s379">And I could distinguish different schools of painting and stuff like that, because my parents were very insistent when we went to these museums that I could identify what it was, or who the – and I convinced them that I knew enough about art appreciation, I could get credit for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Good for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: And I got all these language credits, and I did all right on math.</span> <span id="s382">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: You have a very diverse education.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yeah, then, the only thing is, I had to take fo – you had to take eight semesters of high school English, and I – I doubled up on them.</span> <span id="s385">They let me do that.</span> <span id="s386">And in fact, I don’t know, I even got in one of the honor classes.</span> <span id="s387">I don’t know how I ever did that, but – and I think maybe I ever had done more reading, not only in English, but in things in the international literature.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So you graduated from high school when you were 16, and then did you join –</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: 16 and a day, I was very old.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Oh, right after your birthday.</span> <span id="s391">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s393">Graduation – some gi – schools graduated on Tuesday, some Wednesday, some Thursday.</span> <span id="s394">My school graduated on Thursday.</span> <span id="s395">They only had so many caps and gowns to go around.</span> <span id="s396">If I would have been on Tuesday school, I would have made it with 15.</span> <span id="s397">Wednesday was my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: What did you do after graduation?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Well, I – I was a – that summer I was a junior con – a swimming counselor in a camp, and then shortly thereafter, my parents moved to Ohio, and I couldn’t get a decent job because of my age.</span> <span id="s400">Even as a draftsman, they thought I might prick myself with a pencil.</span> <span id="s401">But those days the labor laws were ridiculous for a 16 year old, and said, why don’t you go back to high school?</span> <span id="s402">I said, I graduated from there.</span> <span id="s403">So I got some helper jobs, not very much and I started to do some vocational training, I went to a local high school and I took some evening courses in machine shop.</span> <span id="s404">I hadn’t done much work in machine shop, but I was interested in those things.</span> <span id="s405">And then, shortly before we got into war, we had defense preparatory courses offered by different schools.</span> <span id="s406">And since I was in Columbus, Ohio, Ohio State provide that course, and I took some of these courses, which were non-credit courses.</span> <span id="s407">But when I bec – later on when I was able to afford to go to college, I talked to the prof who taught me the courses I had on [indecipherable] and I convinced him I didn’t have to take the course, he would give me academic credit for it.</span> <span id="s408">So that helped me.</span> <span id="s409">And I had – in fact, one of the guys was, i-in one of the fields, the number one man in the country, who happened to be the head of the department for engineering drawing at Ohio State.</span> <span id="s410">So, and then I went full time, from the beginning of ’42 until November of ’43.</span> <span id="s411">In the meantime, I got a letter called greetings, your neighbors want you to represent them in the armed forces.</span> <span id="s412">So the day – the day before Thanksgiving ’43 was my first day active duty.</span> <span id="s413">And on Thanksgiving day was my first day of KP.</span> <span id="s414">And that was a big job that time.</span> <span id="s415">Then I spent time in the army, I was being – with engineering back on – they put me into a signal corps, which, I mean, technical things, and then I went to something called ASTP, are you familiar with that term?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: N-No.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: It was Army Specialized Training Program.</span> <span id="s418">What they had there, they didn’t know how long the war would last, and since no new kids were graduating from college, or very few, they had programs to give academic training and provide people for leadership and more responsibility later on.</span> <span id="s419">And they had it in two different – in several fields, one of them was linguistically, and the other one was engineering.</span> <span id="s420">So I went to the University of Illinois, where they tested me, and I qualified both for language and for engineering.</span> <span id="s421">But I f – was looking long term, so I signed up for the engineering type, and they sent me to Rutgers University for about six months, to study engineering.</span> <span id="s422">And I got this – these were academic courses, so I got credit later on at Ohio State for the work I did there.</span> <span id="s423">And then, as they figured the war seems to have been coming to the end, this was after D-Day, and they looked like this – this program was sending kids to college, was terminating, so I applied – I figured engineering and languages, I applied for military government transfer.</span> <span id="s424">But somehow they didn’t – somehow they figured they needed me for military intelligence.</span> <span id="s425">So they sent me to Camp Ritchie, if you ever heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: The so called Ritchie boys.</span> <span id="s428">This was – Camp Ritchie is in – near Hagerstown, Maryland, and this was the military intelligence training center.</span> <span id="s429">In fact, there’s a very good movie out, was made by a German company, called, “The Ritchie Boys,” and what happened, i-it was quite – it was very fair.</span> <span id="s430">They took people who had a certain high I.Q. – I forgot what the army called the thing right now – and they were fluent in a language that was of interest; German or Italian or French.</span> <span id="s431">We were not that much concerned with eastern European languages.</span> <span id="s432">And they had a similar thing on the west coast, in br – in Monterey, for people who were – were interested in Asiatic languages, and getting involved there.</span> <span id="s433">So I got to that camp, which they cou – on my orders I’d even – couldn’t even say where I’m going to.</span> <span id="s434">And that movie they made about it, I don’t know whether Holocaust Museum has – hat that, it’s – but it’s – but it’s a very interesting link.</span> <span id="s435">And these people did all kind of jobs, interrogation of prisoners during wa – during the fighting.</span> <span id="s436">And the most famous attendee of that school was Henry Kissinger.</span> <span id="s437">But he graduated from there before I – I went there.</span> <span id="s438">And what happened?</span> <span id="s439">We – when we were finished, we knew more about the German military, the civil service, the reliability, things, when people were – were promoted on certain jobs, they had certain jobs, which ones were considered highly – higher the liability for the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s440">Or some of them were just – because the skill of somebody was, let’s say, the county engineer.</span> <span id="s441">Well, that’s because he si – knew how to put in sewer systems.</span> <span id="s442">But – and the – was – and I d – I didn’t get finished with that til after V-E Day, so was lucky when I went overseas, I didn’t have to do any fighting.</span> <span id="s443">But I was involved in a lot of interesting episodes.</span> <span id="s444">I was in, for instance, typically in my favorite stories, things that happened.</span> <span id="s445">There were – for instance, when there was a security raid in the occupation, because U.S. Army was invo – [indecipherable] was concerned that the Germans might pull Operation Werwolf.</span> <span id="s446">That was the same thing, the name – tag name they gave to what the French were doing with the Maquis.</span> <span id="s447">Resistance.</span> <span id="s448">So they tried to undermine it.</span> <span id="s449">I know – so they, sometimes they had raids and thing, looking for weapons, and looking for people that were on the [indecipherable] list.</span> <span id="s450">And wa – they had guys like me, assigned to battalion headquarter, and if they brought in something that was suspicious, I had to give it for a screening.</span> <span id="s451">I know one time they brought in a guy with a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a red cap.</span> <span id="s452">And I looked at him and I looked his I.D. and I looked at his brass button, and it said RB, which means Reichsbahn.</span> <span id="s453">And said, take that guy back to the railway station, he is the station master.</span> <span id="s454">But the normal G.I. wouldn’t know th-that guy from another guy with a German uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: That’s funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: So this is a – this was some of the funny things, but I mean, I could – you could see they had support.</span> <span id="s457">I mean, people like myself, and colleagues of mine, who could thought things out.</span> <span id="s458">Not that they think they gotta arrest a guy because he wears a uniform.</span> <span id="s459">But he just – the kind of thing that I think is a funny story.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: How long were you in Germany with the army?</span> <span id="s461">Were you – you were stationed in Germany, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Oh, let’s see.</span> <span id="s465">I got there, let’s see, it was probably about from September or October ’45, til – and the story gets complicated before it gets cleared up – and I stayed there until December ’47.</span> <span id="s466">And then I was also involved in war crimes trials.</span> <span id="s467">I was an investigator for one of the guys who got accused, got indicted for the Nuremberg trials, but he was never tried, because we could not get good evidence on him.</span> <span id="s468">Plus when we blew his safe and found all kind of thi – interesting things on there, including a letter from the Kaiser, because the guy was very important in World War I.</span> <span id="s469">The biggest gun in World War I was named after his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Big Bertha.</span> <span id="s472">Did you ever hear about that?</span> <span id="s473">That gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: It was the – then – the guy was Alfred Krupp, from the Krupp factory, munitions maker and steel factory.</span> <span id="s476">And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials and I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, who was the prosecutor for Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s477">And I attended one of these meetings; they said, as you investigate, you gotta look for two things.</span> <span id="s478">Cri – preparing for and conducting aggressive warfare.</span> <span id="s479">That we found Krupp, because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing them, and things of that nature – other war material.</span> <span id="s480">The other one was crimes against humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s481">And this ma – old man, Krupp – and I have a lot of his personal history, to – was in – retired, I think because of health reasons, about the same t – about the time Paris fell.</span> <span id="s482">So that’s before slave labor because a problem.</span> <span id="s483">And his son took over.</span> <span id="s484">So – and he and his son didn’t get along at all.</span> <span id="s485">And so he had – the – the old man didn’t have anything to do with the operation of the factory, or their personnel, or policies.</span> <span id="s486">He was there collecting his retirement pay, and that’s about all.</span> <span id="s487">In fact, it’s an interesting situation, that this guy is, when he was born, was not – his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp, who was very big before World War I, who built up the factory a lot, Alfred Krupp, and he ha – only had daughters, he had no sons.</span> <span id="s488">But he wanted to perpetuate the name and the family.</span> <span id="s489">So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of the Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.</span> <span id="s490">So he maintained his nobility name, but he main – he kept his – kept the Krupp name in the family.</span> <span id="s491">So there was a special edict, I don’t know what year that was done, but it’s an interesting situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Yeah, it is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: And I used to have si – copy of his – I used to have his passport for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Were there any other cases, like war crime trials that you worked on?</span> <span id="s497">The cr – the Krupp case and –</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Yeah, that was the only one for Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s499">But then I worked for – well, again by the pe – if I talk about things you know, I me – stop me.</span> <span id="s500">During the Yalta Conference, where they decided the war crime trial concept, said there was people who were involved on an international basis, who were supposed to be tried by the international court, which were then Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s501">But things had happened, like concentration camp or slave labor, in the countries whose zone of occupation was – was war crimes against individuals of that nationality, were supposed to be tried by courts of that ka – courts of that cor – of that nationality.</span> <span id="s502">For instance, again, there’s an interesting history which is – don’t know whether – how well known that was, when the – when the – when – during the fighting, U.S. troops got as far as the Elba river.</span> <span id="s503">That meant they went past – through Thüringen where the ca – main town is Weimar, and where also Buchenwald was located there, just nearby there.</span> <span id="s504">And then, after the – they rearranged the zones and – and that area of Weimar became Russian zone.</span> <span id="s505">So, since we had the evidence, like lampshades made from human bl – from human skin, and SS guards and oth – and all kind of stuff, including the wife of the former commandant, Ilse Koch, and – more about her later.</span> <span id="s506">I said I have a long history of – [indecipherable] history.</span> <span id="s507">And so – so we moved before our troops withdrew from that area, and the Russians moved in.</span> <span id="s508">We took all the stuff and put it into a facility in Dachau.</span> <span id="s509">We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage facilities to store the evidence.</span> <span id="s510">And there was a mission.</span> <span id="s511">Since – since Buchenwald was supposed to be tried by Russia, and since this is the Russian zone, we – we had a team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all that stuff that had been collected, and they – the lawyers put it into a legal documentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence.</span> <span id="s512">But the wi – Russians refused to accept it.</span> <span id="s513">They did not want to annoy the Germans.</span> <span id="s514">It’s in their zone, they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that Germany look bad.</span> <span id="s515">So they refused to do this.</span> <span id="s516">And so about – that was before Churchill spoke about the Iron Curtain.</span> <span id="s517">That was Russia did not live up to its commitment under the Yalta Conference.</span> <span id="s518">So it’s – for many years later – about two years later they would – the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I participated in that one.</span> <span id="s519">There were some interesting people [indecipherable] were there, and later on I got into the war crimes trials in Dachau – in Dachau.</span> <span id="s520">The U.S. trials.</span> <span id="s521">And one of the most in – at times I wasn’t sure I was going to do that.</span> <span id="s522">For a while I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and was [indecipherable] court interpreter.</span> <span id="s523">Was sometimes assistant to the judge, because they had terms, which different people translated different ways.</span> <span id="s524">And they were – the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to them, what – how it happened?</span> <span id="s525">And then I had to figure out these were the same – translating it back into German, these were the same organization.</span> <span id="s526">So, and – but there was – there was some interesting people there.</span> <span id="s527">Probably the most famous – one of the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto Skorzeny.</span> <span id="s528">Did you ever heard about that name?</span> <span id="s529">Otto Skorzeny was the commander of the German Ranger.</span> <span id="s530">In fact, he became famous.</span> <span id="s531">After the Italian partisans had ca-captured Mussolini and kept him on top of a mountain as a prisoner, his ranger unit, with gliders and with mountain troops, stormed that place and rescued Mussolini.</span> <span id="s532">The partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but – but that was the guy.</span> <span id="s533">And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge, because he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them all in German – in American uniforms, to go behind our lines – through our lines and disturb things, maybe destroy signal equipment and put on markers, direction signs, turn them around and to ca – and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge, the aim of the Rumsted(ph) offensive was to capture Antwerp.</span> <span id="s534">And he was an important part, but he was being tried – tried [indecipherable] for that.</span> <span id="s535">But there was an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s536">The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from Atlanta, who had – he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense counselor in war crimes trials.</span> <span id="s537">But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because there was a guy who was – I don’t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he had some lawyer assistance.</span> <span id="s538">And he found out that you cannot get anybody on espionage, or sabotage.</span> <span id="s539">These are ruses of war.</span> <span id="s540">As long as you are not – as long as you are caught – not caught in the other country’s uniform.</span> <span id="s541">There were some of his men who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot.</span> <span id="s542">But he was caught later on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s543">Therefore that stopped it and he was acquitted.</span> <span id="s544">And then he became other things, he was – became the chief of security for Egypt.</span> <span id="s545">He was sometimes – there was a – were some articles written, the most dangerous man in Europe, because he had that wartime experience, and he was helping Egypt.</span> <span id="s546">But didn’t do much good.</span> <span id="s547">Egyptians didn’t do so well in the Six Day War.</span> <span id="s548">But – so, and then there was also, during the Buchenwald trial, there was this wa – wa – fo – the widow of the commandant, and she had been a widow for many years, but she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s549">And they tried to find out whether it was a Polish guard.</span> <span id="s550">There were – a lot of the guard people were Polish DPs.</span> <span id="s551">And they were all right.</span> <span id="s552">And the Americans pretty well liked them, the only per – only one person didn’t like the Polish guards.</span> <span id="s553">There was th – my dog.</span> <span id="s554">He always barked at them.</span> <span id="s555">And he was a interesting dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: What kind of dog was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: It was a German Shepherd, a relatively small one.</span> <span id="s558">But he was very good pedigree, because the couple – the dogs that bred him, used to belong to the German Field Marshal Mordell, who, when he lost the [indecipherable] in the – after U.S. troops had moved east of the Rhine river, he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s559">Right before that, he gave his matched pair of dogs to a local farmer.</span> <span id="s560">And I found out about those dogs.</span> <span id="s561">And he bred them, and I got one of his offsprings.</span> <span id="s562">But then, the kind of situations that people do – in the thing, for instance, I was stationed in Dachau that time, and we had took a barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners, and we dro – got a couple veterinarians and a couple farm boys, and we had a veterinary clinic, because some of us had to go out of town for a couple of weeks, so we left the dogs there.</span> <span id="s563">But they were too – even too dumb to make sure they had all the medicine, so they died of distemper.</span> <span id="s564">Dist – the medicine was not easily available in Germany, but we could have send it, call – contacted our parents and have it sent from the States.</span> <span id="s565">So the dog did not – did not survive.</span> <span id="s566">But this is – but lot of the G.I.s had these thing.</span> <span id="s567">And by the way, if you keep pe – these people busy, I was working for a while, that was before that, in an internment camp, where they had people who – who were not accused of anything, but they were considered security risks, because they had really high positions in the party, or in civil service, or in the military.</span> <span id="s568">That’s primary – not in the general army, but in the S.S. or something like that.</span> <span id="s569">And they were housed in German army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had all the heat, the hot water, they had decent food, which was short at that time, but they were bored.</span> <span id="s570">So we arranged with them, a craft shop.</span> <span id="s571">Some of them were very handy.</span> <span id="s572">And I have – still have at home, four paintings which – watercolors, about this size, which the guy did from memory, and they are very nice paintings, and I really treasure them.</span> <span id="s573">And they were – didn’t have much stuff, they were [indecipherable] canvas, they were the back of the ration boxes.</span> <span id="s574">So they improvised, and I got them home, I got them framed.</span> <span id="s575">And they didn’t want to get paid in money.</span> <span id="s576">They said, if you do – if it’s – you know, we – well, it was good relationship between these craftsmen and the G.I.s.</span> <span id="s577">They said no, I would appreciate it rather, if you would send a package with some chocolates or some other candy to my wife or to my kids.</span> <span id="s578">And we got that at the PX.</span> <span id="s579">So it’s, again, the people who had – we were sorting out who was a real security risk, who was – on the war crimes wanted list that was put down – put out by all the countries, sorting things out, and these were primarily the guys, the Ritchie boys.</span> <span id="s580">And they were very young guys.</span> <span id="s581">I think our detachment commander, he was old, he was 21 years old.</span> <span id="s582">He was a second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s583">But this – oh, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: No, you’re fine.</span> <span id="s585">Oops, here.</span> <span id="s586">Okay.</span> <span id="s587">It’s still recording, we’re good.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Okay, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: No disconnects?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Nope, nope, we’re – we’re – we’re good.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: All right, I’m sti – we’re still wired.</span> <span id="s597">So – interesting thing is while I was in – investigating in that [indecipherable] team, I met a young lady who was the – a telephone operator for the British organization, it was British zone of occupation.</span> <span id="s598">And she had been a telephone operator for the German post office, the post office was running the telephone system in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s599">And then she was delegated to be the private telephone operator for the state adjutant general.</span> <span id="s600">I mean, she was very good in it, to get that particular thing.</span> <span id="s601">And then when the British took over, she went – became telephone operator for one of the British headquarters.</span> <span id="s602">There was a [indecipherable] commission, they – since this is the area where the – which produced the most coal, and they rationed the coal allocations through all the occupation areas.</span> <span id="s603">And we got quite involved, to the extent that she was my wife, through the war part.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Hanni, h-a-double n-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: What was maiden – her maiden last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Sessilman(ph).</span> <span id="s612">So, I mean, she was basically – she was Aryan and she was involved in the BDM and competing in the contests they have for different things.</span> <span id="s613">And no, we had a very good marriage of 62 years, and she died day after Christmas last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Sorry to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: So when we got married in Dachau, by the mayor of Dachau.</span> <span id="s616">In fact, we were, I think the second couple involving a G.I. and a war bride, that was married by that guy.</span> <span id="s617">But he gave an endlessly long speech, and we were then supposed to have a reception at the officers’ club.</span> <span id="s618">And we were getting late and late, so when we finally got through, we told the driver to step on it, and we got a speeding ticket from the MPs.</span> <span id="s619">But then we had a reception at the – or a din – a nice dinner at the [indecipherable] club.</span> <span id="s620">And – and a band and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: F-For – ’47.</span> <span id="s623">In fact, this is one reason when the – I stayed longer in Europe than I had to, because when I was supposed to come back for discharge, come back to the States, I could not bring my – I could not get married, I was – as a G.I. you had to get permission by the military to marry, and I could not get that permission, and without that she couldn’t come to the States.</span> <span id="s624">So, since there was a shortage of people, they offered all kind of incentives for people to stay there if they had certain skills.</span> <span id="s625">And I stayed there as a civilian, where I made quite a bit more money, but I was a – they had a uniform for the civilians.</span> <span id="s626">So – and it was important that you wore some service ribbons, that meant you were not a carpetbagger.</span> <span id="s627">Some guys, they just went there and never in the service, but the fact that you were in the service, you were accepted by them.</span> <span id="s628">And we could go to the R and R centers in the – near the Alps and used to have some good times over the weekends.</span> <span id="s629">And was on a lake, and early morning there had to be a festival.</span> <span id="s630">And then you went on a sailboat.</span> <span id="s631">They rigged it for you, you didn’t have to rig it yourself, and then we sailed until lunchtime.</span> <span id="s632">And then there was a – then there’d be a party in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s633">So – and with an oompah-pah bands and all this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s634">No, this is the – G.I.s at that particular time, if they could get to those places, the army took good care of them.</span> <span id="s635">Except one thing is, there was one of the experiences my wife had.</span> <span id="s636">We went to a place where we knew there was an R and R center, we went there, but we did not know that was for blacks.</span> <span id="s637">But we asked them whether we could have lunch there.</span> <span id="s638">Said yes.</span> <span id="s639">But then we sat on a table, and there was some blacks sitting on the table, they said, hey you, you can’t sit there with them.</span> <span id="s640">That’s – that was the U.S. military in ’46 - ’47, before Truman integrated the military in – forgot again the year that was.</span> <span id="s641">Yeah, I think it was one of the first things he did.</span> <span id="s642">I think he did that after – after V-J Day.</span> <span id="s643">Well, okay, then we got married there, and we could go over – we went back to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Where did you settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: I went back to Columbus, Ohio, where my parents were living.</span> <span id="s648">And I went back to Ohio State and got my degree.</span> <span id="s649">In fact, three weeks ago, I was elect – I was titled distinguished alumnus from Ohio State, for engineering department.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Oh, congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s652">I got – had quite a bit of involvement with the – I was member of a industry review board to advise profs what kind of things are strong, that industry needs and they sho – should emph – things they should emphasize.</span> <span id="s653">For instance, one of my biggest complaint, I think that’s not only with engineers, but with other people, too – you went to college, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Which one did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Well, I bounced around, but I graduated from North Dakota State University.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I see, okay.</span> <span id="s658">North Dakota.</span> <span id="s659">I’ve not spent any – I spent quite a bit of time in Wyoming, and I used to go to South Dakota to go skiing at the – was it Black Hills, or – yeah, I used to go skiing in the Black Hills.</span> <span id="s660">Whenever I had – I was in – in Gillette, Wyoming.</span> <span id="s661">I was working in a coal mine there.</span> <span id="s662">And let’s see – no, this is – no, this was quite interesting, to get the – to work with the profs and do things, and this is – yeah, I mean, the things I said, which is something wa – most universities make a big mistake.</span> <span id="s663">When you went to college, whatever you studied, when you wrote a term paper, or had to give a report, who was your target audience?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: My professor.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s666">Somebody who knew much more about it than you did.</span> <span id="s667">In real life, most of the people deal with people that know less about it.</span> <span id="s668">For instance, when I learned about computer, they told me to toggle over, and I looked for a toggle switch.</span> <span id="s669">I mean, the kind of terminology.</span> <span id="s670">Doctors are great for using terms which nobody understands unless you’re a doctor yourself.</span> <span id="s671">Engineers do that too, accountants at times, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Everybody does.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s674">Th-That’s where you were trained.</span> <span id="s675">And I was trying to get the school to mandate that the ki – that the students take a course in public speaking.</span> <span id="s676">True non-specialists in – let’s see, what is that organization that gives speeches?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Toastmake –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Toastmakers?</span> <span id="s680">Toastmakers?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, Toastmaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Oh, Toastmaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s684">The kind of a thing that they do there by which you are asked to give, for instance, this is something I either learned in the military, then when I get back, after I started working there, I also went back in the reserve.</span> <span id="s685">And I progressed quite a bit there, and I commanded a unit, and I had some fun with something.</span> <span id="s686">It was [indecipherable] we had inspection from a guy from Washington coming, I don’t know, from headquarters.</span> <span id="s687">And I kn-knew about it, when that was, and I scheduled commanders time.</span> <span id="s688">And one of my favorite things to schedule there is – it was during the Eisenhower administration, [indecipherable] for peace.</span> <span id="s689">And I was involved in building the first commercial nuclear plant in this country.</span> <span id="s690">And so I talked about how they operate and I had the drawings all over the wall, and – til I found out the inspector hadn’t heard about that, but I could put it in a way that this guy who was maybe an accountant or something like that, or an auditor could fo – could follow it.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: And so in fact, I had some fun.</span> <span id="s693">I had my senior non-com was a high school teacher, and I made a deal with him: whenever I gave a lecture – and I had to do that once a week, we met once a week and – for two hours – one hour I had to do the work; he critiqued it.</span> <span id="s694">He took notes, what I did well, what I didn’t do well: talking too fast, not getting things organized, talking to the blackboard, all that kind of mistake.</span> <span id="s695">Using terms that were not defined.</span> <span id="s696">So after the meetings, we went to the nearby legion post and we both had beer, and he gave me a critique.</span> <span id="s697">And I am very thankful for what he has done for me.</span> <span id="s698">And I have addressed, I think last year at Ohio State, I addressed a group of about 400 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Wow, that’s incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeah, so it’s – I – I feel comfortable with doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Yeah, you’ve had lots of practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: You’re have lots of practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yeah, right, yeah.</span> <span id="s705">Doing that and then back in the engineering part, I had to testify, or talk to governmental agencies.</span> <span id="s706">Like one time in Canada and one time in Malaysia.</span> <span id="s707">Kuala Lumpur.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Malaysia, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: We were doing something that was non-standard, and I had to defend it.</span> <span id="s710">So there were a lot of people, some of them were technically trained, some were not.</span> <span id="s711">Why we’re doing it, what we’re doing, what the risk was, and what the training was for to be done properly, and what the results are from the testing that had been done before.</span> <span id="s712">But I felt quite comfortable even talking to a foreign country like in Kuala Lumpur.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: I’m going to stop the – the track, and we’re going to start a new one, cause it’s almost –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Harry Ebert, conducted by Annie Erling, on the 16th of October, 2010, at the Kindertransport Association Conference at Arlington, Virginia.</span> <span id="s718">So, do you have any children with Hanni?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: No, no, we decided we didn’t want any.</span> <span id="s720">But I have nephews and nieces with whom I’m quite close, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Did you s – did you stay in Columbus, Ohio?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No, when I graduated, I went to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then I went to Marietta, Ohio.</span> <span id="s723">In fact, there I worked for a company, and they had a Marietta College, and they had some night courses in business related things, but to be an accredited thing where you could get a degree, they had to take some science courses.</span> <span id="s724">But the science faculty at Marietta College were so lazy, and they didn’t have a graduate school, so they didn’t have the graduate students who could – would teach those.</span> <span id="s725">So the – the dean of the gradu – of the night school got people out of industry.</span> <span id="s726">I was teaching physics, and engineering drawing, and they had some other people were teaching accounting and chemistry and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s727">So the wa – it was quite, quite interesting.</span> <span id="s728">In fact, it was like teaching liberal arts because maybe I talked about a different piece of equipment in a power plant, and some guy says, oh, I know all about it.</span> <span id="s729">This is depreciated over five years, because the guy was in accounting.</span> <span id="s730">But he had no idea what in the world it was doing, why it was there.</span> <span id="s731">So I tried to clear that up.</span> <span id="s732">No, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s733">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Is there anything else that you’d like to –</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Well, yeah, that’s – I’ve stayed – stayed in the military, and I got – had a – had – also had a – what was known as a mobilization designation.</span> <span id="s736">That meant – familiar with that term?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Mm-mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: That means you are training for a job that’s held by somebody else, in case a balloon goes up, one of you guys – maybe we’ll split the headquarter, and we need two people with that training, and I used – I did that, and I was in the intelligence branch.</span> <span id="s739">And one of the things that I was really trying to push, and we were successful – that was during the Cold War era, that we had linguistic training.</span> <span id="s740">People training in linguistic and it was all packed military items.</span> <span id="s741">We had several reserve units.</span> <span id="s742">We were lucky; the Cold War never got hot.</span> <span id="s743">We di – they didn’t have to be called up.</span> <span id="s744">Maybe some people got called up during the Berlin crisis, but well, there was not – then we were prepared, as compared – and I may be talking politics now, during the Gulf Wars, we had not – the government had not prepared linguists who could speak Arabic.</span> <span id="s745">I’m sure there are plenty guys around there who are maybe people who immigrated from Jordan, or immigrated from Israel or Palestine, or some of these – Egypt, or some of the other countries, who could handle these languages.</span> <span id="s746">And so it – it was – no, then, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s747">When I – I was working for Exxon for – as an engineering specialist for about 30 years, and I worked in 22 countries, often teaching courses there.</span> <span id="s748">And you learn some of the tricks of the trade of how teaching in a foreign country.</span> <span id="s749">For instance, I was giving a course in Japan, and I found a commercial book, or an advert – actually a catalog by a company that had published the same thing in English and in Japanese.</span> <span id="s750">I had the English one, so I got the Japanese one, and got one of those for each of my students from the supplier, and if I wanted a certain graph, maybe I had a slide, but then for the Japanese to read things about it, I would have in there saying E page 42, J page 52, so they could look up the reference material.</span> <span id="s751">Plus, the idea of simple sentences.</span> <span id="s752">Many p – and speaking very slowly.</span> <span id="s753">If I would have a foreign speaking audience – foreign language speaking audience, I would speak about this pace.</span> <span id="s754">And no k – no complicated sentences, which the French can do the conditionnel.</span> <span id="s755">I don’t know whether we use that in English, the conditional case.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: I’m bad at grammar.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I mean, when you insert, the green house, which is located on the next street.</span> <span id="s758">You know, by inserting that thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Is for sale.</span> <span id="s761">I mean, if that’s – that is loca – the next street.</span> <span id="s762">Make that a separate sentence.</span> <span id="s763">This is putting two thoughts together.</span> <span id="s764">So I had a lot of fun with that, and I stayed in some countries where – which generally are not known as being Jewish friendly, like Gaddafi’s Libya.</span> <span id="s765">I worked there for a while.</span> <span id="s766">I was about four times in Saudi Arabia, and I worked there, and recently, since I retired, I’m working for – part time for a company, and I was in United Emirates.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s768">You’ve traveled a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: That’s incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yeah, I said I worked in 22 countries, and I think I visited 52.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: But I didn’t – I always liked to go in the Far East.</span> <span id="s774">I used to – I used to enjoy Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan.</span> <span id="s775">And I – I really enjoyed Pakistan.</span> <span id="s776">And Pakistan was one of the most surprises.</span> <span id="s777">For instance, I was working there on a fertilizer plant, we were rebuilding things, and they – I had some young engineers.</span> <span id="s778">And about half the young engineers were indigenous females, and they were treated just as well, were given assignments equivalent to what the – the male engineers of the same experience level were getting.</span> <span id="s779">So when you, in some, I guess, in the primitive farm areas, this may be different, but in the industrial area, there is – you find out the f – the female is treated better.</span> <span id="s780">And we were sitting all together, having lunch and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: The only thing is, the guest house I was staying was next to a mosque, and they woke me up every morning when they called for prayer.</span> <span id="s783">So, I had a lot of fun with those things.</span> <span id="s784">I mean, this is the experiences.</span> <span id="s785">I said, I lived history, the same way.</span> <span id="s786">First time I was in Israel – in fact, to get there I was – had been in Pakistan, and I cou – they couldn’t f – you couldn’t fly from Pakistan to Israel, so I flew from Pakistan to Teheran, Iran, from – at that time there was – the shah was still in command.</span> <span id="s787">I – they could fly from Teheran to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s788">And I decided to do some sightseeing.</span> <span id="s789">But I figured, these old things, they have been around that long, fine.</span> <span id="s790">But it was my military background, I got myself a guide who was fighting in the Golan Heights, and we we went up the Golan Heights the same way his unit went up.</span> <span id="s791">I’m glad they cleared up all the mines.</span> <span id="s792">But it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s793">That’s another interesting experience dealing with that part of the world.</span> <span id="s794">We – this guy had – he was Israeli, he had some Arabic friends at one place, and we went there and I got some tea and some dates.</span> <span id="s795">Not dates with women, dates the food.</span> <span id="s796">And then there were – near there there was a warehouse, and there were some trucks parked.</span> <span id="s797">And these trucks had Israeli license plate, and he said – they had wing-nuts on them.</span> <span id="s798">He said, you loosen one of those wing-nuts.</span> <span id="s799">And they had Jordanese license plates.</span> <span id="s800">What happened?</span> <span id="s801">They were taking the famous Jaffa oranges – although it was not in Jaffa, it was farther west, but the same type, and transporting them to the Jordanese – to the border between Israel and Jordan, then change the license plate, and then moved to – all the way to Saudi, because Saudi had the money and they – they wanted the – the better food.</span> <span id="s802">So this is a kind of cooperation that the Israeli were aware what was going on and these Arabic farmers who were growing the oranges up there in [indecipherable] were making some money, and I guess the truck drivers got paid.</span> <span id="s803">So it was – no, I’ve been several times visiting Israel, but that was an interesting experience.</span> <span id="s804">Also, from the military point of view, there is a place just east of – east of Tel Aviv on a mountain called Kenkillya(ph).</span> <span id="s805">From there you could fire some of the bigger guns into Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s806">And I think the Israelis made a big mistake of ma – considering part of the West Bank, they should have annexed that, as a security, to control the high ground.</span> <span id="s807">After they found out at the Golan Heights how important the high ground is.</span> <span id="s808">So I’m sure they had enough people who were studying this thing.</span> <span id="s809">And then with the military, I st – stayed with a co – [indecipherable] command general staff college, and stuff like that, which is the second highest educational thing within the army.</span> <span id="s810">The only higher one is Army War College.</span> <span id="s811">I applied for that, but I didn’t – I couldn’t get in that one.</span> <span id="s812">So I – I had an interesting time there in involvements and stuff like that, and retired as a full [indecipherable] colonel.</span> <span id="s813">And in fact, night before last, I stayed in abot – on Aberdeen Proving Ground, and I had a VIP suite for myself.</span> <span id="s814">I had one and a half bedrooms and one and a half baths.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: And a living room.</span> <span id="s817">So that was – that was a convenient way.</span> <span id="s818">I figured I didn’t want to drive all the way from New Jersey to Washington and try to fight the traffic, and to get to the hotel in the evening, so I stopped over in Aberdeen and worked my way through Baltimore, which is a mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Oh, traffic is so terrible around here.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Well, the fact I didn’t know the roads, I said, this is detour, and I followed that thing.</span> <span id="s821">And then I – the detour sign disappeared, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: The roads sh – th-the construction and traffic –</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: – most of the time it doesn’t make any sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s826">I used to spend a lot of time at Fort Meade.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: And we used to go to Baltimore, because we had a bunch of young guys, they never had been at strip clubs on the East Baltimore Street, they had a lot of them.</span> <span id="s829">I guess that’s pretty well known, that East Baltimore Street.</span> <span id="s830">And I – if I wanted to get all my tu – all my guys together, the best place to find them was at East Baltimore Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: You knew where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Right.</span> <span id="s833">That’s – and these were boys from West Virginia, my – my army unit at that time was based in West Virginia.</span> <span id="s834">So it’s – since I was living just across the river from there.</span> <span id="s835">But that facility was there, and that unit was there and they had an opening.</span> <span id="s836">So that’s about it, and – well then, after – went walking when I was working.</span> <span id="s837">I went to mari – there’s Marietta, Ohio, which – have you heard of Marietta, Ohio?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: I’ve heard of it, never been there, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: There’s Marietta, Georgia.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: There’s also Marietta, Ohio, which is a very – historically a very famous town, because after the Revolutionary War, they handed out the G.I. Bill of the Revolutionary War, was 106 – 160 acres, you know, in o – in Ohio [indecipherable] Illinois.</span> <span id="s842">And they were handed out in Marietta.</span> <span id="s843">People came by boat from Pittsburgh on the Ohio River, and went to Marietta.</span> <span id="s844">And that’s where there was General Putnam, who was from Massachusetts, but he was the dispenser of the G.I. Bill of the Revolutionary War.</span> <span id="s845">And the house where he did that in was still in existence.</span> <span id="s846">In fact, it was that – in the top of that town has a little mountain, and there’s a – was an Indian mound.</span> <span id="s847">So we lived on the road that le – went from the river to the Indian mound.</span> <span id="s848">That was called Sacra Via.</span> <span id="s849">So – so it’s interesting –</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: – things I – I lived through and saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Yeah, we’ve covered everything.</span> <span id="s853">This is great, though, we were able to fit – talk about your post-war experience too.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: So, that’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No, I got – I had a good time.</span> <span id="s857">I was elected fellow of an engineering society.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: I saw that in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: And I published several technical papers, and so that’s about it, unless you have some other questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: We’ve covered a lot.</span> <span id="s861">This has been fantastic.</span> <span id="s862">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah, in fact, you’ll find in that article that’s – you did not have before.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Take a look at those two I got.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: [indecipherable] this is just one.</span> <span id="s867">So we just have –</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: A G.I. remembers?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s870">G.I. Recalls the Occupation of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah, I think that goes ba – that goes quite a bit at the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: This will be really good to have, because we – we archive all of this, so this is fantastic, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I think I may have sent that.</span> <span id="s874">After the last Kindertransport Conference, they asked to send things to them.</span> <span id="s875">And I think I may have sent that already.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s877">Well, we might – we might have it –</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: – I guess, but I’ll – I’ll check into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Yeah, ag-again, this is something you don’t put in a recording.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Sh-Sh-Shall I shut it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Okay then, one second.</span> <span id="s884">This concludes the – the interview of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum with Harry Ebert, conducted by Ann Erling, on the 16th of October, 2010.</span> <span id="s885">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s888">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s889">PAGE 20 Interview with Harry Ebert</span></p> <p><span id="s890">October 16, 2010</span></p></body></html>
