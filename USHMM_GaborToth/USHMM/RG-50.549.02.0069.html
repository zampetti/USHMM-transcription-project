side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Answer: My name is Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s18">I was born in Athens, Greece, April 29, ninetweent-- 1926.</span> <span id="s19">I returned to Athens from the partisans.</span> <span id="s20">I was stationed at that time in Thessaly, in the city of Lireza, which is the capital of Thessaly.</span> <span id="s21">I returned to Athens t -- either towards the very end of October, ’44, or beginning of November ’44.</span> <span id="s22">Approximately two or three weeks after the liberation of Greece -- actually, the Germans left Greece because the Russians were about to enter Yugoslavia, and therefore their retreat would have been cut off.</span> <span id="s23">So the Germans essentially left Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And when were you reunited with -- with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, I arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday.</span> <span id="s26">And the reason this is prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted.</span> <span id="s27">I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from Lireza perhaps around four or five o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s28">I called from the bus station, and I was told to immediately come.</span> <span id="s29">I took a taxi, and when finally we were approaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one.</span> <span id="s30">In fact, there was not a single person in the street.</span> <span id="s31">And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door.</span> <span id="s32">A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back.</span> <span id="s33">Of course, I -- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare.</span> <span id="s34">In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn’t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai.</span> <span id="s35">I didn’t know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai’s to see my family?</span> <span id="s36">So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the door, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she embraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai.</span> <span id="s37">I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where is mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother.</span> <span id="s38">And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr. mi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn’t the time to explain.</span> <span id="s39">They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows -- knew where they went.</span> <span id="s40">That was the -- the reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah, but I have to -- to cover iv -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival.</span> <span id="s43">I -- in -- in the beginning of December of ’44, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in Athens.</span> <span id="s44">And these troubles primarily occurred in Athens.</span> <span id="s45">There -- there was fighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured.</span> <span id="s46">Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the events, our neighborhood was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets.</span> <span id="s47">So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated.</span> <span id="s48">They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists.</span> <span id="s49">I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active.</span> <span id="s50">But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of Athens, and eventually to Africa.</span> <span id="s51">But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back.</span> <span id="s52">So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of ’45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives.</span> <span id="s53">Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn’t go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens.</span> <span id="s54">So he resumed hi-his -- his profession.</span> <span id="s55">Also, I must note that the apar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a wife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in Lireza.</span> <span id="s56">They were occupying half of the apartment, they couldn’t be evicted, or -- or -- it was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action.</span> <span id="s57">So my father and I sort of lived in half of the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another -- another apartment.</span> <span id="s58">So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking the entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September.</span> <span id="s59">And indeed, in -- in September of ’45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the Polytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- in a moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that’s ano -- a different chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s61">When you were a teenager, you had been working.</span> <span id="s62">What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of ’42.</span> <span id="s64">Since the universities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle.</span> <span id="s65">So I was -- my father found a job for me.</span> <span id="s66">Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency.</span> <span id="s67">There was a -- not a black market, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the occupation.</span> <span id="s68">What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs.</span> <span id="s69">Occasionally -- and the only non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars.</span> <span id="s70">And also, occasionally, small bars of gold.</span> <span id="s71">So, this individual, who was originally from Salonika, and who was a -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family, escaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by himself.</span> <span id="s72">A bureau conducting this sort of activity.</span> <span id="s73">Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let’s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued.</span> <span id="s74">The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies.</span> <span id="s75">For instance, while Rommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated.</span> <span id="s76">And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the -- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation.</span> <span id="s77">So this is what, essentially, he was doing.</span> <span id="s78">And my job was -- I didn’t do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let’s say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his house, get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer.</span> <span id="s79">It was, let’s say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal.</span> <span id="s80">If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s81">Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal.</span> <span id="s82">So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we -- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles.</span> <span id="s83">Woolens, and some silks, pretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was the -- the currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: And was this a Jewish enterprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, it -- the man, his name was Haim Romano, happened to be a Jew from Salonika, but th-the traders were both Christian Greeks, as well as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s87">And when you mention your neighbors in the apartment above, were -- were they Jewish?</span> <span id="s88">And I know that your parents sort of social network was generally family contacts.</span> <span id="s89">I think people they knew from Monisteer, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: -- it was a -- a Jewish world in which they led their lives, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s93">Well, and the Shabitais were Jews, but they were not Sephardim.</span> <span id="s94">Mr. and Mrs. Shabitai -- Mrs. Shabitai was from Yarninar, and Mr. Shabitai was from Trikola.</span> <span id="s95">Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492.</span> <span id="s96">In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans, which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s98">Do you think that your group had any -- was there a Sephardim look?</span> <span id="s99">I mean would -- could you -- could you say that you were slight in build, and dark, and -- I mean, is -- was there a difference between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Do you see any difference?</span> <span id="s101">No, no, I -- I -- I don’t recall -- really I think that I couldn’t distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our relatives, and other Greeks.</span> <span id="s102">They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration.</span> <span id="s103">Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people.</span> <span id="s104">But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of Sephardim.</span> <span id="s105">The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt -- a sister of my mother’s, that’s the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s107">Was Ladino your mother tongue?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Not mine.</span> <span id="s109">Mine was, well dual, Greek primarily because of my friends and going to school, but at home it was obligatory to speak French, bo -- my mother was a teacher of French, and my father had studied in Paris, or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: But you don’t know what you spoke first as a child, or -- or fr -- from the very beginning?</span> <span id="s111">Perhaps you were speaking Ladino and French right from infancy on.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: I -- I don’t believe that I spoke Ladino.</span> <span id="s113">Perhaps, before I began to go to school, I believe, and I -- I seem to -- I recollect that I spoke to my parents in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: I’m backing away now and coming -- thinking again of your father at this time.</span> <span id="s115">Do you have a sense of how he was coping?</span> <span id="s116">I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular point, he had lost his wife and two sons.</span> <span id="s117">Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often.</span> <span id="s119">Or in discussions I have with people.</span> <span id="s120">And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children.</span> <span id="s121">I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- I ca -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married.</span> <span id="s122">So I don’t think that there was, let’s say, reluctance.</span> <span id="s123">My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, o-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in Monasteer, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this.</span> <span id="s124">A episode of things like this.</span> <span id="s125">But not very much about personal life.</span> <span id="s126">But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the Greek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial.</span> <span id="s127">We didn’t go into -- into that.</span> <span id="s128">Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot.</span> <span id="s129">So he was always hobbled.</span> <span id="s130">He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s131">But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely.</span> <span id="s132">I think you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the Germans.</span> <span id="s133">So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that time, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return.</span> <span id="s134">We -- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April ’45, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the camps was still totally unknown.</span> <span id="s135">So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back.</span> <span id="s136">And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s138">You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his admonishing you to not be taken by the Germans.</span> <span id="s139">And I think he spoke of that, I’m assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the mountains.</span> <span id="s140">And you were the oldest, and you’d had your Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s141">And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I cannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly.</span> <span id="s143">In the summer of ’39, my father took me to a -- there’s a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from Athens, it’s called Lutrikey, and it’s a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that are -- contain rad-radio activity, radium.</span> <span id="s144">And they were thought to be very beneficial for whatever a-ails you.</span> <span id="s145">It was essentially a resort.</span> <span id="s146">And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days.</span> <span id="s147">It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still remember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I recall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had begun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was we were going to leave the apartment where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall.</span> <span id="s148">And we’re going to buy a house.</span> <span id="s149">So it was the first time that I had heard my father telling me of something about his -- let’s say dreams and plans for the future.</span> <span id="s150">So, in other words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult.</span> <span id="s151">The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of ’39, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of ’39, it’s the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn’t touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to use a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered.</span> <span id="s152">The war had started, it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s153">My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War, and it’s horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn’t yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940.</span> <span id="s154">So, it’s a long detour to what’s -- what -- what you ask.</span> <span id="s155">So I -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in my father, which was not apparent on the surface.</span> <span id="s156">When he admonished me not to be caught alive by the Germans, I think it was because he knew from all the reports of the 30’s, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora, all these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don’t think he -- no one knew at that time of concentration camps, but he knew that it was not a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans.</span> <span id="s157">So he -- he -- it was a second instance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it’s better to -- to be dead, than be caught alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And I would assume then, that there might have been more confidences shared at that stage in your life, were it not for the fact that I think you s -- you also talk earlier in your interview on videotape about the pall that descended, so that it became a situation from your parents when they -- their fears were something they di -- they wanted to protect you from.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can still feel it.</span> <span id="s160">I don’t re -- recall that there was, let’s say, a smile on their faces after about mid or early April of 1943, because the news began to come in very quickly about both Monasteer and Salonika.</span> <span id="s161">Those occur about two or three weeks apart.</span> <span id="s162">And the -- although -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some that was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives.</span> <span id="s163">And as I say, I -- from then on, I don’t recall their being a single smile in their faces.</span> <span id="s164">Now I’ve lost track of what you asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Oh, and they wanted to protect you, I think, from their fears.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.</span> <span id="s167">Ye-Yes.</span> <span id="s168">Really, I think it would be a stretch for me again to say that that was the motivation.</span> <span id="s169">Surely -- I’m sure that they wouldn’t want to alarm us, especially my younger brothers.</span> <span id="s170">But even to me, they -- they didn’t say things because they knew that I would have -- I wouldn’t have that much to contribute.</span> <span id="s171">But it was -- it was a sort of shielding, but I think it was primarily because they themselves were, first of all, not only so crushed by what they had heard, but the principle thing was that they be -- I’m sure now, in retrospect, that they were mulling what to do in case so -- something like this would reach Athens.</span> <span id="s172">So I think their total preoccupation for all that time after beginning of April ’43 was precisely what to do.</span> <span id="s173">That’s why when finally it did occur, September of ’43, after the Italian armistice, then suddenly, and for the first time, we had a family council, something that had never occurred before.</span> <span id="s174">And my father and mother sat us around the table, and with very few words, told us what we had to do.</span> <span id="s175">Therefore, all these preparations must have been part of what they -- they were preoccupied in what they were preparing to do.</span> <span id="s176">Because i -- I -- I -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s178">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I believe we were talking about the situation a-after April ’43, when the news from Salonika and Monasteer came, and I think I was alluding to the fact that although our parents did not take us into their confidence about their concern, their worries, but I can only surmise, and I’m almost positive now in checking with my brother, that a lot of the time, intervening time, was spent in preparing for -- not inevitability, but in -- in the event that the same thing would occur in Athens.</span> <span id="s180">Because I cannot explain in any other way, the fact that practically as soon as the signal was given to disperse in Athens, the plan was already in place about where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And the plan about where to go raises lots of questions for me about the -- the friends, or the people with whom you -- your family, not -- not you, ultimately, sought shelter, or -- or -- or homes, and the extent to which those people took risks, or did not take risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: All right.</span> <span id="s183">A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I -- I would speak about my role first.</span> <span id="s184">Although again, I hadn’t discussed this with my parents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus, who is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have to go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn’t even met his parents.</span> <span id="s185">He says, “They’ll be n-no question, you will come and stay with us.”</span> <span id="s186">So that sort of was done.</span> <span id="s187">When then we had this family council about where to go, I will tell you very quickly, my -- my father -- first of all, no Jewish family, really more than three or four at most, could possibly be hiding all together, because it would have been very apparent, no matter where they were hiding, that neighbors would immediately see, suddenly, not one or two, which you can justify as being my visiting relative from the provinces.</span> <span id="s188">Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family.</span> <span id="s189">So, this person was essential.</span> <span id="s190">My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time.</span> <span id="s191">Certainly until my departure from the mountains about a month later, with a -- a couple, they were childless.</span> <span id="s192">Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her name was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so they were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing.</span> <span id="s193">Next door to our house in Athens, to our apartment, was a man who had a small store that was really a mini variety store.</span> <span id="s194">By that I mean he -- he sold tobacco, cigarettes, newspapers, but also in the back o-of -- he had thread, and needles.</span> <span id="s195">It was that -- that sort of convenience neighborhood store.</span> <span id="s196">And over the years my father had become very, very friendly with this individual, and he had a house in one of the suburbs on the eastern side of Athens, really a -- a vi -- a far suburb.</span> <span id="s197">And that’s where my mother and two brothers went.</span> <span id="s198">So when we dispersed, that’s how we -- that’s where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: You ask about risks.</span> <span id="s201">Well, really all of them took risks, and the same risks, because the Germans made it known that sheltering Jews, or sheltering people like members of the resistance, whether arm resistance or the political resistance was a capitol offense, an -- and from time to time they would shoot them in the street.</span> <span id="s202">So taking risks was quite a -- a -- well-known, and all of them took risks, and the same risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s204">I was interested in the -- what took place in Germany, and it seemed to me that -- and I think you mentioned this, that Greeks helped the Jews, and they said, “We’re all humans.”</span> <span id="s205">It’s common humanity.</span> <span id="s206">But I think it’s worth you discussing that more, just because something happened in Germany where -- perhaps it was baser instincts of humans were worked on, but they began to see the Jews as not human.</span> <span id="s207">And that enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for things of that sort to take place.</span> <span id="s209">Look at Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s210">In 1941 they pass a law, which has about -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state.</span> <span id="s211">But it was almost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it’s provisions were clearly anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s212">Or what happened to the Romanian Jews?</span> <span id="s213">Half a million people were -- most of them massacred by the Iron guard of Romanians themselves.</span> <span id="s214">Or the -- the Jews of Serbia and Croatia?</span> <span id="s215">Most of them died of starvation by the Ustasha, th-th-th-th -- the -- the Croatian Fascists.</span> <span id="s216">So, the Germans, by no means had -- didn’t have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty.</span> <span id="s217">They rose it to -- to heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness.</span> <span id="s218">[indecipherable] Salonika Jews, they were telling them that they gonna send them to Kraków, and -- and un-unfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in Salonika was a -- a gullible, naïve, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the Jews of Salonika that their brethren in Kraków were going to take care of them.</span> <span id="s219">Of course, the Germans didn’t tell them that Kraków had already been totally eliminated.</span> <span id="s220">So this kind of a thing hadn’t reached Greece or Italy.</span> <span id="s221">Maybe -- I don’t know, maybe the ethnic character, it would never have taken root, but I have to admit that I often think that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years.</span> <span id="s222">When I was in the mountains we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and one sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s223">So I feel a personal sense of failure, that my generation has done something terribly wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Also, do you think that the role of the Greek church was very critical in being outspoken and saying that we oppose this?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Look, le-le-let’s put things perspective.</span> <span id="s226">There was really one extremely courageous voice, that’s was Thamskino’s, the archbishop, who not only protested openly, and who I think, perhaps -- I don’t know if it was mentioned in the videotaping, he was threatened by the German general Stupa that he would be shot, and Thamaskino said, “Greek clergy traditionally have been hanged.”</span> <span id="s227">And he expected Stupa to follow the same tradition, yeah.</span> <span id="s228">But look, I know of no really massive -- by that I mean even in t -- in the [indecipherable] of Jews that were saved through the action of the Greek Orthodox church.</span> <span id="s229">The -- it is a fact that Thamaskinos, the archbishop said that Jews would find refuge in monasteries, but I really don’t know of a single case where Jews survived because they were sheltered in monasteries.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s231">There are not remarkable stories of righteous acts, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Oh, there are -- there are lots, but they -- they -- they are not on the part of an organized body, wha -- be it the church.</span> <span id="s233">For example, the then chief of police, Evert, he -- I mean, in the German occupation, he personally issued or gave orders, and faked id -- identity cards were issued to Jews.</span> <span id="s234">These -- these were acts of heroism that are -- really were individual.</span> <span id="s235">Other than Evert, and this act of Thamaskinos of open protest, all the other Jews who were saved was through the act of, I think, great humanity, first of all, and even at times against a -- a -- you know, a palpable danger on the part of individual Greeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Let’s go on now to the reunion with your brother Samuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Well, as you recall from the other tape, beginning in May, or June of ’45 as I recall, when the first news of the liberation of concentration camps, then -- and -- and -- and -- and DP’s -- displaced persons began to be processed, then there were both -- there were reports both in the Greek newspapers, and also on the radio of rec-recitation of names of the known people who were -- would be returning.</span> <span id="s238">And I found this out from a neighbor in the -- in one morning, that she had heard my brother’s name.</span> <span id="s239">But within really t-two or three days shortly after this news, Sam already had been moved, eventually from Germany to Italy, Bali, and then to Pardres, and then he called on the phone and told us that he was arriving, and I went to the station and -- and there he was.</span> <span id="s240">Well, i-i -- first of all, I cou -- I didn’t recognize him right away, because he had grown so much in the brief year and a half that -- almost two years since I had see -- we had seen each other.</span> <span id="s241">And two things I think, or one thing s -- that struck me was that his behavior, at least outwardly in the days and weeks after his return, to -- at least to me it appeared as if he had not really -- or -- or -- or all these horrors, and all these experiences had not left such a -- a -- a mark on him, because he -- he would laugh, and sing, and -- and I remember he was into -- into jazz, and -- and -- and modern music, and going out with -- with friends.</span> <span id="s242">Whereas I had really, in the -- in the -- in the months in the mountains, I had spent a great deal of time just thinking about what had happened, and also looking to a much better situation afterwards, and I had all kinds of plans, and especially about my mother, who was always a very demanding woman, and who I thought was not -- never satisfied with my accomplishments, and that she would be very proud about things that I was going to do.</span> <span id="s243">And -- and -- and I had been, I think, much more touched by the events than I could see Sam.</span> <span id="s244">Of course, it’s very difficult to read what is really deep in -- in somebody’s mind, or psyche.</span> <span id="s245">But at least outwardly, I was astounded at the resilience of human beings to go through this -- this horror which you would begin to see in newsreels and read progressively in books, that the term Holocaust hadn’t even been invented yet.</span> <span id="s246">But I was astounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And did you -- were you able to come up with any explanation of how Sam could be coping?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, the only explanation was that -- that simply because he was not only young, absolu -- in absolute terms, but that -- that in that period of 13 or 14, there was more elasticity in -- in -- in somebody’s mind and character and emotions than there would be -- we only had four years apart -- in any -- in any case, it -- it -- I was much more affected by the -- by the war experience, all the events, than I saw Sam being affected.</span> <span id="s249">And that’s -- simply surprised me.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s251">How did you view, subsequently, your decision not to remain in Athens, but to go to the mountains?</span> <span id="s252">In a sense it seemed to me you -- your -- you were in hiding, but you were in hiding with the partisans in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: All right.</span> <span id="s254">I have -- I have thought about this thing very, very much, but I -- I can really tell you that it was not resolved of a great deal of rational thinking, and weighing of factors for and against.</span> <span id="s255">I can only ascribe it to pure instinct, number one, to a aspect of my personality that I simply -- when I thought about it, I re -- re-refused to -- to -- to -- to s -- to s -- to accept the possibility of remaining in hiding for an indeterminate period of time.</span> <span id="s256">I had never been away from home, although the Mikalopoulus’s were very kind to me, they accepted me, th-th -- Thanasis, my friend, was the only child, the only son, and -- and there was never any hesitation, accepting me as another, but it wasn’t really that I felt a stranger, simply that I could not withstand a life of continuous hiding, which then made me an -- and the moment this took root, then what I call personality, I -- I’ve believe that what is referred to sometimes, I’m goal oriented.</span> <span id="s257">That means I -- once I set a -- a target, then I -- I do whatever I can to -- to -- to reach that -- that outcome.</span> <span id="s258">That was what propelled me.</span> <span id="s259">The -- it wasn’t really based on any other set of weighing of rational pieces of information for or against.</span> <span id="s260">That was going to be it, and I was going to a total unknown.</span> <span id="s261">I didn’t even know where I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Was part of it your wish to be actively resisting?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No.</span> <span id="s264">The active wish was to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: And I wonder if you talked with your father about this, but it seems that for those in hiding, they must have been -- have felt imperiled.</span> <span id="s266">I mean, when they’d go to sleep at night, you never knew when you wou -- would be denounced.</span> <span id="s267">I think of how fearful a time it must have been when the rest of your family, your mother, grandmother, and brothers were taken for questioning.</span> <span id="s268">Did you talk to your father about what that stage was like for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: The answer is, we didn’t talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let’s put some dates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about.</span> <span id="s270">My mother and brothers were caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944.</span> <span id="s271">They were incarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari.</span> <span id="s272">And on July 29, they were put on board the last transport that ever left Greece, together with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews.</span> <span id="s273">I can imagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him.</span> <span id="s274">There was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a negative side, lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my father, not so much alone to see him, but also to get money.</span> <span id="s275">Also, perhaps -- we didn’t cover that, I don’t believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my father changed hiding places three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only maintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right?</span> <span id="s276">So there would come a time when it was time to go.</span> <span id="s277">Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really ostensible reasons that people would suspect, or even somebody would whisper and say -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who were doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move.</span> <span id="s278">So my father moved three times.</span> <span id="s279">At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother, grandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last place, the third place, before the liberation.</span> <span id="s280">And simply, he must have realized that something had happened, because there were no contact -- there was no contact.</span> <span id="s281">Of course, he found out immediately after -- after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s283">What did Sam later tell you about that?</span> <span id="s284">I mean, were they -- were they brutally treated, because I -- I think the Germans would want to find out where your father and you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s286">Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam told me.</span> <span id="s287">In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected -- not the young one, not the me -- Mekko.</span> <span id="s288">And they kept on asking them about my father’s and my whereabouts.</span> <span id="s289">Of course, in -- in a case for me, she did not know.</span> <span id="s290">And then Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really destitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to me.</span> <span id="s291">She did not know where I had gone.</span> <span id="s292">I’m sure my father told her, “He’s gone to the mountains.”</span> <span id="s293">But even with my father I didn’t com -- there was no way to communicate and -- and send notes from time to time, I’m -- I’m fine.</span> <span id="s294">There were no ways of doing that.</span> <span id="s295">So the combination of her concern about my fate and whereabouts, and -- and the brutality and the beatings, and -- and the other thing which is so revealing about my mother that Sam mentions in his interview, was her almost foolhardy defiance of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s296">Of cursing them, of calling them criminals, of telling them that their comeuppance would come very soon.</span> <span id="s297">This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know, that’s un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy person.</span> <span id="s298">But it’s an aspect that’s -- is so telling about -- about her.</span> <span id="s299">I don’t think that’s -- I don’t even know if my father knew about these events.</span> <span id="s300">They didn’t come up.</span> <span id="s301">I didn’t learn about what I just related to you, until I saw Sam’s interview with the sh -- the Spielberg foundation.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: I think you had mentioned earlier that in that family, that one family council meeting, you had agreed that you would never disclose where each of you were.</span> <span id="s303">And it’s interesting therefore, your mother’s defiance.</span> <span id="s304">But I wonder also if you had her determination.</span> <span id="s305">She was a strong personality, I think, and it may have been that spirit from her that drove you to go to the mountains.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I would like to think that that’s the case, but I have to also confess that it was not, again, a conscious thing.</span> <span id="s307">In other words, I -- I -- I set my -- I became determined to do it.</span> <span id="s308">I even -- I mean, in -- in retrospect -- no, you know from my thi -- the other interview, that I didn’t even have an identity card.</span> <span id="s309">I -- I -- I manufactured one of them, which really would not pass scrutiny even by a -- an idiot, but fortunately we were not stopped.</span> <span id="s310">S -- the fact that -- that -- that I did it, that I didn’t know where I was going to end up, it was something that -- that simply drove me, and if it was a part of -- a similarity in -- in character traits, that’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: What did you later learn from Sam about your younger brother?</span> <span id="s312">I’m wondering if your mother protected him?</span> <span id="s313">I -- I -- I think he was -- he would be 10 when he died, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: He was nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: I wonder if she would hide from him something of the horrors, and -- but I don’t know what you learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Well, really very little.</span> <span id="s317">Mekko, as we used to call him, well, his name was -- Mechalmar was his first name, was too young.</span> <span id="s318">An eight year difference, as you know, is immense among young children, although I re -- I remember I -- when he was two, or three, or four, I was his protector, I would take him to walks, and to play in a number of places near our house.</span> <span id="s319">There was a square with -- in a garden, in a playground.</span> <span id="s320">But we did not exchange things.</span> <span id="s321">I -- I don’t th-think I [indecipherable] my mother.</span> <span id="s322">Obviously she protected him in the sense of making sure that he was fed, and -- and clothed while they are -- they are hiding, under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s323">But, you know, as you -- as you know, children sense, even much younger, so I’m sure that he knew that these were dire times, and I -- I think someone refers the fact that actually the -- the capture, the denouncement was perhaps that both children, in the last place of their hiding, they went out to play in the streets.</span> <span id="s324">And maybe more than they should have, and therefore, seeing strange faces, perhaps, gave some people who were not particularly sympathetic to the situation, to spread the word.</span> <span id="s325">Not maybe maliciously, but once these kinds of things came in, well, there are strangers in this neighborhood, you gotta remember that the people who discovered them were Greeks collaborating with the Germans, and who perhaps, a the -- I -- of -- out of ideological reasons, but in order to maintain their jobs, they became more zealous than -- or more [indecipherable] than the king, as the saying goes.</span> <span id="s326">So they went out of their way to -- you know, to -- to chalk up captures.</span> <span id="s327">And that’s how it happened, because they exposed themselves a little bit more than -- than they should have.</span> <span id="s328">But at the same time, they were young children, and they had to get out and play.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Have you felt a wish to f -- try to find out who revealed where your mother was?</span> <span id="s330">I mean, oh -- did you even feel a wish to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: I a -- I’ve asked Sam about that.</span> <span id="s332">There is no -- no one knows who did -- if there was really someone, or more than one who actually denounced.</span> <span id="s333">I think simply, as I say, the word spread around there were strangers in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s334">This got picked up by these roving collaborators.</span> <span id="s335">Now, what is known, however, is that when they were taken to the detention -- to -- to the offices of the -- of the Gestapo, and -- and the names are very well known, the two or three Jews, including this horrible man named Hasson, who was a terrible collaborator with the Nazis, who made it his job to go and discover hiding Jews, and -- and -- and -- and capture them.</span> <span id="s336">So in -- in -- no one knows, really who -- single person, or other people who did the da -- see -- see -- see -- one of the unknowns.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: When your mother was taken and -- well your, your mother with the -- the -- your brothers and -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: -- is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s339">This is tape number two, side A. I was interested in knowing when your mother was taken for questioning, with your family, where they were -- where they -- that Gestapo questioning would take place.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes, according to Sam, he -- they were taken to Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s341">Now, let’s not think that they really went to the office of the chief of the Gestapo in Athens.</span> <span id="s342">The ger -- the Germans, they had a -- a major office building in the center of Athens, not very far from Constitution Square, which was known as the commandatura, which was a c-combined office of the headquarters of the German occupation forces in -- in Athens, the Gestapo had.</span> <span id="s343">And because it was a large office building, it had also a -- a large basement.</span> <span id="s344">That’s where they were -- they were taken for interrogation.</span> <span id="s345">Let me just simply tell you that I don’t know if it is -- what kind of poetic justice, or anything like this, when I was taken by the gendarmerie after -- that’s where I was taken, in the same place.</span> <span id="s346">But that’s where they were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s348">Now, to what does Sam attribute his having survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: We have ta-talked about that.</span> <span id="s350">I think essentially, one -- if one has to take a single reason -- well, first of all, let’s say two.</span> <span id="s351">One that at their arrival in Auschwitz, in the morning of August 16, of 1944, parathetically -- can I say how I -- we know that?</span> <span id="s352">Yes, because I looked at the da -- the so-called danuta Auschwitz chronicles as they are known, which is entries, almost like a diary every day of oc-occurrences.</span> <span id="s353">And the entry for August 16, it talks about the almost 2000 Rhodesian Jews.</span> <span id="s354">It doesn’t tell the complete story, there were another har -- 600 non-Rhodesian Jews among them, my mother and -- and -- and brothers.</span> <span id="s355">They arrived there, and in the -- this of course, famous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor camp, was because of his height.</span> <span id="s356">He was only -- ’44 -- he was 14 years old, but he was a lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari outside of Athens before the transport, where he was forced to do stupid, meaningless labor of moving rocks from one place to the other, had -- and the food was good, also, there, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he gained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to labor -- all right -- to the labor camp.</span> <span id="s357">Once then in the labor camp, after the famous three or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of Auschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a combination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard labor.</span> <span id="s358">But the survival in boodi, in particular then the survival in the famous Death March in the winter of ’45, when Auschwitz got shut down because of the Russians coming in, and they were taken elsewhere.</span> <span id="s359">Sam credits it to the care of older men, who took him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings.</span> <span id="s360">In particular in protecting them about -- especially what not to do.</span> <span id="s361">And what to be a-a-aware of, because as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each other, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival.</span> <span id="s362">So he believes very strongly that one or two people took him also under their wing, and -- and it was through them that he was able to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: I’m interested in also in knowing of the roles you as brothers fulfilled later, as the eldest son, and the winner of a scholarship, you came to the United States, Sam stayed with your father, and I -- I’m guessing that he felt an obligation to be -- to spend his life close to your father, emigrating after your father’s death.</span> <span id="s364">I just wondered if you felt that you were a -- a cornerstone of the family, sort of succeeding in the -- in your new life, but fulfilling one critical role?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Well, re-re-recall that I came to the United States on a student scholarship, therefore believing that after my studies were over, I would return to Greece, and resume my life there.</span> <span id="s366">Why Sam stayed, I have really mulled this very much, and I -- I -- I don’t have a -- a -- you know, an answer that I can be a hundred percent sure, but both my parents were really maniacal, I think, about making sure that we were well -- well educated.</span> <span id="s367">I -- the decision for me to become an engineer was cast at the -- I think the moment I was born, I think, f -- by my father in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Not a currency trader.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: R-Right, right.</span> <span id="s370">Or -- or an accountant, as -- as he was.</span> <span id="s371">And I think that there was a -- a particular event.</span> <span id="s372">In 1952, Sam had, I think, just barely finished high school.</span> <span id="s373">He -- he may have been thinking -- I think he did, about going to university, possibly for commercial studies.</span> <span id="s374">But at the same time, coincidentally, my father retired from his occupation of -- his job that had gone on for 40 years, practically.</span> <span id="s375">And there were no pension plans as we know them here, but he was given a large final severance amount, which he then decided to -- to -- to use to invest in going into business with somebody who actually was the brother of my stepmother.</span> <span id="s376">My father had remarried, and so he started this business, and I think -- I think -- I’m -- I’m almost sure, that it isn’t that my father didn’t push Sam to continue, or to -- to -- to pursue university work, but starting a business, he thought that it would be a wonderful thing to bring my brother in, so that he would also learn the business, and grow with it, and eventually of course, inherit it.</span> <span id="s377">Unfortunately, it failed for many, many reasons, including the fact that my father, while he was a wonderful accountant, was not a businessman.</span> <span id="s378">Plus also that his brother-in-law and partner turned out to be a crook.</span> <span id="s379">And -- and in -- in the meantime then, Sam had also married, and that’s why I think he stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s381">It wasn’t a matter of his feeling that he was forfeiting the opportunity to join you, perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, look, although by the time I left, and I -- I know now that my father had started all his efforts to secure a scholarship for me, or -- or some means for me to go and study abroad.</span> <span id="s383">He even wrote letters to Churchill, inflating -- I mean, the truth, beyond -- you know, any conceivable acceptable level of -- of -- of -- of recognition.</span> <span id="s384">It’s true that at one time, during the occupation, two Jews of the British army, that had, you know, been stranded in Greece, and were hiding, w -- they -- we -- hi -- hid them in our house for overnight.</span> <span id="s385">In his letter to Churchill, he inflated these [indecipherable] arrangement of British troops, and -- and -- and he was asking for no compensation of any kind, other then op -- an opportunity for his son to have an opportunity to study in England, if possible.</span> <span id="s386">The fact is that also he was starting the same thing with B’nai Brith, because he was a member of the B’nai Brith.</span> <span id="s387">In -- in fact, he kept all of these things totally secret from me.</span> <span id="s388">I had no idea what was happening until one -- when it was a done deal, essentially, and he told me at one time.</span> <span id="s389">And actually, my first reaction was to -- to say, “No, I don’t want to her -- leave you.”</span> <span id="s390">You know.</span> <span id="s391">I’m saying all of that -- forgive again the detour -- to tell you that -- I mean, my leaving, and -- and -- and his decision that I go and study abroad, the sacrifices that my father would undergo to see his son educated, had no bounds.</span> <span id="s392">And I think that under other circumstances, he would have pushed Sam to do the same thing, even if then that meant that he would be left alone, you know, with two sons away.</span> <span id="s393">But as I said, the -- the -- this maniacal thing for education was so strong, the only countervaley thing, I think was that -- that -- that coincidentally he was starting a business, and therefore he saw that there was another avenue that would be open for my brother to advance.</span> <span id="s394">I speculate -- and I was telling this to my wife last night, that if my mother had been alive, Sam would not have gone into that business, she would have pushed him, regardless, to go and -- and -- and -- and study.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: It’s interesting, your story of your father’s efforts on your behalf, cause I was thinking of when you were -- when you went to Libya, he had intervened then, and -- successfully, I think, either was a New York Times reporter that --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, well not -- not -- yes, of course, i-i -- my father immediately then contacted a cousin -- our cousins, and it was they who then knew the Times’ correspondent who then talked to -- to the archbishop, Thamaskinos.</span> <span id="s397">And it was that way that I was -- I was set free.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Yeah, anyway, they’re wonderful stories of a father’s determination.</span> <span id="s399">Now, at this time, would many of the Jews of Athens have been thinking actively of leaving for either Palestine or the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Very well -- ah, I -- I saw that question, I was laughing a little bit because I have -- I have to tell you what -- what happened.</span> <span id="s401">There was not, as in for example, Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s402">You know, in spite of all the talk about the Bulgarians saving 50,000 Jews, it’s true that -- that they were not killed, but not what then the Bulgarians began to claim.</span> <span id="s403">But the Bulgarians, as you know, marched with their feet, and -- and from 48,000, there are only 3000 left.</span> <span id="s404">There was less of the mass exodus from Greece, but th -- recall also, that out of a population of 77,000 pre-war, only about six or 7000 survived.</span> <span id="s405">And I think in one of your questions was how many wer -- were sheltered.</span> <span id="s406">The best numbers that one has, about five or 6000 found shelter, either with Greek Christian families, or in the mountains.</span> <span id="s407">I don’t mean the resistance, they just went up there, and were able to hide and lose themselves in -- in the population in the parts of Greece that they were known as free Greece, which included the region where I was.</span> <span id="s408">About 1300 were the -- in the resistance, in any case.</span> <span id="s409">But very shortly -- I mean, mid ’45, immediately we had visitors from Israel, and I still remember young Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis, but totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and -- peasants.</span> <span id="s410">I mean, things out there that you don’t necessarily associate with the appearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in cities who are -- live soft lives.</span> <span id="s411">In any case, they had been sent on purpose to recruit young men to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s412">And as you know, they did.</span> <span id="s413">Quite a few were then sent to what’s called Akshara, which was sort of a preparatory school for three or four weeks, to teach the rudiments of living in a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s414">And then it was -- all of it was clandestine, because one night, in -- at night -- and they were taken by boat to ships that were not in territorial Greek waters, and there they were taken, and then taken to Greece again in secret, because they didn’t come as part of the British quotas, they were trying to violate.</span> <span id="s415">And some of them were caught and incarcerated in Cypress, in any case.</span> <span id="s416">So I -- I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to Palestine, but the reason I’m laughing is -- y-you -- it’s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it’s so unreal.</span> <span id="s417">Most of our preoccupation in questi -- questioning the Israelis about what kind of government are we going to have, if eventually a state is formed.</span> <span id="s418">Because our experience, you know, in the mountains, and things like this is we need to be democratic, and you know, almost Socialistic, and things like -- th-the Israelis would look at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, “Look, w-we have many things to do before w-we come to that point.</span> <span id="s419">The first thing to do is to try to -- to make sure that we become a state.</span> <span id="s420">When we become a state, then people will ha -- will -- will vote,” and -- and we were surely looking for reassurances ahead of time.</span> <span id="s421">Well, and that was -- there was a very strong thing.</span> <span id="s422">The reason I didn’t become extremely serious, you know, to the point of taking action, what they say -- first of all, A, I couldn’t leave my father.</span> <span id="s423">Sam had not even yet appeared on the scene when these events of the contact with the Israelis occurred.</span> <span id="s424">Sam had not e -- yet returned, number one, and two, of course, the Israelis had departed, and then of course the British clamped down, and it wasn’t even possible to do that any more.</span> <span id="s425">And then of course, my departure from the United States, you know, made this thing a moot point.</span> <span id="s426">But yes, there was a very strong period of I would say two or three months, where practically I got on the boat to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Now, how much of an honor was it to have that B’nai Brith scholarship?</span> <span id="s428">W-Were there -- were there many of them, or very few?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Right.</span> <span id="s430">The first two were my scholarship, and -- and my second cousin, Jeff Levis.</span> <span id="s431">We left at the same time.</span> <span id="s432">First of all we -- even after everything was put in place -- you know, in addition to all the paperwork, visas, this and the other, examination by the American consul that we were at least mildly proficient in -- in English, enough to -- to claim that we were going to go and study in -- in an American university.</span> <span id="s433">But the major th -- thing that -- that -- that -- that one had to wait for -- and that nothing could be done about it, was to wait for passage, because there were no -- there was not much shipping still, it hadn’t been fully restored.</span> <span id="s434">So it took about another four or five months of waiting to get booking on -- on a ship.</span> <span id="s435">So there were two -- it wasn’t done on the basis, let’s say, of competition.</span> <span id="s436">It was -- I ad -- really wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: It was your father’s letter writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: My father’s letter writing, and his cousin, you know, Joseph Levi, that, you know, really made th -- there was -- I know now that two other such scholarships were given.</span> <span id="s439">They were not scholastic achievements, it was simply th-that -- that Jews in the United States sponsored us.</span> <span id="s440">Although it was B’nai Brith money, which it certainly didn’t last more than one year.</span> <span id="s441">And I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s442">And -- and the only reason I was able to continue was because the university then picked up the -- the sc -- the scholarship.</span> <span id="s443">So that’s how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s445">Then how did you travel to the United States, by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Well by -- by boat, yes.</span> <span id="s447">The Volcania.</span> <span id="s448">It was two Italian ships that had been used during the war as transports.</span> <span id="s449">It had a sister ship called -- Volcania -- not -- not Lusitania, but it’s is -- same Italian -- kind of Italian name, I’ll -- I’ll remember in a moment.</span> <span id="s450">It took about 13 to 14 days because we stopped in Genoa to pick up other passengers, and -- you know, it wasn’t a very fast ship.</span> <span id="s451">And it took about, you know, maybe 12 days to get to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: What did you take with you?</span> <span id="s453">And you thought then you would be there for several years, for the degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: F-For at least four years, for any -- four years, for at least four years.</span> <span id="s455">Well, of course, other than -- than items of clothing, I took very little else.</span> <span id="s456">Two or three mementos.</span> <span id="s457">First of all, for the man who sponsored me, who had to sign an affidavit of support as it was called, who I never met in my life, he lived in Kalamazoo, Michigan, his name was Osias Souvairdling, my father gave me a present to give him, which was -- must have been a very dear thing for him, it was a -- a cigarette case.</span> <span id="s458">He didn’t even know if the man smoked, but it was really done of silver filigree, I think of -- of -- of wire, intricately done, and which I eventually sent to Mr. Souvairdling to thank him profoundly, when ha -- as I say, we never met.</span> <span id="s459">And so we came to New York, we stopped for three or four days, seeing relatives in New York.</span> <span id="s460">Jeff had a --</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And that would be -- you had a -- your father’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yes, Benjamin, and I stayed with him overnight.</span> <span id="s463">And then -- after all, we were also late, because it was end of October, and this -- and the semester had already started, so we were already a month and a half late.</span> <span id="s464">So we left New York to go to Chicago, and in Chicago then we parted because, you see, both of us had no choice, we were not given a choice about what schools to attend.</span> <span id="s465">We each told what we wanted to study and B’nai Brith then found the appropriate schools.</span> <span id="s466">I was then sent to the University of Illinois.</span> <span id="s467">So in Chicago we said good-bye to each other, I took the train down to Champagne, and he took the train to Iowa, because he went to Iowa State.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And what are your memories of, the first impressions, of New York, of your uncle’s home, of Illinois?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Well, all right, they were distinct.</span> <span id="s470">New York was of course something that only one saw in pictures, and in books, and still one had to -- to -- to really marvel at the c -- the -- the -- the sorts of things tha-that were hard to even imagine.</span> <span id="s471">Taken to the automat for example, I mean, the idea of pushing a nickel and then being served a meal was -- you know, not only strange, but for -- for -- especially mechanically minded people like myself.</span> <span id="s472">In Illinois it was very different because, you know, I arrived there the night in -- on November the third or fourth of ’46.</span> <span id="s473">It happened to be the day before the semi -- the -- the biennial elections -- not presidential, but for two-thirds of the Senate, and the whole House of Representatives.</span> <span id="s474">And -- and -- and -- you know, naively, and -- and -- and I found out the following day that at that time, easily, about half of the people in the fraternity where I was being given room and board -- which was another thing that the B’nai Brith had arranged for me to do at the AEPi house, the majority of them were veterans themselves, fliers, soldiers.</span> <span id="s475">And then when I asked them are they voting tomorrow in the elections, and they said, “What elections?”</span> <span id="s476">I was -- it was the biggest, first initial shock in my life, because one in Europe associated political awareness and movement always with university students.</span> <span id="s477">That’s where also the ferment would take place.</span> <span id="s478">And to -- to find out that the supreme indifference, and -- and a -- and e-eventually, this is -- became really, from -- from a critical thing, became an endearing aspect of American life, that I liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: What is it they say, if all is going well, you don’t need to vote, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: [indecipherable] or something like that.</span> <span id="s481">Or -- or maybe the other thing that all politicians are -- are -- are -- are not worth paying attention to.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: How difficult was your adjustment to life at -- that would be Urbana, Champagne.</span> <span id="s483">I was just thinking of language, and then all the other adjustments.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Well, all right, language of course was really a bit of a problem, but it didn’t take me very long to -- to acquire language.</span> <span id="s485">The nice thing a -- the ni -- the good aspect -- not the good, the -- the -- the tolerable aspect was that for engineering, really language was not that essential.</span> <span id="s486">Or at least a very strong component.</span> <span id="s487">Some of the first courses one had to take, which first of all amazed me, was that I had to take, you know, algebra.</span> <span id="s488">Algebra.</span> <span id="s489">I had gone to a special high school in -- in Greece, preparatory to entering the Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s490">What is -- algebra was already a foregone thing.</span> <span id="s491">And in fact, the first day I got to -- to that class, and I’m sitting there, and -- and -- and I see the instructor laboring over a formula, and -- and -- and very diffidently I asked if I could show another way, and I went, and then I showed the solution, and afterwards, at the end of the session, he asked me to stay back, and he said he knew about my arrival, and he knew that I was -- I came from Europe and education was stronger there, and he asked me not to come back again.</span> <span id="s492">He says, “I’ll give you an A, don’t show up in class any more.”</span> <span id="s493">So I was able to overcome that.</span> <span id="s494">So I -- I believe that -- that I had some facility for languages, and so it didn’t become that much of an obstacle.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: What -- what were the most difficult areas of adjustment?</span> <span id="s496">I mean, were there -- were there cultural things that were hard?</span> <span id="s497">I mean, were you nostalgic for Greek food, did you miss your friends and family badly?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Really, I must a-admit that -- that -- that except for occasional bouts of -- not loneliness, of not really being with a relative or a friend, but there was so much to absorb from every aspect.</span> <span id="s499">Life in it’s little ins -- insignificant a-aspects, wa -- the shops, the stores, university life.</span> <span id="s500">Life in a fraternity, what young people did, what interested them.</span> <span id="s501">It is -- it was so -- so -- there was practically no time to really begin to feel any deprivation at all.</span> <span id="s502">The first time that happened was at the end of the first year, when suddenly the summer vacation [indecipherable] what am I gonna do?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: And you were 20 then?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s505">So I really went to New York, and stayed with my uncle, and I was working in his factory, he was a manufacturer of dresses.</span> <span id="s506">Well, when the people in B’nai Brith found out that that’s what I was doing, they were horrified.</span> <span id="s507">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s508">So then they arranged for me to go to a special camp that was run by the Quakers.</span> <span id="s509">They had six or seven of them around the country, but typically what it would be, the Quakers -- the Friends -- the American Friends Service Committee would invite f -- foreign students, about 35 to 40, put them in a place, usually a -- a private school, the grounds for a private school that -- since it was vacation time, and we would stay there for almost eight weeks, and the idea was to talk about life and -- and f-foreign affairs, and things like this, and we had every week some prominent individual from the university, a professor would come, or -- either of political science, or psychology, and he would lecture, and he would hold a -- a -- a -- a -- discussions under a tree.</span> <span id="s510">You know, kind of a thing and exchange ideas.</span> <span id="s511">And then of course, play games, go swimming, and things like this, and that’s -- that’s how tha -- th-th -- it was a first time when I suddenly found myself almost detached because the -- the house, the fraternity house closed, school was closed, I was going to go to summer school.</span> <span id="s512">And that’s the first time that it hit me that now I’m again alone and on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: What was your fraternity experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, since I had no -- I had a brief semester which I went to the Polytechnic and still living at home, I -- I don’t want to say it was strange, or -- or -- everything was strange for me, everything was new, and I had nothing to compare -- of course I had then, eventually a -- other schoolmates who didn’t live in fraternities, who lived in dorms, or who lived in -- in rooming houses.</span> <span id="s515">What -- what I found -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s517">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s518">What was the fraternity experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Well, as I said, I guess, since it was all new, I had to -- to absorb and ac -- and sort of accept, because I had no other frame of reference against which to compare.</span> <span id="s520">The only thing that certainly was a bit peculiar, at least to me, was that so much time was spent in -- in games, and recreation, as compared to study.</span> <span id="s521">But even within this type of environment, one was not obligated to do anything.</span> <span id="s522">I mean, there were certain events that one had to participate in, but what one did with one’s free time, it was up to individual.</span> <span id="s523">So again it was -- it was a very good introduction to an aspect of American life, namely that you don’t have to conform to exactly a particular pattern.</span> <span id="s524">It was some of it you had to do, some of it was entirely voluntary.</span> <span id="s525">And I -- I know that there were some fraternity brothers who were Americans, and who, like me, did not participate in all the games, and superficial other activities, and who were much more serious in studies, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: It would have given you acceptance by a group, and I wondered if that was a very good feeling for a newcomer?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yes, and again, since I have no other way to compare it, I would have to ask myself where if I had simply had a room in it, or -- or a place in a dorm, or -- or -- or in a rooming house, would I be able to, al-almost in one fell swoop, be a brother to f -- to 40 or 50 other people?</span> <span id="s528">I-It wouldn’t have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Yeah, it seems to me it was interesting that that was arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: And I wondered too, when you were later in the U.S. army, years later, were there any similarities with your fraternity days?</span> <span id="s532">I -- I was just simply thinking of group acceptance.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: None, none.</span> <span id="s534">Of course, there -- there is a similarity, you know, whenever groups of people do similar things together, there are ties and camaraderies, and of course I leave out a big -- I was in the mountains, that’s a different story, and participated in an action, and so forth, but in the American army I was not in any battle situation.</span> <span id="s535">Because there is a special ties that get formed when people share dangers.</span> <span id="s536">In the army, what was shared in the beginning was, during basic training, where you undergo a mixture of both discipline that is -- has some meaning, and a lot of mindless nonsense, which has even particular words in the -- in American army that we will not mention now in -- you know, the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Now, what fraternity was it, and what were the usual characteristics of that fraternity?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: All right, the fraternity was called AEPi, Alpha Epsilon Pi.</span> <span id="s539">It was a Jewish fraternity, one of about, if I recall at that time, either five or six Jewish fraternities on the Champagne Urbana campus of the University of Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: And -- and most of, I think of the 40 or 50 individuals, me -- students at that time, I think 90 percent were residents of Illinois from various parts, mostly from Chicago.</span> <span id="s542">And the rest were really from practically other parts of the country, there were three or four New Yorkers, one from -- two from outside of Boston.</span> <span id="s543">And obviously I was -- I was the only -- the only foreigner.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s545">Did you experience any anti-Semitism on the campus in general, or in those years?</span> <span id="s546">Were you a -- aware of any?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: None.</span> <span id="s548">None.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Tell me more then -- let’s go on to your -- your studies.</span> <span id="s550">Y -- it seems your adjustment was very straightforward.</span> <span id="s551">You did your first degree, and you stayed on at Illinois for your later degrees?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s553">After finishing the Bachelor’s degree, i -- it coincided with the advent of the Korean war, 1950.</span> <span id="s554">When I got my Bachelor’s degree, then that summer, the war in Korea started.</span> <span id="s555">A -- a number of friends and so forth, who thought they were be of imminent draftable age, did a number of things, including going to graduate school which they never thought or intended to go, in order to get deferments.</span> <span id="s556">Other even went to the length of quickly getting married, so they would be supporters of family.</span> <span id="s557">And then I -- I was told that I would be given a -- an assistanceship, a research assistanceship to continue to graduate school, which then enabled me to go through the Master’s degree.</span> <span id="s558">Then I decided to continue on for the doctorate.</span> <span id="s559">And I went for the additional year, including then taking the oral exams.</span> <span id="s560">And the oral exams were -- were -- took place on June third, 1953, the date of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s561">So I passed the oral.</span> <span id="s562">So what was left to d -- to -- to do was to write the thesis, and in fact my advisor and I had selected the topic, but I had run out of money.</span> <span id="s563">And there was no -- the assist-assistanceship funding was over.</span> <span id="s564">So it was a question of how I mi -- a -- going to be able to support myself.</span> <span id="s565">My professor had arranged for me -- my advisor to work for the summer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, just for the summer.</span> <span id="s566">And then, after taking the orals, I was offered a permanent position at Bell Laboratories.</span> <span id="s567">Well, I talked to my professor, and he said, “All right, it’s a little -- rarely done, but it can be done.</span> <span id="s568">You can arrange for to write the thesis in absentia.”</span> <span id="s569">Which was the plan.</span> <span id="s570">Unfortunately I was drafted a year later, and -- although after my release from the army, I intended to continue on -- to try to -- to write the thesis by -- in the meantime, at the University of Illinois, they stopped allowing thesis to be written in absentia, because of pressure from the legislature.</span> <span id="s571">And that sort of put an end to -- to that quest.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Yeah, what did you write your thesis on?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: What I was going to write the thesis on.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Well, yeah what -- what were you planning earlier, to write it on.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Well, the topic we had selected was this, the realization of electrical networks, with real components.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And did you work -- I mean, wa-was that an area you pursued in your work later?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: A little bit, because since I was drafted, less tha -- in about a year after my starting arm -- permanent position at Bell Laboratories, there was a two year a -- in -- almost two years intervening in the army.</span> <span id="s578">When I returned, I changed departments, and I joined a completely brand new department, which really was going to, and did the work in -- in -- in the totally new generation of telephone exchanges, digital instead of the older variety.</span> <span id="s579">Which almost had nothing to do whatsoever with any of the special academic interests that I had.</span> <span id="s580">It was -- it was a new universe, essentially of computers, and that’s what to -- got me into that field.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s582">Going back to the army, now had you become an American citizen earlier?</span> <span id="s583">You came here as a Yugoslav.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Right.</span> <span id="s585">This is something that we have not covered at all because it was not covered in the earlier interview.</span> <span id="s586">While I -- I was studying for the orals, in April of 40 thre -- 40 -- of ’53, my landlady tells me that somebody’s -- wants to talk to me, a gentleman appears, hands me a letter, I open it up, it’s from the immigration naturalization service, I’m to depart United States within two weeks.</span> <span id="s587">Why?</span> <span id="s588">He says, “Look, I’m only the messenger.”</span> <span id="s589">Well, you can understand my state of mind.</span> <span id="s590">I got on the train, went to Chicago where I had friends, told them the situation.</span> <span id="s591">The long and the short is they intervened.</span> <span id="s592">I mean, they got me to talk to a congressman, who then talked to the immigration department, immigration department renewed my stay for another year.</span> <span id="s593">So I thought that was going to be the end of that, right?</span> <span id="s594">Without my knowing -- I had told one of my professors what had happened , and while I was in Chicago, and even after my return two or three days later, without my knowing, four professors wrote to the then Senator Dograss of Illinois, who introduced a private bill in congress, and eventually became a law, known as the law for the relief of Isaac Ne-Nehama.</span> <span id="s595">It was signed by President Eisenhower, and by law I became a -- I was accepted as an immigrant, outside of the student visa restrictions, because student visa is a restricted class, where you are not allowed to -- to stay permanently.</span> <span id="s596">So I was now, because of the special bill, I was now a special -- a -- a -- an immigrant.</span> <span id="s597">So I would have to wait for my five years, you know, to be -- to gain citizenship.</span> <span id="s598">But being inducted into the army, automatically within six months, then you become a citizen, for the very obvious reason that a country cannot ask you to defend it, and at the same time not recognizing you as a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: So I became a naturalized citizen in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Yeah, now -- and they intervened on your behalf with that private legislation, just you were a promising student, and they felt it was an injustice?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes, I’m -- I’m eve -- I’m very embarrassed to read the -- because I was investigated by the FBI, I mean, they had to go and interview them, and the glowing terms, I mean, make me blush even today when I read them.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: And then after serving in the army, you returned to Bell Labs, and continued to work in this exciting new field?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Right.</span> <span id="s605">But i -- i -- i -- i -- a personal aspect of my life is that it -- that just before I went in the army, I got married.</span> <span id="s606">In fact, I lived with my first wife in Colorado Springs, because after basic training in New Jersey, I was then sent to the fifth army’s headq -- school -- signal school in Colorado Springs.</span> <span id="s607">And since in the army it’s very important -- or even more important what you don’t do, than what you do, instead of cleaning pots or -- or -- or being in the trenches, I was teaching in the signal school, reserve officers who were passing every three months, to take refresher courses in radio, telephony, and things like that.</span> <span id="s608">So that’s where I spent my -- my two years.</span> <span id="s609">Upon our return then, to New Jersey, I resumed my work at Bell Laboratories, but then there was a -- a rift, and in 1957, I was divorced.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s611">Tell me about your first wife, what was her name and her background, and where you met, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Her name was Ann Greenberg.</span> <span id="s613">I -- I -- I -- two summers -- after the first summer I mentioned to you earlier, with the Quaker camp, I worked in the Poconos in a camp for boys and girls, as a waiter, to earn pocket money.</span> <span id="s614">And was very often sufficient to -- to -- to allow me to buy a -- an occasional movie ticket.</span> <span id="s615">Because the scholarship just simply provided room and board, nothing else.</span> <span id="s616">But then I had a friend and when finally I wa -- began to start working at Bell Laboratories stationed in New York City, then this friend that I had met in the camp told me about a young lady who was an -- an -- a friend of hers, and that’s how I -- I met Ann.</span> <span id="s617">And so we were going out together, and in fact when I got my notice from the draft board to present myself for training, Ann -- I can only tell you subs -- from subsequent information -- her own parents were divorced, it was a -- a rather unhappy marriage, and she convinced me.</span> <span id="s618">I maybe n-not have taken a lot of convincing, I was a little bit hesitant because, you know, going into the army, goodness knows where I could be shipped.</span> <span id="s619">But she was persuasive enough to tell me that she would accompany me wherever we went, if it [indecipherable] allowed.</span> <span id="s620">The long and the short is we -- we got married.</span> <span id="s621">And she went to school in Colorado Springs, at the university because she eventually intended to go to medical school.</span> <span id="s622">When we return, lived in New Jersey, she enrolled at NYU.</span> <span id="s623">And she was -- began to have problems.</span> <span id="s624">First of all, academic problems, and then one day she disappeared.</span> <span id="s625">The long and the short is I found out through a physician who was -- knew her from -- since childhood, that according to him, she was a schizophrenic.</span> <span id="s626">And he -- who -- and this -- this man urged me to simply get away as fast as I could.</span> <span id="s627">I was -- my reaction was, you know, “You’re just telling me that I’m dealing with a sick person, and you’re telling me to abandon a sick person?”</span> <span id="s628">But he convinced me that it’s the kind of a thing that has no hope for -- for cure, and -- and it would have been almost an impossibility.</span> <span id="s629">The long and the short is that I got a quick divorce in Mexico.</span> <span id="s630">It was consensual, it wasn’t contested or anything like that.</span> <span id="s631">That’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s633">On to the next part of the story, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: W -- y -- in your years with Bell Labs, I’m sure there were particular successes, and difficulties, and -- I mean, how do you look back on those years, and what would you have us know?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: All right, all right.</span> <span id="s637">Well, you know, there was always a kind of phrase to describe the Bell system.</span> <span id="s638">We used to refer to i -- i -- to it as -- collectively as Mother Bell.</span> <span id="s639">So one can conjure up a -- an older woman, rather buxom, you know.</span> <span id="s640">Warm, that you feel warm in -- in -- in -- in -- near her.</span> <span id="s641">Well, in other words, it was a magnificent preparation for a career, because first of all you -- you were among individuals of extreme capability.</span> <span id="s642">Bell Laboratories recruited only the upper one percent of graduates in American universities.</span> <span id="s643">So there were no idiots there, and -- and you couldn’t really make it through with hot air, you would be found out right away.</span> <span id="s644">So it was a -- a very, very demanding -- well, not demanding, but -- but really very mar-marvelous preparation.</span> <span id="s645">By the same token, it was a -- an extremely inbred thing.</span> <span id="s646">We -- we thought collectively that we knew everything.</span> <span id="s647">And -- so in -- there was a little bit of a struggle because there was no formal thing.</span> <span id="s648">My dreams always were that when I started my career, I would be taken under the wing of an experienced person who would take me slowly through the -- and it didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s649">It isn’t that I didn’t learn things from colleagues, I did, a great deal.</span> <span id="s650">But there was no former -- you were essentially left on your own.</span> <span id="s651">And there came times I think almost three or four weeks after I started, that I really had terrible time believing that I was earning my paycheck under false pretenses.</span> <span id="s652">That -- that I wasn’t doing anything valuable.</span> <span id="s653">But I very quickly got over that, because I began to do serious things.</span> <span id="s654">And then I got drafted, and I return, a-and -- and then it happened that we were working on the first field trial of this first ever new telephone exchange, what has taken Bell Laboratories biggest department of 400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess, Illinois.</span> <span id="s655">And I started the -- the -- the system, and I came to the conclusion that it will not work.</span> <span id="s656">Not -- not that it will not work, that it -- it would not accommodate the kind of capacity that it was aimed to, something like 20,000 or 40,000 subscribers.</span> <span id="s657">My analysis showed that it would barely make it for 2000 subscribers.</span> <span id="s658">Well, it was solid enough thing that my own supervisor believed it, and f -- you know, typically then I was -- I gave it a -- a presentation.</span> <span id="s659">And of course the first reaction was one of horrible shock and -- and -- and -- and -- and disdain, but the stuff was solid enough, and that was -- I became a -- immediately a rising star.</span> <span id="s660">I was almost, I think, thrown out into the street, and within a week I became a fair haired boy, and I got promoted, became a first promotion supervisor.</span> <span id="s661">But then I got the notion, a year after I became promoted that I really wanted to be in a higher stratum of research, and I left and went to the Rand Corporation in California, where I was going to work, believe it or not, it was a joke, really to [indecipherable] subsequently on artificial intelligence, because two people who had written some papers, told me that they had funding from the Air Force to start an effort, and I wanted to be a participant there.</span> <span id="s662">When I got there, simply the -- the plans were totally different, never as I said, and that experience at Rand was, in itself of a different kind, but equally rewarding.</span> <span id="s663">Your --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: And how long did you stay with Rand?</span> <span id="s665">A: I stayed for two years.</span> <span id="s666">Then one f -- day I got a call from my former boss at Bell Laboratories, who was ready to retire, and who told me that the Bell system had been asked by the government to assist the government in the Apollo program.</span> <span id="s667">And he was simply asking me where I would talk to him.</span> <span id="s668">And he asked me not to hang up on him.</span> <span id="s669">I said, “I respect you too much to do that.”</span> <span id="s670">The long and the short is they -- and I’m talking about -- I -- but I don’t know anything about rockets is what -- I don’t know either, and I’m -- I’m 65 and I’m willing to learn.</span> <span id="s671">The long and the short is that -- do you want to hear a interesting story?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: All right, good.</span> <span id="s674">I -- because I had a lot of leave coming, I flew to east, I spoke to them, I came back, I spoke with Paulette, and I decided to reject their offer, that I was happy what I was doing at Rand.</span> <span id="s675">That was a weekend.</span> <span id="s676">On Monday I go back to my office at Rand, and the telephone rings, and it’s the secretary of the president of the Rand corporation.</span> <span id="s677">She says, “Frank Wright to see you.”</span> <span id="s678">I had met him once.</span> <span id="s679">What’s the president to do with me?</span> <span id="s680">I go to his office, he greets me, he says, “I -- I understand you’re considering leaving us.”</span> <span id="s681">I was, you know, f -- absolutely -- you know, and it showed in my face.</span> <span id="s682">H-He saw it, he says, “W-W-Wait,” he said.</span> <span id="s683">“it isn’t anything nefarious, we don’t have a -- a secret police.</span> <span id="s684">It’s very simple.</span> <span id="s685">Julian West,” who was the vice president at Bell Laboratories with whom I had talked to that previous day or two, “is a West Point classmate of mind, and he called me, he told me that they want you.</span> <span id="s686">And so what do you think you are doing?”</span> <span id="s687">So I told him, “I’m going to stay.”</span> <span id="s688">He said, “Fantastic.”</span> <span id="s689">I sit down, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s690">Well.</span> <span id="s691">He said, “And what do you think of the Apollo program?”</span> <span id="s692">So I began to say, “Well, this is probably the biggest thing since the building of the pyramids, the greatest,” -- so I didn’t know that he was almost setting a -- a -- a trap, and I was waxing so eloquently about, you know, going to the moon.</span> <span id="s693">Then he said, “I -- I th -- I think like you do.”</span> <span id="s694">He says, “Let m -- let me tell you -- let’s do the following,” he says.</span> <span id="s695">“Why don’t you go?</span> <span id="s696">Within -- because if you don’t, you may regret it later that you didn’t participate.</span> <span id="s697">But you go, and within two or three months, you will know whether it’s really s-suits you.</span> <span id="s698">If it doesn’t, come back.</span> <span id="s699">There’ll always be a place for you here.”</span> <span id="s700">What a wise individual.</span> <span id="s701">So I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: An inter -- it is an interesting story.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: [indecipherable] and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s704">I -- I didn’t return.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: So that you then continued to work on the Apollo program?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Oh, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Yeah, that’s why we came to -- to Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Well tell me for how long you worked on it, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes, from 1962, till 1968.</span> <span id="s711">And this is at what -- at that point where already the plans for Apollo already had matured.</span> <span id="s712">My department -- I was head of one of the five departments in the company.</span> <span id="s713">We were already beginning to think about voyages to Mars, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s714">But another opportunity o -- arose.</span> <span id="s715">A friend of this boss of mine, who re -- who attracted me back to the -- to -- to the Bell system, then had a -- a -- a wealthy individual friend who lived in f -- in Philadelphia, and who was willing to fund new companies.</span> <span id="s716">And the long and the short is that I left the Bell system, and I founded my own company.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: This is very fascinating, I thought you’d had a career, you know, an unbroken career with Bell Lab.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: And this would have been a very exciting time with the Apollo program.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Yes, it’s an unmistakable time because I don’t -- it ha -- is -- it has been studied, it has been written up, namely how so much enthusiasm, because fo -- you could see -- and I traveled a great deal, because this program was all over the United States, we didn’t think about nine to five, or working hours, weekends.</span> <span id="s721">The enthusiasm there, of going and doing something like this was so [indecipherable] and -- and -- and -- and it -- it encompassed practically hundreds of thousands of engineers, and -- and people around the country.</span> <span id="s722">The enthusiasm was -- was great.</span> <span id="s723">It has not been replicated.</span> <span id="s724">But if I may tell you that things like this have occurred, and I can assure you that I have not really been an instrument in choosing the situations, but throughout my career, Bell Laboratories, the new telephone system, then the Apollo program, the Rand Corporation artificial intelligence.</span> <span id="s725">In other words, what I’m trying to emphasize is that these things occur both in companies as well as in -- even in countries, very rarely, where you undertake something where there is no precedent.</span> <span id="s726">Because when you are in situations like this, then ideas flow freely.</span> <span id="s727">When you are in a -- in a environment with a lot of tradition, and you say, “Well, what about this thing?”</span> <span id="s728">Then they’ll say, “Look, we’ve tried that.”</span> <span id="s729">Or, “We don’t do things like this around here.”</span> <span id="s730">When you are in a new situation, then all ideas are given free reign.</span> <span id="s731">Now, all of them are not equally good, and some could be good, or even better than what was -- which -- which was in, but even countries don’t have the luxury of pursuing two or three avenues in parallel.</span> <span id="s732">So to be in a -- in -- in a -- in a -- in an environment like this, it’s the -- it’s -- it’s almost like getting drunk, or smoking -- which I don’t know what smoking pot or any of these things would be, but it’s -- I remember the early 50’s in the Bell Laboratories.</span> <span id="s733">Unless you are either under narcosis or an utter idiot, you couldn’t help but stumble on new inventions, on new ideas.</span> <span id="s734">It was a kind of a ferment that occurs very, very infrequently in the lives of companies, or the survivors in -- in even the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s735">Somehow it occurred two or three times in my career.</span> <span id="s736">None because I chose them like this, just pure luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Yeah, so you’ve been very privileged --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: -- to be in these sort of intellectually exciting --</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Right.</span> <span id="s741">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: -- areas.</span> <span id="s743">Now, when you would be with the Apollo program, how would that fit with Sputnik?</span> <span id="s744">I mean that -- Sputnik would have happened, and have --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Oh yeah, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: -- Kennedy, yes, and -- and we would have been sort of fast and furiously pursuing space flight --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: -- just at the time you’d be -- yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: -- you’d be working on part of that program.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Well, Apollo was -- was -- was -- was done on purpose by the Kennedy speech in Congress --</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: -- to send a man to the moon.</span> <span id="s754">The fact that it was done not so much in response to Sputnik alone.</span> <span id="s755">I mean, we were pursuing manned space flight.</span> <span id="s756">The Russians beat us by a year, but as events eventually showed, really, eventually the a -- the American technological superiority is what made -- made the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Yeah, and a -- but -- was it -- well, I was just thinking of reading about someone named James Webb, I think, who --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Oh, James Webb, yes.</span> <span id="s759">James Webb was the -- the -- the first administrator.</span> <span id="s760">A very funny thing I will tell you.</span> <span id="s761">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Of na -- of -- of NASA.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Of NASA, oh -- NASA.</span> <span id="s764">He was a very ki -- a -- he was primarily a -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s766">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s767">We were talking about Kennedy’s America space program, and James Webb.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Right, James Webb, who was the first and really strongest NASA administrator.</span> <span id="s769">But there -- there’s a vignette about Webb which I think that you’ll find amusing.</span> <span id="s770">Around 1954, he was interviewed by the New York Times, and there were many questions, and one of the questions he was asked was phrased as follows, he said -- he was -- he was told, “Mr. Webb, it’s been said that the Russian space program is a very methodical program, you know, because they had started with a manned thing, then you send one individual, then a woman, then two.</span> <span id="s771">How would you characterize the American program?”</span> <span id="s772">He said, “Our program is just as methodical, if not more so than the Russian.</span> <span id="s773">Every step we take depends on the next.”</span> <span id="s774">And that’s Mr. Webb, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Yeah, that was fun.</span> <span id="s776">Now, you formed your own company at -- in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: All right.</span> <span id="s778">It was 1968.</span> <span id="s779">My revered, late, former boss Dr. Lovell, a prominent man, inventor with 300 patents to his name, prolific individual, and extremely wonderful.</span> <span id="s780">He told me one day that his friend was looking to fund a starting company, was I -- was I interested?</span> <span id="s781">And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I really didn’t even know what, specifically we were going to do other than to really get into the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas.</span> <span id="s782">But very quickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur.</span> <span id="s783">The first one was that my former boss at the company that I worked, part of the Bell system that was doing the work on the Apollo program, the company was called Bellcom, and it was, of course, situated in Washington, that’s what brought us from California here.</span> <span id="s784">He also had, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief executive of another company.</span> <span id="s785">And he called me on the phone one day, and he said that one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the country, they were -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems.</span> <span id="s786">That is to say those systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the windows and bet.</span> <span id="s787">But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their totes, as they were called, it’s also the same name in England, from tote boards.</span> <span id="s788">And we -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans?</span> <span id="s789">So we thought that it was going to be a brief engagement of about a couple of months to look over their plans.</span> <span id="s790">It turned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and -- and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it right, they said, “Well, why don’t you do it for us?”</span> <span id="s791">And the long and the short is, and what made my company was the horses.</span> <span id="s792">We -- we build the first computerized systems in the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation because we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play, primarily as laboratory instruments.</span> <span id="s793">No -- no such animal had ever been used in a very, not only real life situation, but betting is a very, very technologically demanding situation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting’s taking place, the number of transactions is very, very high.</span> <span id="s794">And so the system had to, you know, keep up with the flow thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Now when you said mini-computers, would -- I mean, how small would they be?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Well, a -- a mini-computer, the type that we used, would be about the size of a -- let’s say an audio tape, no not -- not that small, but one of the units that you see on my shelf, possibly, let’s say 20 inches wide, maybe 20 inches high, and about the same depth.</span> <span id="s797">But as I said, they had very limited memory, and they were used only, principally at the time, tentatively as laboratory instruments to collect data on experiments and things like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: And what did -- what was your company called?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: It was called International Computing Company.</span> <span id="s800">My f -- boss, the man who eventually engaged me asked me why that name.</span> <span id="s801">I said, “Well, it would be too ambitious to call it intergalactic, so I -- I chose International Computing Company.”</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s803">And then it was really venture capital behind you initially?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Well, the venture capital was sink -- only one source, this individual, a-and that’s all the funding that we got.</span> <span id="s805">There is no question that like any young company, young companies like young humans are vulnerable, they are not fragile.</span> <span id="s806">But not anything that we did, but the circumstances within a year after w-we got formed, things were a bit dicey, and we almost came, practically to disbanding the company, but we -- we stayed and -- and the engagement with that company to do the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: The horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: The horses, gave us enough staying power.</span> <span id="s809">Also our -- actually our first contract that we won two months after our formation, was to win a -- a program funded by the nat -- National Institutes of Health, to try to see whether computers could be used in assisting the collection and dissemination of blood in blood banks.</span> <span id="s810">And we were allied in this particular contract with the -- the blood bank in Milwaukee, in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s811">And it lasted for two years, and we were able to prove that indeed, because it’s the -- a problem of s -- not -- o-of -- of -- of inventory, because as you know, blood has a short lifetime of three weeks.</span> <span id="s812">So, it had -- computers were -- what we were able to do, in a real life situation, because the Milwaukee blood center supplied about 23 hospitals in the greater Milwaukee area -- the secret is the ability of the Milwaukee blood center -- all information if a blood unit is wanted, of a particular type in one hospital, and the computer knew it was in another hospital is to transport it, sometimes even with a taxicab.</span> <span id="s813">By contrast, the Red Cross, who was the -- and still is the biggest collector of blood -- privately I think it’s a national disgrace, because the Red Cross doesn’t, once it collects a unit of blood, if it then ships it to a hospital, it’s responsibilities end there.</span> <span id="s814">Now the unit may eventually age, and then be thrown down the drain, but in -- in Milwaukee we -- we did not allow that, because we were able to, if something was needed, then we could -- had enough authority because the Milwaukee blood center still owned the blood unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: But the long and the short of ICC was that after the horses, then we got involved in satellite communications.</span> <span id="s817">And I can tell you -- perhaps you know enough about computers to know that computers really don’t care whether you’re dealing with blood, or -- or horses.</span> <span id="s818">It’s information that you are -- are -- are exchanging, so very -- when we got into satellite communications, we bodily lifted elements of software from the racetrack systems into satellite communications.</span> <span id="s819">And you tell that to people who don’t understand, they say, “Well, how can that be?”</span> <span id="s820">Well, [indecipherable] understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Yeah, the horses paid for your knowledge that could be applied to other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Right, and made -- made -- made the company.</span> <span id="s823">And -- and by -- by ni -- ni -- 1987, and that was about 11 or 12 years after our formation, we had reached a force of about a hundred to 120 people.</span> <span id="s824">And then we became -- we were courted by a number of big corporations.</span> <span id="s825">Eventually a company called Contel, Continental Telephone, cause it was the third largest telephone company in the United States, bought us.</span> <span id="s826">And in a sense this was [indecipherable] completing the circle for me.</span> <span id="s827">I started my career in a -- in a telephone company, and eventually gets bought out by another telephone company.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Meanwhile, let’s go back to your family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: What was happening to you personally during this time, and also will --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: May I intervene for a moment to tell you about something else?</span> <span id="s832">Since you are following a chronological thing.</span> <span id="s833">You did not ask me -- it did not occur to me to tell you about some of my activities as a student in Illinois, which really are something I treasure.</span> <span id="s834">Let me tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: -- very briefly, all right?</span> <span id="s837">And then we can move to -- I got involved in -- in -- in an -- in an activity which was a -- a extramural, it had to do with studies.</span> <span id="s838">It was an activity of students who run the concerts.</span> <span id="s839">The university had a season of concerts, orchestras and soloists.</span> <span id="s840">And the students arranged for everything.</span> <span id="s841">I mean, there was a faculty committee that they got involved in the transactions, who to invite, and the contracts, and things like this, but the students then did everything else.</span> <span id="s842">Issuing the tickets, programs.</span> <span id="s843">And then when the concert took place, of -- ma -- and my job became of going to the train station and getting the visiting artist, taking them to their hotel, and then bringing them to the concert hall, and then afterwards for -- for dinner.</span> <span id="s844">And it was a very rewarding thing, because I met people like Igor Stravinsky.</span> <span id="s845">I was dispatched by the university to Chicago.</span> <span id="s846">He had come from New York with his wife, and he didn’t want to take the train from Chicago to Champagne, so the president of the university sent his limousine, so I went to get Igor down, and -- and I will tell you a -- a -- a little vignette, if you are interested.</span> <span id="s847">Shall I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Yeah, oh do, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Oh, all right.</span> <span id="s850">Well we’re -- it was February, and I picked him up from the [indecipherable] station, and we are getting in the limousine, we are driving, we are talking in French, primarily.</span> <span id="s851">He was not that comfortable in English.</span> <span id="s852">At some point, about an hour -- it’s about a three hour drive, he was telling me that he had been suffering from stomach problems, and his wife Vera, a magnificent Russian grand dame, was from time to time su -- supporting him, he said, “Yeah, yeah, oh she’s been very, very sick at times.”</span> <span id="s853">But at some point he said, “Look, I -- I’m -- I’m feeling some pains now, would you ask the driver to stop at the next gas station, because I have a thermos bottle with milk in my valise, and I need to,” -- of course, of course.</span> <span id="s854">So we stopped, and we opened the trunk, and -- and -- and opened the valise, the driver and I were on the side, and we saw Stravinsky opening the thermos, pouring something, and drinking.</span> <span id="s855">And after awhile he says, “Everything is fine.”</span> <span id="s856">And we got into the car, and there was an unmistakable strong smell of Scotch whiskey.</span> <span id="s857">So, when about an hour later he said he had pains again, we understood.</span> <span id="s858">This way I met, you know, people like Stravinsky, and Stern, and -- and Metropolus, and Zell.</span> <span id="s859">Because I would go pick them up, and then we would always ask them, and in many cases they all did that.</span> <span id="s860">The only reward that we students had, about eight, 10 of us, for all the work was to be -- to have dinner after the concert with the visiting artist.</span> <span id="s861">That was, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And -- and you enjoyed the concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Of course, and we enjoyed the concerts.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s865">You know, you played the violin as a child.</span> <span id="s866">Has music always --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: I -- I started the violin.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Ah.</span> <span id="s869">I just wondered what role music had played in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Oh, an extremely import -- I -- I -- it’s -- it’s a passion.</span> <span id="s871">I don’t play any instruments, but you -- you -- I think you asked me the questions, what I -- I do for pleasure.</span> <span id="s872">We can get into that, but music is one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yeah, and was that something that was -- meant a great deal to your parents, and their parents before them?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Well, my father used to play the mandolin, and he at times would play, but mostly th-this work -- what, in Ladino and Sephardic culture, are called canteegass, from the Spanish word, which are -- believe ballads, although there are differences.</span> <span id="s875">Ballads tell a story, canteegass mostly are usually about a love affair, or -- or one thing like that.</span> <span id="s876">But it wasn’t that they were s-so musically.</span> <span id="s877">We didn’t have -- we had a -- a radio, but it wasn’t a musical thing, but in the whole process of -- of being well rounded, then I was sent to the conservatory in Athens, and I took classes in the violin, until ’41 when also again because of the occupation, the conservatory closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Now, I’m glad that you -- we went back to the story --</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: -- about Urbana Champagne --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: -- and -- and -- and music, but were there other things going on in those campus years which were important, and tie in in some way with your -- your background?</span> <span id="s883">I -- I was wondering what was happening politically in the country then, and would there be much involvement at the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: The only thing that I recall distinctly -- and it didn’t touch me personally, but in fact the director of the school of music, Dr. Kyper -- in fact, the summer of graduation, I returned to Champagne to retrieve a couple of personal belongings, and on the return -- he was there, it was July, so I was -- it was a little strange to see Dr. Kyper in the train.</span> <span id="s885">We sat together in the observation lounge, and he proceeded ga -- I -- I could see that he was very troubled, and I felt both honored, and in the same time, it’s a bit uncomfortable, because Dr. Kyper unloaded, or -- or told me, or related to me, the reason he has come back.</span> <span id="s886">And this it was simply that because of the McCarthy era, perhaps he had connections with leftist groups in the United States, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s887">But essentially he had been sort of recalled from vacation by the president of the university, and told that there were such suspicions, or accusations, whatever.</span> <span id="s888">The [indecipherable] fact was that he was dismissed from the di -- the directorship of the school of music, but remained as a professor.</span> <span id="s889">And he was a -- a -- a first kind of personal contact with a political atmosphere at that time.</span> <span id="s890">This is the main thing.</span> <span id="s891">I mean, after I went in the army and so forth, well then I -- I was always politically interested, I -- because I remember, my first recollections as a -- as a boy, because my -- both my parents were extremely interested in political things and we used to discuss it, but my first political awareness was the Spanish civil war.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s893">No, I -- I would have expected that because of your background, you’d have a particular sensitivity to the McCarthy era.</span> <span id="s894">Just -- really just you’d experience the pre -- well, you know, you’d experienced the Holocaust, and so you understood that.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s896">Well, not only the Holocaust, but -- but even the [indecipherable] all of these things, and the reading, and all the thinking, and it was a kind of a strange thing to be living those days in the United States, who -- f-for us in the liberation -- the United States and it’s history was something so unique, so superior to anything else, that at the beginning, you know, I found it really hard to reconcile how in the same place that -- that -- where there was so much freedom of expression, everything else, there was also something like this.</span> <span id="s897">Except that a little bit of understanding of what had happened in the 30’s in central Europe, in Germany, then s -- I began to -- to realize that there wa -- there was no monopoly, and it could happen anywhere, and it had begun to even infest the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Yes, and I would think to see -- to have that insight that -- perhaps to appreciate the danger it posed before many Americans would.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Sure, of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: You had referred to your -- to y -- to your wife, Paulette in the -- as we spoke about your -- your corporate years, so let’s -- le-let’s return now to that part of your family life, and tell me how you met.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: All right.</span> <span id="s902">All right.</span> <span id="s903">Well, we go back, remember I was divorced in ’57, and -- and again, this is another period that harks back when you were asking me, when I first came to the United States, did I feel lonely, or -- or nostalgic, which I hadn’t, but again in this stressful period, I had lots of friends, but really not relatives near me, that is to say people who, regardless of what you do, will always be on your side.</span> <span id="s904">So I had nowhere to turn, and I -- I had to -- to cope with the situation.</span> <span id="s905">In any case, the following summer, and coincidentally because Sam was getting married, then I decided that I needed a -- a change of scene.</span> <span id="s906">In fact at one point I -- I thought that perhaps I would go and -- and -- and live in Europe.</span> <span id="s907">And in fact I went to Paris first.</span> <span id="s908">And I had been given names of a number of companies, including IBM, and believe me, it took just one interview to completely settle the issue for me, that the only place for me was the United States.</span> <span id="s909">So I then enjoyed my -- my vacation, and I didn’t think of ever st-staying in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Yeah, let me -- let me ask two things.</span> <span id="s911">Going back, what were the main stresses at that time, in 1957, which you mentioned before, but also -- and then -- then I’m eager to know what it was about that IBM interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: All right.</span> <span id="s913">The stresses were strictly personal, the personal stresses of the divorce, of -- of -- of all it’s -- it’s a-aftermath, and then finding myself alone, and -- and a little bit lost, and -- and wounded, the way that things had -- had happened.</span> <span id="s914">And I -- I imagine it’s either romantic or -- or -- or -- or whatever you want to call it, to s -- to -- to -- to s -- really think that a change of scenery is what you need.</span> <span id="s915">So that’s why then I said, “Oh, well, all right, let me look into the possibility of working overseas.</span> <span id="s916">So I contacted a number of people.</span> <span id="s917">When I went to i -- to IBM offices, well they said, “Yeah, but you see we cannot hire you here, as an American, because that has all kinds of other ramifications.</span> <span id="s918">We have to pay you extra salary, allow you return every year for vacation, and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s919">So that’s a totally different kettle of fish, you gotta be hired by IBM there and sent to Paris.</span> <span id="s920">But if to hire you here, you have to be hired as a local.”</span> <span id="s921">And that meant a totally different situation.</span> <span id="s922">The moment I heard that, I -- I -- I realized i-it wasn’t going to be for me and I’m glad it -- that it occurred very quickly, because then I could enjoy the remaining two months.</span> <span id="s923">Because I went to Spain first, went to Greece for Sam’s wedding.</span> <span id="s924">This is where I met Paulette, I mean the first time.</span> <span id="s925">I mean she was in the receiving line.</span> <span id="s926">Then two days later, I got a call from her sister, whom I knew vaguely.</span> <span id="s927">I had met her vaguely.</span> <span id="s928">Her sister was having a few people for dinner, would I like to come?</span> <span id="s929">Sure.</span> <span id="s930">So I’m walking, and -- and I’m reaching the -- the -- the block where her sister lived, and at the door is a young lady.</span> <span id="s931">Well, we’re both waiting for the door to open, we go, we get into the elevator, and we both realized that we stopped in the same door, and we ring the bell, and of course, it opens up, Yola, her sister, opened the door.</span> <span id="s932">They embraced.</span> <span id="s933">I thought there was -- she was just another invitee, I had no idea of the relationship.</span> <span id="s934">And like an idiot, it was during, really, dinner when a conversation is going between them like Yola is asking Paulette, how are the folks?</span> <span id="s935">I mean the parents.</span> <span id="s936">Fine.</span> <span id="s937">And then I said, naively, “Are you related?”</span> <span id="s938">They said, “We are sisters.”</span> <span id="s939">Well, so that was our first meeting.</span> <span id="s940">Then the following day, or I di -- two days later, I forget, she called, and now she tells me that this was a daring thing on her part, to tell me that she had tickets to a concert with Isaac Stern, would I like to go?</span> <span id="s941">I said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s942">I had dinner with Isaac Stern during my years -- in fact, we went to the concert and after the concert I went backstage, and we had a little reunion with Stern.</span> <span id="s943">He remembered me because we had dinner together with his accompanist Zagin.</span> <span id="s944">And so we started going together, and within about a week, I proposed to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Now, t-tell me Paulette’s last name --</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: -- and also her home would have been very close to the area where you were in the mountains -- in the Pindus mountains?</span> <span id="s948">A: No, no, no, let me -- her maiden name is Moudzoukos.</span> <span id="s949">Her family hail from a city called Volos, which although is in Thessaly, it’s at least 200 miles from the area where I was.</span> <span id="s950">Volos is on the eastern part of Greece, and it’s a port, because it’s on the Aegean Sea.</span> <span id="s951">Her family were prominent.</span> <span id="s952">Her father and -- and his brother, and the family had a large factory, textile manufacturers.</span> <span id="s953">In fact, I remember when I used to go, at times, to my father’s office some summers to help -- to b -- so to pass the time, and I remember photographs of the Moudzoukos factory, I can still see it’s outlines.</span> <span id="s954">The name was very familiar.</span> <span id="s955">In any case -- and they also, from Volos, they were Romaniots, also, they were not Sephardim in -- in the sense that we -- I explained earlier.</span> <span id="s956">She has a sister who’s still alive, and in -- older, Yola, lives in Athens.</span> <span id="s957">She has a son, and he’s married, has a son, and expecting another one.</span> <span id="s958">I met her -- I mean, we were engaged, then -- then a-arrangements were made for Paulette to join me, because she couldn’t come to United States.</span> <span id="s959">We had to be married outside of the United States, and then I would then invite her to come as an American citizen.</span> <span id="s960">But we had to be married outside of the continental United States.</span> <span id="s961">She stayed with friends in Montreal for about two or three months.</span> <span id="s962">I would go from time to time to be with her, and also because my divorce was in Mexico, and it was not recognized in Quebec, in the province, because they only recognize religious marriages, and religious annulments or divorces, we were married in Toronto.</span> <span id="s963">We knew no one.</span> <span id="s964">We went to the registry, and they said, “Do you ha -- do you have any witnesses?”</span> <span id="s965">As it happened, there were another couple behind us, also strangers in Toronto, and we became each other wis -- each other’s witnesses, and that’s -- we were married then in -- in -- in June of ’58.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: And how old were you then?</span> <span id="s967">A: Well, I was 32.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Right.</span> <span id="s970">And she came about two months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Now, as an observ -- as an outsider it would seem to me that this wa -- this marriage had lots of qualities that would make it a success, of -- her sort of coming from -- from Greece, being Jewish and so on.</span> <span id="s972">Do you remember having any thoughts about what you -- what -- what qualities you wanted in a wife, or shared background?</span> <span id="s973">Was it important that she shared your faith, and things of that kind?</span> <span id="s974">Or did it just happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: I think it just happened, but really in -- in -- in -- in my own personal case, you -- you have t -- to also take into account that even at the time I went in Greece, I was still living possibly in the tail end, fortunately, of my experience, the first marriage, which had ended so -- so badly.</span> <span id="s976">Really, I think that -- it’s one of the questions that I think I saw in your notes, about religion.</span> <span id="s977">There is a woman named Jane Gerber, you know her work.</span> <span id="s978">I -- I -- she invited me to give lectures in -- in Baltimore in July, which I will do.</span> <span id="s979">But I just heard a lecture of hers because of the -- of a thing in the National Cathedral where they have some artifacts that came from Spain that -- of the Sephardim Jews there.</span> <span id="s980">Wonderful lecture she gave.</span> <span id="s981">And a magnificent phrase of hers, I think it was in response to a question, and -- and her phrase was, the relative relaxed attitude of the Sephardim towards religion.</span> <span id="s982">And this is as best I can also describe both my religious upbringing, which was not very strict.</span> <span id="s983">I mean, we were observant of all the major holiday -- Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s984">Dietary laws are really almost impossible to apply in Athens, because there were 3000 Jews in a city of a million.</span> <span id="s985">There -- y-y -- there wasn’t a place to -- to go buy kosher meat and things like this.</span> <span id="s986">But in the high holidays, then special arrangements were made for s -- special slaughterers to come, and to provide.</span> <span id="s987">So there were no -- there was -- when I -- there were never crustaceans in our house, or things like that.</span> <span id="s988">But the observances there, we were -- my job for example, every Friday from the age of five or six, because the synagogue was only about a block away from my house, was to carry the oil donation to the synagogue, because the Sephardim didn’t burn candles.</span> <span id="s989">All the -- the lights were olive oil with wicks in there.</span> <span id="s990">And go to the synagogue on Sabbath, and of course, all the major holidays.</span> <span id="s991">And the -- the -- the prepara -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s993">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Continue in that vein, so -- from a totally different thing, there is a -- a Greek saying that it’s better to -- to wear old shoes from your country, even if they are -- have been repaired.</span> <span id="s995">But again, I didn’t got there to -- to -- to find a -- a wife, it just -- it just happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: And, of course I’m -- I’m -- I’m glad that there was some commonality, first in another language, to some shared experience.</span> <span id="s998">Paulette was too young, she was -- she was only 33, and at the time of the hiding, she was barely nine or 10 years old.</span> <span id="s999">So she doesn’t have as vivid memories of -- I mean, she has vivid memories of the hiding, but I mean nothing compared to going to the mountains.</span> <span id="s1000">And also, very fortunately, none of her relatives perished in -- in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: One of her uncles also happened to be a Spanish citizen.</span> <span id="s1003">He was taken to camp, but he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1005">Now, does she remember being in hiding, though, her -- her family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Oh, absolutely, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1007">Not only that, but she was able a few years ago, I think four or five years ago, to re-establish contact with the daughters of the family that hid them.</span> <span id="s1008">And in fact one of them was visiting a sister in the United States, and then came and stayed with us for -- for a week.</span> <span id="s1009">So she has maintained this thing, and she has extremely strong recollections, because also, there -- there came a time when in maybe not the first, but the second house where they were hiding, somebody already told them, there’re already suspicions that you me -- may be Jews, and that was a signal to -- for them to immediately leave and go someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: See, she remembers all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1013">Tell me about your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1015">Well, we have three daughters.</span> <span id="s1016">Sarah was born in New Jersey, because at that time I was working at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, and when Sarah was a year old, that’s when I left, or we left, and we went to California, because of my engagement at the Rand Corporation.</span> <span id="s1017">Then when we return, Maya, the second one, was born in ’63, three years after Sarah.</span> <span id="s1018">And in ’66, Nicole was born, and she was born here.</span> <span id="s1019">I think I s -- a little bit helped deliver her a little bit, because it occurred very, very fast.</span> <span id="s1020">It was a Saturday morning, and Paulette said that the time had come.</span> <span id="s1021">We notified the doctor, he said, “All ri -- okay, I’ll meet you down -- down there.”</span> <span id="s1022">I was going to drive her, initially.</span> <span id="s1023">But I had made arrangements with neighbors to take care of the two other children, but the pains are coming very, very fast.</span> <span id="s1024">And so I call the ambulance, but even then, she says, “The baby’s coming out.”</span> <span id="s1025">And she lied on the bed, in fact I can see the head coming out.</span> <span id="s1026">And out of the window I see our neighbor, a psychiatrist who is walking his dog, so I ran out, and -- and -- and I told him that -- that Paulette is having a baby, he dro-dropped the dog, and he came and deliver the baby.</span> <span id="s1027">We wrapped it in a -- in a blanket.</span> <span id="s1028">He asked from something to cut the umbilical cord, and I go -- I got it, and brought the -- the poultry shears from the -- from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1029">And when we -- we were there, I mean Paulette, as if nothing had happened, her cheeks were a rosy color.</span> <span id="s1030">I was -- I bel next in pallor holding the baby in this -- this dirty towel that we had wrapped it around.</span> <span id="s1031">But the palest of all was Dr. Hoffman, because he hadn’t done anything like this since --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Medical school, yeah that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1035">Now, what are the names of your three daughters, Sarah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Sarah, the eldest, Maya, and Nicole is the -- the -- the -- the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Delivered at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Delivered at home.</span> <span id="s1039">She is an attorney, Nicole, in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1040">She has three sons now.</span> <span id="s1041">And Maya has two sons.</span> <span id="s1042">So we have, of the three daughters, five grandsons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Yeah, that must be wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Well [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1046">So you’ve been surrounded by women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: For a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: For a long time, and now I -- I -- I must say that I was really hoping for a -- a granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1050">But it’s ma -- fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Just so you have to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: How did both you and Paulette decide to raise the girls?</span> <span id="s1054">I’m thinking of bringing them up to -- I mean, did you attend -- did they attend synagogue, did they have Bat Mitzvahs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Did you share openly your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: No, the -- we -- I -- look, i -- living in aside what I referred to earlier, Gerber’s phrase of the relaxed atmosphere, but I mean both at university, and -- and -- and when I began to mature a little bit more, I am not religious.</span> <span id="s1058">But some of the things we retained which were dear to me, primarily because it brought memories of the family and it’s tradition.</span> <span id="s1059">So we always had the lighting of candles in Hanukkah, and the high holidays we -- we used to go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1060">But I did not insist on their going to Sunday school, or -- or -- or this or the other.</span> <span id="s1061">It’s -- it’s turned out that of the three, entirely spontaneously, Nicole is the one who is super Jewish than all the other -- all -- all the -- the daughters.</span> <span id="s1062">I think really if I think now in retrospect, I think the division of labor in the upbringing was -- Paulette was much more -- her family more structured from a social standpoint.</span> <span id="s1063">I mean, in my house, for instance, we never celebrated birthdays.</span> <span id="s1064">It was unknown.</span> <span id="s1065">I don’t even know my father’s birthday, my mother’s birthday.</span> <span id="s1066">The only reason I know my birthday, and my brother’s is because I -- we have records from -- birth certificates.</span> <span id="s1067">But in those days, they did -- they did -- but so from the social upbringing, this was sort of Paulette’s area.</span> <span id="s1068">In my case, I think that I co -- I continue to try to inculcate the same things that I received from my parents, you know, the tremendous reverence for -- for education and -- and -- and learning.</span> <span id="s1069">Plus I think something else, one other thing, it was -- this -- how can I phrase it?</span> <span id="s1070">The -- the -- the a -- assuming of personal responsibility.</span> <span id="s1071">I remember that in the case of all three girls, when they were ready to now leave home and go to school -- to university, Maya -- Sarah going to Boston, Maya in Michigan, and Nicole in Wisconsin, I took them all for a -- a long ride and lunch.</span> <span id="s1072">And first of all, I told them about the fact that I had been married once before.</span> <span id="s1073">And a -- a typically -- although they didn’t tell each other, because I asked them not to, they all -- always asked the same question, what was her name?</span> <span id="s1074">And did by any chance have a sibling that they didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1075">[indecipherable] not -- no -- no such thing.</span> <span id="s1076">And then I told them that as they are ready now to go and -- and live their own lives, I told them that a part of the Hippocratic oath a doctors take, one part which I -- I -- I think it’s very important, is above all do no harm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: So I s -- I used to say to them, “Look, you may encounter all kinds of situations, all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s1079">If you are asked to try something, whether it’s drugs, or si -- do the following.</span> <span id="s1080">If you have any doubt about the possibility of doing harm, then don’t.</span> <span id="s1081">But whatever it is that you do, take personal responsibility for that.</span> <span id="s1082">Now, it will always be a -- a -- I mean, we will always be with you, no matter what happens,” but I tried in a number of little things that they used to do when -- when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s1083">For instance, how they would divide a labor, chores, how they would do.</span> <span id="s1084">It was always this aspect that -- and -- and although this got formalized really, after the war in France, with existentialism, and when it was finally given a kind of official thing, that namely life is nothing but a -- a set of choices, and even not doing something is itself a choice.</span> <span id="s1085">But even before I had read Sartre, and -- and -- and -- and the periodicals that I used to get from my cousin, from Paris [indecipherable] moderne, I always felt, and I think primarily the war years, because when I got to the mountains, then I knew that is -- is nothing -- I had no place else to go f -- to assume responsibility for whatever I did.</span> <span id="s1086">So that became something that’s -- I sort of learned on the job, as it were, in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1087">And I thought that it would be a very important and useful thing to -- to tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Yeah, and had -- had they been growing up in a -- in a strictly observant household, their guidance would have come from the sort of roles of their faith, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1090">Yes, probably, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: So it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: [indecipherable] the ethical portion of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: -- of the faith, yes.</span> <span id="s1095">You know, it’s -- what I would say, either by recounting personal examples or events in my life, the -- they were not meant really to be mini lessons in ethics, but simply that -- that I -- I trusted them enough -- I had differences with Paulette, really sometimes really severe ones.</span> <span id="s1096">Paulette would sometimes accuse me that I was too easy, that I -- she -- she -- she believed, and she still does that Sarah experimented with pot when she was in high school.</span> <span id="s1097">I tried to tell her that -- that all I tried to do, and all I think a -- a parent can do, is to make sure that the core of the person is solid.</span> <span id="s1098">Since I could not be on top of them in every place they went, I could only concentrated in one pronouncement, do whatever you want, but be responsible for it.</span> <span id="s1099">Fortunately they have all turn out to be magnificent persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Very different in many, many respects, but all of them quite good --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: -- and solid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: I wondered if there’s any -- wh-when we referred to Jane Gerber earlier, and I was reading something that spoke about this Sephardim psyche, which I -- I jotted down, but I wonder if there is -- I wonder if you think there are any built in differences of attitudes that Sephardim might have, because they really have wandered so widely, through centuries of history, and -- and faced all sorts of upheavals, and -- I don’t know if there are people that are more resilient, less trusting, I have -- I -- I just wonder if there -- if anything comes to mind that’s worth discussing here.</span> <span id="s1105">And -- and if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Well -- well, it may be, but I think that it again depended on individual households.</span> <span id="s1107">What I can say that comes a little close to -- to -- to what you’re alluding to, was my mother telling me about some -- for example, because her maiden name was Colonomos, which, as you probably know -- who knows if there is any connection, but one of the most famous rabbis of all time, not s-so much Sephardim, a [indecipherable] Ashkenazis Germany was a Colonomos.</span> <span id="s1108">And as you know the name means -- it has some variance.</span> <span id="s1109">The -- the basic variant is Colonimos, which in Greek means, of good name.</span> <span id="s1110">And it’s Hebrew equivalent is yom -- what’s the name?</span> <span id="s1111">Not -- yom -- yom -- Yomkesh.</span> <span id="s1112">So, th-there -- people who are called like that.</span> <span id="s1113">Now, why was she doing that?</span> <span id="s1114">Apparently there must have been a kind of tradition that was primarily oral -- again, through the ballads, and through the songs, that hark back to Spain.</span> <span id="s1115">After all, of the five synagogues, major synagogues in Monasteer, before the catastrophe, one was Kal Aragon, the synagogue of -- from Aragon, the other was Kal Portugas.</span> <span id="s1116">So there was really in -- in the stories that they would say, and even sometimes I -- you know, I -- yo-you -- if I chance to read a -- a play of Calderone’s, and you see phrases which are not longer existing in -- in modern Spanish, and I can hear my grandmother pronounce it.</span> <span id="s1117">Some of that was there, but it was not something that was cultivated so much, except simply in the oral tradition about how things were at home, how they dressed for holidays, how they ate.</span> <span id="s1118">So I don’t know if it is really what you -- you refer to as psyche.</span> <span id="s1119">In Salonika, because of a stronger movement, and the fact that -- that -- that there was a lot more contact with other countries because of commerce, and in inismeer in Istanbul, there was much more of an intellectual fermented than there was in the monastileese.</span> <span id="s1120">There is a mystique about monastileese that to this day I don’t know why it’s there.</span> <span id="s1121">In fact, a week or so ago, we went to an annual meeting on monastileese, which is a group of 60 people in -- in -- in -- in New York, that it’s a bureel society, they simply are descendants of a first congregation of monastileese ever established in New York.</span> <span id="s1122">It doesn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s1123">It’s called the Congregation of Peace and Brotherhood.</span> <span id="s1124">But they continue --</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Their sort of proud tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Yeah, so there is, yeah, there is -- if you could see, I mean you go on the web, and you -- Monasteer, when it comes -- [indecipherable] has his own website, the Sephardic four, full of things again about -- Sephardic things, dishes, cooking, traditions, names.</span> <span id="s1127">I mean, you -- names which were strange names sometimes, very Spanish in many cases.</span> <span id="s1128">Then strange mixes of Hebrew names, women, Soonho, which in Hebrew is Allegra.</span> <span id="s1129">And then you see from -- from generation to generation how things we [indecipherable] change.</span> <span id="s1130">My mater -- paternal grandmother’s name was Estraya -- Star, all right?</span> <span id="s1131">But as is traditional in Jewish fa -- Sephardic families, the eldest daughter, firstborn on the paternal side -- I mean born, takes the name of the paternal mother.</span> <span id="s1132">And the boy -- that’s why I’m named after my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1133">And -- and -- an-and -- now that’s -- [indecipherable] it was through the work that I’d done for the museum that I -- and some other things, that I found that my great-great grandfather, Solomon, was one of the 13 signatories in Monasteer in 1864 for the bringing of the alliance française in Monasteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1135">I would think that these things you found out about your family are wonderful for your daughters --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: -- to -- I mean they’ve -- they’ve grown up with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: To connect, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: -- stable parents, with a shared -- to some degree a shared heritage, and -- and with a great deal of sort of, I would think, economic stability and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: But it’s wonderful that there’s gaps, I mean in I -- history over generations, it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Let me tell you what I regret, however.</span> <span id="s1143">That there is practically no information about my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s1144">I have a cousin, first cousin, Miriam, who lives in -- in Israel, she -- her -- her -- her mother and my mother were sisters, and she has done a lot of research on the Colonomus family.</span> <span id="s1145">I finally have decided that it’s about time I asked Miriam to make as much of the connection -- the only thing I know about my mother was because she was an extremely bright student, and she went to a French school, and in that meeting just last weekend, I found another woman, whose mother, although in Salonika, also went to an alliance français school, and she also was very bright.</span> <span id="s1146">Both of them were slated to be sent to Paris for further training, but unfortunately the war intervened.</span> <span id="s1147">That’s -- stopped it.</span> <span id="s1148">But I remember even when I first came to the United States, landed in New York, and saw my aunt, and I met another friend of hers, not a relative now, but also from Monasteer, and she says, “I remember your mother, she was so clever.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: And of course, we would expect such a mother to want her children to excel academically.</span> <span id="s1150">I mean, that’s a -- I think a Jewish stereotype, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: That’s a -- that’s putting it very mildly, very mildly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: -- but her own abilities would want -- want it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes, she was a very driven person, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: We were speaking about your mother and her abilities and her ambitions for her sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Well yes, first th -- I mentioned earlier about the obligation to speak French at home.</span> <span id="s1156">Very frequently she would ask me to all -- give me assignments to read, books, French books.</span> <span id="s1157">In the beginning children’s stories, later on even plays of Racine.</span> <span id="s1158">And I still remember she’s in the kitchen, maybe cooking something, and I would then read passages, or from some of -- of these plays.</span> <span id="s1159">Now some of them, and I still remember, included situations which really -- now, they were not erotic, but for instance I still remember -- although I knew the -- the word -- it comes from when it was -- it says -- he says elaparlay arsematress.</span> <span id="s1160">Well, she did not comment.</span> <span id="s1161">Normally she would have expected me to ask, “Well, that does matress mean?”</span> <span id="s1162">You know, because matress has at least two meanings in French.</span> <span id="s1163">One is a teacher, you know, or mistress, but mistress in the sense of hierarchy, and the other is the -- the lover connotation.</span> <span id="s1164">So she was an avid reader herself, in the little time that she had available running the house, although -- though we had a maid.</span> <span id="s1165">And she read history, and she -- i-it was a -- a k -- a kind of a -- of a situation where she -- she demanded, you know, excellence, and it was at times sometimes hard to know what her expectations were.</span> <span id="s1166">My father on the other hand was a lot more encouraging.</span> <span id="s1167">He had ways of recompense.</span> <span id="s1168">One of my earliest memories that I have to tell you, I was I think possibly barely -- four -- four and a half, and I had written from an assignment, you know, half a page.</span> <span id="s1169">And I showed it to him, and he was incredulous, he says, “You wrote that?”</span> <span id="s1170">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1171">I almost saw a -- a -- a look of disbelief, and he says, “Here, here, takes -- take another piece of paper.”</span> <span id="s1172">He sat down and he dictated a brand new passage from another book for me, and had me write it.</span> <span id="s1173">So I finish that, he looked at it, he says, “What a magnificent handwriting.</span> <span id="s1174">All right, put your things together, we’re going to go now to the patisserie, and have a piece of cake.”</span> <span id="s1175">So he had this nice thing about, you know, rewards.</span> <span id="s1176">Wa -- my mother was not really that free with -- with praise.</span> <span id="s1177">She was always a lot more demanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: Yeah, but your father was very warm and loving, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Now, you s -- you’ve said different things in the earlier video interview that m-made me feel there was often tension with your mother, and I’m assuming that you, rather than Sam your brother, would be the one who would c-carry the burden of your mother’s ambitions for you.</span> <span id="s1181">But I -- I wondered if you’d talk a bit more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Well, I don’t know if it’s something, you know, if -- I know even from my own experience with children, that by the time Maya was born, the second, one mellows, and -- and it becomes a different -- because obviously the first child has taught you how to become a parent.</span> <span id="s1183">And I think that probably from either a character or personality strai -- trait, I’m probably very much like my mother.</span> <span id="s1184">I too, perfectionist, demanding.</span> <span id="s1185">Really I -- I cringe sometimes at being praised.</span> <span id="s1186">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1187">Which I know is a terrible defect, because it’s almost the obverse side of the coin of claming too much.</span> <span id="s1188">If you always reject praise as -- as if -- you know, you’re asking for people to -- to continue doing that.</span> <span id="s1189">So, you know, there were -- there -- there were -- there were tensions at times, and she was, you know, quite severe with me.</span> <span id="s1190">And it isn’t that she neglected the other two, but I think, again, it was a question of mellowing, and -- and not asking as much from them as I did -- she did with me.</span> <span id="s1191">But on the other hand, especially in the mountains, when I began to reflect about the tensions, and her demands, and things like this.</span> <span id="s1192">It’s -- it’s then that I began to realize how much what was, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self discipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something that you like, namely to go and find out things.</span> <span id="s1193">And -- and the joy of discovering coutch sa -- doesn’t happen if you don’t -- if you don’t try.</span> <span id="s1194">And -- and you know that there are people I -- I know my youngest daughter began -- she had a -- she has perfect pitch, and began to even play tunes in piano when she was barely two, two and a half years old.</span> <span id="s1195">And -- and later on -- I tell her sometimes, and she -- she rightly says it isn’t -- wasn’t laziness, she had other things to interest her.</span> <span id="s1196">So she didn’t pursue piano the way, you know, I thought that she -- she would from -- from that kind of promise in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1197">So similarly, what originally was a -- a compulsion, then I began to appreciate, and how much I owe her for what she eventually was able -- able to give me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: The love of -- of -- of -- of -- of finding out, and -- and -- and looking at things.</span> <span id="s1200">Except that she -- she -- she -- she had a sharp edges to doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Yeah, but fortunately you -- your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: -- you know, you had the -- the balance, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: But her relationship with Samuel might have been different.</span> <span id="s1206">Of course, you can never be in his shoes, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1208">And because a-again, see, the 40’s was s-so different, and by the time that I think Sam also came of age to really start to doing more serious studies, going into the gimnasium, the high school, the war had intervened, and -- and that changed things considerably.</span> <span id="s1209">And I -- I -- and it -- I don’t even by -- that -- tho -- the p -- the -- the occurrence of the war mellowed her.</span> <span id="s1210">It was merely that -- that already other things became very important, and by that time already, I had then hit my stride, and it was not necessary any more to be pushing.</span> <span id="s1211">And she already could see, she had evidence that I had now taken --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1213">We know that as a child you, I think were artistic, but you also built a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1214">I was thinking, I think you made puppets, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: Shadow puppets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: -- were d -- yes -- were d -- were inventive and able in that area.</span> <span id="s1217">Have you continued to -- well, what are the things that you’ve enjoyed doing in your free time?</span> <span id="s1218">A: Well, first of all, it isn’t only from childhood, but I think again a partly a question of personality, character -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s1220">This is tape number four, side A. We’ll go back to the things you were doing for pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1222">Well, again, you know, it’s amazing how inconsequential events remain.</span> <span id="s1223">I ha -- was about six or seven years old, or maybe eight, and I had become a boy scout, or -- or a cub scout, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1224">And part of -- of the thing was to get a uniform, but also a staff.</span> <span id="s1225">You know, the kind of a thing that you have to then use when you climb mountains and so on.</span> <span id="s1226">Well, when the time came for me to -- to -- to get the staff, you d -- you couldn’t go to a store and buy it, but next door, or two doors down from my house was a -- a lumberyard.</span> <span id="s1227">I -- I went and -- and -- and bought a -- a long, square pole, but now it has to be made into a cylinder.</span> <span id="s1228">Well, it happened then again that another two doors down was, in the basement, a -- a -- a man who used to make chairs, and he had a wooden lathe what he would turn, as the phrase goes, you know, the -- the -- the legs.</span> <span id="s1229">And so I t -- I brought the -- that square piece of wood, and he made me wait, and was sit down, and he put it on the lathe.</span> <span id="s1230">And then he began to explain to me while he’s turning the wood, how this essentially amorphous piece of wood, just a square, long, piece of wood, with his cutter, he would be able to transform it and give it shape.</span> <span id="s1231">So it -- it was like seeing something be revealed under the hands of a -- of a craftsman in front of my eyes.</span> <span id="s1232">So then the idea of making things with the hands, is a compliment to the -- the other side of pleasure and discovery, which in -- in -- in mathematics does not require proo -- evidence to the physical world.</span> <span id="s1233">If you solve a proposition in mathematics, you know when you’ve solved it.</span> <span id="s1234">You don’t need somebody to come and say yes, that’s right, you know it.</span> <span id="s1235">Unlike physics, or -- or science where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical observation, experiment.</span> <span id="s1236">Which is then half wasted because it requires both intellect and observation, to then making things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires also some training, which obviously involves the brain.</span> <span id="s1237">So I -- from those early things then, I wanted to build things.</span> <span id="s1238">And so when we went to California for the first time, I bought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I remember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent of the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the amount of marble, and just reveals what’s already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: What about -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: All right, so -- so -- so -- wha -- you asked me what I like to do for pleasure, and part of it was, when I was at Bell Laboratories for example, then I belonged to a Bridge playing club, and i -- some of us at lunch hour, instead of going to the cafeteria to have lunch, would have a sandwich, take it with us, and go to the recreation room, and -- and play Bridge until the -- and so very quickly, and especially in Bridge as well as in chess, you have to have good tutors, especially wish have -- to have very good partners.</span> <span id="s1241">I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing in tournaments.</span> <span id="s1242">At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, is -- it was -- it’s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel.</span> <span id="s1243">This is a -- a -- a game with the following.</span> <span id="s1244">It’s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there are two boards, with a wall in between the two players.</span> <span id="s1245">So both boards are set independently, and each player does not see what the other’s board contains.</span> <span id="s1246">And the moves start.</span> <span id="s1247">There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role is only to say whether a move that you may attempt is permissible or not.</span> <span id="s1248">Permissible in the sense if there’s an opponent piece, you cannot move, let’s say, a square ahead, all right?</span> <span id="s1249">And his other role is to say whether you have captured a piece.</span> <span id="s1250">That’s the only thing he’s permitted to say.</span> <span id="s1251">And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don’t know the deployment of the opponent forces.</span> <span id="s1252">Now, as you proceed with the game, and pieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out, you begin to have a pretty good idea what it is.</span> <span id="s1253">So these are the things which are intellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me.</span> <span id="s1254">But inc -- we moved to California, I bought a saw, and I started make -- making things.</span> <span id="s1255">Making things out of wood, then when we came here I made the table which I showed you upstairs.</span> <span id="s1256">I made some other pieces.</span> <span id="s1257">But now I don’t do these things any more, now it -- it’s -- a new toy has come into my life, and that’s th-the -- the computer, and making web sites, and things like this.</span> <span id="s1258">The other passion is music.</span> <span id="s1259">I’m a -- a musician monqué as they say in French.</span> <span id="s1260">If I had another life, this is what I would have liked to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: And tell me more about the kind of music that you feel you most enjoy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Well, I have always thought that my eldest sa -- daughter Sarah really was born about three or 400 years too late.</span> <span id="s1263">Her li -- preferences, and the things that she likes in [indecipherable] are more suited to the Renaissance days of Italy, at least as I picture them.</span> <span id="s1264">Similarly, my tastes in music are really frozen, as it were, between the 17th and the beginning of the 20th century.</span> <span id="s1265">So I only listen to classical music.</span> <span id="s1266">And although I studied the violin, it is a terrible instrument.</span> <span id="s1267">It’s a punishing instrument because it’s very, very hard, even for experienced violinists to -- to make a good sound come out of that instrument.</span> <span id="s1268">And although I never took piano lessons, the piano attracts me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1269">Occasionally -- I have a keyboard, if I hear a melody, or a part of an opera and I want to reconstruct it, and I -- I can go back to the keyboard and try to -- to -- to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Course you can do wonderful things with musical composition on the computer now, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yes, but -- right, but I think -- and I’m sure that some of that can be very creative, but I don’t have the training to -- to do that.</span> <span id="s1272">So at times I try to play with programs that -- in the computer that do that, but I co -- quickly see that -- that -- that -- that this is purely mechanical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1274">I know that you’ll be going to Macedonia some time later this year, has tru --</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: -- has travel been an important part of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yes, I -- I have not travel -- after my retirement in ’91 -- in ’90, sorry, even -- I did not agonize very much about what I was going to do, I know many people who are approaching that age, or -- or time, they say oh, what am I going to do afterwards?</span> <span id="s1278">Well, I thought for a little while, but then I said all right, I’ll try to do whatever interests me, and -- and if I begin to climb walls in the -- I’ll -- I’ll think of [indecipherable] then.</span> <span id="s1279">All right.</span> <span id="s1280">First of all, I was asked by my former boss to consult for another year for the company, because there was still a piece of work that I had started, that was unfinished, and he was not planning to replace my position.</span> <span id="s1281">So I did that for a year.</span> <span id="s1282">Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the European community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work which was being funded by the European community, but which dealt with telecommunications, and it’s future in Greece.</span> <span id="s1283">I mean the telecommunication system.</span> <span id="s1284">So for four years, I traveled.</span> <span id="s1285">I was practically on the plane every other month, through Europe, throughout Europe.</span> <span id="s1286">I -- I’m no -- I’m talking about the east, but primarily the western part of Europe, and Greece, doing this consulting work.</span> <span id="s1287">Then a year after that, a big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point, and we had had the Irish telecommunications company, that which led me to go to Ireland a number of times, which I -- both Paulette and I love.</span> <span id="s1288">Then we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1289">I have lots of relatives there, who had migrated -- some of them migrated in the early 30’s from Salonika to Israel.</span> <span id="s1290">So there’s a -- a lot of progeny that’s -- that’s now in -- in the tents.</span> <span id="s1291">Plus also some cousins, among them Miriam, her last name is Kalahora, who was one of about an estimated 1500 Jews who were able to escape from Greece via boat to Turkey, and then go from Turkey, through Syria, and Lebanon, eventually to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1292">Now some of them, and her sister, either -- I mean, drowned, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s1293">What is not known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and -- and essentially kill them.</span> <span id="s1294">Some of them were captured by the Germans, by some patrol boats.</span> <span id="s1295">Some were also denounced.</span> <span id="s1296">But one of them made it.</span> <span id="s1297">But 1500 made it to -- to Turkey, to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Now, do you f -- do you follow -- d -- do you have any comments on what’s happening in Israel now, and do you -- I -- I -- I’m -- I wondered to what extent you’re more politically aware than many a -- sort of homegrown Americans may be, not just regarding Israel, but be interested to know your thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: All right, well, first of all, I -- I -- I think I’m -- I -- I read avidly about current affairs, both in the press, and -- and in -- in magazines.</span> <span id="s1300">I think about that, I talk to people.</span> <span id="s1301">What -- what has troubled me about Israel, I could not really understand even a woman as -- as bright, and as capable as the former prime minister, what -- her -- what was her name?</span> <span id="s1302">Q: Golda Maier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Golda Maier, who at one point was asked about the Palestinians and says, “Who are they?”</span> <span id="s1304">And I really have not been able to understand the -- the mentality of some people, both in Israel, and I think sometimes more of it among some of the leadership of the Jewish community in the United States to -- to almost ignore the existence of -- of a group of people, namely the Palestinians.</span> <span id="s1305">M-My own preference would have been the kind of a thing that as we know from events, things came almost close to being done, except at -- at the last moment, at the altar, one or the other di-didn’t -- didn’t -- didn’t make it happen.</span> <span id="s1306">I think personally both -- I think that’s historical invisibility.</span> <span id="s1307">The end of it if it -- it will take place, it -- it would be along the lines of what Rabin and -- was attempting to do, or -- or Barak.</span> <span id="s1308">But I -- I -- I -- I talk to my relatives, and I -- I find them on both sides of the issue, and I -- I hesitate -- although I do not hesitate to criticize the government, or -- or individuals in -- in the -- in the Israeli government, because sometimes I feel that they lack statesmanship, and -- and savvy.</span> <span id="s1309">But then I also realize that -- that since -- there’s a Greek saying that if -- if you are not in the -- in the dancing floor, don’t attempt to teach those what -- what are the -- the right steps, and because I’m not there, I -- I -- I -- I can voice certain observations and certain views, but not t-to the point of -- of -- of being adamant about it, because I don’t live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: How much time have you spent at the Holocaust Museum?</span> <span id="s1311">I know of your work there, but what -- ho -- what part --</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: -- how much of your life has that work taken up, and -- and what are your thoughts about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1315">Well, the -- my things with the Holocaust Museum took really -- it took place in two different times, and for two different reasons, and two different periods.</span> <span id="s1316">One was about five or eight years ago, when I was even trying to ascertain the date of my mother’s death.</span> <span id="s1317">Now, I would ask Sam, when did you get to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s1318">Well, of course, I mean, I think it was -- you know, either -- either between the 17th, and the 20th of August.</span> <span id="s1319">All right.</span> <span id="s1320">“Well,” I said, “I need to find out.”</span> <span id="s1321">Well, I went, and I started looking at the archives, and I found what’s called -- I think I v -- we would -- we talked about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: We ju -- we just mentioned it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1324">The Danuta Chronicles, which were the -- a kind of -- of almost diary officially that it was kept by a Czech inmate called Danuta --</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: -- and eventually it was published, and they are known as the Danuta Chronicles.</span> <span id="s1327">Well, you look at entries day by day as they -- they are there.</span> <span id="s1328">Sometimes they are from the sublime or the horrible, to the terribly mundane.</span> <span id="s1329">For instance, okay, today 15,000 arrived and were taken to the crematoria.</span> <span id="s1330">And then this individual was punished with 10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1331">I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of entries.</span> <span id="s1332">Well, all right.</span> <span id="s1333">Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16 August of ’44, where he says, “1600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.”</span> <span id="s1334">Then he says how -- so many males, so many females.</span> <span id="s1335">Not of the total, but so many females were given numbers, and he has the range of the numbers, and the females were given the following numbers.</span> <span id="s1336">And I knew from Sam’s number on his arm fits exactly in the range that he’s -- he cited there.</span> <span id="s1337">So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I asked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, “Very early, dawn.”</span> <span id="s1338">And that makes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day, because they didn’t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day.</span> <span id="s1339">So that was the first thing.</span> <span id="s1340">So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s1341">What drove me then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar thing.</span> <span id="s1342">I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in Macedonia, in mon -- in Monasteer, but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in Serbia, very few ever reached the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1343">And now not that much had been written, so I was beginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources.</span> <span id="s1344">Now I know the Germans shot most of the Serbian Jews and buried them, or used mobile gas vans.</span> <span id="s1345">It was before the killing factories began to operate.</span> <span id="s1346">Well, then I found in a book that the Bulgarians who occupied Macedonia and Phrase, among other things, and -- and this book which is called, “A Town called Monasteer,” makes the following assertion.</span> <span id="s1347">That in the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- o -- a -- an item unique to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1348">But emphatically I’ve concluded there is nothing unique about the Holocaust, everything is unique about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1349">And so I contacted Yad Vashem, eventually I got the microfilm, it came.</span> <span id="s1350">But then, while I’m waiting for that, I thought I would to go the archives, and I asked Sharon there innocently, do you have anything from Monasteer?</span> <span id="s1351">Yes, we have 1400 photographs.</span> <span id="s1352">Well, here is two huge books, but you couldn’t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification.</span> <span id="s1353">But together there was two rolls of 35 millimeter microfilm, so you take the books to the library, put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same number as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cyrillic was the identity and address of these persons.</span> <span id="s1354">Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to my relatives.</span> <span id="s1355">Now though, since it’s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at the end is f. There’s Colonomos from my mother’s brother, I found my aunt.</span> <span id="s1356">My uncle Salamone Hamma, my father’s brother, and my father’s sister, Oro, who had married a man named Franco.</span> <span id="s1357">Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came home.</span> <span id="s1358">I was a bit moved by this discovery.</span> <span id="s1359">Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following Monday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, “Well, Mr. Nehama, you know, we wanted to call you, but I was hesitating, and,” -- I said, “Look, let me tell you why I’m calling.</span> <span id="s1360">Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps maybe I can help.”</span> <span id="s1361">She said, “That’s what we were going to ask you too, if you would be willing to.”</span> <span id="s1362">And that’s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of work took almost a year, because now, for the first six months, I would go the museum carrying my portable computer, and get the books, get the microfilm, sit in front of a reader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would then transfer them to the computer.</span> <span id="s1363">Then one day it dawned on me that instead of trudging and getting all these things to the museum, maybe I would rent a microfilm reader, and bring it here to my house, and I don’t have to -- to travel.</span> <span id="s1364">But immediately then I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, it gives you a copy out of the printer.</span> <span id="s1365">Well, that means that the stupid thing goes out digitally so that the printer can print it.</span> <span id="s1366">If it goes out to the printer, it can sure go to a CD.</span> <span id="s1367">So I took the -- the microfilm, and I paid a co -- a company, and they transferred onto -- on one -- on a CD, so I did the remaining other four or five months at home.</span> <span id="s1368">Then after that was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the Yad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you magnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that different clerks were writing, because you can see that the handwriting is changing over time.</span> <span id="s1369">And it -- it was a-another almost eight or nine months of very eye breaking e-e-effort to -- to do the Yad Vashem thing.</span> <span id="s1370">But it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: But it was also very rewarding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Very rewarding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: What -- what are the other things that you want to do in the remaining time you have?</span> <span id="s1376">I mean not -- are there other interests that you have not yet pursued?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Well, let me give you an example, all right?</span> <span id="s1378">A few years ago, the -- after my first grandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like everyone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about?</span> <span id="s1379">So -- so I put together a little handmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity -- special relativity, not general relativity to a child.</span> <span id="s1380">The truth is that it requires a little bit more sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they don’t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first.</span> <span id="s1381">But there are certain aspects of special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable] because one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we cannot experience it.</span> <span id="s1382">You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been books that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is.</span> <span id="s1383">Suppose it was on -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you car -- say speed of light was 30 miles per hour.</span> <span id="s1384">What would happen?</span> <span id="s1385">You -- you go out in the street, and -- and you see a person in a bicycle, and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it’s one of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that’s one of the aspects of -- of special relativity.</span> <span id="s1386">But because you can’t make -- you know, but -- so you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so I’m waiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the relativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell them, or tell them other stories.</span> <span id="s1387">Because I remember from childhood I would be fascinated I had certain heroes.</span> <span id="s1388">Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus.</span> <span id="s1389">Or -- or Hercules, or Eracles.</span> <span id="s1390">Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was Alexander the Great.</span> <span id="s1391">Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug in many respects.</span> <span id="s1392">That’s the kind of thing that I would like to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1394">So it sounds to me as if you -- there may be a market for those ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Right, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: I was thinking, I think Einstein said he asked the questions only a child would ask, and that ties in with something you said earlier about working in fields where you are free of the sort of strictures sometimes placed by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: -- certain workplaces, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1400">Well, you see, Einstein said that imagination is much, much more important than even very sharp intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1402">You know, often in these interviews -- and -- and this is why I think of this question, about your sort of resilience, and your psychic state, but ha -- have you felt that you ever needed to have psychiatric counseling?</span> <span id="s1403">I -- I’m -- y-you know, I wondered if the -- I know your brother Sam would have seen and experienced far more horrifying things, but I wonder if you felt some degree of trauma from the losses in your family, and that -- that -- that has at times been difficult to bear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: Look, I -- I have felt, or I have thought about the Holocaust and what happened to my mother, brothers, the other relatives, and I am absolutely certain that he has colored part of my outlook to life, to other people.</span> <span id="s1405">But can I make a connection, can I -- was there -- was there a time when I had personal difficulties?</span> <span id="s1406">I mentioned to you the divorce.</span> <span id="s1407">But I -- I didn’t find that -- that a, even if there was a connection, that I would be able to -- to -- to get relief, to -- tying it to God.</span> <span id="s1408">So it’s one of the unanswered things.</span> <span id="s1409">I have been m-more impressed by the works of all of the writers of the Holocaust, there’ve been quite a few.</span> <span id="s1410">But the one that -- that I admire most is Primo Levi.</span> <span id="s1411">Number one may be because he was both a -- a scientist and a chemist, as well as a extremely sensitive individual, let alone a -- a wonderful writer.</span> <span id="s1412">And you know, although most people now conclude that he committed suicide, rather than dying because of an accident falling down -- downstairs, I have not ever found it ne -- essential, or at least that I could even remotely hypothesize that this particular personal problem is tied -- and as far as looking for help, maybe it could be resolved, but it would not be cause of that, not because of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I think -- when we were talking, and you were asking me about the recent work that I had done, which I call the trassiteration and translation project with the archives of the -- in the Holocaust Museum, it was -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: You don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: Oh, let me ch -- let me see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: You need -- you need a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1419">This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span> <span id="s1420">This is tape number four, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: We were talking about one aspect -- not that one aspect, but I think you used the word, and I almost at the same time, that the work that I was doing was very rewarding, and I-I -- I think it’s very rewarding.</span> <span id="s1422">But there were also some byproducts, if I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came into contact with individuals of similar interests.</span> <span id="s1423">There’s a matter of me corresponding with -- his name is Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from Monasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake district in Chile.</span> <span id="s1424">And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee communities in South America.</span> <span id="s1425">Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a man who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San Francisco area.</span> <span id="s1426">And it was through Mark’s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have copies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer Jews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance française in -- in Monasteer.</span> <span id="s1427">Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the president of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we have a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where’s he’s addressing the illion israllitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to the Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment during the first World War, to almost the total destruction of Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s1428">Then -- then my uncle Solomon was the secretary of the Joint Distribution Committee in Monasteer, thanking the Jews of America for a shipment of clothing.</span> <span id="s1429">All of that, in addition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave something to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me when I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are very selfish.</span> <span id="s1430">They don’t think about anybody else.</span> <span id="s1431">Then they go to school, they meet other people, so they begin to share.</span> <span id="s1432">When they have a family, they begin to give to others.</span> <span id="s1433">But some people stop there.</span> <span id="s1434">Now, very few people begin to give to a larger circle, namely their immediate community.</span> <span id="s1435">Still fewer give to even larger circle, the country to which they belong.</span> <span id="s1436">And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give to the entire world.</span> <span id="s1437">So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don’t know whether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history that he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs.</span> <span id="s1438">So I’m glad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a ledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance.</span> <span id="s1439">So that’s the kind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I’ve done represents, and then finally that I may be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it’s -- it’s -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me insistently to do, to write my memoirs.</span> <span id="s1440">So at least I -- if -- if I only write certain other parts, and I don’t write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can refer to, if they choose to, after I’m gone.</span> <span id="s1441">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">End of
