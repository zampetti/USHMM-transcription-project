My completely Jewish name is Semanto Menachem Ackos.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q.</span> <span id="s10">When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A. I was born on November 10, 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q.</span> <span id="s13">In what town and country were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A. I was born in Breveza, Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q. Was that a suburb of Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A. No, it was in northern Greece near the Albanian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q.</span> <span id="s18">What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A. My father’s name was Menachem Semanto Ackos and my mother’s maiden name was Rosa Chaim Vitalis.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q. Were they born in that same city?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A. My father was born in the next town, where we called it Yanena, and my mother was born in the same town that I was born in, Breveza.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q.</span> <span id="s23">What were your parents’ occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A. My father was a general merchant, and wheeler and dealer guy, whatever he could do in order to make the best for his family.</span> <span id="s25">Also, my mother was very, very wonderful alteration lady for woman’s garments.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q.</span> <span id="s27">You say your father did everything.</span> <span id="s28">He bought, he sold?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A. Wheeling and dealing.</span> <span id="s30">Buying, selling, the merchant type of wheeling and dealing in Greece is way, way different than in the United States.</span> <span id="s31">You don’t need no license.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q. Can you tell me about it?</span> <span id="s33">I mean, clothing, metals, grain?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A. I can tell you about it.</span> <span id="s35">I can tell you that you will go into a warehouse, that they were selling flannels, blankets, things like that, that you will buy a quantity of them, and leave some at home, and the rest of them, you put it on your shoulder or a push cart, and go over to the neighborhoods and sell it to the ladies.</span> <span id="s36">Like we didn’t have so many department stores over there, so they were waiting for the merchant to come in to their door.</span> <span id="s37">Also he was part goldsmith, buying, selling gold and copper and silver, and things like that.</span> <span id="s38">Anything that he can do to improve the better life for his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q.</span> <span id="s40">What languages did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A.</span> <span id="s42">We speak completely Greek.</span> <span id="s43">We were not aware of any other language at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q.</span> <span id="s45">Then you didn’t speak Yiddish, as so many central Europeans did.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A. No.</span> <span id="s47">We did not have any of that.</span> <span id="s48">We had only one small school that the youngsters, before they hit high school, they were learning the basics of the Jewish language.</span> <span id="s49">But it wasn’t very much to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q.</span> <span id="s51">This was Hebrew, though, rather than Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A. Well, I don’t know, to tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s53">I’m ashamed to say it, but I don’t know the difference between Yiddish and Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q. Hebrew is what the prayer books are written in in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. Well, then, it was Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q. Was your family, then, very religious?</span> <span id="s57">Did you have a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A. Just like any common other family in Greece.</span> <span id="s59">Whenever we could, we respected and loved God.</span> <span id="s60">I attended all the High Holidays, but I will not say that ever Shabbos we were over in the shul.</span> <span id="s61">I will not say that.</span> <span id="s62">But I can say that all the High Holidays were attended religiously and with a great respect for our religion, to keep our customs alive, and to keep the best that we know for loving our own religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q. And when you say High Holidays you mean Rosh Hashanah?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A. I mean Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, I mean Succoth and Pesach, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q. Was anybody in your family a Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A. Zionists we did not have at that time, because technically, to tell you the truth, we didn’t even know what the word Zionist means.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q.</span> <span id="s68">Now we’ll move away from the family.</span> <span id="s69">What events, local, national, international, were you aware of from the mid ‘30’s, late ‘30’s to 1941?</span> <span id="s70">I think this question aims at news of what was happening, say, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A. Absolutely none.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q. Where were you getting your information at this time?</span> <span id="s73">Newspapers?</span> <span id="s74">Radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A.</span> <span id="s76">We did not have any information about the outside world from Greece except on October 28, 1940, the Italians were allies of the Axis, declared war against the Greeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q. We’ll get to that in a minute.</span> <span id="s78">Here were have a couple more questions on background.</span> <span id="s79">The question here is in what setting or settings did you have contact with Gentiles?</span> <span id="s80">Obviously your father did business with them…</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A. Gentiles were our friends, colleagues and classmates, merchant mates, our families, neighbors.</span> <span id="s82">The religion had not much to do with the combination of our friendship and acquaintance in the neighborhood and in the world of business, except at the time of Passover, when it was the crucifixion of the Christ.</span> <span id="s83">At that time it was a small percentage of animosity from the Gentiles towards the Jews, and only that time, showing obviously.</span> <span id="s84">The rest of the time, the anti-Semitism was a little bit under the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q.</span> <span id="s86">How did it show up, this little that was not under the ground?</span> <span id="s87">What happened at Easter time?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A. Well, at Easter time, they would avoid contact, especially at the time of the great grand Friday, the Good Friday, when it was the day that Christ was crucified.</span> <span id="s89">They would look at us and try to avoid any contact with us at that time.</span> <span id="s90">As a matter of fact, it was a myth that the mothers will frighten the little boys and girls that in case they’re not very good, they’re going to give them to the Jews, and the Jews are gonna put them over barrels with pins and needles, to take the blood away from them, make their bread out of it, which was the matzo.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q.</span> <span id="s92">You mean the mothers were using Jews to frighten little children?</span> <span id="s93">You were the boogeyman?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A. Yes, that was the truth.</span> <span id="s95">And it was very unfortunate—and I can say it right now, with no regret—that 85% of the Grecian people were almost illiterate.</span> <span id="s96">So they didn’t know any better, and it was something like they inherit it from mother to son, and they could not accept very gracefully that anybody that was Greek can worship another religion besides the Greek Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q.</span> <span id="s98">So then, where in Poland at that time, the little Jewish kids were having rocks thrown at them, and getting beaten up, in Greece the Gentile kids were afraid of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A. Well, I tell you, they were looking at the Jews as part of the curse remaining from the Christ itself, that they were not blessed by the Lord Jesus, and they had the mystic voodoo powers to do some harm.</span> <span id="s100">So it was all these kinds of myths during the Passover time and during the Easter of the Greeks.</span> <span id="s101">All the rest of the time they were fading away.</span> <span id="s102">At least they weren’t showing, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q.</span> <span id="s104">But nobody called you names because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A. No, but it was exactly in Greece the same thing that is almost over the whole world.</span> <span id="s106">When a Jew does not do exactly the favor or cooperation of the Gentile wish, you hear a certain percentage of the Gentiles call you, “that damn Jew”.</span> <span id="s107">That is a fact all over the world, not only in Greece or in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q. I’m going to interpolate a minute now, another question.</span> <span id="s109">Tell me, who was in your family?</span> <span id="s110">How many sisters and brothers were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A.</span> <span id="s112">We are four sisters and I was the only brother, and the father and the mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q.</span> <span id="s114">What ages were the girls?</span> <span id="s115">Were they younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A.</span> <span id="s117">The girls were approximately two years apart from me and the last one was ten years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q. And were there other relatives living outside your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s120">Not outside of our community.</span> <span id="s121">In the same quarters that we were living.</span> <span id="s122">Our mother’s father and mother had very unfortunately died, and my father took in his own protection my mother’s two brothers and one sister, which is the sister of my mother who has become widowed through the Albanian and Greek war.</span> <span id="s123">My father took them all in custody, and besides raising his own family, he was guarding and protecting my mother’s two brothers and sister.</span> <span id="s124">Also, another brother that my mother had, he was serving in the Grecian army, and he stepped on a needle.</span> <span id="s125">He had tetanus through that and he died when he was 22 years old.</span> <span id="s126">His name was Gersom Vitalis.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q. Now, you say he was their guardian.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">(Female voice: I think he wants to say “protector.”)</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A.</span> <span id="s130">He helped them as a protector, providing food and providing quarters to sleep, and guarding them if anything was wrong.</span> <span id="s131">One of the men was trying to be a craftsman for shoes, the other one a merchant, and mother’s sister was helping as much as she could by altering dresses in houses when there was a need for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q. To your knowledge, what happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A.</span> <span id="s134">They all got caught by the Nazis, and shipped by trains to the concentration camp of Auschwitz, and we never hear of them except a small detail that we heard about my father.</span> <span id="s135">According to the story of the survivors that had come back from the concentration camp, he was part of the plot to blow up part of the crematoriums over there.</span> <span id="s136">We don’t know what is truth and what is not truth, because many stories, good, bad and indifferent, had arrived with the first Holocaust survivors from Germany.</span> <span id="s137">Also, in Greece, after the end of the war, were many survivors from many other countries, like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, because Israel was reborn in that time and Greece was one of the main lands that you could travel to Israel through sea and it was called Achsherah.</span> <span id="s138">And it was welcoming everybody and anybody that wanted to emigrate to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q. Was this the Greek government that built this?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A.</span> <span id="s141">We do not know exactly where Achsherah was founding from but it was a word that it was funding through United Jewish Appeal or American Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s142">It was based in New York that time, and they had a representative from Yanana Relief.</span> <span id="s143">But they would have made one of these bases like a little camp outside of Athens, that every Jew was welcome, either had a family or didn’t have a family, or he wanted to remain Jew and go to live his life beyond the survivor, or whatever he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s144">It was a shelter for anybody who was passing by into Greece from any place as long as he was Jew, and he will be as comfortable as he possibly could make ‘em through the circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q.</span> <span id="s146">Now we get into questions about the actual war.</span> <span id="s147">What age were you when the Italians attacked Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A.</span> <span id="s149">When the Italians took Greece I was from 9 to 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q. And how did you hear about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A.</span> <span id="s152">How did I hear?</span> <span id="s153">It was like a great celebration!</span> <span id="s154">When on October 28 Mussolini sent the telegraph over to Greece that you either surrender or we attack you, everybody and his brother that he can hold an arm, he went over against the Italians.</span> <span id="s155">There was nobody who could miss it.</span> <span id="s156">It was like a celebration.</span> <span id="s157">(Laughing)</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q.</span> <span id="s159">So there was mobilization.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A. Yeah.</span> <span id="s161">It was a grand…what they call it when they grab everybody that goes in the army?</span> <span id="s162">Drafting.</span> <span id="s163">They draft everybody and everybody was volunteering and even the ones, they weren’t qualified to be drafted, they wanted to go over and fight for the freedom of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q.</span> <span id="s165">Did the Jewish community react in any special way?</span> <span id="s166">Like was there a meeting at the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A. Oh, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s168">The Jewish people reacted just exactly like the Americans reacted at Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s169">Everybody went over, got his uniform, to work against the guy that wanted to invade our freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q. Okay, so here we are now.</span> <span id="s171">The war has begun.</span> <span id="s172">How did your life change, economically and socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A. Well, it’s a long story to that.</span> <span id="s174">The Italians were advancing for the first month, but after that the Greeks drove them all the way through the Adriatic Sea, and then Mussolini had to ask Hitler for help, and Hitler marched through Yugoslavia into Macedonia and six months later in April the Nazis marched right into Greece.</span> <span id="s175">As soon as they marched right in, everything turned upside down.</span> <span id="s176">They divide Greece in two different categories.</span> <span id="s177">Athens was under the control of the Italians, and all of the rest of the other Greek land was under control of the Germans.</span> <span id="s178">And they come over and they announce over the radio, “We come in as friends and if you don’t bother us, we don’t bother you.</span> <span id="s179">But if you do bother us, you will be punished by death.”</span> <span id="s180">So just before the Greek national radio stations shut out, the announcers said this: “Everybody has to fight against the Nazis, even if it costs his life.</span> <span id="s181">Long life to Greece!”</span> <span id="s182">And after that the Nazis took over the radio and everything else.</span> <span id="s183">With a very small time, no more than two months, everything had disappeared from Greece.</span> <span id="s184">You could not find any food.</span> <span id="s185">People will sacrifice houses, without exaggeration, for five pounds of beans.</span> <span id="s186">People dying in the streets like flies.</span> <span id="s187">We lost more people from starvation than we lost from bullets.</span> <span id="s188">There were many undergrounds, and kids that were making all kinds of things, anything that they can damage the conquerors.</span> <span id="s189">And the conquerors in return were very, very much angry, and rough, on anybody.</span> <span id="s190">Winston Churchill come out every day on the radio and one time he said, “Greek people, even if you take and damage one screw out of the great German machine, you lead us one step towards victory.</span> <span id="s191">Do whatever you can.”</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q.</span> <span id="s193">How did you hear Winston Churchill?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A.</span> <span id="s195">We hear Winston Churchill because the Nazis had always confiscate those radios.</span> <span id="s196">The ones that were not confiscate, they were digging inside of wells, right in homes, inside of courtyards, and any place that can possibly hide them, and we were getting them out in the afternoon hours when London BBC will come out and speak.</span> <span id="s197">That time we used to send a few guys, small boys, three, four blocks away, from anybody was listening to the radio, so when the German electronic cars were coming in, they can catch wherever the radio’s coming from and then he will come over, whistle, and we shut off the radio, and put it right back in the well, because almost every house in Greece had, in the middle of the courtyard, a well that it was drawing water out of it.</span> <span id="s198">That’s how we heard from the BBC.</span> <span id="s199">The penalty for listening to the BBC at that time was immediately death.</span> <span id="s200">As same as the penalty if you’re hiding a Jew.</span> <span id="s201">If you know of a Jew, and you don’t report them, it was also death.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q. Was the BBC broadcasting in Greek, or did you know some English?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A. On, no.</span> <span id="s204">The BBC was broadcasting in Greek language.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q. Now, what were you personally doing?</span> <span id="s206">Did you do any sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A. EVERYBODY, not only myself, everybody was involved.</span> <span id="s208">Anybody who can think.</span> <span id="s209">The sabotage cannot be by bodily harming some soldier, or by blowing a tire of a car.</span> <span id="s210">That you hated them, it was sabotage right there, itself.</span> <span id="s211">They knew very well that they were not welcome.</span> <span id="s212">The young people between ten and fifteen, when the cars and trucks were traveling fifty, sixty miles an hour, or thirty miles an hour, they will jump behind the cab, steal the fuel, anything they can steal, and jump out.</span> <span id="s213">They were coming to the point that every truck had a guard behind with a gun, and soon as a kid will jump on, they will kill right on the spot.</span> <span id="s214">We had many, many formal ways of sabotaging.</span> <span id="s215">As far as myself is concerned, I’d rather not talk about it.</span> <span id="s216">It’s not time of bragging or heroism or any things like that.</span> <span id="s217">It’s been a long time now, but everybody did something to damage the great German machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q. Now, your father had gone off to fight?</span> <span id="s219">Did he enlist?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A.</span> <span id="s221">It was a word at that time that they will take all the young men and send them over to work in factories in Germany.</span> <span id="s222">To build, the Germans needed working hands.</span> <span id="s223">One period of time, he left and he went over with the partisans.</span> <span id="s224">He came back sometime later.</span> <span id="s225">I’m not so sure what was the reason that he come back—he got wounded, or the partisans went way out deep.</span> <span id="s226">But towards the middle of 1944, when the great Nazi snake was dying, nobody was believing that it would harm anybody else, and that time the new boss of Athens was German, because Italy had gone underground, and he promised to the Jewish people through the Great Archbishop of Athens that he will not harm the Jewish people if every Saturday they will go and present themselves, the men, in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s227">Every Saturday for an hour.</span> <span id="s228">It was not going to harm anybody.</span> <span id="s229">It was a part of a trap.</span> <span id="s230">Because the Germans were losing, nobody thought that they had time now to take revenge out of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s231">So for several weeks the Jews were going over to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s232">They said, “Right here we are,” and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s233">The time was going by.</span> <span id="s234">They had more trust that nothing will happen to them, until that day of March 25, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q. To backtrack a little bit, then, your father was gone for a while, and there was your mother alone with these five little children, and you were the oldest.</span> <span id="s236">What did you live on?</span> <span id="s237">Who made a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A. What’s the difference?</span> <span id="s239">We did try anything and everything.</span> <span id="s240">It’s very, very difficult to American people, or to a reader, to understand.</span> <span id="s241">How can homes live without plumbing, how can homes live without telephones, how can homes live without doctors, even how can ladies give birth to children with midwives?</span> <span id="s242">At that time we didn’t have no telephones, we didn’t have no plumbing—we had outside in our courtyard—we can have one pound of beans and three pounds of bread, and it lasts us three days.</span> <span id="s243">We did anything and everything, whatever we could, to survive.</span> <span id="s244">Everybody was doing his best.</span> <span id="s245">We were going to the woods, we were going to anyplace you could, to get any food.</span> <span id="s246">We all were a lack of nutrition.</span> <span id="s247">It was one was helping the other.</span> <span id="s248">Greeks were helping the Jews; the Jews were helping the Greeks, wherever you could, so you stay alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q. And you were heating your home with wood stoves.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A.</span> <span id="s251">There is no such thing as was heating homes.</span> <span id="s252">People cannot understand that the winters were not as severe as in Minnesota, but we had a great big, like a wood stove.</span> <span id="s253">We’d grab some wood here, and we’d get newspapers, anything.</span> <span id="s254">It’s completely indescribable.</span> <span id="s255">I do not have the imagination and I cannot coming close to the truth of describing how we survived.</span> <span id="s256">Sometimes it’s very miraculous like to believe that people can survive under circumstances.</span> <span id="s257">Most of the time it’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q. I did not ask you before, when did you move to Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A.</span> <span id="s260">When did we move to Athens?</span> <span id="s261">We moved from Breveza to Athens when I was five years old.</span> <span id="s262">We survived also because, during the good days when father was working his wheeling and dealing, he had saved enough gold, and he made it into the small coins, liras, and then we were selling part of the gold on the black market to survive and buy food and things like that.</span> <span id="s263">Towards the end we didn’t have anything much more.</span> <span id="s264">But also there he had a taxicab, that was very unique at that time.</span> <span id="s265">But we cannot use it because lack of gasoline and lack of the people riding in the cabs, and also the Nazis were confiscating anything that had wheels on it.</span> <span id="s266">So my father had taken the wheels out of the cab, and give it to a friend to put it in a basement, and he hide the whole entire torso of the cab.</span> <span id="s267">The friend was a manufacturer of bamboo and straw things, and he covered the cab with bamboo and straw things so nobody would see it.</span> <span id="s268">And right after the war, when father was gone, and we come back in our own home, my mother and I, we took the cab out, and we put it back.</span> <span id="s269">With the help of the Greek government restoring our license, we had a Greek employee to drive the cab, one in the day and one in the night—they stole us blind, but that’s a different story—but through the cab we were trying to survive.</span> <span id="s270">So many other actions were involved after the war, like the United Jewish Appeal has brought in so many services like doctors and orphanages…</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q. We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s272">Let’s back up a minute now.</span> <span id="s273">Somebody said that when your father went to the partisans, or before your father went to the partisans, you were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A. My mother’s sister, she was widowed from the second war.</span> <span id="s275">She met a friend, very, very well to do lady that had a whole house over in some kind of suburb of Athens.</span> <span id="s276">Her own son was killed in the Albanian War, and the two women had become friends.</span> <span id="s277">Knowing the fact—the other lady—that my mother’s sister was Jewish, she offered to go hiding in case something happened.</span> <span id="s278">She didn’t care for her life, because she was alone.</span> <span id="s279">So my mother’s sister, through that lady, took us into hiding before my father went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s280">And then, after he come back from the partisans, we still were there.</span> <span id="s281">Then we come back in the house again, and then come back to the hiding.</span> <span id="s282">It was a couple of times like that.</span> <span id="s283">Now this is also forty-five years ago, and even though that I am fifty-five years old, I do not recall everything in the smallest detail.</span> <span id="s284">I’m very sure my sisters will be able to add something that I might miss.</span> <span id="s285">Even though they were a little bit younger than me, I imagine that their memories will not fool ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q. Well, you remember different things.</span> <span id="s287">You remember what was important to you and what was happening specifically to you.</span> <span id="s288">Now you must have been hearing what was happening to the Jews in other parts of Europe, because you said a few minutes ago that, “We didn’t think anything would happen to us.”</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s290">We never had any contact to know what happened to the Jews in any other places in Europe.</span> <span id="s291">The BBC, which was the direct contact with the Greeks, it was busy talking about only the military victories or defeats of the Nazis, in England and America.</span> <span id="s292">They never had to bother with any kind of the small details about the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s293">We did have, though, in 1943, an occasion that the biggest city of Greece, which was Salonika, had the greatest population of Jewish people and three or four synagogues and many, many thousands of Jews, they were taken from there into Germany or something, but it was something like hiding and misinformation about other people.</span> <span id="s294">I’m very unfortunate to say, there were two brothers, the brothers of Reykanati, that they were hiding and they turned them in to the Germans for their own safety, which is the two brothers also got into court after the war, and they were executed by the Greek government.</span> <span id="s295">But during the exile of the Jews from Salonika, we didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s296">There was not any information whatsoever.</span> <span id="s297">And like I said before, because the war was at the tail end, nobody thought anything will happen to the Jews in Greece, because the Nazis were busy defending themselves and the walls of Berlin.</span> <span id="s298">They didn’t have any other appetites for killing anybody else.</span> <span id="s299">But we were very wrong in that matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q.</span> <span id="s301">Now at no time, then, in Athens was there a ghetto or were you required to wear a yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A. Oh, no, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s303">As a matter of fact, the Greek government, to a certain, degree, had instructed certain officials and the police department to give us identifications with Christian names and pictures and things like that, and there were a lot of Jewish people that they were floating around in Athens with false I.D.’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q. Where did you get your false I.D.’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A. Through the neighborhood precincts of the police department.</span> <span id="s306">Anybody, I think, over fifteen years old, he had to have an I.D. with his name, his residence, and his occupation.</span> <span id="s307">And also that I.D. required you to name your religion, Catholic, Jewish or Orthodox.</span> <span id="s308">And most of the false I.D.’s were claiming that the Jew that was bearing the identification was an Orthodox, and with a different name.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q.</span> <span id="s310">Did you buy these somewhere, or did you just go in the precinct and get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A.</span> <span id="s312">We had a lot of traitors in Greece that they turned in a lot of Jews, but also I have to admit that the survival of the Greek (Jewish) people that they are here today alive, or they were alive after the war, we owe it to the Greek government and to the Greek people.</span> <span id="s313">They were stand by with us.</span> <span id="s314">Some of them they even lost their lives to cover the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q.</span> <span id="s316">So then the government offices were issuing you false identity papers and they knew they were doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A.</span> <span id="s318">There were no government offices at that time.</span> <span id="s319">The government offices were running by the German people through the Greeks that were collaborating with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s320">The real patriots, that they happened to be one or two or three in each precinct, they were risking their own lives to provide a false I.D. for some Jewish family.</span> <span id="s321">We had great patriots and great humanitarians, that they like to see us survive, instead of going like lambs in the slaughterhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q. Can we go back to the hiding a minute?</span> <span id="s323">Do you remember how you hid?</span> <span id="s324">Were you just staying with these people or were you hiding in a barn or somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A.</span> <span id="s326">We were hiding in a small basement room in that lady’s house, which was a very beautiful house.</span> <span id="s327">The room that we were hiding in, it was like some storage room.</span> <span id="s328">And she has given to the neighbors the false information that we were distant relatives, and we were over there because our small village way up in the north part of Greece was all burning up from the Nazis, and we had no place to go, and through the better times when our village would be rebuilt again, we’ll go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">In the meantime, we were surviving, like I say, by taking a small piece of gold and sell it in the black market and try to do whatever we could out of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q.</span> <span id="s331">What made you decide to go and hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A. Well, we had no choice because the Nazis were starting to show great animosity, and at that time there was some kind of rumors, after 1943, that the Salonika Jews, they have suffered a great deal, they were expelled from their own city into the Nazi Germany—and they would do the same thing in Athens.</span> <span id="s333">There were some houses that the Nazis took over, the extremely rich Jewish, and they put them in custody when they failed to very much bother the middle class or the poor Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q. And you can’t attach any dates.</span> <span id="s335">You don’t remember exactly when you were there, and when you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A. Well, I can give you 1943 to about the end of ’43, and we come back from the hiding there in ’43 to ’44, and then go back in the hiding in ’44 until the end of the war, because I remember they took me there in March 25, 1944.</span> <span id="s337">So that’s as close as I can get as far as dates are concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q. That’s pretty good.</span> <span id="s339">Tell me about the deportation.</span> <span id="s340">The day that the men went to the synagogues on Saturday as usual to check in, to report, to be counted.</span> <span id="s341">Tell me about what happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A. Well, that’s a story that is a little bit tragic.</span> <span id="s343">That time I was helping my father by selling cigarettes from the black market to the Greeks, and one of the places that I could make a little bit of business as about a 14- or 15-year-old, was at the gathering of the Greek Jews over in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s344">I was going over there, selling some cigarettes.</span> <span id="s345">And that Saturday, they took all of them in, and when I finished selling the cigarettes I left, and I was coming home because they didn’t want the young people, they only wanted the big ones.</span> <span id="s346">We didn’t think nothing of it.</span> <span id="s347">Now the rest of what I heard is after I left—I heard that, I did not witness it—that a truck come in with some guards, and they placed two guards in the door of the synagogue, and they closed the doors and they tell them not to get alarmed because they were taking them over for some kind of an examination.</span> <span id="s348">But the young people and the other Greeks that were walking around there and they saw that thing happen, spread the word that the Jews were getting captured and even the word come over towards our house.</span> <span id="s349">They brought in some trucks and they put the Jews in, and they took ‘em outside Athens in a place called Chaidari.</span> <span id="s350">That place was a small concentration camp for the resistant partisans and anybody that was against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s351">The Nazis would capture them and put them over there, and even then, when they were taking them there, they think nothing will happen to them; they were just taking them for questioning.</span> <span id="s352">Many of the relatives of the men, they want to go with their husbands and their brothers.</span> <span id="s353">One of them was my mother’s brother’s wife, with her two kids.</span> <span id="s354">She wanted to go where her husband went, and the Nazis would have no objection to taking anybody in the trucks that they will admit that he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s355">The mother didn’t want her to go in there.</span> <span id="s356">Somewhere, somehow, her instinct told her, no matter how painful it was, that we had to survive.</span> <span id="s357">And we left the house, we give whatever we could to the neighbors, and we marching towards that lady’s house, and begun the second hiding.</span> <span id="s358">The mentality of the Greek woman is, “I’ll go wherever my husband go”.</span> <span id="s359">The woman in Greece, even now 45 years later, are, in a way, depending on the man for their livehood and their whole entire lives.</span> <span id="s360">So if they lose their male protector, some of them, they don’t even want to live.</span> <span id="s361">They did want to go wherever their husbands went, or their brothers.</span> <span id="s362">They wanted to share they own fortune with their beloved ones.</span> <span id="s363">That’s why they followed wherever the Nazis were taking the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q.</span> <span id="s365">So then your father was taken away, and then what happened?</span> <span id="s366">How did the six of you continue on?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A. Well, it’s very, very simple.</span> <span id="s368">After they took ‘em from the synagogue, the Nazis made a mission to go over in every Jewish house.</span> <span id="s369">They confiscated the records of the synagogue and they knew now where every Jewish house was located, and they went over there and confiscated whatever they could, and they wanted to take everybody into the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s370">The word had spread that they were doing that, so the Greeks and anybody else who could informed us, and we all went into hiding, up ‘til the liberation day.</span> <span id="s371">The great breadwinner was the mother, because she was the one who could divide up and manage the things, in order for us to survive.</span> <span id="s372">We conserved things that father had left us, and we had friends that they donated a little bit here and there.</span> <span id="s373">And I was shining shoes and I was doing wheeling and dealing, whatever I could, but I was not the main breadwinner.</span> <span id="s374">The main breadwinner was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q. Could you describe to me what a black market contact was like?</span> <span id="s376">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s377">Who did you meet?</span> <span id="s378">How much did things cost?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A.</span> <span id="s380">The black market was like this.</span> <span id="s381">The main thing that the black market was selling, it was food, and only food.</span> <span id="s382">That was the main source of survival.</span> <span id="s383">And in order to buy food, you had to have gold, or Great British sovereigns, which is worth 24-carat gold, the size of a quarter.</span> <span id="s384">So only with English sovereigns and melted gold—I mentioned before in the interview that my father was having the gold, and melted it, and we had some pots of gold—with gold we could buy some food and survive.</span> <span id="s385">And, like I said before, I was trying to wheel and deal at that time with the gold.</span> <span id="s386">I was the one that was selling the gold and getting the food, but I was not the only breadwinner.</span> <span id="s387">No, the mother was the one who made us what we are today.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q.</span> <span id="s389">But did you go out to the country to meet people and buy things, or were you in alleys or doorways?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A.</span> <span id="s391">You could not find food in Athens.</span> <span id="s392">You had to go way out in the small villages, which they were all the way from ten miles to fifty miles to a hundred miles out.</span> <span id="s393">The farther that you are going, the more that the Nazis will not go there, because they were a small farmer here, a small farmer there, that they had in their storage room corn or barley or beans, that they were willing to sell for some gold.</span> <span id="s394">They were afraid to come down in Athens, so wherever I was going, and he knew that I was sincere, then he would see two pounds of corn or two pounds of butter, or two pounds of beans.</span> <span id="s395">Through the gold you will survive somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q.</span> <span id="s397">How did you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A. Walk.</span> <span id="s399">There was no meanings of transportation.</span> <span id="s400">Walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q. Were any of your sisters old enough to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A.</span> <span id="s403">The kids were very young and I’m very thankful that they were very young.</span> <span id="s404">They still have the memories of this ordeal, the painful memories, but it’s fading away.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q.</span> <span id="s406">So then you and your sisters and your mother were never taken away by the Germans.</span> <span id="s407">Did you find out what happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A. Well, we find out the father and part of our other relations and others in Athens, they were trying to blow up the crematorium.</span> <span id="s409">That’s one story.</span> <span id="s410">Another story, for a long time, it was that he was liberated and was in Russia.</span> <span id="s411">Also we made some inquiries of the Red Cross, that will inform me officially, later, after the war, that he was dead.</span> <span id="s412">Also, some other sources would say that the time that they were selecting them right and left—the ones that they were on the right, they would work, and the ones on the left, they were going to the gas chambers—that somebody says he might have seen him selected onto the right, and he might have seen him selected over to the left.</span> <span id="s413">There were all kinds of rumors.</span> <span id="s414">Nothing is officially to be believed.</span> <span id="s415">Whatever has happened, it’s nobody can give an account absolutely 100% true.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q. Can you tell me what happened the day the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A.</span> <span id="s418">The day the war ended?</span> <span id="s419">Have you ever seen Times Square on the first of the year, at midnight?</span> <span id="s420">The day the war ended, every Greek in town he got in the streets of Athens, hollering, “Long live to the Allies!”</span> <span id="s421">“Long live to Greece!”</span> <span id="s422">The Nazi German flag came down from the rock of the Acropolis, and the Greek flag went up.</span> <span id="s423">Allies from New Zealand, England, America, France and all over, and also the Divine Platoon from the Greek army that was fighting in Egypt, and in El Alamein, and at Rimini, Italy, they all arrive in Greece, and also King Paul arrived with all his aides, and the whole entire Greece was full of flags from every nation that we never can dream that they were existing.</span> <span id="s424">The radios were playing the national anthem and patriotic songs.</span> <span id="s425">The kids were hugging and kissing, and everybody was in such a joy that it almost seemed like the hunger, the thirst, the lost of the beloveds, all of it faded away for a while, because the bright light of freedom had brightly shined in the streets of Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q. That’s quite a description.</span> <span id="s427">What happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A. Next, slowly but sure, organizations from all over, the United States mostly, and England and any of the prosperous countries, they wanted to help the people to come back on their own feet.</span> <span id="s429">The construction companies and UNRRA, and the American-run organizations through General Marshall, come over in Greece, and they start rebuilding the things that were town down because of the bombing and the catastrophic effects of the war.</span> <span id="s430">Food starts coming in.</span> <span id="s431">Clothes start coming in, and businesses start, slowly but sure, building up.</span> <span id="s432">We got our taxi out.</span> <span id="s433">We got our license.</span> <span id="s434">We come back in our own home.</span> <span id="s435">Our home was confiscated by a collaborator of the Nazis and we could not prove that he was a collaborator, and from four rooms we ended up having one, but still it was a home, though we were forced to be neighbors with the collaborator, and also another Jewish family.</span> <span id="s436">We all lived together in that big house.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q. Was Athens ever bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A. No, Athens was never bombed.</span> <span id="s439">The city of Piraeus was bombed very severely, which is approximately fifteen miles away from Athens, and is the main port of Greece, and I think it’s the third or forth largest port in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q. Now, you decided at some point to leave Greece, and come to the United States.</span> <span id="s441">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A.</span> <span id="s443">Why did we not come to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q.</span> <span id="s445">Why did you even think about leaving now that the war was over and things were gradually getting back to normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A. That’s another long story, why we didn’t go to Israel and we come to America, and why we left Greece.</span> <span id="s447">Right after the war, a gentleman by the name of Joseph I. Josephs, he was a Jewish Greek, from Germina, he was claiming that he knew part of the father’s family.</span> <span id="s448">He came over to visit Greece right after the war, and he praised America so much.</span> <span id="s449">He said that in America, the girls don’t have to have dowry to get married.</span> <span id="s450">And also he praised America as the greatest country in the world for a family to be built and live happily.</span> <span id="s451">The achsherah, that I mentioned before, it was in Greece, and it was a great propaganda for people to immigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s452">When they make us go and visit the achsherah, we found many young men and many young women waiting to go to Israel to fight, because they had the spirit to build up the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s453">But very unfortunately, when we got in there, nine out of ten girls that were in achsherah, they were all pregnant.</span> <span id="s454">And when mother asked when they had time to get married and get pregnant, one of the officials said, “Over there, they don’t have to be married.</span> <span id="s455">We need lives.”</span> <span id="s456">So mother said “I don’t want my daughters to be that way.</span> <span id="s457">I’m not going to Israel.”</span> <span id="s458">So time goes by, and it was through United Jewish Appeal, a possibility to come over in America.</span> <span id="s459">One of mother’s main concerns was the happiness of her children.</span> <span id="s460">Being the only boy, I couldn’t under any circumstances—no matter how smart, and how clever, or how good a merchant I can be—I couldn’t provide, even with the taxi that we had, a dowry to get qualified husbands for the sisters.</span> <span id="s461">So through the things that we hear about the United States, mother knew that the only place in the world that her kids can be happy was America.</span> <span id="s462">And that’s why we’re here.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q.</span> <span id="s464">When did you come and did you all come together?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A. No, I came in first, because that time I was almost twenty years old, and according to the Greek Army law, anybody who hits 21st birthday, he cannot emigrate because he has to serve in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q. For how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A.</span> <span id="s468">He has to serve in the army for four or five years.</span> <span id="s469">So I had to come first, before November 10, which was my birthday to make me 21 years old.</span> <span id="s470">So I arrived in New York on January 10, 1951, and the kids arrived on March 1951, and mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q. And all the transportation costs were paid by Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A. Part of the transportation costs, because we had a taxicab and mother into United Jewish Appeal, because United Jewish Appeal never wanted to furnish the complete transportation.</span> <span id="s473">They would furnish transportation into the people that they didn’t have any equity, but at that time, having a taxicab in Greece, it was very obvious equity.</span> <span id="s474">In return, the United Jewish Appeal has guarantee that when we come here, for five years until we become an American citizen, we will be under their protection.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q. Now, you didn’t have any relatives who were in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A. No.</span> <span id="s477">We didn’t have any relatives.</span> <span id="s478">I waited in New York for three months.</span> <span id="s479">When they come in, then we had a choice.</span> <span id="s480">We could stay on our own in New York, but New York is a big city.</span> <span id="s481">We could never become American citizens there.</span> <span id="s482">We could become citizens, but we could never have whatever we want to live like Americans.</span> <span id="s483">Coming to New York, we live like Greeks, like living in the old neighborhood in a different part of the world.</span> <span id="s484">Mother didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s485">Mother is the cause that we have what we got, and whatever we are now.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q.</span> <span id="s487">How did you happen to come to St. Paul, Minnesota?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A. Well, because it’s random.</span> <span id="s489">United Jewish Appeal had many branches.</span> <span id="s490">One of the branches of United Jewish Appeal was Jewish Family Service of Minnesota, that was taking under her protection certain people from Europe after the Holocaust, after the war.</span> <span id="s491">There were people from Poland, people from Germany, people from Greece, and it was by random that we had to be coming here.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q.</span> <span id="s493">What did they do for you after you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A.</span> <span id="s495">When we got here, they provided us house on Broadway, which was a good Jewish ghetto at that time, because there were a lot of Jews from all over the world in that neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q. That’s in St. Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A.</span> <span id="s498">We had the upstairs, about two rooms and a patio, whatever you call it, and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s499">At that time it looked like a palace to us.</span> <span id="s500">And it was a palace, you know.</span> <span id="s501">They provided us with plenty to eat, they provided us with plenty to sleep, and they help us send the kids into school, providing that I would contribute some from my work.</span> <span id="s502">So we made some kind of arrangement on that, and we went five years like that, until we become American citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q.</span> <span id="s504">How much education had you had in Greece?</span> <span id="s505">Did you go to school when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A.</span> <span id="s507">As far as I am concerned, right here I never went to school.</span> <span id="s508">I went only one day to the International Institute.</span> <span id="s509">I went one day, but I didn’t like it very much because, without being selfish, after being in high school in Greece, I thought I knew more than the teacher.</span> <span id="s510">I never went to school in America, but I’m very proud that the kids went to school, and that they did so well.</span> <span id="s511">I learned whatever I know on the sidewalks of America, which is great.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q. Tell me, you’re married, do you have children of your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A. No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q.</span> <span id="s515">So then your sisters have been your family, as it were.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A.</span> <span id="s517">The sisters have been more than a family to me.</span> <span id="s518">They’ve been the whole world.</span> <span id="s519">(crying) “The sidewalks of America.”</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q.</span> <span id="s521">How did you learn to speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A. Well, for a great part of my life I have been a taxi cab driver, and I learned it through the American public, and also I learned it through the family that I got here.</span> <span id="s523">I visit my sisters, and most of the time my nieces and nephews and my sisters speak English.</span> <span id="s524">So I learned through them.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s526">I should ask you if you’ve had any involvement with the Jewish community while you’ve been here.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A. Well, I been keeping the faith but I never have a great deal of socializing with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s528">I know very many of them, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q.</span> <span id="s530">But you’re not active in the synagogue, organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A. Technically I’m not very active with the Jewish community or anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q. Do you maintain contact, or did you, with other survivors or any survivor organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A. Not organizations, but private people.</span> <span id="s534">I do know several survivors of the Holocaust, including some people that I socialize with that they come directly from concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q. Are there any other Greek survivors in the Twin Cities?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A. Yes, they are.</span> <span id="s537">There is a family that I know called Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Asher.</span> <span id="s538">They live in Highland Park.</span> <span id="s539">They have a couple of kids.</span> <span id="s540">They’re quite old right now, but I do not associate the last few years with them.</span> <span id="s541">Also there is a Greek survivor here from the concentration camp that’s a Greek lady that married a German survivor, by name Ida Rosenbaum.</span> <span id="s542">She lives in Highland Park, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q.</span> <span id="s544">These are philosophical questions now.</span> <span id="s545">Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor?</span> <span id="s546">Have you thought about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A. Love of life, to be alive, and I just thank God that I am survivor, and I have enjoyed the beautiful life that Americans provide for me though his culture and my work.</span> <span id="s548">And it means a great deal that my mother’s dream come true.</span> <span id="s549">Because the only thing my mother ever wanted, is to see her kids married, especially the girls, and see grandchildren, and from her soul upstairs, I think she’s very pleased.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q.</span> <span id="s551">So all four of your sisters did get married without dowries in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A. Well, the “dowries” they give, it was as good wives, working and help their husbands be whatever they are now, and give good families and good homes and good kids for them.</span> <span id="s553">And I’m very proud of each one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q.</span> <span id="s555">You were apparently fortunate because the Greek non-Jews were very “helping” people for the Jews during this time.</span> <span id="s556">So I don’t know whether I should even ask you this question.</span> <span id="s557">Can you describe for me your general feelings about human nature?</span> <span id="s558">About non-Jews, and Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A. My general feelings about human nature?</span> <span id="s560">I am very proud that I’m Jewish; I’m very proud that I’m alive and here in America.</span> <span id="s561">But until the day I die, I will have one very big question in my mind: Why, all over the world, is a certain percentage of people anti-Semitic?</span> <span id="s562">I’ll pray to God that He give the good knowledge to people to be non-anti-Semitic, and to help Jewish people at the time of need, the same way that other people will help others.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q. Do you read books about the Holocaust or watch TV shows about it or go to the movies?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A. I’ve seen several movies, I have read the book about the Diary of Anne Frank, and saw other small stories here and there, but due to the fact that Holocaust stories, movies and memories like that will bring some kind of a painful memories into myself, lately, the last few years, I try to avoid them.</span> <span id="s565">I do not avoid them completely but I’m not crazy about it to go and see them either.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q.</span> <span id="s567">Did you feel that they were accurate, though?</span> <span id="s568">That they were giving a true picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A.</span> <span id="s570">The truth is that there’s no imagination, and the greatest author of the world can never describe the truth of this Holocaust.</span> <span id="s571">There is no pen sharp enough to write exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s572">And there is no mind big enough to believe the things that have took place between the rise and fall of the Third Reich.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q. Usually I ask one more question.</span> <span id="s574">Is there something that you want to say for this interview that I forgot to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A. Yes, I’d like to say one very good thing.</span> <span id="s576">Love live to America!</span></p> <p><span id="s577">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s578">PAGE 15</span></p></body></html>
