birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">A: My name is Martin Irvin Glickman.</span> <span id="s4">I’m usually referred to as Marty Glickman.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s6">At the age of 6 I moved to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s7">I was raised in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: And what year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: I was born in 1917.</span> <span id="s10">My parents came from Romania.</span> <span id="s11">They came over about 1912.</span> <span id="s12">I don’t remember exactly when.</span> <span id="s13">I wasn’t around when they got here.</span> <span id="s14">But I was born in 1917.</span> <span id="s15">Lived originally in the Bronx.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My father was not an extremely religious person.</span> <span id="s18">As a matter of fact uh he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s19">We observed the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s20">Occasionally on Shabbat we’d go to synagogue, only occasionally.</span> <span id="s21">My grandfather and grandmother on my mother’s side were, kept a kosher home uh with the two sets of dishes and the silverware and things like that.</span> <span id="s22">I was bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s23">I went to Hebrew school and uh I raised my own children in the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s24">And my two sons were bar mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s25">My two daughters were not bar mitzvahed, but we have a Jewish background, a Hebrew background.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Was that very important to you as a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: It wasn’t uh very important in terms of my uh, uh grand feeling about Judaism.</span> <span id="s28">I was like any other kid.</span> <span id="s29">I, I was brought up in Jewish neighborhoods, mixed neighborhoods actually.</span> <span id="s30">Uh we lived amongst Italians and Irish.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Why don’t you start that again because you’ve sort of conflicted yourself.</span> <span id="s32">What kind of neighborhood were you brought up in demographically?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: I was brought up in a, a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s34">I was brought up in a, a mixed Irish, Italian and Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s35">There certainly were as many Jewish boys around with whom I played as there were people of other faiths.</span> <span id="s36">And I didn’t feel unusual about being a Jew.</span> <span id="s37">Uh many of my friends went to Hebrew school with me and many of my classmates in school were Jews.</span> <span id="s38">Uh it was uh nothing out of the ordinary being Jewish in my neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Then you didn’t feel any anti-Semitism from the non-Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Occasionally we’d get into a fight.</span> <span id="s41">Uh I had an older cousin who was a big strong young man and he fought with an Italian boy one day because he was called a Jew Bastard.</span> <span id="s42">And uh he got into a fight, and uh I’m pleased to say that my cousin won the fight.</span> <span id="s43">But I never actually uh struck a blow because I was called a, a Jew Bastard or anything like that.</span> <span id="s44">Uh as I say I was amongst Jews most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So you really never felt in any way slighted because you were Jewish or you never saw that as something that you’d have to rally against?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I never felt as though I, I had to overcome the fact that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s47">I was aware however that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s48">And uh, uh the great athletes of the day uh, Venny Leonard was my father’s hero.</span> <span id="s49">Another great prize fighter named Leach Cross uh was a man that he admired greatly.</span> <span id="s50">And uh Hank Greenberg was one of my early heroes.</span> <span id="s51">So I was aware of Jewish athletes and Jewish competitors who did well.</span> <span id="s52">I wanted to do well also to show that a Jew could do just as well, perhaps better, than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Then there was that distinction.</span> <span id="s54">How important were sports and how did you get involved in sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I got involved in sports because I was always the fastest kid on the block.</span> <span id="s56">I could run faster than anybody else could run.</span> <span id="s57">And, and uh I found this true until I ran against Jesse Owens, He was the one fellow I couldn’t beat, never could beat him.</span> <span id="s58">But other than that I was, as I say, the fastest kid around.</span> <span id="s59">And because of that I had an advantage in any sport I played.</span> <span id="s60">So I played, punch ball, and box ball, and ring-a-leaveo, the games kids played in the Bronx and Brooklyn in those days.</span> <span id="s61">And when I started playing basketball or baseball or football, because I had the speed, I had an advantage and so I could be perhaps better than some of the other guys.</span> <span id="s62">I could almost steal first base in baseball.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So you started sports at a fairly early age?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: I started sports, I started my first running when I was uh five years of age I think.</span> <span id="s65">Uh we used to run around the block.</span> <span id="s66">And uh we’d start in opposite directions, I and my opponent would run off around the block and we’d come back to the same spot.</span> <span id="s67">And the first one returned to that spot was the winner.</span> <span id="s68">And uh the older guys in the neighborhood would match me against some of the older boys there because I could beat the fellows my age rather handily.</span> <span id="s69">And I almost never lost.</span> <span id="s70">I don’t remember losing a race until I ran against Jesse.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Now when did this running and sort of neighborhood sports become sports in a more organized fashion?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Sports for me became more organized when I went to Junior High School.</span> <span id="s73">Montauk Junior High School in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s74">And uh I played on four different teams.</span> <span id="s75">I was a catcher on the baseball team.</span> <span id="s76">I played on the basketball team.</span> <span id="s77">We won a city championship in, in basketball.</span> <span id="s78">Also won a city championship in baseball.</span> <span id="s79">Uh I ran on the track team and I was the field day champion.</span> <span id="s80">I was the fastest runner in the school.</span> <span id="s81">And of all things I swam on the swimming team.</span> <span id="s82">And in those days athletes played all sports in season.</span> <span id="s83">In the spring and summer you played baseball.</span> <span id="s84">In the fall you played football.</span> <span id="s85">In the winter time you played basketball.</span> <span id="s86">And all year round you ran.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t ever remember walking as if as a young person.</span> <span id="s88">I always ran.</span> <span id="s89">It was just my nature to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So sports were very important to you it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Sports were critical to me.</span> <span id="s92">Uh my life was built around sports.</span> <span id="s93">And I think it began when I started reading the Merrywell books.</span> <span id="s94">Now uh those of you who are my age may well remember the Merrywell books.</span> <span id="s95">They were written by Bert L. Standish and Frank Merrywell was the premier hero.</span> <span id="s96">He had a younger brother named Dick Merrywell who also was a great athlete.</span> <span id="s97">And Frank Merrywell married and had a son named Frank Merrywell, Jr., who also was a great athlete.</span> <span id="s98">And I wanted to be like Frank Merrywell junior or senior or Dick Merrywell.</span> <span id="s99">And uh the exploits of the book, I started reading them I guess when I was 12 years of age, and I wanted to duplicate those exploits.</span> <span id="s100">He ultimately went to Yale.</span> <span id="s101">Became an all – American football player, basketball player, a champion in all the sports he participated in and a, a well – rounded All – American type person.</span> <span id="s102">I wanted to be Frank Merrywell.</span> <span id="s103">I still remember his, his, his girlfriend’s name whom he married.</span> <span id="s104">Her name was Inez.</span> <span id="s105">I married a person named Margery, but I met her in high school.</span> <span id="s106">So it was uh, uh it was my, my goal to be like Frank Merrywell, this fictional character.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Then your goal was to be this quintessential All – American guy?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes that’s right.</span> <span id="s109">I wanted to be the uh as good as I possibly could be in sports and also be a good student, because Frank Merrywell was a good student.</span> <span id="s110">I, I wound up being, I would say, uh a B student.</span> <span id="s111">Uh I never had problems passing a, a courses in school.</span> <span id="s112">I was uh a fair student.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So there is actually one story I’m curious about.</span> <span id="s114">When you talk about how active you were in sports and how they really were your life at that point.</span> <span id="s115">Did you think that you had a future in sports, that you might be thinking in terms of Olympics or an athletic career?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: I never thought in terms of having a future in sports.</span> <span id="s117">I never aspired, for example, to be a, a sports announcer.</span> <span id="s118">That came through my uh the good day I had, the best day I ever had on a football field.</span> <span id="s119">But the only reference I recall as to having aspirations in sports was in my uh Junior High School graduating year when I was all of 14 years of age.</span> <span id="s120">My homeroom teacher, a man named Hugh Brown, who was an alumnus of Yale, wrote in my yearbook – be seeing you in the 1936 Olympics.</span> <span id="s121">And I thought that was very nice.</span> <span id="s122">I was a fast runner in school.</span> <span id="s123">But uh I was only 14.</span> <span id="s124">I didn’t think in terms of the Olympic games, but he predicted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: After you read that did you think ah ha maybe that is where I’m going or is that something I should aspire to?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I didn’t think in terms of the Olympic games until I was uh well into my uh freshman year at Syracuse University.</span> <span id="s127">Uh I was a, a school boy champion as a sprinter.</span> <span id="s128">I was the, the city champion, the state champion, the national sprint champion, but I didn’t think in terms of the in terms of the Olympic games because I, I was still a kid.</span> <span id="s129">I was 17.</span> <span id="s130">And uh only in my freshman year when I began to win against important competition did I realize I had a chance to make the team.</span> <span id="s131">And when I won the metropolitan championships in New York City and then the Eastern Olympic trials up at Harvard against a great sprinter named Ben Johnson.</span> <span id="s132">When I beat Ben he was uh, uh, he was uh the world’s record holder at 60 yards indoors, and when I beat him I realized then just a, a month before the Olympic games that I had a chance to make the Olympic team.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: I’m going to ask you to repeat one sentence.</span> <span id="s134">Not the whole thing.</span> <span id="s135">When you said something about not until I was in my freshman year.</span> <span id="s136">Can you say not until I was in my freshman year in college?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Not only my freshman year in college did I realize that I had a chance to make the Olympic team?</span> <span id="s138">I was uh a high school champion, New York City sprint champion for several years, and New York State champion.</span> <span id="s139">I was also the national interscholastic schoolboy champion.</span> <span id="s140">I and I knew I could run fast, but I didn’t know how fast I ran until I ran against uh some of the better sprinters in America and was able to beat them, particularly a fellow from Columbia named Ben Johnson, an outstanding sprinter.</span> <span id="s141">He was the world’s record holder at 60 yards indoors and when I beat Ben, beat him a couple of times, I realized I had a shot for the Olympic team and that was at the end of my freshman year at Syracuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Having all of a sudden this thought or goal, was there anything different about being a Jewish American athlete than just being another great athlete?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: In my high school years and my junior high school years, there was nothing different about being a Jewish high school athlete certainly not in New York City.</span> <span id="s144">I’d competed against everyone.</span> <span id="s145">And uh I felt no different than other athletes in school.</span> <span id="s146">It was only in my uh freshman year at Syracuse University that I became aware of the fact that I might have been a little bit different when at my first training table meal as a freshman, I asked uh at lunch, the very first meal, please pass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed at the table, because they weren’t lamb chops.</span> <span id="s147">They were pork chops.</span> <span id="s148">So I realized then I was a little bit different than most of the other guys on the football squad.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did it motivate you differently?</span> <span id="s150">Did you think about it differently when you competed?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I was always aware of the fact that I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s152">Uh never unaware of it under virtually all circumstances.</span> <span id="s153">And uh even in uh the high school competitions and certainly at college and uh for the Olympic team I wanted to show that uh a Jew could do just as well as any other individual no matter what his race, creed or color and perhaps even better.</span> <span id="s154">And uh it wasn’t until uh the, the circumstances developed in the Olympic games when I was refused the opportunity to run in the games uh because of the fact I’m Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: At this time you’re a little bit older, you’re a little bit smarter about what’s going on in the rest of the world, were you more aware of the restrictions applied to Jews.</span> <span id="s156">I mean in your, in your community growing up it was very mixed.</span> <span id="s157">It didn’t seem to be an issue.</span> <span id="s158">But were you aware that there was anti – Semitism in America, that you couldn’t go everywhere you wanted to and that sort of thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I was certainly aware of the fact that there was anti – Semitism.</span> <span id="s160">My grandfather and my father, my uncles, told me about the pogroms in Europe and Romania.</span> <span id="s161">They’d heard about the pogroms in Poland as well and in other parts of Europe and Russia and I was aware of uh anti – Semitism.</span> <span id="s162">In New York City I was also aware of the fact that there were certain places I was not welcome.</span> <span id="s163">I might go into a hotel for example and uh see a small sign where you registered uh which read restricted clientele, which meant in effect no Jews, no Blacks allowed.</span> <span id="s164">There were certain areas around New York City where you couldn’t live.</span> <span id="s165">Like Darian, Connecticut, for example was a place where Jews were not permitted to own homes in Darian.</span> <span id="s166">And uh I was aware of that.</span> <span id="s167">Uh my folks would tell me and my in – laws later on uh told me about reservations they made at a hotel and my father – in – law’s name was Dorman and uh neither Jewish or Gentile, and he would try to check into a hotel having made a reservation at some resort and being turned away when they found out he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s168">He might check in as Jack Dorman, which he was, but his friends and associates might have names like Goldberg or Cohen or Goldstein and the group was turned away uh upon occasion.</span> <span id="s169">So I was aware.</span> <span id="s170">I was aware of anti – Semitism.</span> <span id="s171">In New York and throughout the country as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How much in the early 30’s did you know about what was going on in Europe and Germany in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I knew practically nothing about what was going on in uh Germany uh specifically and in Europe generally, except that I’d heard about the pogroms in eastern Europe basically as I mentioned in Romania and Poland and Russia.</span> <span id="s174">Uh but I was not specifically aware until my freshman year at Syracuse when as a political science major I began to learn of the uh anti – Semitism that uh some of the Fascist countries were subjecting Jews to, particularly in Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s175">There was anti – Semitism in Germany.</span> <span id="s176">I knew that.</span> <span id="s177">And there was anti – Semitism in America.</span> <span id="s178">The uh Nuremberg laws as I understand it were passed in 1933.</span> <span id="s179">I was aware that there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: I think 35.</span> <span id="s181">There were restrictions from 33.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: …start over.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s185">I, I, I was aware of the Nuremberg laws which were passed in 1935.</span> <span id="s186">Um Hitler had come to power in 1933.</span> <span id="s187">As a political science major at Syracuse University, I was aware of those anti – Semitic laws, but these were merely on the books uh like the laws perhaps, not going to certain hotels, not going into certain areas, the unwritten laws, or the law about not crossing against a red light if you’re crossing the street.</span> <span id="s188">Uh they were not seriously spoken nor seriously taken in the States.</span> <span id="s189">We were aware of it.</span> <span id="s190">But how, how they affected individuals I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And you didn’t have any family in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: At that time uh the family I had in Europe uh were my father’s brothers who uh lived in Romania and were still there.</span> <span id="s193">But uh I didn’t know how they were affected by it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s195">It’s just interesting to know, you know, what you knew before going over to Germany.</span> <span id="s196">Tell me about qualifying for the Olympics.</span> <span id="s197">How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I qualified for the Olympic games by winning a series of races to qualify for the final trials which were held at Randall’s Island in New York City uh the first use of that Randall’s Island Stadium for track and field championships.</span> <span id="s199">I qualified by winning the metropolitan championships and then the eastern qualifying round up at Harvard Stadium in Boston.</span> <span id="s200">There were Eastern, Near – Midwestern, Western, and Far western trials and I was the winner of the sprint in the East so I qualified for the final round.</span> <span id="s201">It was a series of qualifying rounds and I and about, I would guess, 14 other sprinters qualified for the final round.</span> <span id="s202">And in that final round I qualified and made the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How did you place in those final rounds?</span> <span id="s204">What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Uh the placement in the final round, in the actual finals, I qualified by finishing second in my uh in that semi – final heat uh at Randall’s Island.</span> <span id="s206">And uh I’d like to tell the story of uh my first race against Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe.</span> <span id="s207">Uh these two were the two great black sprinters of the day.</span> <span id="s208">Uh we drew uh, uh marbles which we numbered for the lanes in which you ran.</span> <span id="s209">I drew lane number 5.</span> <span id="s210">Jesse Owns was in lane number 4.</span> <span id="s211">Ralph Metcalfe was in lane number 6.</span> <span id="s212">And I’m in number 5.</span> <span id="s213">So here is Owens, the world’s champion, alongside of me.</span> <span id="s214">Metcalfe, who’d run and won a silver in the 1932 Olympic games, on the other side.</span> <span id="s215">These two magnificent athletes on either side of me and I’m scared stiff.</span> <span id="s216">I mean I was shaking so that when the starter called us to our marks, to put our feet in the starting holes, we didn’t use starting blocks in those days, you dug holes with a trowel.</span> <span id="s217">When I started to put my front foot, my left foot, in the hole, my foot was shaking so I could not put my foot in that starting hole.</span> <span id="s218">It was just vibrating so I couldn’t put it down.</span> <span id="s219">And all six additional sprinters on either side of me were on, on their marks, getting ready to go, and I’m still standing there shaking.</span> <span id="s220">And the starter called everyone up and called me over to him.</span> <span id="s221">I knew the man.</span> <span id="s222">Uh he’d started me in some of the high school races I had run, and he said Marty walk up and down a bit, take a few deep breaths, relax, jog up and down, relax, and we’ll try to start again.</span> <span id="s223">And after several minutes uh I was calmed down sufficiently to get my foot into that starting hole.</span> <span id="s224">Both feet in and we raced.</span> <span id="s225">Uh I don’t remember the gun going off.</span> <span id="s226">We were set terribly tense of course on our marks, and then set, and then I was running.</span> <span id="s227">And there was Owens on my left and Metcalfe on my right and for forty yards I’m running even with them.</span> <span id="s228">And then suddenly as though they were on an escalator and I was not they were pulling ahead and moving ahead.</span> <span id="s229">And I fought as best I could and I kept dropping back.</span> <span id="s230">And uh then I realized I wasn’t going to catch either one of them and I thought I finished third in the race.</span> <span id="s231">Uh so much so that uh Ted Using who was broadcasting the race on the infield of the track, he was the leading track and field broadcaster of the time.</span> <span id="s232">Uh Ted called me over after the race and said here’s Marty Glickman, the kid from Brooklyn who finished third.</span> <span id="s233">Oh wait a second he said.</span> <span id="s234">I see they’ve placed Frank Wycoff third.</span> <span id="s235">Marty finished fourth.</span> <span id="s236">And he interviews Frank and then he says now here’s Mar, oh just a moment he says, uh they’ve placed Floyd Draper in the fourth place, Marty finished fifth.</span> <span id="s237">So he interviewed Floyd Draper and then he, he interviewed me finishing fifth.</span> <span id="s238">Which is where I was placed.</span> <span id="s239">I was a bit upset about that.</span> <span id="s240">Uh films from the race indicate that uh I beat Floyd Draper by a foot uh.</span> <span id="s241">Very little question about that.</span> <span id="s242">As for Frank and myself, you could, you could choose the winner between the two of us, but uh, uh I didn’t know whether I beat Frank or not.</span> <span id="s243">Nor did he.</span> <span id="s244">Uh later in Paris in a post – Olympic meet I beat Frank but uh, uh we were virtually in a dead heat for third place.</span> <span id="s245">So I, I so remember Dean Cromwell finishing uh, uh it’s too long already.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s247">I guess I’m asking was there something that happened there, that was a precursor of anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well Dean Cromwell, Dean Cromwell leads to another story which has to do with the selection uh my ouster from the team.</span> <span id="s249">So uh if you can fit this in.</span> <span id="s250">As we finished the race, I noted that Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach of the American Olympic team and the head track coach of the University of Southern California, was in amongst the officials, arguing with them that Frank Wycoff had finished third and Floyd Draper had finished fourth.</span> <span id="s251">Because he was the coach of Southern Cal and Wycoff and Draper ran for Southern Cal or had run.</span> <span id="s252">Wycoff was graduated.</span> <span id="s253">Had run for Southern Cal.</span> <span id="s254">These were his boys and he pushed them amongst the officials uh as finishing third and fourth.</span> <span id="s255">And I was placed fifth.</span> <span id="s256">I don’t know whether I finished third, fourth, or fifth.</span> <span id="s257">I just don’t know.</span> <span id="s258">But I do know that Dean Cromwell had a hand in the placement of the order of finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And you think it was clearly favoritism, not the fact that you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: I think it was clearly favoritism that uh he wanted his boys placed third and fourth.</span> <span id="s261">Uh the fact that I was Jewish I think did not matter at that time.</span> <span id="s262">He wanted his boys in there.</span> <span id="s263">And uh I had made the team anyhow because the first seven men were to make the team.</span> <span id="s264">The first three finishers running the 100 meter run, and the next four finishers making up the 400 meter relay.</span> <span id="s265">So I had made the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Any other Jews on the team?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: The other Jew on the track team, one other Jew was Sam Stoller.</span> <span id="s268">Stoller was placed sixth in the 100 meter final.</span> <span id="s269">He finished behind me.</span> <span id="s270">He ran a poor race.</span> <span id="s271">Later Sam beat me in the Olympic Village in a trial race we had amongst the three of us.</span> <span id="s272">Sam Stoller finishing first.</span> <span id="s273">I was beaten by a shoulder by Sam, and we both beat Floyd Draper.</span> <span id="s274">Floyd Draper wound up running on the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: We’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s276">Now after you qualified for the Olympic team, what sort of preparation was there between those qualifying rounds at Randall’s Island and going to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: We qualified for the Olympic team uh on a uh Friday and we were on board the ship I believe on Tuesday, heading for uh Berlin.</span> <span id="s278">It was almost immediate.</span> <span id="s279">Uh we were measured for our uniforms.</span> <span id="s280">Uh there were several events we attended, uh several ceremonies we attended and we were aboard ship uh within three days after making the team.</span> <span id="s281">It was very quick.</span> <span id="s282">There was no training period or anything like that.</span> <span id="s283">We stayed in shape, of course.</span> <span id="s284">We kept working out every day to make sure we were in good condition.</span> <span id="s285">And we took the S.S. Manhattan for Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Now this sounds pretty exciting.</span> <span id="s287">I don’t know how much you had traveled before then, but winning these rounds and then a few days later being on a boat going to Europe sounds like a big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: This was quite an experience for me.</span> <span id="s289">I had been no farther than Boston.</span> <span id="s290">I’d been no further south than Philadelphia until that time.</span> <span id="s291">I was uh this 18 year old kid from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s292">I was the second youngest kid on the team, on the track team.</span> <span id="s293">And here I was aboard this magnificent liner heading for Europe and uh it was a most exciting time.</span> <span id="s294">Uh it was wonderful, it was thrilling, it was, it was great.</span> <span id="s295">It was fulfilling my Frank Merrywell dream partially.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What was it like on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: The boat was uh informal.</span> <span id="s298">It was fun.</span> <span id="s299">Uh we, we trained aboard the ship.</span> <span id="s300">It was a, a five day crossing and a sixth day getting uh to Hamburg and then down to Berlin by train.</span> <span id="s301">Uh but we had no opportunity to really sprint aboard ship.</span> <span id="s302">So we did calisthenics, we jogged up and down, we did a great deal of walking aboard ship.</span> <span id="s303">We uh watched our diet fairly carefully.</span> <span id="s304">Uh there was no specific training regimen because we were all pretty good athletes, had our own different coaches and coaching techniques applied to us for months and years beforehand.</span> <span id="s305">So we were not concerned with uh being uh directed by the coaches who were on the team.</span> <span id="s306">It was a fun time.</span> <span id="s307">It was, it was a time that was loose and easy and pleasant and, and we looked forward with great anticipation to getting to Europe and getting in competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">(end of Tape 1 of 4) Tape 2 of 4</span></p> <p><span id="s309">(five seconds)</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: I want to backtrack for a moment.</span> <span id="s311">Prior to your going to Berlin, do you remember any conversation, any newspaper articles, any talk of America boycotting the Olympics because of what was going on already in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: At the time we were competing in the uh regional finals and then the finals at Randall’s Island uh the talk was so slight that I truly was not aware of the possibility of a boycott of the 1936 games.</span> <span id="s313">It had very little play in the press if any.</span> <span id="s314">I don’t remember seeing it in the newspapers or hearing it on the radio.</span> <span id="s315">As a matter of actual fact, no Jewish organization like B’nai Brith or uh ADL or uh the American Jewish Congress if there was an AJC then.</span> <span id="s316">Uh no Jewish organization nor any individual ever said to me, Marty don’t go.</span> <span id="s317">There was no talk, general talk, of boycott.</span> <span id="s318">I know now that there was a vote taken involving the AAU, the Amateur Athletic Union, and the American Olympic Committee and that uh they voted to go.</span> <span id="s319">Uh but there was no such publicity or promotion such as existed in 1980 when the President of our United States, Jimmy Carter, uh strongly recommended that we don’t participate in the 1980 games.</span> <span id="s320">There was no such popular movement at the time of 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: And you weren’t aware that there were athletes who had decided not to go on their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I was not aware of any athletes who decided not to go.</span> <span id="s323">I know now that athletes uh say they decided not to go.</span> <span id="s324">There was a fine sprinter whom I never met, never ran against, fellow named Herman Newgas, of Tulane, who determined that he was nor going to try out for the team.</span> <span id="s325">Uh he didn’t go, he didn’t try out for the team.</span> <span id="s326">But I knew that later, in later years.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: So this was just not an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: The fact of going or not going was not an issue.</span> <span id="s329">Not as far as I was concerned nor in terms of the public press or the populace generally.</span> <span id="s330">Uh we didn’t think in terms of not going.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Tell me about the trip over, the anticipation, what it was like being on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Being on the boat was fun.</span> <span id="s333">Being on the boat was a brand new experience particularly for a kid from Brooklyn or any of us who’d never been abroad .</span> <span id="s334">Uh I’d been no farther north than uh, uh than Boston.</span> <span id="s335">I’d been no farther south than Philadelphia, and here I was uh an eighteen year old kid from Brooklyn uh heading for Europe.</span> <span id="s336">Uh had been, a name, a place my parents came from, going to Germany, and uh visiting other countries as well.</span> <span id="s337">Our first stop for example was uh in Ireland with the ship.</span> <span id="s338">Just stopping there and seeing it in the distance and how beautifully green it was.</span> <span id="s339">We stopped in England momentarily at Plymouth and I could, uh I couldn’t see the Plymouth Rock or anything like that and uh, uh but it was Plymouth England and then we went across to uh, uh Germany to uh, uh landed in Hamburg and from Hamburg took the train down into the uh heart of Berlin to the huge Bahnhof in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What was going on on that boat?</span> <span id="s341">What was the mood?</span> <span id="s342">People were I assume fairly excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: All of us were pleased at having made the team.</span> <span id="s344">And uh the boat was wide open.</span> <span id="s345">In those days a huge ship uh like the Manhattan uh had different classes, first class, second class, uh cabin class or whatever, steerage even.</span> <span id="s346">Uh but we had the run of the boat.</span> <span id="s347">And uh, uh those we ate in what amounted to uh the uh second class dining room, we were not in the top categories of dining room, we had huge menus to choose from.</span> <span id="s348">We were not given training table food.</span> <span id="s349">We selected our own foods.</span> <span id="s350">There was a fellow on the team named Tarzan Brown.</span> <span id="s351">Uh an Indian, Narragansett Indian from Maine who’d never seen a menu like this before.</span> <span id="s352">And Tarzan was a marathon runner.</span> <span id="s353">He weighed perhaps a hundred and thirty pounds.</span> <span id="s354">Uh, uh a great marathon runner.</span> <span id="s355">He’d won the Boston marathon.</span> <span id="s356">On the team and we had uh this huge menu.</span> <span id="s357">And every meal, every day, he ate the menu from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s358">I mean six appetizers, and two or three soups, and four main courses.</span> <span id="s359">In those six days on the ship uh he might have put on between 10 and 11 pounds.</span> <span id="s360">He ran the first mile of the marathon and uh then he sat by the wayside and uh gave it all up.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: How were you spending your time on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: We spent our time on the boat talking, uh working out, uh calisthenics mostly.</span> <span id="s363">Jogging up and down on some of the very short, straight aways on deck.</span> <span id="s364">Uh there was no facility to really work out the way we would have ordinarily on a, a cinder track or a clay track, certainly no quarter – mile track aboard ship.</span> <span id="s365">Uh but we, we stretched, uh we jogged, we walked, we did exercises and uh we talked and we read and uh, uh generally it was a group of guys having a good time together.</span> <span id="s366">There were women on the team as well, but uh, I guess I was not involved nor interested in any of the women.</span> <span id="s367">I had a girlfriend who later became my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Was there any special camaraderie amongst the few Jewish athletes on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: There was no special camaraderie amongst the Jewish athletes except a, a warm friendship that I developed with a, a baseball player, Herman Goldberg, who was a catcher on the exhibition baseball team.</span> <span id="s370">There was no international baseball competition.</span> <span id="s371">America was practically the only place where baseball was played in those days.</span> <span id="s372">So it was a demonstration.</span> <span id="s373">An exhibition team and he was on the team and on the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s374">Herman was, a catcher on the team.</span> <span id="s375">We hit it off very nicely.</span> <span id="s376">But usually uh with the athletes from the different sports, the track athletes stayed together, uh the gymnasts were together, the swimmers were together.</span> <span id="s377">Not that we didn’t fraternize with each other but we had much more in common with Olympic team.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Now when you say you talked a lot, what did you talk about?</span> <span id="s379">What it was going to be like in Berlin competing or?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: We didn’t talk about uh about what Europe was going to be like.</span> <span id="s381">We talked uh about mostly about America.</span> <span id="s382">We talked about uh, uh baseball and football and particularly about track and field.</span> <span id="s383">Uh we told stories, we swapped yarns.</span> <span id="s384">We were, how can I say it best, we were a bunch of guys who enjoyed each other.</span> <span id="s385">We had enormous respect for each other.</span> <span id="s386">And I as one of the younger fellows on the team, looked up to some of the older men who were not only older but bigger and stronger uh that one.</span> <span id="s387">And uh it was just a very pleasant time, a group of young men being with each other enjoying uh the sea voyage, enjoying each other’s company.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Did you think about the fact that you were representing the United States in the Olympics?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: It’s rather unusual uh for me or any athlete to say that uh we represented America.</span> <span id="s390">I didn’t feel as though I represented the USA.</span> <span id="s391">Uh I represented me.</span> <span id="s392">I was a, I was glad I was on the team.</span> <span id="s393">It was a goal I had sought.</span> <span id="s394">It was uh an achievement for me.</span> <span id="s395">It was an individual thing.</span> <span id="s396">After all the Olympic games in theory and I strongly believe this, the Olympic games are for the individual, for the excellence of the individual and theoretically though we wear national uniforms we don’t represent the different countries who’s uniforms we wear.</span> <span id="s397">We represent athletes.</span> <span id="s398">We represent sports.</span> <span id="s399">We compete in sports for sports’ sake.</span> <span id="s400">The competition is all important.</span> <span id="s401">Winning is not important.</span> <span id="s402">Baron de Coubertin who founded the modern Olympic games insisted, has been quoted many times as saying, winning is not the goal of the Olympic games, taking part, participating is what the Olympic games are all about.</span> <span id="s403">So it wasn’t as though we were going there to win for the United States.</span> <span id="s404">That was the thought that was perhaps in the back of our minds.</span> <span id="s405">It was not a conscious thought.</span> <span id="s406">We were going as athletes, not necessarily as Americans.</span> <span id="s407">I was going there as a Jewish American athlete, but as an athlete basically.</span> <span id="s408">A Jew, an American, and an athlete.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: What’s the reality of what you’re saying that there is that there are no, are you saying theoretically there are no national lines, there are no politics in the Olympics?</span> <span id="s410">I mean that certainly isn’t my perception.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: People say that there are politics in the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s412">I say hogwash.</span> <span id="s413">I say nonsense.</span> <span id="s414">Where does politics fit in when you run 100 meters?</span> <span id="s415">Or 1500 meters?</span> <span id="s416">Or put the shot?</span> <span id="s417">Or even play basketball against each other?</span> <span id="s418">What politics are involved?</span> <span id="s419">The first man across the finish line wins.</span> <span id="s420">No matter what the race.</span> <span id="s421">The man who puts the shot a longer distance than any other is the gold medal winner, or spins the discus, or throws the javelin or whatever the event.</span> <span id="s422">There are no politics amongst the athletes.</span> <span id="s423">You talk about politics amongst the nations.</span> <span id="s424">Certainly.</span> <span id="s425">But not as far as the Olympic games are concerned.</span> <span id="s426">They don’t exist.</span> <span id="s427">Politics are not involved in terms of winning and losing.</span> <span id="s428">That’s a good kasook right?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Well I just clearly nations have used those gold medals in a political framework.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I don’t believe that at all.</span> <span id="s431">I don’t believe that the uh, having uh, medal winners for a particular country in terms of anything important, anything solid.</span> <span id="s432">After all, the East Germans were terrific as long as East Germany existed and they uh sought and worked hard to get, to develop great Olympic athletes.</span> <span id="s433">And the Soviet Union won many, many medals, dominated a couple of Olympic games, and, and certainly the uh, the uh the Italians to some extent won many Olympic events as well as other Fascist countries doing well and centered their interest in the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s434">And where is the Soviet Union today?</span> <span id="s435">Where are the East Germans today?</span> <span id="s436">Where is Nazi Germany today?</span> <span id="s437">They just don’t exist any more and Nazi Germany won more medals in the ’36 games than the United States did.</span> <span id="s438">33 to 26.</span> <span id="s439">Although they won medals for dressage and for pistol shooting and rifle shooting and things like that.</span> <span id="s440">Uh I don’t see the importance of international athletics in terms of politics at all.</span> <span id="s441">They say that the governments use it, but even the successful Olympic teams like Germany and East Germany and the Soviet Union, where are they?</span> <span id="s442">What good did it do them?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: I don’t necessarily need to belabor this, but except for that in 1936 Germany’s successes not only in presenting the Olympics but in also winning a lot of medals, may have been an encouragement, may have spurred them on in ways at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Many people say that uh the ’36 Olympic games were the Nazi Olympics or Hitler’s Olympic games.</span> <span id="s445">I saw that they were Jesse Owens Olympic games.</span> <span id="s446">The myth of Nazi Aryan supremacy was smashed to smithereens by the great non – Aryan athletes.</span> <span id="s447">Black athletes, wonderful black athletes, won the 100, the 200, the 400, the 800, the long jump, uh the high jump, medaled in many other events as well.</span> <span id="s448">It was the Olympic games of Jesse Owens not of Adolph Hitler.</span> <span id="s449">Jesse was idolized by the German population.</span> <span id="s450">He couldn’t walk into the stadium using the regular player’s entrance into the stadium.</span> <span id="s451">He had to be secreted into the stadium.</span> <span id="s452">He had to use a secret entrance to get in.</span> <span id="s453">Otherwise he’d been mobbed by the uh idolizing uh German population or whoever the spectators were and they were mostly Germans in the 120,000 seat stadium.</span> <span id="s454">It was Jesse Owens Olympics as far as I was concerned, and I think as far as the world was concerned.</span> <span id="s455">And it certainly proved that uh this Aryan business of supremacy was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s456">There were non – Aryans winning the most important events.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Let’s go back to your story now.</span> <span id="s458">So you had this terrific boat ride over and tell me about your arrival and getting to Berlin and all of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: We arrived at the Bahnof in Berlin at midday in a huge crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Let me just stop.</span> <span id="s461">You arrived on the boat in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s462">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Was there anybody there to greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: We went right to the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: There was a huge crowd waiting for us at the Bahnhof in Berlin, this huge railroad station, uh newspapermen, camera people with the newsreels, uh photographers, fans, officials of all sorts, uniforms of all sorts.</span> <span id="s470">Huge crowd waiting on the platform when we arrived.</span> <span id="s471">And as we uh got off the train and milled about on the platform I felt a tap on my shoulder.</span> <span id="s472">And I turned and saw a smallish looking young man in his mid – twenties obviously an American as soon as he talked to me, and he said to me are you Marty Glickman.</span> <span id="s473">I said yes.</span> <span id="s474">He said you’re Jewish aren’t you.</span> <span id="s475">I said yes I am.</span> <span id="s476">Slightly taken aback.</span> <span id="s477">I said uh why do you ask.</span> <span id="s478">He said well I’m Jewish also.</span> <span id="s479">I said you’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s480">What are you doing here.</span> <span id="s481">He said I’m going to med school here in Germany.</span> <span id="s482">I said you’re going to med school here in Germany.</span> <span id="s483">He said yes.</span> <span id="s484">I couldn’t get into an American med school.</span> <span id="s485">So the feeling I had of Berlin being very much like New York in it’s anti – Semitism or it’s lack of anti – Semitism uh was similar to New York and Berlin.</span> <span id="s486">It was the same sort of city, I thought, particularly as a result of this conversation with this young man going to med school.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What did he tell you about the political climate in Germany as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: I asked him what it was like for you as a Jew here in Germany.</span> <span id="s489">He says well in Berlin I go practically unnoticed.</span> <span id="s490">Nobody knows that I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s491">Uh I’m going to med school here.</span> <span id="s492">Uh in the shtetels, in the smaller cities around uh Germany uh there are problems.</span> <span id="s493">But now during the Olympic games and leading up to the Olympic games everything is, is, is quite.</span> <span id="s494">Uh nothing seems to be going on in terms of anti – Semitism.</span> <span id="s495">And as far as my being here in Berlin, I’m just like anybody else here in Berlin.</span> <span id="s496">I’m going to med school.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: All of these people who greeted you at the train station in Berlin, were they carrying swastikas, was there any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: There was a huge number of uniformed individuals.</span> <span id="s499">I noticed and we commented about it, my teammates and I, about the fact that uh there seemed to be no men under the age of approximately 35, no young men who were not in one uniform or another.</span> <span id="s500">They were wearing either gray, green or brown.</span> <span id="s501">In one uniform or another.</span> <span id="s502">No young men in street clothes, in civilian attire, except those who were older than 35 or obviously older than uh the age that we athletes were.</span> <span id="s503">Everyone seemed to be in uniform.</span> <span id="s504">As for banners and flags, they were all over the place, dominated by the swastika.</span> <span id="s505">The swastika was all over.</span> <span id="s506">On virtually every other banner we saw there was a swastika.</span> <span id="s507">But this was ’36.</span> <span id="s508">This was before we really got to know what the swastika truly meant.</span> <span id="s509">This was two years before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s510">This was three years before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s511">It was five years before the United States was involved in the war.</span> <span id="s512">So the swastika and those uh German flags, the black and red and white of the German flags, did, didn’t mean very much to us except as a form of decoration.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And it wasn’t sort of an unnerving amount of patriotism?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: I’d never been asked about the patriotism exhibited by the Germans at that time.</span> <span id="s515">Uh it was a, a, a natural thing to see uh all these German flags.</span> <span id="s516">Uh but flags of other nations were exhibited as well.</span> <span id="s517">Uh they rimmed the stadium.</span> <span id="s518">They were on the streets.</span> <span id="s519">There were many flags.</span> <span id="s520">Mostly German.</span> <span id="s521">Most of those German flags were contained the swastika.</span> <span id="s522">Uh there was seemed to be no outward display of patriotism except when Hitler walked into the stadium.</span> <span id="s523">He would walk into his box overlooking the field and I was perhaps 50 to 75 feet away from Hitler’s box.</span> <span id="s524">And he’d walk in and the stands would rise and you’d hear it in unison.</span> <span id="s525">Seig Heil.</span> <span id="s526">Seig Heil.</span> <span id="s527">All together, this huge sound reverberating through the stadium.</span> <span id="s528">That was the patriotism, the German patriotism I saw.</span> <span id="s529">Seig Heil, with a hundred and twenty thousand people shouting it, or most of the hundred and twenty thousand people.</span> <span id="s530">But that same shout of Seig Heil was matched by the sound of Jesse Owens name.</span> <span id="s531">Every time Owens came on the track and he was on frequently because he ran in four different races, and qualifying times and qualifying races for all those races.</span> <span id="s532">Every time Jesse appeared on the track the crowd would yell, Oo vens, Oo vens, the w in German is pronounced as a v. And they would shout with the same amount of fervor it seemed for Jesse as they sounded for Seig Heil.</span> <span id="s533">Oo vens.</span> <span id="s534">Oo vens.</span> <span id="s535">It was a remarkable thing to see this marvelous black athlete saluted by a hundred and twenty thousand Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: That’s a great story.</span> <span id="s537">Now when Owens wasn’t coming out on the field was there anything alarming about this Seig Heil in unison, a hundred and twenty thousand, or I don’t know how many people were actually shouting it, but what seemed like the entire stadium?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Uh, I never felt as though there was anything alarming in terms of uh the Seig Heil, a feeling of fear or anything like that.</span> <span id="s539">It was almost as though uh we in, in the States were singing the National Anthem or uh, uh stating uh the pledge of allegiance to our flag.</span> <span id="s540">Uh it was uh it was fairly brief.</span> <span id="s541">Hitler would walk in with an entourage of uh Goering and Goebbels and Hess and Himmler and Stryker and take their seats in this box with Hitler in the middle, slightly forward of the rest of the group, and Goering with his uh resplendent, outlandish uniforms uh wildly decorative and Goebbels the rat like face and the rest uh Hess with a very dark beard that he had.</span> <span id="s542">Uh they, they sat there.</span> <span id="s543">Uh and uh Hitler particularly was extremely nervous when German athletes ran.</span> <span id="s544">He’d sit in his seat and rub his thighs and, and, and move back and forth as I’m doing now, and uh he was obviously very much involved in the race.</span> <span id="s545">And he was, I thought he was nervous for his own athletes.</span> <span id="s546">When other athletes competed, he just sat there uh quietly and observed.</span> <span id="s547">Uh he was thrilled, overjoyed, smiled when uh German athletes went to the winning podium.</span> <span id="s548">When the black athletes went to the winning podium, Hitler was gone.</span> <span id="s549">As soon as the black athlete won his gold medal and was going to the podium to receive it, the box would empty out, Hitler’s box would empty out.</span> <span id="s550">They’d all be gone and they would not pay homage to the great black athletes who were there.</span> <span id="s551">They stayed for the white athletes.</span> <span id="s552">But they left for the black athletes.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">(adjustments to Marty’s appearance)</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: I want to know a little bit about what it was like being in Germany, the Olympic village, what that was like?</span> <span id="s555">Did you take little side trips into town or into other areas as a tourist?</span> <span id="s556">If you can tell me a little bit about the mood before the Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: The event I was supposed to run, the 400 meter relay, was uh one of the last events in the track and field program.</span> <span id="s558">It came, the trials came on the penultimate day and the final day of the games for track and field was the final of the 400 meter run.</span> <span id="s559">So uh I had plenty of time and so did the other athletes, except fellows like uh Jesse Owens and uh one or two others who competed in several events, uh I had plenty of time to uh go into Berlin during the morning hours usually or late in the afternoon after the afternoon events took place and I uh had my freedom throughout Berlin.</span> <span id="s560">I could hitch a ride if I chose to, get aboard a, a bus or a trolley, or whatever, because I was wearing a, an Olympic uniform and I had Olympic identification of all sorts on me, and uh it, it was, it was beautiful, it was lovely.</span> <span id="s561">Uh I walked along uh Unter der Linden uh I thought that Unter der Linden, later I went to Paris and walked along the Champs Elysee.</span> <span id="s562">I believed then that uh the Camps Elysee was not as attractive as Unter der Linden in Berlin but that was my own personal feeling about it.</span> <span id="s563">Uh the Olympic village was a, a beautiful campus of bungalows and low lying houses which uh housed the uh various teams of the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s564">Uh and it was like a college campus.</span> <span id="s565">Uh slightly rolling hills, low hills and uh dotted with uh these bungalows and different buildings there.</span> <span id="s566">There was a practice track, there was a swimming area, uh an indoor natautorium, and uh we worked out at the practice track.</span> <span id="s567">The single most important thing I got from the games was the fact that the other athletes of the world were just like me.</span> <span id="s568">And I was just like they.</span> <span id="s569">Uh I worked out with Hungarian athletes and uh, uh Romanian athletes and British athletes, French, Japanese athletes.</span> <span id="s570">We had many things in common.</span> <span id="s571">The things involving our sports uh and uh I’d jog alongside of the different athletes.</span> <span id="s572">I walked alongside of them of the dining room and rooms but we were with each other and we enjoyed each other’s presence even though we couldn’t communicate very well with most of the teams of the world because I didn’t speak their language and they didn’t speak mine.</span> <span id="s573">Talked to the English, of course, and talked to those who spoke English.</span> <span id="s574">Uh there was one Finn, a great Finnish athlete named Gunnar Harkert.</span> <span id="s575">Uh Gunnar was uh the 5,000 meter champion.</span> <span id="s576">A young man in his early twenties who was a beautiful blond, blue – eyed, apple cheeked young man, and a great, great runner.</span> <span id="s577">He won the gold medal.</span> <span id="s578">And he spoke good English.</span> <span id="s579">And we spent a great deal of time with Gunnar because he liked being with the American athletes.</span> <span id="s580">He liked speaking English and we liked Gunnar.</span> <span id="s581">And to my shock and horror, he was killed in the Russian – Finnish war just a few years after the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s582">But knowing him and knowing the other athletes, even just being with them for this limited amount of time, made me feel like one of them.</span> <span id="s583">And I think they felt like one of us.</span> <span id="s584">It was a wonderful education for all of us and me particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you mingle with German athletes?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: The German athletes usually stayed to themselves.</span> <span id="s587">The German athletes worked out together.</span> <span id="s588">Worked out by themselves.</span> <span id="s589">Uh they weren’t as free, as loose, as easy as athletes from other countries of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">(end Tape 2 of 4) (Tape 3 of 4)</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: You were saying that you had time before your event or your supposed event in the Olympics and you were able to go into Berlin and all that.</span> <span id="s592">In this did you feel anything about the atmosphere?</span> <span id="s593">Was it charged?</span> <span id="s594">Did you see signs saying No Jews Here?</span> <span id="s595">Did you experience any of what was to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: In my time in Germany I felt and saw nothing overt.</span> <span id="s597">I saw no signs.</span> <span id="s598">I heard no verbiage of any sort.</span> <span id="s599">I speak a little German because of the Yiddish that I know and I took some German at school.</span> <span id="s600">Uh and I heard nothing and I saw nothing which was anti – Semitic in any way, except for the day that I was supposed to run the trial heats of the 400 meter relay.</span> <span id="s601">And uh, uh that was the first anti and only anti – Semitism that I experienced.</span> <span id="s602">And I experienced it from American coaches and not from Germans.</span> <span id="s603">There was no overt sign of any anti – Semitic feeling or activity at all that I saw in Berlin or wherever I went in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Now Herman Goldberg your pal at the Olympics mentioned a trip into Berlin where I guess you hitched a ride with some German soldiers.</span> <span id="s605">What happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: One of the ways of getting from the Olympic village to the Olympic stadium which was about eight miles distant from the Olympic village was to hitch a ride.</span> <span id="s607">And uh Herman Goldberg, my buddy and I, hitched a ride in what amounts to a German Army jeep.</span> <span id="s608">And it was driven by a German sergeant who looked like a Nazi sergeant and he sat alongside of his passenger who was a, a very handsome Lieutenant in the German army, blond, blue – eyed, most attractive looking man.</span> <span id="s609">And as we got into the jeep, hitching the ride, they asked for our autographs.</span> <span id="s610">And we said we’ll give it to you when we get off the jeep.</span> <span id="s611">Which we did.</span> <span id="s612">Uh we took these uh eight miles at a what we thought was a reckless speed to begin with.</span> <span id="s613">We could see the speedometer going up to uh 70, 80, 90, 100.</span> <span id="s614">100 kilometers we finally realized and not a 100 miles an hour, almost uh only half the speed.</span> <span id="s615">At any rate we get to uh the Olympic stadium and uh they, they give us some paper to sign our names and we scrawled our names, Herman Goldberg, Marty Glickman and left almost immediately.</span> <span id="s616">Uh we didn’t want them to have them ask questions about our names, Goldberg, Glickman, were we Jewish, or do we have German Jewish background or whatever.</span> <span id="s617">We were aware of the fact that we were with this German Lieutenant uh and this German sergeant who looked every inch the typical Nazi Army officer and under officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: So you knew that there was potential for problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: We were aware of the fact that uh there was anti – Semitism in Germany.</span> <span id="s620">We were aware of the fact that these were obviously German soldiers, perhaps Nazis, but we thought all Germans uh all soldiers certainly uh were sympathetic to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s621">And uh we just didn’t know what Nazism was.</span> <span id="s622">Remember.</span> <span id="s623">This is from the prospective of two years before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s624">Uh the Holocaust was not only not a thought, it didn’t exist in our imagination, in our dreams uh we, we didn’t have nightmares about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s625">It was a word that I didn’t even know in 1936.</span> <span id="s626">Uh certainly had we uh any inkling of what was going to happen, we wouldn’t have been in Germany in the first place.</span> <span id="s627">But uh the uh, uh the feeling about anti – Semitism for me and probably for Herman and the two other Jews who uh whom I knew uh on, on the team.</span> <span id="s628">There was a, a fine basketball player named Sam Bolter who was on the team and Herman and I and uh, uh there was another Jewish athlete uh, uh who.</span> <span id="s629">The Jewish athletes I knew on the team uh were Herman Goldberg, who was my buddy much of the time, and Sam Stoller who was team mate on the 400 meter relay, and Sam Bolter was a, a wonderful basketball player, a guard on the basketball team and uh the four of us were the only Jews I was aware of.</span> <span id="s630">I understand now there were three other Jews who were on the uh American Olympic team, but I didn’t know them then.</span> <span id="s631">I didn’t know they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s632">But the, the four of them I knew, the four of us were the Jews whom I knew.</span> <span id="s633">And we certainly were not aware of what was to come.</span> <span id="s634">I guess the whole world was not aware of, of what was to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: So Berlin was like any other big city, but very beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Berlin was like any other big city.</span> <span id="s637">If I would use a single word to describe Berlin during that period of time.</span> <span id="s638">The word would be carnival.</span> <span id="s639">There was an atmosphere of carnival about Berlin with the flags flying and the beautiful weather, almost every day uh it was, it was golden.</span> <span id="s640">Fleecy white clouds occasionally overhead.</span> <span id="s641">Late in the day, on a couple of days, there was some rain at the stadium.</span> <span id="s642">But most of the time it was just lovely.</span> <span id="s643">The city was immaculate as I understand it still is and as I saw a couple of years when I was back there again.</span> <span id="s644">And uh the people were well dressed and seemingly well fed.</span> <span id="s645">Uh the beer flowed and uh it was a carnival atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Now before I get to, I want you to tell me about how you were basically dumped from the race, but I just wanted to ask you on the boat or in the Olympic village, did you get to know John Woodruff at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: I knew John Woodruff uh slightly from the various track meets in which we competed at the same time.</span> <span id="s648">He ran the half mile.</span> <span id="s649">I was the sprinter running a 100 meters and sometimes 200 meters.</span> <span id="s650">And John and I were among the younger members of the team.</span> <span id="s651">Uh John was a, a uh a wonder athlete.</span> <span id="s652">He was taller than virtually anyone else on the, on the squad except for some basketball players, six feet four, a quiet, reserved, and a magnificent runner.</span> <span id="s653">He had the longest stride, running stride, in the world at that time.</span> <span id="s654">And he ran a marvelous race to win the gold medal at 800 meters.</span> <span id="s655">He was far better than the rest of the field as you probably know and have seen, he virtually came to a halt at the half – way mark of the race, at the end of the first quarter, let the rest of the field go by because he was pocketed in.</span> <span id="s656">He couldn’t get to the outside.</span> <span id="s657">He couldn’t make a move because there were runners in front of him and along side of him, so he let the field go by him, ran around the entire field and then came on to win handily down the stretch and down the backstretch first, around the far turn and around the stretch, and uh, a quiet, self – effacing, and a uh just a wonderful athlete.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Now tell me about your anticipation for your event.</span> <span id="s659">I know you were training for it, and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: The 400 meter relay was selected beforehand and the four of us in order, Sam Stoller would start, he had the best start of the group of us.</span> <span id="s661">I was to run the second leg down the back stretch straightway.</span> <span id="s662">Floyd Draper run the third leg.</span> <span id="s663">And Frank Wycoff run the anchor leg.</span> <span id="s664">He was the great veteran.</span> <span id="s665">This was his third Olympic team that he was on.</span> <span id="s666">And we practiced passing the baton and passing the baton is terribly important in the 400 meter relay because the race is short and you to make a, a, a good pass, the best possible pass.</span> <span id="s667">And we practiced this every day.</span> <span id="s668">In that order.</span> <span id="s669">So that we knew each other and we knew the distance we had to start running and things like that.</span> <span id="s670">The morning of the day we were supposed to run in the trial heats, we were called into a meeting, the seven sprinters were, along with Gene Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, and Lawrence Robertson, the head track coach.</span> <span id="s671">And Robertson announced to the seven of us that he’s heard very strong rumors that the Germans were saving their best sprinters, hiding them, to upset the American team in the 400 meter relay.</span> <span id="s672">And consequently, Sam and I were to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe.</span> <span id="s673">Now there’s no question that Jesse and Ralph were faster at 100 meters than Sam and I. They’d beaten us fairly regularly.</span> <span id="s674">And we were shocked.</span> <span id="s675">Uh Sam was completely stunned.</span> <span id="s676">He didn’t say a word in the meeting.</span> <span id="s677">I’m a brash 18 year old kid and I said coach, you can’t hide world class sprinters.</span> <span id="s678">In order to be a world class sprinter you must run in world class competition.</span> <span id="s679">And we don’t know of any Germans outside of Erik Borkmaier who finished fifth in the 100 meter final beaten by Frank Wycoff, the, as well as Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe.</span> <span id="s680">He was the best German sprinter.</span> <span id="s681">Later I beat Borkamier in another post Olympic track meet, but we all knew we could beat Borkmaier, and you don’t hide world class sprinters.</span> <span id="s682">I said coach there can’t be any German world class sprinters.</span> <span id="s683">He says well we’re going to take no chances, said Dean Cromwell.</span> <span id="s684">And Jesse and Ralph are going to take Sam pla, Sam’s place and your place.</span> <span id="s685">At which point Jesse spoke up and said coach I’ve won my three gold medals, the 100, the 200, and the long jump.</span> <span id="s686">I’m tired.</span> <span id="s687">I’ve had it.</span> <span id="s688">Let Marty and Sam run.</span> <span id="s689">They deserve it, said Jesse.</span> <span id="s690">And Cromwell pointed his finger at him and said you’ll do as you’re told.</span> <span id="s691">And in those days black athletes did as they were told.</span> <span id="s692">And Jesse was quiet after that.</span> <span id="s693">But he volunteered not to run, not to win his fourth gold medal so that Sam and I, the only two Jews on the track team, could run and win or try to win.</span> <span id="s694">The only way we could have lost that race is had we dropped the baton.</span> <span id="s695">Frank Wycoff later said that uh we probably would have run just as fast because our baton passing would have been superior because we had practiced.</span> <span id="s696">I spoke up, I said something else, I said coach no matter who runs we’re going to win this race by fifteen yards.</span> <span id="s697">We won by fifteen yards.</span> <span id="s698">When you see the finish of the race, all you see is Frank Wycoff crossing the finish line.</span> <span id="s699">You don’t even see the next, second place finisher.</span> <span id="s700">He’s out of the picture.</span> <span id="s701">He’s that far back.</span> <span id="s702">Fifteen yards behind.</span> <span id="s703">The Germans didn’t finish second or third.</span> <span id="s704">They finished fourth.</span> <span id="s705">They were placed third because the Dutch team ran out of their lane and so they were disqualified.</span> <span id="s706">But they finished third in the race some fifteen, sixteen yards back.</span> <span id="s707">So the story given us was an out and out lie by Robertson and by Dean Cromwell.</span> <span id="s708">I believe now that with Hitler’s humiliation by having the black athletes stand on the winning podium the many times that they did in the 100, the 200, the 400, the 800, the long jump, the high jump.</span> <span id="s709">They were dominating the games.</span> <span id="s710">That it would have been further humiliation for Hitler to have Jews stand on the winning podium.</span> <span id="s711">And as I said the only way we would not stand on the winning podium had we dropped the baton.</span> <span id="s712">We would have won the race by, by fifteen yards or more.</span> <span id="s713">So we didn’t get to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Now you say now this is the way you look at it.</span> <span id="s715">Try to put yourself back to this time in the summer of 1936 as you were told that you weren’t going to be running.</span> <span id="s716">What was going through your mind?</span> <span id="s717">What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: As I was told that Sam and I would not run I thought that track politics was taking place, that uh Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, wanted to make sure that both his boys, Floyd Draper and Frank Wycoff were on the team.</span> <span id="s719">And so he was making sure they were going to be on because in a trial race in the Olympic village three days before this race took place, the 400 meter race took place, we ran a trial heat.</span> <span id="s720">And Stoller won the race, beating me by about oh a shoulder, a foot, and we both beat Floyd Draper by a yard.</span> <span id="s721">So here is Draper running the relay, whom we had both beaten just a couple of days before and Sam and I were not running.</span> <span id="s722">In the entire history of the modern Olympic games, now going into it’s 100th year, no fit American track and field performer has ever not competed in the Olympic games except for Sam Stoller and me, the only two Jews on the 1936 team.</span> <span id="s723">Every other American track and field athlete has competed, so long as he was physically fit, didn’t have a pulled muscle or didn’t have an appendectomy as one of our track athletes did have and couldn’t run, a fellow named Hal Smallwood.</span> <span id="s724">But with that exception uh every athlete has run.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s726">But you didn’t.</span> <span id="s727">I mean you weren’t thinking in those terms in August of ’36.</span> <span id="s728">You were thinking it was basically favoritism again.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: In August of ’36 I thought originally, I did mention in that meeting I did say that coach you know we’re the only two Jews on the track team, Sam and I. There’s bound to be a furor about this back home.</span> <span id="s730">We’ll worry about that later said Dean Cromwell.</span> <span id="s731">Later, of course, Dean Cromwell also was a member of the American First committee, that group in America which was sympathetic to the Nazi cause.</span> <span id="s732">So my thoughts were that Cromwell was seeing to it that his boys were on that 400 meter relay.</span> <span id="s733">And uh about that threat of other German sprinters that was just uh had a whole cloth.</span> <span id="s734">It, it, it was a complete lie.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: What were you feeling?</span> <span id="s736">Here you had been preparing for this in a way for years and you’d been training especially hard, you were, I’m sure, very, very excited to participate in the Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s738">I was young.</span> <span id="s739">I was 18.</span> <span id="s740">Sam was three years older than I.</span> <span id="s741">He was a senior at Michigan.</span> <span id="s742">And uh in those days when you finished your college career that was usually it.</span> <span id="s743">And Sam was at the end of his college career.</span> <span id="s744">He vowed never to run again because of this terrible disappointment.</span> <span id="s745">He did run and won a collegiate championship the following year.</span> <span id="s746">He did change his mind a bit later on.</span> <span id="s747">I as an 18 year old, just out of my freshman year, I vowed that come 1940, I’d win it all.</span> <span id="s748">I’d win the 100, the 200, I’d uh run on the relay.</span> <span id="s749">I was going to be 22 in 1940 and I’d be at the height of my supposed uh athletic abilities in those years.</span> <span id="s750">Of course 1940 never came.</span> <span id="s751">There was a war on.</span> <span id="s752">1944 never came.</span> <span id="s753">But I was frustrated and angered enough so that I could look ahead and get even four years hence.</span> <span id="s754">Young enough to get even.</span> <span id="s755">In addition I was a football player uh at Syracuse and uh a month from the Olympic games I was going to be playing football at Syracuse University, my first varsity season then.</span> <span id="s756">And uh I had something to look forward to.</span> <span id="s757">I had something to dissipate my disappointment by having a, a football season too, looming for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: So you weren’t even temporarily devastated by this?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: I was, I was, I was not if you use the word devastated, I was not devastated.</span> <span id="s760">I was angered.</span> <span id="s761">I was frustrated.</span> <span id="s762">And as I say I was young enough to think ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Say that again without the as I say.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: I was not devastated by not being on that 400 meter team.</span> <span id="s765">Terribly angry.</span> <span id="s766">Terribly frustrated.</span> <span id="s767">But I was young enough to be able to look ahead to 1940 and perhaps win it all, to win the 100 and the 200.</span> <span id="s768">I might be at my athletic peak when I was 22 years of age.</span> <span id="s769">Here I was only 18.</span> <span id="s770">So I had something to shoot for, something to look forward to, come 1940 and the next Olympic games.</span> <span id="s771">I also had a football season I was looking forward to because I was going into my sophomore year, first year of varsity football, and that occupied my thoughts and time and energies immediately after the games.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: You mentioned that Owens stepped forward and said, let these guys run.</span> <span id="s773">Did you get that kind of support from the other athletes?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: No one else said anything in that room during the course of this meeting.</span> <span id="s775">Ralph Metcalfe didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s776">I think he wanted to run on the relay and this justification, why, why not, if he could run on the relay.</span> <span id="s777">And the only other athlete involved who didn’t run was Mac Robinson.</span> <span id="s778">Mac, Jackie Robinson’s older brother, already had won the silver medal at 200 meters and he was not as good at 100 meters as he was at 200 meters.</span> <span id="s779">In addition he was not involved in the practice of passing the baton.</span> <span id="s780">That 400 meter relay was set as I say with uh leading off was Sam Stoller with that great start.</span> <span id="s781">I was running the second leg, Floyd Draper the third leg, Frank Wycoff the anchor leg and we practiced passing the baton in that order for two weeks in the Olympic village.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Did the other athletes after this decision had been made, were they supportive or did they or did you guys just not talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: They were supportive.</span> <span id="s784">The other athletes were supportive afterwards.</span> <span id="s785">Uh patted me on the back.</span> <span id="s786">Say, saying Marty you should have run.</span> <span id="s787">Uh not en masse.</span> <span id="s788">Everybody was involved with his own uh achievements or striding.</span> <span id="s789">Uh the, the feeling was that tough luck.</span> <span id="s790">But for me, as I say, it was the feeling of I’ll show them.</span> <span id="s791">I’ll get even.</span> <span id="s792">I was there.</span> <span id="s793">I sat in the stands and watched the race.</span> <span id="s794">The qualifying heats proved that we were by far the best team among the other countries of the world, the best 400 meter relay team.</span> <span id="s795">The following day I was walking across the campus of the Olympic village and I heard my name called to me, and 50 yards away was Lawrence Robertson, the head track coach, uh with his cane.</span> <span id="s796">He was an older man.</span> <span id="s797">Marty, Marty.</span> <span id="s798">And I jogged over to him.</span> <span id="s799">I just want to tell you how sorry I am.</span> <span id="s800">I made a terrible mistake.</span> <span id="s801">And uh he said he was sorry.</span> <span id="s802">Dean Cromwell didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s803">Never spoke to me again.</span> <span id="s804">Uh I don’t know what he said or thought to anyone else, but he never said a word to me.</span> <span id="s805">Wycoff later said we would have run just as fast had you and Sam run because our superior baton passing because of practice could have enabled us to run and win.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Now you started to say you were there watching your meet.</span> <span id="s807">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Watching the trial heat and watching the final the following day were uh strange, weird, all sorts of emotions flashed through my being.</span> <span id="s809">Uh frustration certainly.</span> <span id="s810">Anger certainly.</span> <span id="s811">I look out on the track and I see Metcalfe passing runners down the backstretch.</span> <span id="s812">He ran the second leg.</span> <span id="s813">And that should be me out there.</span> <span id="s814">As they warmed up, jogging up and down the track, I, that should be me.</span> <span id="s815">That, that’s me out there.</span> <span id="s816">And you know frustrated at it uh feeling uh also feeling relief that I wasn’t running in this race.</span> <span id="s817">I didn’t have the pressure of receiving the baton, running with it and passing the baton.</span> <span id="s818">I wasn’t fearful of dropping the baton.</span> <span id="s819">And all relay runners have that uncertainty, that fear of the possibility.</span> <span id="s820">I’ve never dropped a baton in the many relay races I’ve run, but I’ve seen it dropped.</span> <span id="s821">So I it was some feeling of relief, but mostly it was anger and frustration and the feeling that should be me out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Who were you sitting with during the event?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: My recollection is I sat with Herman Goldberg uh during the events for either the trial race or the trial heats or for the finals.</span> <span id="s824">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s825">I don’t believe I sat with Herman both those days.</span> <span id="s826">Very often we would sit together and sometimes we would not.</span> <span id="s827">After all he had his own assignments to take care of.</span> <span id="s828">He was practicing and playing with the American baseball team.</span> <span id="s829">But I do believe that for one of those races either the trial heat or in the final that Herman was alongside me.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Did you talk about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: No.</span> <span id="s832">I uh I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s833">Words can’t convey how you feel.</span> <span id="s834">Not at the moment anyhow.</span> <span id="s835">Uh words wouldn’t have made me feel any better or less angry.</span> <span id="s836">I uh I just sat there and uh suffered or just felt.</span> <span id="s837">I felt all these emotions.</span> <span id="s838">And again at the age of 18, the world is bright and glorious in front of you.</span> <span id="s839">I was a good athlete.</span> <span id="s840">I knew that.</span> <span id="s841">And uh four years hence I was going to be out there again.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Now when the American team did win and went up to the podium to receive their honors, were you proud for them, were you happy for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: When the American team was on the podium, I was not necessarily proud for them.</span> <span id="s844">I was pleased, of course, that they won, and I was particularly pleased that they won by fifteen yards to prove the point that uh anyone, anyone of the American uh sprinters could have won on the, run on the relay and won the event handily.</span> <span id="s845">But we, I don’t feel as though uh I was an American athlete, or that I was a Jewish athlete.</span> <span id="s846">I was an athlete.</span> <span id="s847">I was a, a member of the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s848">I was in the Olympic stadium.</span> <span id="s849">Uh I was part of this overall thing, which I believe has done me so much good in all the years which follow, 60 years now, which have followed those ’36 games.</span> <span id="s850">Where I began to realize that I’m just like the other athletes of the world, the other people of the world and they’re just like me.</span> <span id="s851">We’re all alike.</span> <span id="s852">We’re all brothers.</span> <span id="s853">And uh the whole point of the games, the whole point of all athletic competition is to learn to respect each other, to like each other, to love each other, to get to really know each other.</span> <span id="s854">And I was part of that.</span> <span id="s855">And I was also angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Were you envious?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: I don’t think I was envious?</span> <span id="s858">I uh.</span> <span id="s859">The only feeling I have today, I’m a grandfather of 10, and I’m the great – grandfather of 4.</span> <span id="s860">So I don’t have the grandchildren or the great – grandchildren I can show this gold medal to.</span> <span id="s861">That’s the only feeling of disappointment I now have, that I can’t show my grandchildren this gold Olympic medal.</span> <span id="s862">That’s the only, the only feeling I have now.</span> <span id="s863">I think it’s wonderful that I was on the team.</span> <span id="s864">I think it’s great that I made this trip.</span> <span id="s865">Uh it exposed me to, to marvelous things.</span> <span id="s866">And also exposed me to the hurt of anti – Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Is there anything else you can tell me about what it was like, not necessarily for your competition in particular, but just what it was like being in the Olympic stadium?</span> <span id="s868">Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: The Olympic stadium itself is a very impressive place.</span> <span id="s870">Uh it’s a, it was particularly impressive then when filled with a hundred and twenty thousand people and it was virtually brand new.</span> <span id="s871">And I’ll never forget walking into the stadium, marching in along with my American teammates in the opening day parade.</span> <span id="s872">And I use the word march loosely here because American athletes don’t march very well.</span> <span id="s873">We kind of sclumped in you know in line but ah walking in the manner of loose – limbed, uh easy going American athletes.</span> <span id="s874">And I remember looking up at Adolph Hitler as we walked by, marched by, and he was glaring down at us we thought.</span> <span id="s875">And the comment heard in the ranks and I said it also, he looks just like Charlie Chaplin.</span> <span id="s876">And that’s just the way we felt about him.</span> <span id="s877">He was almost a comic figure with his drab, khaki uniform he wore, khaki shirt and khaki pants.</span> <span id="s878">No decorations on it.</span> <span id="s879">That funny little moustache and the cowlick over his forehead and uh he was a comic figure.</span> <span id="s880">Uh I thought of him and I think many of us thought of him as like a typical South American dictator of those years who was here today and gone tomorrow.</span> <span id="s881">After all he’d just been in power some two and a half years and who knew how long he was going to last or how much power he would ultimately have.</span> <span id="s882">But uh he was comic to us.</span> <span id="s883">Uh along with the rest of his entourage and uh certainly they were funny looking in terms of uh Goering and his uniform and Goebbels with his rat like face and some of the diplomats in their with their long frock coats and ascots and uh, uh some of the Army uniforms and Naval uniforms around them.</span> <span id="s884">So uh it was uh it was uh an experience I’m pleased to have be a part of.</span> <span id="s885">And of I’m still angry at not having that medal to show the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Was there something awesome about marching in with a hundred thousand people sitting there?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: We felt no feeling of awe.</span> <span id="s888">We were cocky, young, uh well – trained, uh good athletes.</span> <span id="s889">And uh nothing awesome about going into a huge stadium.</span> <span id="s890">We’d been in huge stadiums before.</span> <span id="s891">We’d competed in these huge stadiums.</span> <span id="s892">Uh the ha the thing I remember, one of the things I remember most, was as part of the opening ceremonies these thousands of pigeons which had been kept in cages</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: I need to stop you here cause the tapes… (end of Tape 3 of 4) (Tape 4 of 4)</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: When we stopped you were describing what it was like being in the Olympic stadium, the pageantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A: The opening day parade.</span> <span id="s896">One of the things I, I best remember about the uh, uh the opening day ceremonies of the Olympic games was standing in the infield of the stadium while the Olympic oath was being taken and uh the various music was being played, was the release of these thousands of pigeons which had been cooped up and they were all, alongside the inner perimeter of the stadium.</span> <span id="s897">And now after being in these cages for I don’t know how many hours or how many days, they were suddenly released and they flew up over the stadium and circled round and round.</span> <span id="s898">And we began to hear on our straw hats that was part of our uniform, the straw hats, splat, splat, splat from these pigeons.</span> <span id="s899">And we were afraid to look up of course or else we’d get it in the eye.</span> <span id="s900">But there we were cringing in the stadium and the splat, splat of all these thousands of pigeons going round and round and finally they went far enough up to get out of the stadium and flew away.</span> <span id="s901">It was a very funny moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Do you remember.</span> <span id="s903">Were you at the closing ceremonies?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: No.</span> <span id="s905">We, we left before the end of the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s906">Avery Brundage I believe, the head of the American Olympic committee, was the basic reason, I believe that Sam and I didn’t get to run in the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s907">Adolph Hitler was being humiliated by the great success of the black American athletes and I think that he wanted to see to it that Jewish athletes didn’t stand on the winning podium and further humiliate Adolph Hitler, embarrass him with that nonsense about Aryan supremacy because here were the great black athletes who couldn’t be kept off the winning podium because of their number and their great reputations.</span> <span id="s908">And they were marvelous.</span> <span id="s909">But here were two rather obscure Jewish American athletes who could be kept from the winning podium and I believe that Avery Brundage who was close to Hitler, who had examined Germany for anti – Semitism the year before to see whether or not the games should be held in Germany.</span> <span id="s910">Here was Avery Brundage keeping Jews from the winning podium so as not to further embarrass Adolph Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: This was something that you realized later.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: I was, I was more aware of it later than I am.</span> <span id="s913">I was more aware of it later uh than I was at that time.</span> <span id="s914">But uh Brundage was a most important figure.</span> <span id="s915">Head of the American Olympic Committee and later on the president of the International Olympic Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: You mentioned you had wanted, or were thinking forward to the 1940 Olympics.</span> <span id="s917">So apparently this experience didn’t sour you at all on sports, or fairness, Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A; My experience in the Olympic games and the fact that I didn’t run didn’t sour me on the games at all.</span> <span id="s919">It soured me on Avery Brundage.</span> <span id="s920">It certainly soured me on anti – Semitism and the Nazis as well.</span> <span id="s921">But as far as the Olympic games then and for many years thereafter, I was an Olympic uh booster.</span> <span id="s922">I didn’t want us to boycott the games in the Soviet Union in 1980.</span> <span id="s923">I didn’t want the Soviet Union to boycott the American games in 1984.</span> <span id="s924">But I’m not very happy with the current Olympic games.</span> <span id="s925">The Olympic games of ’96 and the enormous commercialization of the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s926">I think that the Olympic ideal, the Olympic creed, doesn’t exist any longer.</span> <span id="s927">It’s all strictly professionalism.</span> <span id="s928">I think that the current Olympic games in Atlanta is a huge project for profit and that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: At what point after the games did you become more aware of what was actually taking place in Germany and in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: I became aware of what took place in Germany in 1938, Kristallnacht was the beginning of the knowledge generally of what took place in Germany.</span> <span id="s931">In 1936 even the German Jews stayed in Germany until 1938.</span> <span id="s932">Many left but far more remained in Germany until ’38 and then they started to try to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s933">Of course, I didn’t know about uh the Holocaust until after the war was over.</span> <span id="s934">I was a, a marine in the, in the central Pacific during World War II on the Marshall Islands and uh the European campaign was that far distant from our involvement in the Pacific.</span> <span id="s935">So it wasn’t until I came back in December of ’45 that I began to realize, began to hear and know of what took place in the years, the closing years of World War II</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Did you rethink at all about your participation in 1936/ I mean when you started learning much more, did it make you think about it all in context?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: I’ve been asked many times whether I have second guesses about going to Germany in 1936 and uh I persist in saying that I’m delighted I went.</span> <span id="s938">Uh I’m glad that the games took place in 1936.</span> <span id="s939">Uh I saw no harm from the games themselves.</span> <span id="s940">I saw a great deal of good from the games.</span> <span id="s941">For me as an individual learning about the other athletes of the world and for the great success of the non – Aryan athletes, the marvelous black athletes who had this great success in helping smash that myth of Aryan supremacy.</span> <span id="s942">I think that was a very positive thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Did you afterwards think more about being a Jewish athlete?</span> <span id="s944">I mean did it, because in fact that seems to be what happened in 1936 even though prior to that you never considered yourself a Jewish athlete.</span> <span id="s945">You were one.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Something took place in 1937 which uh was a direct result of what happened to me in 1936.</span> <span id="s947">I was playing football at Syracuse and uh for this particular I was the star of the team.</span> <span id="s948">We had upset Cornell the week before and uh I had uh scored both touchdowns for Syracuse against Cornell 14 to 6 was the final score.</span> <span id="s949">And I’d had the best day I ever had on the football field.</span> <span id="s950">Lot of publicity about me then.</span> <span id="s951">And uh I’m embarrassed almost to say it, I was the star of the team going to a game against Maryland, in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s952">And as we’re getting dressed for the game sitting alongside of me is the other starting half – back.</span> <span id="s953">His name is Wilmoth Sedette Sing.</span> <span id="s954">He is a black man but his mother married a Hindu physician and Will and I played side by side.</span> <span id="s955">We’re in the same class.</span> <span id="s956">We took classes together.</span> <span id="s957">He helped me through my physics class, my physics course.</span> <span id="s958">Later he was a member of the uh the black airmen, the black squadron who helped form uh the one squadron of black aviators in World War II.</span> <span id="s959">But this was in Baltimore, Maryland.</span> <span id="s960">We’re being dressed for the game.</span> <span id="s961">He’s sitting right alongside of me, right here.</span> <span id="s962">He slept alongside of me where we slept in the, in the gym during the football season.</span> <span id="s963">And the coach came in, Ossie Solom along with the Director of Athletics Lou Andreas and he said uh fellows I’ve got some news.</span> <span id="s964">Uh the local press and Maryland had just found out that Will is not a Hindu but he’s a black man and consequently he won’t play today.</span> <span id="s965">And I said to myself sitting there, stand up Marty and say if Will doesn’t play, I don’t play.</span> <span id="s966">And I’m one of the leaders of the team.</span> <span id="s967">I’m the star of the team, this week anyhow because of that previous game the week before.</span> <span id="s968">And I say stand up and say that.</span> <span id="s969">And I think to myself, but if I do stand up and say that and the game is cancelled and there’s ruckus or this furor develops as a result of the game being cancelled, if that happens they’ll point to me and there’s that Jewish guy getting in trouble again.</span> <span id="s970">Because just the year before I’d been involved in the anti – Semitic incident in Berlin.</span> <span id="s971">And so I didn’t say a word.</span> <span id="s972">And Will didn’t play.</span> <span id="s973">And I played.</span> <span id="s974">And we got beat.</span> <span id="s975">We got beat twelve nothing.</span> <span id="s976">A couple of years after that, Will was killed in World War II and to this day I still feel very strongly about it.</span> <span id="s977">That I should have gotten up and said and he was good enough to die for our country, but he wasn’t good enough to play against Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: I want to ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s979">(Straighten jacket and tie0</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: After the Olympic games uh many of the track and field athletes toured Europe and several different track meets.</span> <span id="s981">I ran on a 400 yard relay team in London at White City Stadium.</span> <span id="s982">I ran with Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe and Frank Wycoff and me.</span> <span id="s983">We set a world’s record at 400 yards.</span> <span id="s984">That world’s record still stands.</span> <span id="s985">Mostly because they rarely run that race and they don’t run yards any more they now run meters.</span> <span id="s986">So um the four of us are still world record holders at the 400 yard relay.</span> <span id="s987">I also ran in Paris after the uh Olympic games.</span> <span id="s988">Ran against Frank Wycoff and uh I won the race against Wycoff that day and uh a combination of uh Japanese and French athletes as well as American athletes competed that day.</span> <span id="s989">And I won that race.</span> <span id="s990">Also ran in Scotland.</span> <span id="s991">I ran in a handicap race and uh didn’t win that handicap race.</span> <span id="s992">Uh I was set back so far from the rest of the field because these were local athletes in uh in Edinburgh, Scotland, that uh I was literally off the track, uh that far back, and had to run up a slight incline to get to the track and then start running.</span> <span id="s993">I finished out of the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: So I think what you’re telling me from those first few races is that you probably were good enough to run in the Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Well, I, I was on the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: But to have actually competed instead of all that stuff you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Do you want me to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s999">All of a sudden a few weeks after the Olympics, you’re making a world record in the same event.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: I don’t want to brag.</span> <span id="s1001">I mean it’s been said.</span> <span id="s1002">I, I was on the team.</span> <span id="s1003">That’s the important thing.</span> <span id="s1004">I made the team and the obviously I was good enough to be uh to run in the Olympic games because I was on the American team.</span> <span id="s1005">And uh American athletes compete in the Olympic games when they make the Olympic team, except for these two Jewish athletes who didn’t because of Avery Brundage and Adolph Hitler and anti – Semitism.</span> <span id="s1006">And I’d like to add one other thing that sometimes people feel sorry for me and what happened to me in, in Germany, in Berlin, in 1936.</span> <span id="s1007">What happened to me was as nothing, absolutely zero to that which took place later on.</span> <span id="s1008">There’s just no feeling of uh comparison and no feeling of, of hurt.</span> <span id="s1009">Uh there’s still feeling of anger, but uh I was there and uh that mattered.</span> <span id="s1010">What took place was much, much more important afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: I think I have one more question.</span> <span id="s1012">You mentioned this race in Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: The football game in Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1015">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1016">The football game.</span> <span id="s1017">And the fact that you were very conflicted about standing up for this black Indian athlete.</span> <span id="s1018">Have you thought about ways in which your experience from the 1936 Olympics impacted you or shaped you in terms of values or choices you made afterwards.</span> <span id="s1019">I know it’s a fairly broad question, but.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: I think my experience in 1936, my experience in athletics generally specifically in ’36 made me aware of the fact that I am not different than other people of the world.</span> <span id="s1021">I am not different than blacks or browns or yellows or whites.</span> <span id="s1022">That we’re all one.</span> <span id="s1023">And uh I think I’ve learned not to be tolerant necessarily because tolerance I think implies sort of a uh a superiority over individuals.</span> <span id="s1024">But I’ve learned to appreciate other people I think because of my experience in ’36 and my experience in athletics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Did it make you more vigilant toward racism, anti – Semitism, discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: I think the experience of all athletes makes me more conscious of other people, of bias and prejudice against uh Black and Asiatics and Latins and Jews.</span> <span id="s1027">I think that we’re people.</span> <span id="s1028">I’ve learned that through sports.</span> <span id="s1029">I think that at every level of sports from my days as a schoolboy to my days as a broadcaster has enabled me to thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the abilities of the great athletes.</span> <span id="s1030">I was able to look at and broadcast about.</span> <span id="s1031">The Jim Browns.</span> <span id="s1032">The wonderful Black athletes, the wonderful Japanese athletes, uh the great athletes of the world uh regardless of what their background was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Sports is the great equalizer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Sports is the great equalizer.</span> <span id="s1035">The fellow who gets to the finish line first is the winner.</span> <span id="s1036">Uh brings to mind another thought that uh the Olympic games should be uh a competition amongst individuals and not amongst teams because teams represent nationalities.</span> <span id="s1037">Individuals represent themselves.</span> <span id="s1038">Even though we wore the uniform of the United States Olympic Team, we ran as individuals.</span> <span id="s1039">For the relay, the relay is a unique track and field event, four men running together but running individually together.</span> <span id="s1040">Uh basketball and hockey, great sports, they’re wonderful sports, and football too, of course, but the, the point of sports is the exultation the individual athlete feels when he does it by himself.</span> <span id="s1041">And that’s the point of the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s1042">Team sports are marvelous.</span> <span id="s1043">They teach all the things that ought to be taught in terms of team work and cooperation and practice and respect for the other team and all that.</span> <span id="s1044">But uh, the Olympic games are for the individual and for the extolling of the individual abilities, the excellence of the individual rather than the nation or the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1046">Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: I want to say hello to Margaret.</span></p>
