<span id="s102">And I went away from him and later I came to -- when it come to my mind what it can happen, I came back to meet him, and I can never meet him, so this is -- well maybe in another

inside.</span> <span id="s141">And I remember that was -- it was like a trip, so it’s a few times.</span> <span id="s142">I remember the noise of these planes.</span> <span id="s143">I remember the fire, and I remember that when -- a few times I saw that when all these people from the train, when they go some, no one know -- knows where to go.</span> <span id="s144">Some [indecipherable] goes ahead, and no one knows where -- what we have to do.</span> <span id="s145">And it was like -- it’s very strange, it was like -- I don’t know, is -- or they made it like by military sanction.</span> <span id="s146">It was like on the sky, different colors like a half o -- of the si -- what is it?</span> <span id="s147">How do they call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: A rainbow?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Like -- like a half of the moon, you know, but it was like different -- different bright color.</span> <span id="s150">And someone said because this is here -- this is the point where we can go, we have to go back.</span> <span id="s151">There’s no way to go -- to go further, so -- and we went back.</span> <span id="s152">And it lo-look -- look like -- it looks like some house, or some -- I don’t know what -- all people will -- they listen what they said.</span> <span id="s153">One of the guys said where we have to go.</span> <span id="s154">Because it’s not like you buy a ticket and you go, this [indecipherable] and say go.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Do you remember being afraid on that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: You do.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: I remember that I was afraid, and I remember that -- the noise in this bombing is still in my -- sometimes when I sleep --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: You can hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: -- it comes here, yeah, I can hear it sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Do you have bad dreams now, with remembering it sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: About this time -- well, I just more remember that it was a lot people that going, they don’t know where to go, and this is different color, like [indecipherable] that people say you cannot go here.</span> <span id="s163">This is what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Now you were going in a southeastern direction, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah, we -- we went to west -- west south -- southwest direction, because it was far away from the German border and thing like this.</span> <span id="s166">So -- and we stay here almost a year before German came to this place.</span> <span id="s167">So because German came to this place where you finally [indecipherable], in August, 1942.</span> <span id="s168">So the war began on July ’41, so it was more than a year.</span> <span id="s169">So the war was very, very -- on the high level on this time.</span> <span id="s170">And -- but because -- I don’t know the -- how they call it, they call it like Voencomat -- Voencomat, it’s military commission in these places.</span> <span id="s171">So they got an order to take care about families whose fathers on the f -- on the ar -- in the army.</span> <span id="s172">So because this is a help, this apartment, a help is found the job for -- for Mom, and some -- every month Mom receives some money from the -- like from the government because our father is in the military.</span> <span id="s173">So -- and we stay here, mom -- it was very difficult, but no one knows -- everyone knows that this is a war, no one knows if your father will be alive or not.</span> <span id="s174">And we spent like a year like this.</span> <span id="s175">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: And where -- do you know where you were for that year?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yeah, I know I wa -- it was a -- near Stavropol.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: It was near Stavropol?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Near Stavropol, yeah Beshbagir they call it, Beshbagir, like suburb -- suburb sa -- Stavropol.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: A suburb?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Suburb Stavropol, and it’s agriculture actually, a place -- agriculture most -- in this time it was most agriculture places, not industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: And so they got a new friends, and the people who was here, from -- the Russian people, well, they was not -- they actually afraid to be anti-Semitic, very, very, because actually they should take care about families who was -- came from this -- the territory that you know, like the -- they ra -- ran away from the Germans so, it was -- everything looks not very friendly.</span> <span id="s184">So -- and what happened when ger -- when Germans almost came to this place, so Mom took me, and we tried to run away from this place.</span> <span id="s185">No one knows where, but someone said that we’ll -- we will got the directions.</span> <span id="s186">Germans here, let’s go to another place.</span> <span id="s187">It was again when we came, I see the same line, with the same -- the same [indecipherable] as I said, no place to go.</span> <span id="s188">And where to go, no one knows where to go.</span> <span id="s189">So we came back to the same place in this Stavropol, and my neighbors said to my mom, “You know what?</span> <span id="s190">This is what I can tell you.</span> <span id="s191">You look like Russian village woman, so no one cra -- can recognize you that you are Jew, and no one will ask you.</span> <span id="s192">You can take a name, like Russian name, like Vera, and tell that you are Vera, you don’t have passport.</span> <span id="s193">The passport -- passport was somewhere destroyed.</span> <span id="s194">And let me take care about your son, because together you will never survive.</span> <span id="s195">You will never find a apartment to stay together.</span> <span id="s196">Who will take care [indecipherable] keep.</span> <span id="s197">And between these Russians villages, you will find something and you will survive.”</span> <span id="s198">So Mom decided -- and Mom told me that, “You know what, I will leave you with this very nice -- very nice person, don’t worry, I will come back to pick up you.</span> <span id="s199">And because Germans want to kill us.”</span> <span id="s200">She afraid to told me they want to kill us because we are Jewish, because she afraid that -- if I will play with kids, sometimes I can tell them that I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s201">And I also look like -- like a -- like a Russian boy.</span> <span id="s202">I was a blonde, with a -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: With round fa --</span></p> <p><span

id="s207">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: And -- and Mom said what I can do, this is the way -- this is what I can -- can do, I am very sorry but --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Do you re --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: -- and she left me with this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Do you remember her talking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: I -- I remem -- I remem

id="s214">I did not cry that I want go to my mom.</span> <span id="s215">She said me that we have to do it, I said okay, we have to do it.</span> <span id="s216">And ali -- I often ask me how come, because now, when my grandkids stay -- the first time our gra -- when they wer -- w-we told them, “Can you go somewhere to vacation, and we will stay with your boy.”</span> <span id="s217">He was just born.</span> <span id="s218">And she cried first day, we cannot stop him.</span> <span id="s219">He want mommy and that is it.</span> <span id="s220">And I never said that I want mommy.</span> <span id="s221">Mommy told me that we have to do it like this.</span> <span id="s222">So we did it like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Do you remember her hugging you?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Mom, yes, sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Was she --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: -- I remember her hugging me, I remember her kissing me, and I remember her -- her crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Wa -- but she was crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: She crying, but I was not.</span> <span id="s229">I said, “Well, Mommy says that we have to do it, because someone want to come to kill us.”</span> <span id="s230">So -- and two days I was in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And you were four years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I

<span id="s240">And even -- even this time, I don’t remember me crying.</span> <span id="s241">He said, “Let’s go.”</span> <span id="s242">I said, “Let’s go.”</span> <span id="s243">So he put me on --

you’re not s-sure if it’s the synagogue, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I -- to be honest with, it -- member -- I tried to understand, it looks like it was a small -- not big synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Because I don’t remember any church let’s say equipment like crisis or something like this.</span> <span id="s272">It looks like -- seems to me that it was a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And my wife said me, “Where they got synagogue in Beshbagir?”</span> <span id="s275">And I said, “Well, if they got hundred people to bring them together -- or more than hundred, maybe they got,” -- anyway it was -- it was in service, or it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: -- previous synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Let me -- let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s279">How do you now understand this woman who clearly seemed to be trying to help your mother and you, and in a day she gets a German boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes, why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: It’s their philosophy, she got -- well, you know, when Germans came, so they came there let’s say [indecipherable] they -- they believe that is forever.</span> <span id="s283">If she knew that is for a half a year maybe her behavior will be di --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Different, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: -- was be different, but she believed that is forever.</span> <span id="s286">So that is why she said well -- no one force her, teln her this Jewish guy, but she has to explain him where she got this guy -- where she got me.</span> <span id="s287">And as a Jewish boy, maybe I got something that if they will take a look at this, they will found that I am a Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: So -- and so they brought me to this place.</span> <span id="s290">No one gave us food, no one, but because it was families, they got something with them.</span> <span id="s291">And I remember me that I go -- I am alone, no one else, four year boy, no one else.</span> <span id="s292">So and I took a look one family, another family.</span> <span id="s293">I took a look one family they -- I remember they eat things like bread with honey.</span> <span id="s294">So I took a look on him, he said, “Maybe -- wh-where is your Mom?”</span> <span id="s295">I said, “I don’t have my Mom here, by [indecipherable] self.”</span> <span id="s296">He start crying, and sa -- it was a -- a Jewish man with a build -- I -- I don’t know his name, what -- I don’t know how he looks like, his glasses.</span> <span id="s297">So -- and he -- he gave me a piece of bread with honey and said, “Take it, please.”</span> <span id="s298">And he is crying, and I said, “Why he is crying?”</span> <span id="s299">I did not understand what they going to do here.</span> <span id="s300">I don’t understand why all these peoples here, I even don’t understand why this guy brought me here.</span> <span id="s301">Well, I understand maybe she doesn’t want me stay with her, she gave me someone else, and that is it.</span> <span id="s302">And it was like, you know, like a sign, I don’t know, that I said to them, “I want to go to make pee-pee.”</span> <span id="s303">And the guy who was in -- on the door, he said [indecipherable] it was a fence around, it was not just -- he said, “Okay, you can go.”</span> <span id="s304">So when I came and wi -- to make a pee-pee it was like a wooden cabin with something in the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: It’s a -- it’s an outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yeah, outside, but you can make a pee-pee.</span> <span id="s307">So I came to this place, and another guy.</span> <span id="s308">I look at him, and he worked with horses.</span> <span id="s309">He clean a ho -- a horse.</span> <span id="s310">He look at me, he look on this door, he looked at -- I came along from this place, and he came to me, and he said, “Listen, all these people will be killed.</span> <span id="s311">And I will try to save you.</span> <span id="s312">Don’t say a word.</span> <span id="s313">I will bring you a carriage, and I will bring you to a safe place.”</span> <span id="s314">S -- and he -- he work -- he work like with them, but it was -- he was like part on something like underground or something like this.</span> <span id="s315">So he put me in this carriage, and he brought me -- it was about, in my understanding, at least 30 minutes, 40 minutes drive on this place.</span> <span id="s316">And he reveals a big, big forest, and he said, “Stay here.</span> <span id="s317">I be back.”</span> <span id="s318">And what I remember, it was very, very, very ti -- this was real time, and I start to worry, because he did not come back, and I don’t know where to go from here.</span> <span id="s319">And it was a forest, and just me and the -- and the horse.</span> <span id="s320">So I don’t know what I have to do, where I had to go, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So the horse was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: The horse and carriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: He left the horse with me, and said stay here.</span> <span id="s325">He put this horse around the tree, and said stay with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: So he came somewhere.</span> <span id="s328">It looks like he came to get some orders, or some direction what he has to do.</span> <span id="s329">And he came [indecipherable] that he save one guy.</span> <span id="s330">I don’t know if he told them that he’s Jewish or not Jewish, maybe [indecipherable] and he said what -- what is next I can do.</span> <span id="s331">So a -- now he came back.</span> <span id="s332">He brought -- he put me -- he -- we continue our -- this journey, so we came to one place in different town.</span> <span id="s333">And we ca -- he came to the woman, the woman was pregnant and she got four kids.</span> <span id="s334">And he said, this kid I brought you, this kid has to stay in your house for a couple days, and we will find for him a place.</span> <span id="s335">She start crying, she said, “Take him away, I don’t want him because I have three and I expect another one, and it’s very dangerous for me and for my family.</span> <span id="s336">I don’t want him, take him away.”</span> <span id="s337">Because I understand for Germans is [indecipherable] said, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s338">We will find place for him.”</span> <span id="s339">So they put me under the bed, and they put watermelons around me.</span> <span id="s340">They cover me --</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Watermelons?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Watermelons.</span> <span id="s343">It was time -- it was like the end of the autumn, it was about maybe August, the end of the August, September, so they put a lot out, and they said, “You have to stay here, don’t go, and don’t cry.</span> <span id="s344">But you have to stay here unless we will call you.</span> <span id="s345">Don’t go away, stay here.”</span> <span id="s346">And it was about maybe two days when I was in this position.</span> <span id="s347">So later someone came, and the -- it was almost --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Well what did you -- do you remember being in that --</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yeah, I remember like now, I remember y -- ow --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: -- I remembering how this bed was covered with something like -- like gray cover, and it was a long one, so when someone come in, and they would like to take a look, they open it and they see just watermelon [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s352">So they did not search.</span> <span id="s353">I remem-remember that one guy came and said, “What do you have?”</span> <span id="s354">And she said, “Nothing.”</span> <span id="s355">So he -- he open it.</span> <span id="s356">I remember the -- how -- he open it, because I see -- I saw that something -- light came to me, but I says I was told.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: You did exactly what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Don’t -- don’t be -- yeah, don’t -- don’t open your mouth.</span> <span id="s359">So -- and this [indecipherable] me, and later they found the couple, and as I remember it was a Polish couple, they were not young, but they were -- they was without children, childre -- childrenless -- how’s it go?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Childless.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Childless.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: So and they look at -- at me, and they said well they -- they understand that action is not -- it’s not safe to have a child, because rumors can be around.</span> <span id="s364">But because they did not have kids, they decided that they want me to be in their family, because as this guy said, her mom is died, no one [indecipherable] he did not tell that Mom around, she will pick him up.</span> <span id="s365">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did you tell him that your mother was alive?</span> <span id="s367">Were -- could you speak well?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Well I -- yeah, sh-she ask me, “Well, where’s your mom?”</span> <span id="s369">I telled her then that my mom, she went, and I don’t know where sh-she’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: -- she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s372">I know what she told me that she left -- I told them the story, how I came to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: And I remember the woman said, “You -- I’m asking you, I’m begging you, don’t tell anyone about this.</span> <span id="s375">Tell everyone that we are your parents, and this is just the way that you can survive.</span> <span id="s376">Because if not, they going to kill you, and they going to kill us.”</span> <span id="s377">And when I was in this family, as I remember, it was long enough, because when -- when the Germans was in this place about a half a year.</span> <span id="s378">It was -- they came like suddenly from the sky as paratroopers.</span> <span id="s379">They put the paratroopers to take this place from the Russians during the war.</span> <span id="s380">And, you know, half a year, they forced leave this place.</span> <span id="s381">Half a year.</span> <span id="s382">So they occupied this place like half a year.</span> <span id="s383">But from thi -- I believe it was more than half a year when I first saw my mom, because when she came, I did not recognize her.</span> <span id="s384">She was alive, and because she was -- she looked like Russian, so with this name like Vera, so she survive.</span> <span id="s385">When she survived, she start looking for me.</span> <span id="s386">She start ask one, another one, you know?</span> <span id="s387">And finally she find the family where I was.</span> <span id="s388">And this family tell to them, “Listen, you know if your fa -- if your husband will come.</span> <span id="s389">You don’t know how you can survive, okay?</span> <span id="s390">And you are actually, you are not old woman, you can have kids more if your husband will come or not, you will have in your family.</span> <span id="s391">Let him stay with us.</span> <span id="s392">We will like him so mu -- much, and he fa -- he forget about you.”</span> <span id="s393">He forget his mom.</span> <span id="s394">And Mom -- Mom came to me, and someone called me.</span> <span id="s395">I remember the face of this woman that I live in the family.</span> <span id="s396">She was very, very like sa -- a very -- very worry about this moment.</span> <span id="s397">And she said, “Do you know this woman?”</span> <span id="s398">And I came, look at her, I said, “No.</span> <span id="s399">It’s -- it’s -- I don’t know this woman, she just came to take me.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t want go from here.</span> <span id="s401">I don’t want go anywhere from here.”</span> <span id="s402">And as I told you, she -- he doesn’t remember you.</span> <span id="s403">And it was time that -- actually it was for Mom was difficult even to prove that I am her son, because no documents, nothing.</span> <span id="s404">Maybe they s -- in some ways they believe maybe it’s not my mom also, but they was not happy to give me back.</span> <span id="s405">It was a sad day.</span> <span id="s406">And -- but I believe it was about -- about a year, maybe like -- that I stay in this family.</span> <span id="s407">So in a couple months my mom came back.</span> <span id="s408">And she ch -- she change her dress.</span> <span id="s409">She came in the same dress that she left, and she make her hair in the same way.</span> <span id="s410">And I took a look on her, and I said, “My mom came to pick me up.”</span> <span id="s411">So I came to kiss her, and she asks I want to st -- with their permission that I have to stay additional month, she has to prepare somethi -- somewheres to take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And this is how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s415">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: I think I asked you a question before --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: -- you had this little coughing spurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Which -- a question you couldn’t possibly actually figure out an answer to --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: -- was how would they explain this four year old boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: First of all they was not -- not so old.</span> <span id="s426">They was ma -- maybe in their 30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: And the second -- the second thing was I remember -- I know -- I don’t remember even ever play with any kids, so I think they did not let me go, they want keep me in -- in -- in house mostly.</span> <span id="s429">And well, i-it -- it -- it was dangerous because maybe if someone --</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Would see.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: -- gives them a -- give alert to the Germans, so maybe they have to explain this in some --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: -- in some way -- in some ways.</span> <span id="s434">But well, from -- from the understanding, ma -- from my understanding, they got like an excuse, they never know that it’s Jewish boy, they ne-never check it.</span> <span id="s435">Someone said it’s a boy, no he doesn’t have parents, they want them to keep him.</span> <span id="s436">So it would be like -- for them it could be like an e -- they can -- can admit it like an excuse for themself to -- if someone will question it.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s438">And do you remember staying inside most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yes, I remember I’m staying in -- stayed mo -- most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: And were you unhappy about that, or did they explain to you why?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Well, they tried to entertain me in the house.</span> <span id="s442">They got a lot toys, that I never got.</span> <span id="s443">And they tried to take care about me very, very well, because as I said like -- they guess maybe it will be their child, so I remember that well, they tried to give me -- where they got it I don’t know, but the food was very, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yeah, but as I said, it was like agriculture place, so the ground -- they got some food from the -- from the ground.</span> <span id="s446">I don’t know their occupation, I just remember that from my view they look like real European -- European couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: And they were nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: They was nice to me.</span> <span id="s449">They was very nice to me.</span> <span id="s450">They was very nice to me, but what -- as I said what happened, and when -- the second time when Mom came to -- to -- to pick up me, so it was a big difference in me now because they start to do something with me.</span> <span id="s451">Something happened inside me that I stopped eating, and they said that, “He doesn’t want to eat, I don’t know what happened to him, he -- he usually was a good eater, now he stops,” -- like he stopped eat [indecipherable] was like a half left for me what I was before, on the time when Mom came to pick up me a second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: And they didn’t want to give you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: They did not want.</span> <span id="s454">They did not want the -- and they try -- well, they not bring this case to the court or something like this, first of all, because as I said it was a situation when you was on this territor -- territory, you’re guilty.</span> <span id="s455">So -- and my mom, let’s say she got like a privileges because she was a wife for a person who fight for -- in the army, so for that it was better don’t deal with it.</span> <span id="s456">My mom said -- but as I said, when my mom said that she want me to stay a little bit longer be-before she will prepare for this, they was agree with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And when was it that you stopped eating?</span> <span id="s458">Th -- when she came the second time and said she would come back for you, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: No, when the -- when the -- when she ca -- said that she will come back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: So then you stopped eating until you were going to be with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Yeah, yeah, because I start very well -- something start inside me, and I start --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: It’s interesting because when you appear to be safe, then you seem to have an emotional reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Do you know?</span> <span id="s465">You didn’t have a reaction before, and now --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah, because before, as I said, it looked like I don’t see the changes because well, I was safe in this place.</span> <span id="s467">It was not this time when it was under the -- covered by watermelons --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: -- it was totally different situation now.</span> <span id="s470">And as I said when -- when -- when Germans left these places, so they start a -- I remember that -- well, in -- in my -- in this sheltered life, I never got the same kind of dress, of something like -- like they [indecipherable] to me, because they believe that now they are safe, they don’t have to do anything, and God gave them a child, so this is -- was the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Before your mother came, when it was finally safe --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: -- were you able to go outside, and were you playing with other kids, or you still --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: When Germans was?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: No, when the Germans left.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Yeah, when Germans left, I was -- I -- I -- I -- I wa -- I played in -- they had like as their property, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: -- it was their own or something like this, and I -- yes, I played, but mostly I played by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: It was no -- no kids my age around.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: What did you call them?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: These people?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I called them Mom and Dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Mom and Dad?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yeah, Mom and Dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did you do that from the beginning, or did they say this was just safer, to do it that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, it’s almost -- it’s almost from the beginning because when she explained me that I have to tell them that all -- everyone has to know that this is my dad, this is my mom.</span> <span id="s491">This is how I have to call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: And I start to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Do you have any idea how your mother actually found you?</span> <span id="s495">It seems almost impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, I -- I have an idea because as I said, it was not so big place.</span> <span id="s497">All these villages was around.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Around Stavropol.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Around Stavropol, around -- it was not far away from this place.</span> <span id="s500">So, and you know, when the Russians came back, so everyone who was survive around, they try to find as much as possible excuses for themself.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t know what happened to this woman who gave me to Germans.</span> <span id="s502">Maybe -- maybe as a -- she went to the prison, and she said where she went, okay?</span> <span id="s503">Maybe the peop -- the family, where I spent a few nights under the melon, maybe they wanted also have some like [indecipherable] advantages, and sh -- they reported somewhere, because Mom, for the first thing where she -- as I said, I -- as I mentioned Voencomat, so she -- she puts [indecipherable] and this way and come on, they -- it was very powerful --</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: -- powerful organization.</span> <span id="s506">So they put the question to any others places.</span> <span id="s507">And as I said, they -- they got -- in Russia it was a special -- special way to watch on you.</span> <span id="s508">So this 10 buildings assigned to such and such police worker.</span> <span id="s509">So he came and he said, “Well, you got two.</span> <span id="s510">Where you -- where you got this boy?”</span> <span id="s511">Like you said, “Where you got this boy?</span> <span id="s512">Before war you did not get it, where you got it?”</span> <span id="s513">So you had to tell them where you got it.</span> <span id="s514">And they compare all this information, finally she find me.</span> <span id="s515">It was not easy, but she find me.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: She find you.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Do you know how long it took

sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: What was Jewish about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: What was Jewish about me?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: What was Jewish about me, because I know just I am Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: That you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: And I know that m -- the fir -- well -- bay -- because when -- when you said -- in Russia when you call, you said your first name, your father’s name --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: -- and your last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: So because my father’s name was Leib, so I was Leibovich, so is no question about that I was a Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: So -- and I -- that is what I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: But you were not identifying religiously as a Jew, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And f --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: I helped my grandmom to make matzoh, sometimes I help her to go to synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: You know, to -- to do something what she want me to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: But is not because I wanted to keep this religious life.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s806">Did you think of yourself as a Ukrainian Jew, or a Russian Jew, or just Jewish?</span> <span id="s807">Do you understand, because as an amer --</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Maybe just Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: -- as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Maybe just Jewish.</span> <span id="s811">I did not seem --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Just Jewish, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: -- later -- later, when I si -- when I become older, when we met some Jewish people from different parts, from Russia, from Moscow, from Saint Petersburg, we understand this, we are different.</span> <span id="s814">And we are ti -- we are totally different because the people from -- they have different philosophy, and different way to behave themself.</span> <span id="s815">And maybe different way to survive, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s816">To -- because they -- we -- sometimes for us, to be honest with you, to understand people, was easy to understand Ukrainian people from Ukraine, than Jewish people from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: And to find out the common -- the common point or -- we -- we better understand them, the bi -- the Jewish people from -- from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s820">Okay, let’s change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">End of Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Do you know anything about the family that saved you?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: You don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: I don’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: You don’t know their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: I don’t know the name, I don’t know anything.</span> <span id="s829">I don’t know because as I said, well, it was like -- it was not -- it was -- the be -- the [indecipherable] was don’t go somewhere and tell them that we was under Germans, because it can, as I said, like be a stain on your -- in your personal -- so -- and my mom never [indecipherable] and I don’t know anything about them.</span> <span id="s830">I’m very sorry about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s832">Even though your father was in the army --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: -- it still would be a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: It would still be a problem, yeah, it still will be a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Were you ever sympathetic to the Communists?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Well I -- I was never sympathetic to them, because the -- the question is that their promise was totally not what they actually did the people.</span> <span id="s838">Let’s say they said that you have right for speech, you have freedom -- I don’t know, a lot of freedom actually, when it comes to realize these rights, you don’t have them.</span> <span id="s839">So -- and the question is, they did not left anything for you, let’s say, to think about, or to tell them let’s -- let’s to improve something, let’s do something in different ways.</span> <span id="s840">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And at what -- what age did you become -- did you realize this?</span> <span id="s842">At a young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Yeah, I realize it at -- at very young age, and the question was just what you have to do, you have to start to be like [indecipherable] resistant to this, or you have to find some way -- ways how to in future support your family, and things like this, and do anything against, let’s say, your family.</span> <span id="s844">So that is why you stay, that’s it.</span> <span id="s845">But what -- what -- about criticism, what is doing, the government, what they doing wrong, it was always in conversation in our house.</span> <span id="s846">So that is why when I -- when we -- when I got married, and we went -- got a son, so we decided that our son’s life could not be here, because he grow up in the situations that he cannot -- he cannot accept it.</span> <span id="s847">And well, when we got married -- so my wife, she -- much earlier than me she realized that for us is no room here, and we have to leave this country and find something else.</span> <span id="s848">And -- well, why I was not very support -- why I did not support where he decided, because I said, “Listen, [indecipherable] what we have now because I am working with a com -- with the company that they can tell me there are no secrets, we will be -- we will stuck between leave this one and don’t have anything else, and just don’t let us go.</span> <span id="s849">So this is why I let -- I cannot do it right now.”</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: So you were working for a --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Well, I worked --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: You were -- you were working with some other company so that you knew government secrets?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Well, they said yes, but the branch where I was, I did not have any secrets.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: And later -- later, when they decided, when they open a little bit mind, they let leave the country people who really knew much more secrets, and they did not said that you cannot.</span> <span id="s856">This is -- was just a plan, was a government plan, the plan with the government level.</span> <span id="s857">Because as I said, it’s for the history no one can explain that when they decided that they would like -- they let Jewish people to leave the country, they have to found an excuse, why Jewish?</span> <span id="s858">Why they don’t let Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: -- or Ukrainian, or someone else.</span> <span id="s861">So they make up that they g -- they support the fa -- united family, as a --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: -- you know, the family was -- and it was licenned.</span> <span id="s864">They put a paper there, they miss her [indecipherable], they have not see her from the year 1930 -- 1913, they never know her, they nev -- ni -- like next time they m-ma -- make their decision a different way, they said all sister is not a relative, something else is not a relative.</span> <span id="s865">And as a -- as -- as you know it was situation when they -- the way how they explain to the rest of the people that they want leave, let them go, because this is to Israel.</span> <span id="s866">Jewish people, they unite with someone.</span> <span id="s867">This is why old people that they won’t -- don’t like them, so they -- officially they put some documents, and they let them go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: It was like -- I think it’s -- even Solzhenitsyn they sent it like this, sent him to Israel in their time.</span> <span id="s870">But -- and that is why maybe -- maybe, if I decided that we have to do it, maybe I -- we got this -- I am not sure they will let us go, but I will -- I spent about 18 years on this factory -- on this enterprise, and -- because from this enterprise when -- wh-when we -- they did not even take your documents when they see where you worked.</span> <span id="s871">It was none, but it was excuse for them.</span> <span id="s872">So when I left it on the next month, I got another enterprise.</span> <span id="s873">It is no with military connection, so we -- we start over from this point.</span> <span id="s874">And -- bu -- it was the year 1979, and we believe that because it was like Olympic game in Moscow, maybe they -- they a little bit open the door, and maybe we will be lucky to go through this door.</span> <span id="s875">And well, they said no.</span> <span id="s876">They said no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s877">Some people they managed, I don’t know how they gave under table money to someone, they -- everything was corrupt, so maybe they find the way.</span> <span id="s878">But we did not -- we was unable to do it.</span> <span id="s879">But what we said, so it was like a legal situation, was you can do like you are on the level, not -- not fighting.</span> <span id="s880">Cause the government, every six months you can to send documents that you apply -- that you did not change your mind, you still apply.</span> <span id="s881">And they send you a postcard they know.</span> <span id="s882">Th -- they did -- the -- a division of visas permission, they said you cannot go, no, your -- your request is denied, your request is denied.</span> <span id="s883">And it -- as I said, it was when we start -- our problem was that when we start first time to do it, our son was about two year old.</span> <span id="s884">No, not two -- yeah, two year old when we start first time there.</span> <span id="s885">When he went to the final stage, he almost finish college, and even in this situation, when they play games, a open society, blah, blah, blah, they did unbelievable thing because they played games and said, you know, mom can go, you cannot go.</span> <span id="s886">Later they said you can go but your son cannot go.</span> <span id="s887">And in this time, the chief -- the chief of this department, he gave interview to some foreign newspapers and he said, “Everyone who want go, we let them go.</span> <span id="s888">We don’t keep anyone.</span> <span id="s889">There’s no one want to go.”</span> <span id="s890">And I came to him, to his office with this newspaper, and I said, “Let me ask you a que,” -- it -- in Moscow his was very, very, very hi -- high level guy, and it’s -- you know, you never know what happen to you when you come back from this -- from this office, because he was very powerful.</span> <span id="s891">So I came to him with this newspaper, I said, “May I ask you a question please?</span> <span id="s892">What does it means?</span> <span id="s893">This is an interview that you gave to this reporter.</span> <span id="s894">He did not understand you right?</span> <span id="s895">Or it’s a -- a -- a mistake in newspaper?”</span> <span id="s896">And he said to me, “No,” he said, “he understand me right, but we make a decision, not he.”</span> <span id="s897">And he said, “Your son, we cannot let your son go.”</span> <span id="s898">And it was a sp-specific system in -- in Russia that everyone -- every man, he has a gi -- duty to serve three years in the military.</span> <span id="s899">After military it’s -- besides there’s a -- the life in the military, it’s more than in prison.</span> <span id="s900">But after military they said to you, you cannot go because you know secrets, you was in military.</span> <span id="s901">And no one knows what kind of secrets and how long it lasts to keep you because you was in military.</span> <span id="s902">And my son said to me, “Listen, I better die than I go to this military.”</span> <span id="s903">And with these words, with understanding this, we have to go to this guy a few times, it was very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s904">And finally, as I said, when we were -- when the wind was a little bit warmer, and they let him go, and later we left, and in Italy, when he came to Italy, he decided he would like to help young Jewish kids to go to Judaism.</span> <span id="s905">So he got a [indecipherable] like this, he listened to -- they got like -- a rabbi came to Italy, and they tried to introduce to the culture, to the tradition the ju -- Judaism.</span> <span id="s906">And everyone was on the beach because it was months, we are not working, you got food, and they make a decision when -- when sk -- they scheduled to bring you to United States, and he was busy with kids, wi -- wi -- because he said that this is what he has to do.</span> <span id="s907">And when we came here, so very soon he said that we don’t -- we -- we not the right life -- the right life, this is a philosophy.</span> <span id="s908">And he changed his life, he become religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Religious person, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: So you, even though you tried -- you started later, really for almost 20 years you were trying to leave --</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: -- or thinking that -- so is it -- must be very difficult to live under those circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes, yes, because as I said, they -- it is become a common -- let’s say what, like refusniks -- refusniks, except the person whom they refuse give a permission to leave.</span> <span id="s915">So -- and as I said, diff -- different pe -- different category of people, they -- or by their belief or by some circumstances, they did i -- they take different actions to this, you know, they got some of them, they -- every month they go -- went to demonstration, and to the Moscow, or to foreign people.</span> <span id="s916">Most -- a lot of them, they put them in prison, they -- they make up -- a lot guilt about this, like rape, like drugs, like things like this.</span> <span id="s917">But we was like on the level that they said okay, you can -- you can -- every six months you can just send us a request, and we will refuse.</span> <span id="s918">But it was a -- a -- a mark that you are -- belong also to this category.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: And -- I don’t -- they -- every be -- maybe, I don’t know, month or two months we got someone from the police, or from the KGB, he was -- had a police uniform.</span> <span id="s921">And he said -- he make up a -- a -- any kind of excuse to come to check what we are doing, run, or -- or [indecipherable] like this.</span> <span id="s922">And -- and he reported from our phone, that , “I’m here now checking this family, everything looks -- looks not bad.”</span> <span id="s923">And once time he came to us and he said -- I said, “Why did you come to me?”</span> <span id="s924">He said, “Well, we got a letter that your neighbor is drunk.”</span> <span id="s925">I said, “Okay, why you did not go to this member -- to this -- my neighbor?</span> <span id="s926">He drunk, go to his apartment, why you came to me?”</span> <span id="s927">“No, I would like to know if you know something about it.”</span> <span id="s928">I said, “No, I don’t know anything about it.”</span> <span id="s929">“Okay, just write that you don’t know about it.”</span> <span id="s930">I said, “Look, how it help you?</span> <span id="s931">What is the reason?”</span> <span id="s932">But they mi -- make up everything, and the problem was when I -- my second job when I -- it was not a manager position, but sometimes I have taught them the director’s meetings, because I was in charge for supplies, some important things to the factory.</span> <span id="s933">And it was -- sometimes is not your fault but you cannot manage it because it’s -- it was like a circle.</span> <span id="s934">To have the supplies you have to give them something that you are unable to give them, some material and you don’t have it.</span> <span id="s935">And the -- the director said to -- on this meeting, listen, if I will not have these supplies, I will call KGB that you did it on purpose, you don’t want me to do this production and this one ki -- the government want me to do.</span> <span id="s936">And I believe they will make you bah bah bah, like this.</span> <span id="s937">And that every day was like this, and especially you can understand when our son was in Moscow, and when we still try to let him go, one days we came to -- to this chief, this department, and we ask him, “Look, what is your logical?</span> <span id="s938">Is -- from such and such here, we tried to go all together.</span> <span id="s939">So now what -- how is the family united?</span> <span id="s940">If you said -- you advise them to go and bring him invitation, later he will have relatives here, and we -- he will have permission, what is the [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s941">What is the -- what is the logic?”</span> <span id="s942">And he said to me, “Listen, the students are very patriotic people, so we cannot guarantee he will be safe in ma -- in Moscow.”</span> <span id="s943">This is -- was the life.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: When -- when you switched jobs, you left your job?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: And they knew that you are refusnik.</span> <span id="s947">Somebody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: The next job you had you were not earning as much money as you were the first time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yeah, I got maybe half what I got before.</span> <span id="s951">And the -- the guy who interview me said, “Listen, when you move from this place to our place, it means you keep in mind something.</span> <span id="s952">Tell me right away.</span> <span id="s953">You know, if you go somewhere, I will have a problem with the -- it will be problem for me.</span> <span id="s954">So in order to give you permission or not, I have to know -- tell me right away what you going to do.”</span> <span id="s955">And I said to him, “Well, I am telling you right -- right away that I did not change my mind, but because they said that I cannot leave country because I used to work on this military, I don’t know how long they will keep me here.</span> <span id="s956">Do you know what will happen to you in three years?</span> <span id="s957">You don’t know.”</span> <span id="s958">So -- and you don’t know what people it’s around in your department, you know what in their mind.</span> <span id="s959">They can make a decision tomorrow.</span> <span id="s960">So this job was not very, very -- let’s say presti -- with a prestige, with a lot money, and it was difficult, if need some special skills, and someone recommend me to this job.</span> <span id="s961">So he said okay.</span> <span id="s962">He -- he closed his eyes.</span> <span id="s963">[indecipherable] did that because when you go from the place where I work bef-before, this place was famous place, with a li -- benefits, with a lot opportunities for -- just for benefits, not about salary, but benefits was really much higher than any other company have.</span> <span id="s964">So they understand what you keep in mind, or you fired because you did something wrong, against them, and you just manage they -- they don’t put that they fire, or not.</span> <span id="s965">In United States when you find the -- try to get a job you put your resumé.</span> <span id="s966">In Russia you got a -- like a certificate, your certificate.</span> <span id="s967">Every job that you go they put a seal here, and they put the reason why you left this job.</span> <span id="s968">So -- and if they put the reason that they fire you because you are bad worker, or you late, or you drunk, or something like this, so later on it’ll na -- no one when -- will take you, and this i -- was the requirement, you have to show them the certificate.</span> <span id="s969">Without this certificate, no one talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: So what was on your certificate when you left this other place?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Nothing, that I decide by myself, and that is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Nothing.</span> <span id="s973">And were you doing mechanical engineering at this place?</span> <span id="s974">That’s what you studied in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: It was close, it was -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Close?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: -- it was a mechanical engineering field.</span> <span id="s978">I have to explain my boss in my company why I decided to leave.</span> <span id="s979">So I cannot tell -- I could not tell him that I want to go to abroad --</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: -- I just tell him that I have relatives, and -- and we in contact with them in the United States.</span> <span id="s982">So I gave then information that he knows all -- or -- or -- if not he, but special department knows it already.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: And that is why I said I would like to leave this place, and I will go.</span> <span id="s985">And he said, “Don’t worry, stay, I will manage it.”</span> <span id="s986">He said, “A couple bottle with vodka, everything will be okay, don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s987">Because my position in my previous job, it was not very, very big level, but I was like assistant to our big boss.</span> <span id="s988">He was a chief in quality control production, and it was a factory about 5,000 people.</span> <span id="s989">And my job was like statistical job, to prepare him for the meetings, for -- for reports, for something like this.</span> <span id="s990">So he was very comfortable with me because I tell him what his action, how this [indecipherable] should be, what he has to mention.</span> <span id="s991">And he doesn’t -- he did not want me actually, to leave.</span> <span id="s992">He did not want me to leave.</span> <span id="s993">And he said well, one -- one Jew -- one Jew, he can keep one Jew.</span> <span id="s994">I was just one, no one else.</span> <span id="s995">It was like under the percentage.</span> <span id="s996">And but this what -- how I explain him, I said, “Well, I am going to leave.”</span> <span id="s997">He said, “Oh, stay with us, blah, blah, blah.”</span> <span id="s998">I said no, because from this enterprise, I never leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: You never go, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: So I left, and I came to another one and they [indecipherable] they remind me very often where I come from, and what I keep in mind, because they knew that my papers every time, when I -- and the last time -- not -- it was not last time, before this -- before this time, I fill out the papers again, and -- and the director of this, he was a Jewish guy, and -- but he got a Russian name, he -- by documents he was Russian.</span> <span id="s1001">So he said to me, “Listen, because you put this documents that you want in U.S., I have to transfer you from this engineering job to ship -- to like shipping receiving, something like load and loud [indecipherable]or something.”</span> <span id="s1002">I said, “Well if you feel that it’s constitution, you can do it.</span> <span id="s1003">I’m not going to put you any -- any request about this.”</span> <span id="s1004">Well, and he decided okay, let him stay like this.</span> <span id="s1005">And this -- well, I stay like this.</span> <span id="s1006">But as I said, all pe -- a lot people who are brought for fight, who f -- f -- to give us this opportunity, they help because this one -- one -- wa -- one [indecipherable] did not come back to self.</span> <span id="s1007">So -- well, [indecipherable] Gorbachov came, and he got an idea that let’s say let’s have better relationship with -- with the west, with something else, but all people who fight hard, work hard to bring this day, to let us go, they -- peop -- we remember [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Do you think that a lot of people who were in the
