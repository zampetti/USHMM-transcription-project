that you came to Mauthausen and just take me right up to the camp the way you drove in and tell me what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">JIM CACIOPPO: On uh, the first day of the false report of the war's end, we were, I th-th-, I think at Lens, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">And I remember a wild celebration going on.</span> <span id="s6">The war is over.</span> <span id="s7">And uh, there were many of the striped uniform, uh, concentration camp people on the streets.</span> <span id="s8">And I was called in to drive a half track for major Tuthill, two radio operators, Major Tuthill and I, to follow a Russian staff car, and we took off like mad, following the Russians, and I'm not sure what day we were led to Mauthausen, and uh I remember driving up the road to the camp, there were be ex prisoners going up and down the road.</span> <span id="s9">I remember ten Australian soldiers coming up to the track and asking us for food.</span> <span id="s10">We gave them our rations, I remember them cutting their mouths trying to lick the cans out, and we gave then all the rations we had.</span> <span id="s11">Went on up the hill and parked just</span></p> <p><span

guard quarters.</span> <span id="s15">And uh, I remember the prisoners, their physical condition, so many of them that, on the ground, couldn't rise, they had to be lifted to their feet.</span> <span id="s16">A kitchen came that day or the next and food was given to them.</span> <span id="s17">Many of them died from eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">W-j-it was just too rich for them and, kitchens changed to a thin soup.</span> <span id="s19">I remember there w- I remember bodies in places, Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

to see us, so many of them, uh, I remember being taken to the gas chambers, led to the gas chambers, and uh crematoriums by prisoners, and uh, I remember a pile of weapons, rifles, pistols, and uh, I re- I remember a prisoner digging through for pistols to give to us.</span> <span id="s26">And uh, it seemed to be a big thing for him that he was, I remember two Polish men, who had been prisoners, I-I was called out probably the next morning, I was called out to guard the two Polish men and a young boy who was fourteen, fifteen years old.</span> <span id="s27">They had killed a, one of the German guards.</span> <span id="s28">And I sat out there in the sunshine with the three of them for quite a while that morning, and we were really enjoying being together.</span> <span id="s29">They asked if the boy could go get some water, and I-I remember thinking he won't come back, and he didn't, but I wasn't at any trouble.</span> <span id="s30">It was forgotten.</span> <span id="s31">I don't think anything was ever done about him.</span> <span id="s32">But I spent I think most of the morning with those there and uh, my first encounter with anything, anything like that that uh, I remember the rock quarry, rock quarry was still 100 or 200 bodies in the quarry, and I remember the engineers digging graves, and I, I don't know where, I think on the road up to the camp, they were digging three four five graves that were 100 to 150 feet long.</span> <span id="s33">I remember civilians from the surrounding villages I guess, bringing wagon loads of bodies to the graves and then placing them in the graves.</span> <span id="s34">Our army chaplains uh giving the last rites to the bodies as they were placed in there.</span> <span id="s35">I suppose we were there for... a Working
