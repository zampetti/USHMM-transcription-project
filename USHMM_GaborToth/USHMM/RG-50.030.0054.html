<p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Amsterdam in [not audible on this tape] March 1924.</span> <span id="s17">Q: What can you tell me about your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Uh my childhood was very, very nice...warm, a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s19">I had a sister...I still have her, a sister...my parents who don't live anymore.</span> <span id="s20">I had a brother, nine and a half years younger than I was at the time.</span> <span id="s21">He also isn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s22">And we had a large family, and uh I have fond, fond memories of my youth, yah.</span> <span id="s23">Wonderful memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What do you remember about your town and your family life while growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Well, the town was Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s26">I remember the street in which we lived.</span> <span id="s27">At the time it used to be in my imagination later on it used to be a big avenue (laughter).</span> <span id="s28">Later on when we came back and saw the street it was as narrow as can be.</span> <span id="s29">I believe two cars can pass (laughter) and that's it, but at the time there were not so many cars.</span> <span id="s30">There were just bicycles and it was always crowded and busy.</span> <span id="s31">It was a really through-fare, through Amsterdam, and, uh, in a predom....a predominant Jewish neighborhood; uh, so on Shabbat it would be quiet.</span> <span id="s32">It was not an orthodox neighborhood.</span> <span id="s33">Everything, everybody was mixed really.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, on Saturday there wouldn't be much traffic but I remember the huge cars from Heinekken's beer and from Van Gend en Loes with the horses that went through.</span> <span id="s35">Uh, ice trucks that delivered ice on Monday with big ice picks.</span> <span id="s36">It was an old neighborhood with all types of people, working people, uh...poor people, people some a little better off.</span> <span id="s37">My parents were very well off.</span> <span id="s38">They had a store, shoes.</span> <span id="s39">They were...my father's name was a well-known name in Amsterdam...Kattenberg.</span> <span id="s40">There's a borough, not named after him (laughter)...maybe after the borough, that I don't know; but, uh, he...they were a well-known family, yah, I might say.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: What were your friends like?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Friends were a little bit...at the time when I grew up, I wasn't allowed, for instance, to play in the street.</span> <span id="s43">A lot of other children were allowed to play in the street, but somehow my parents thought it wasn't right to have their...you know...little girl...I had a sister one and a half year older.</span> <span id="s44">He says...she says she did play in the street, you know...play...what was play at the time?</span> <span id="s45">Uh, jumping rope, uh, marbles...nothing special but I remember maybe they regarded me too small.</span> <span id="s46">It wasn't allowed, and I wanted to become a nurse, so I rather played with dolls anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What was the memory that you remember most from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, I was sixteen when I practically saw my parents for the last time, my house for the last time.</span> <span id="s49">My childhood... loving care...just beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And what was the Jewish feeling like in the town when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: The Jewish feeling?</span> <span id="s52">Well, you grew up as a Jew and that was the only thing there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">There was uh...there was no choice.</span> <span id="s54">There was no...at least for me, in my family, there was no other thing.</span> <span id="s55">Just being Jewish and living according to the Jewish laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: While you were growing up was there any antisemitism in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Not that I know of, but I can remember one childhood experience.</span> <span id="s58">I don't know how old I was...maybe I was eight or nine and, uh, maybe I had an argument with a child or the child with me and the child called out, "Lousy Jew!"</span> <span id="s59">You know.</span> <span id="s60">I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s61">I never had heard such a thing, so I said, "Lousy Christian!"</span> <span id="s62">I didn't even know (laughter) what it meant, you know.</span> <span id="s63">That was just child's, uh...that was the only experience I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Could you please tell us the names of your parents, your brothers and sisters and any aunts and uncles, cousins, who lived nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Oh, that's quite a lot.</span> <span id="s66">My father's name was Jonas Kattenberg.</span> <span id="s67">My mother was Berthe Kattenberg-Rueff.</span> <span id="s68">She came from Switzerland, as well as all her sisters who had married Dutch hus...uh, husbands.</span> <span id="s69">And my grandfather, Samuel Kattenberg, lived in our house on the first floor.</span> <span id="s70">We lived on the second and the third, and then there was his daughter across the street, Bella Kattenberg, her son...because she was divorced and she took her own name back; and there was another brother of my father's, Saul Kattenberg, with his wife and two children.</span> <span id="s71">Uh, then there were in the nei...in the....a little bit further out of the neighborhood we had, uh, also relatives...the sisters of my mother who married Dutch people, with their children, one of whom still is alive and another one married a cousin, but they are, uh, seventy-eight and the other one is in their eighties, and we get along still fantastically.</span> <span id="s72">It's like...like our...we are like sisters, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What was a typical day like for you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Uh, I recall...I don't know why, but I, I recall, uh, when I went to kindergarten and I always see the same picture, you know: my mother taking me to kindergarten.</span> <span id="s75">That was down, uh, some steps.</span> <span id="s76">You were delivered to somebody, you know, and you played there until they picked you up; and then we came home and I got chocolate milk.</span> <span id="s77">That I will always remember, you know.</span> <span id="s78">I don't know for what reason, but chocolate milk...that was when we (laughter] got home.</span> <span id="s79">A little later I started studying the piano.</span> <span id="s80">My mother would call at the moment I rang the bell, "It is time to practice!"</span> <span id="s81">You know.</span> <span id="s82">After a while I hated it (laughter) terribly and I gave it up.</span> <span id="s83">Later on, I got back.</span> <span id="s84">But, uh, as a child...yah...what do you experience as a child?</span> <span id="s85">Then later on I went to elementary school, from eleme...in the neighborhood... from elementary school I went to, uh, junior high which was a little bit further out.</span> <span id="s86">You had to take a bicycle.</span> <span id="s87">It was near the Vondelpark.</span> <span id="s88">No.</span> <span id="s89">That was near the Mauritskade, on the Mauritskade.</span> <span id="s90">And, uh, that was...oh, we had a good time there as kids and you felt a little bit freedom because you could ride from school to home, to your house and vice versa, and sure it was a little bit freedom because at home was home, and you had to played the game that was, uh, set by the parents, heh?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: In the years prior to the Dutch...to the German invasion of Holland in 1940, what was the Jewish feeling like in the town then?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I don't remember before.</span> <span id="s93">Of course, I remember...I was still very young...uh the time that Hitler came in power, into power.</span> <span id="s94">I remember friends of my parents who had experienced already, '33, '34, and fled Germany...coming to my parents and saying, uh, "Get out of here.</span> <span id="s95">Pick up everything.</span> <span id="s96">Come along with us.</span> <span id="s97">We are going to England."</span> <span id="s98">But my mother used to say, "Here, Holland, is such a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s99">There's such freedom.</span> <span id="s100">Nothing will ever happen here."</span> <span id="s101">So when 1940 came, I was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s102">I..</span> <span id="s103">.</span> <span id="s104">as I said, my mother came from there.</span> <span id="s105">She came from, uh, Saint Louis, the Alsace, and had family living...still brothers...in Basle [Basel, Switzerland] and I was going to visit one of them with another two cousins of mine, at the time a little bit older.</span> <span id="s106">That was in '39, and I was fifteen, and we went on the train and we stayed there with my aunt and uncle, had a wonderful time, until one night my parents called.</span> <span id="s107">That must have been September.</span> <span id="s108">At that time...September '39...at that time, uh, the military were mobilized here, mobilization, as they say; and my parents told us to get back the next day, soonest, uh, opportunity...get back to Holland.</span> <span id="s109">I don't know whether my aunt and uncle told them, "Come here," because that I don't know.</span> <span id="s110">I don't recall that.</span> <span id="s111">I don't remember that.</span> <span id="s112">But I went...we went back.</span> <span id="s113">The three of us went back.</span> <span id="s114">Well, then later on I survived.</span> <span id="s115">The other two didn't.</span> <span id="s116">But, uh, people didn't believe it would be so bad and it would...Holland was a stronghold, a democratic stronghold...nothing would happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">That was the overall opinion of most people.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What happened in 1940, after the Germans invaded Holland, to you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: That was a total surprise.</span> <span id="s120">And, uh, I remember that at first we walked in the street.</span> <span id="s121">We looked at the planes.</span> <span id="s122">Nobody actually understood what was happening.</span> <span id="s123">The reality came soon enough; and, uh, then fear started slipping in then, and eating at everybody.</span> <span id="s124">Uh the fear of the unknown, the fear what would happen and stories that had been told by Germans that had left Germany, uh, but people still hoped for the best.</span> <span id="s125">They were Dutch Jews and they were...nothing would happen to the Dutch Jews and this only could happen in Germany but never here.</span> <span id="s126">That still persisted...that that overall feeling of here we will be OK.</span> <span id="s127">And, uh, I remember, uh, a bomb fell in Amsterdam because Rotterdam was bombed, and I think one stray bomb fell in Amsterdam and people were sitting in their cellars and their, uh...cellars...there were no cellars.</span> <span id="s128">Maybe, yes, some houses had cellars but they were hiding and trying to get away from windows and they didn't want to be seen; and there was fear.</span> <span id="s129">I remember we all slept together on one floor...my father, my mother, my brother, my sister.</span> <span id="s130">Uh, we had a girl who did the home-work [the housework], a maid...sleeping-in maid...and we had somebody else who tended the store, and, uh, she also had a room in the house, so we all were down on the floor and, uh, it was...it was a very fearful something, because you felt the fear from your parents and, uh, yah...it was a very unpleasant, unsettling, fearful time.</span> <span id="s131">Of course, the Germans, the uniforms.</span> <span id="s132">Now I don't know exactly the date, but shortly after, things seemed to normalize and then the Germans had folders, big huge folders put on the walls in the Jewish neighborhoods that, uh, the Dutch Jews, they could sleep at ease.</span> <span id="s133">They could be at ease, because they were Dutch Jews and nothing would happen to them.</span> <span id="s134">They didn't have to fear the Germans.</span> <span id="s135">They would be regarded as the Dutch, and, uh, so they could all go and tend to their own business as usual.</span> <span id="s136">Well, a sigh of relief for everybody.</span> <span id="s137">I mean, as a child I wasn't so interested in politics; but the overall fear that had taken...yah, that crept under your skin, that did did...it never left you, and...but you became...adjusted.</span> <span id="s138">You adjusted to the circumstances and for a while life seemed to go on as usual.</span> <span id="s139">Then, after awhile, they played it so smart...so I don't know...I don't have the words for it...they played it in a way that everybody believed what was being told and was being printed and being said....</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Who played it?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s142">Uh, the Jews were not allowed anymore on the trams, not in public buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">They were kept away from this.</span> <span id="s144">They had to stay home at certain hours.</span> <span id="s145">They...then they had...non-Jews were not allowed anymore to stay with Jewish people...Jewish people were not allowed to visit non-Jews...a separation became as a wake, suddenly, between the people who were your friends and people you had lived with all...all those years.</span> <span id="s146">And it went from one thing to another and finally people...I, I forget to tell that right after the invasion, a lot of people had tried to escape.</span> <span id="s147">For instance, in the first days after 1940, after the May occupation, I know, for instance, my parents also tried to escape.</span> <span id="s148">I go back now to a few days after May 10th, uh...because the, the images come up and they don't come in...you know...in order.</span> <span id="s149">Flies back and forth there.</span> <span id="s150">But, uh, my parents, too, ...they tried to escape with friends.</span> <span id="s151">They had to wait because the friends were coming and they...believe it or not they came with valises full of clothes.</span> <span id="s152">Because...you know...nobody understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s153">They thought they could take a taxi and they could drive to the Hook of Holland, to Ljmuiden, and take a boat and go to England.</span> <span id="s154">But then by the time my parents and they got a..</span> <span id="s155">.</span> <span id="s156">I don't know, a cab or a car or whatever it was, it was some kind of a car.</span> <span id="s157">Uh, we all were piled in and we drove but soon the car couldn't go any...anywhere.</span> <span id="s158">Nobody could get through, and the few people that got away in Ljmuiden, they were just the lucky ones, if they made it to England, and the rest had to go back.</span> <span id="s159">So there was a try, there was....</span> <span id="s160">People tried to escape then, but later on they adapted to the rules and, uh, they hoped for the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Did you or any of your family members try to leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: At that moment...afterwards, no.</span> <span id="s163">No.</span> <span id="s164">Only at that moment, at that time when most people tried to escape, but afterwards there was no opportunity, there was no way out because, uh, very soon borders were closed and, uh, no...it was very dangerous and a parent didn't want to endanger his children.</span> <span id="s165">Uh, parents had parents too, older people they didn't want to leave.</span> <span id="s166">It was...it is an involved thing to leave.</span> <span id="s167">To get up and leave is a terrible thing, because you have to be thinking only of you, your children and maybe if your parents can go, but you cannot take the whole family.</span> <span id="s168">It...it breaks you in in two pieces.</span> <span id="s169">It's terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What was the feeling like in the community after the Queen fled the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Despair.</span> <span id="s172">Hope that the Queen would survive and that the Queen could do something and that the Queen would take care of us all.</span> <span id="s173">But it meant...well, it meant..."My gosh, she left!"</span> <span id="s174">You know.</span> <span id="s175">That was unheard of...terrible!</span> <span id="s176">Not that she left, but understood because the Queen was a symbol of uh beauty, honesty.</span> <span id="s177">Uh, the Queen was looked upon as a wonderful, wonderful person, the whole family.</span> <span id="s178">I think most of the Jews were very royal-minded, at least in my, uh, surrounding, you know, so when she left it was quite a shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: After the Germans had invaded and the anti-Jewish laws were put into effect, what did the Nazis do to the townspeople?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: It took awhile before they started, uh, getting at persons, you know.</span> <span id="s181">They had laws.</span> <span id="s182">You were not allowed to do this.</span> <span id="s183">You were not allowed to do that.</span> <span id="s184">You were not allowed to buy here, to go to a store, to have non-Jews, to be with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s185">Uh, I don't know at what time...I couldn't pinpoint the date when they said, uh, businesses had to be taken care of by...they called it "Verwaltung" [Translation: "administration"] at the time.</span> <span id="s186">That was somebody, they set in place of the owner, of the director of the business so the, the director or owner had to get out and they put somebody else in place, and a lot of people...I know my father did...he had a big...yah business, import/export shoes and wholesale and he also in stores...uh, I know my father got in touch with, uh, one of the manufacturers of shoes who had become a close friend through the years and talked with him, a man he could trust, and this man recommended his own bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s187">He gave my father his own bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s188">At the time they lived in Deurne, in North Brabant.</span> <span id="s189">It was quite a distance away, and he actually gave this man out of the goodness of his heart--with the consent of the man, of course, and his family because they had to move to Amsterdam--and he conducted the business from then on, and my father trusted this man implicitly.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Was this man Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes, he was Christian.</span> <span id="s192">Only Christians could do this.</span> <span id="s193">No Jews were allowed to uh conduct somebody else's Jewish business, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So he ran the business for your father?</span> <span id="s195">A: He ran the business for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: What was the reaction and the response of the townspeople of Amsterdam to everything that was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Fear, because by now it was clear that the intentions were not so good.</span> <span id="s198">Uh, I remember '41, the razzia.</span> <span id="s199">That was the first one in June '41.</span> <span id="s200">Uh, when a cousin of mine--the one I had been with to Switzerland--was picked up from the street because at that time it seemed that a German had been shot and I think that was the reason, the reason for the razzia.</span> <span id="s201">They picked up a number of Jewish young men from the streets, and sent them to uh...yah...what was the name of the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s202">...uh, it comes to my mind later on....</span> <span id="s203">I can, I can say it every day and every minute of the day and of the night, but just now it...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span> <span id="s206">No.</span> <span id="s207">They went right through to...later on we got notice that there he was shot trying to escape.</span> <span id="s208">My husband has a certificate of somebody else in his family...that's what they did, you know.</span> <span id="s209">They they they took them.</span> <span id="s210">They they tortured them.</span> <span id="s211">They put them in horrible camps and they...then they sent a notification to the parents: uh, "Your son has been shot because he tried to escape."</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Was the concentration camp in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No.</span> <span id="s214">No.</span> <span id="s215">No.</span> <span id="s216">In Poland....I will...later on I will fill in the name.</span> <span id="s217">I just cannot, uh, think of it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What did the Nazis do to you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Uh...what did they do to...you skip a long while...then we come now to 1943.</span> <span id="s220">I, meanwhile, ...I told you I wanted to become a nurse and as I was too young to become a a..</span> <span id="s221">.</span> <span id="s222">to to get the training for a nurse; as usual then, girls often got the training in children's care.</span> <span id="s223">I went to the Creche.</span> <span id="s224">The Creche was an existing, uh, institution in the Middenlaan [it was called the Plantage Middenlaan] in Amsterdam, and the Directrice was Henrietta Pimentel, and she had been there already since 1926 or '28, something like that...a long time.</span> <span id="s225">She was at that time already in her fifties...to me an old lady.</span> <span id="s226">But, uh, I was registered there and could start with this course, with other young girls my age.</span> <span id="s227">I was, I think, eighteen then.</span> <span id="s228">I had finished high school, and, uh, '43 I became an intern there.</span> <span id="s229">At home was very heavy, very...yah, it was terrible really, because they picked up people from everywhere...in the street.</span> <span id="s230">They had small razzias, big razzias; because we skipped that time.</span> <span id="s231">We went from '41 to '43, and, uh, people had to take, uh, to buy rucksacks, backnaps [NB: backpacks or knapsacks], and put a name in it and and name everything they had to take along.</span> <span id="s232">They got lists what they had to take along, because they were going to a camp to work and to, uh...they had to bring their own clothes, all things well-known by now; so my par...my father bought them and bought, uh, backnaps and he bought, uh, clothes and my mother sewed the tapes and we each had one; and it was already there all the time, as for all Jews, not only for us.</span> <span id="s233">And, uh, my mother was very scared.</span> <span id="s234">She was so scared.</span> <span id="s235">She wasn't fit to do anything.</span> <span id="s236">She couldn't anymore.</span> <span id="s237">She was just sitting there, and sitting, and I think she was...the fear had taken hold of her and she couldn't do anything but just sit and would fear the bell and would fear the call that her children would be called, that her children would be taken away from her; and I..</span> <span id="s238">.</span> <span id="s239">my father was a strong man and he said, "What God will..." He was not...he was orthodox but he was not what you can consider today orthodox orthodox.</span> <span id="s240">He was a religious man, and he kept us...he kept telling us, "Whatever happens to you, keep your mind strong.</span> <span id="s241">Your body can, uh, uh...withstand a lot...hunger, even a beating, but keep your mind strong because your mind will carry you through and try to believe that there is somebody, that there is a God who will get you through this, and when we get back, and we will all get back...." He was so strong in his con...yeah, later on he was...later on I talked to him.</span> <span id="s242">He was not...he knew, but at that time he was so convinced that we would all get through, you know.</span> <span id="s243">He was a strong man.</span> <span id="s244">A very, very nice man.</span> <span id="s245">Loved by everybody, and he even tried for us to escape.</span> <span id="s246">Yes, we tried.</span> <span id="s247">Maybe in '42 it was.</span> <span id="s248">Oh my gosh, how I jump back and forth.</span> <span id="s249">Do you mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: In '42, my sister, uh, she had a friend she got engaged to and married later on; and, thank God, they are still alive.</span> <span id="s252">Uh, he told her, "Let's get into hiding."</span> <span id="s253">So my parents didn't want to because to break up the family, the daughter to get away, you know..."Let's be together."</span> <span id="s254">But my sister insisted, "And you better, you better Mom, you go also, go in hiding.</span> <span id="s255">Try to find somebody.</span> <span id="s256">Get away.</span> <span id="s257">Sieny, you too."</span> <span id="s258">I wouldn't want to get away from my parents, and she, [Yetty (ph)] went with her...and my parents, after a while they thought it was very wise for her to go, and then they really helped her and assisted her and said, "Yes, do it," you know.</span> <span id="s259">"Let's try."</span> <span id="s260">So she went into hiding.</span> <span id="s261">Uh, she went to an address...the address was Rusland, "Russia," near the Königsberg Hall in a room next to a paper factory or something what was there; and, uh, there she stayed and her fiancé went every day, went over there.</span> <span id="s262">He had a place not too far away from her because at that time you couldn't stay together.</span> <span id="s263">That wasn't being done.</span> <span id="s264">That wasn't...it was unheard of, so later on they did...they stayed together later on.</span> <span id="s265">They had a heck of a horrible time, but later on...so [Yetty (ph)] left.</span> <span id="s266">My sister's name is [Yetty (ph)].</span> <span id="s267">And I..</span> <span id="s268">.</span> <span id="s269">in '42, the Directrice, Miss Pimentel, she wanted me me...she wanted three girls.</span> <span id="s270">Sieny Kattenberg, Betty [Hausmit (ph)]...no, Betty [Oudgekirk (ph)] it was at the time, and [Bonnie Philips (ph)].</span> <span id="s271">There were three girls.</span> <span id="s272">Because in every class...you have some outstanding people.</span> <span id="s273">I wouldn't say because of of intellect, but because they are just their personality or they have something... and she picked us, and she made me head of a department because children started coming in.</span> <span id="s274">Meanwhile, people from the razzias were being brought to the Schouwburg and the Germans didn't want the noise of the children and they couldn't, uh...it was a horrible situation there.</span> <span id="s275">It was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: The "Schouwburg" is?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: The Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s278">You have heard of that?</span> <span id="s279">Q: Could you tell us what the Schouwburg was?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: The Schouwburg was the Hollandse Schouwburg, the Dutch theater.</span> <span id="s281">That was a theater where opera, operettas were performed; also theater, and, uh, it was a well-known theater at the time in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s282">It was right opposite the Creche, so I don't know how come the Germans decided to take this Schouwburg to bring the Jews to, to gather them and from that point on they went to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s283">I don't know what, whatever the reason was.</span> <span id="s284">The only reason being maybe it was still part of the Jewish neighborhood, not completely but still, so once the parents came in there with the children, the children were taken to the Creche, in the beginning by the parents.</span> <span id="s285">But the Germans put a stop to that.</span> <span id="s286">Very soon, parents were not allowed to leave the Schouwburg anymore.</span> <span id="s287">The children had to be taken there by people from the Creche who wore an armband and who were marked and who had special permission to do so and the three of us were designated to do so, and, uh, that is where the most horrible time of my life started.</span> <span id="s288">Also the most important time of my life, because my life is divided between before then and after then.</span> <span id="s289">Now, uh, you ask....</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Was it legal for you to take the children?</span> <span id="s291">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: From the Schouwburg to the Creche?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yes, yes it was because as I just said I had a band, so we were...that meant we were...the three of us were the only ones, at the time, to take children, pick them up in the Schouwburg, bring them to the Creche and later on return them to the parents or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Could you tell me about your work in the Creche?</span> <span id="s295">A: Work in the Creche...that started in....</span></p> <p><span id="s296">TAPE #2 PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Would you tell us about your life in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: In 1941, uh...1940...the days dragged on.</span> <span id="s299">In 1941, uh, the restrictions became worse.</span> <span id="s300">I remember my grandfather passed away at home and he was buried by boat.</span> <span id="s301">They took him by boat because they were not allowed to take out cars or anything.</span> <span id="s302">It is very vague what I remember.</span> <span id="s303">Uh, as a as a girl I wasn't... certainly not allowed to go along to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s304">Uh, no women did anyhow, but then there were only few men who were allowed to go with the corpse and, uh, I remember the story that they went by boat because they were not allowed to take a car out.</span> <span id="s305">Uh, people were scared.</span> <span id="s306">I started working...I finished, uh, school and got into the Creche where I started taking...the, the Creche, where I started taking the course, and by the end of that, uh, the situation had changed so much that, uh, the Directrice, Miss Pimentel, thought it necessary to have three girls staying there...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: When you said by the end of that, by the end of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: By the end, uh...that was '42...beginning '42.</span> <span id="s309">Uh, when the...when I had done the exam, taken the ex...exam and that meant I was now...I had a degree...you can't call it a degree, but children's care.</span> <span id="s310">So, uh, as I said, three girls were staying there permanently; but before that, I forget...there was a nasty incident, because my sister was in hiding and my father got in touch with somebody who told him he could take his daughters and bring them over the border and would take care that they would come in, uh, with the "Maquis" or under...underground organization and to get them away.</span> <span id="s311">That would cost three thousand guilders a child, and my father took care that the money was there, because he had money hidden because they had to give in all the money to Lipmann and Rosenthal,to the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">They had to...silver or whatever they had...radios, bicycles, whatever...they had to, uh, deliver at a certain point.</span> <span id="s313">That was all German property from now on, but he kept hidden money, some money, and he gave this to this man to take care of us.</span> <span id="s314">The man didn't dare to take me because I was raven black, my hair was; so I had to be...I had to go to a beauty parlor and have my hair done, and that was done in the evening.</span> <span id="s315">And it so happened he took me to an, an NSBer.An NSBer was...was somebody who was on the wrong side of the...of 1 Lipmann, Rosenthal &amp; Company was an organization used by the Germans for the express purpose of milking the Jews.</span> <span id="s316">According to Law No. 148/1941, which was passed in December 1941, Jewish financial assets--cash, checks, bank deposit, etc.--were to be transferred to, and managed by Lipmann-Rosenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">2 A member of the Nationaal Socialistische Bewegung (NSB), a Dutch Nazi movement founded in 1931 by Anton Adriaan Mussert.</span> <span id="s318">Antisemitic and pro-German, the members of the NSB collaborated closely with the German occupation regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">decency, he was a pro-German.</span> <span id="s320">Nothing was said.</span> <span id="s321">He must have paid him quite a lot of money but when I was sitting in front of the mirror I saw my hair getting from from black to red, from red to yellow-orange.</span> <span id="s322">It was...finally it was orange.</span> <span id="s323">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s324">I was in shock, but it had to be done because the man wouldn't take me otherwise, so, uh, we went the next day and we walked and as we walked on the Gelderskade ...from my house, I lived the Nieuwe Hoogstraat ...that is not far away from the Dam ...as we walked on the Gelderskade toward Centraal Station, a man came over and and he saw my sister and my...we were both was together and he said, "Don't go further.</span> <span id="s325">Don't go further, because they are trying to trick you; because over there is an "overvalle wagen" [a type of emergency police vehicle], a big German truck, and the man who your parents probably gave money to, he is in cahoots with them."</span> <span id="s326">So we ran like crazy and I don't remember anything of my sister, anything, anything at all, but I remember I came home.</span> <span id="s327">I rang the bell and I fell in my father's arms and he cried so terribly.</span> <span id="s328">You...you know, that broke my heart because to see your father cry...so there I was again the next day back to the beauty par...to another beauty parlor, had my hair done black, then back...went to the Creche and, uh, maybe I wasn't ready with the course yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Maybe I hadn't taken my exam at the time.</span> <span id="s330">But by the end of '41 I stayed in the Creche because that is when the the Directrice asked us three, which I told already, to come there.</span> <span id="s331">Another incident while I was there, so I didn't sleep at home anymore...my little brother who was then at the time eight and a half...he came to the Creche and he walked through the barriers because there were bridges in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s332">Amsterdam is a city with canals.</span> <span id="s333">As most people know is bridges, and the Germans had a habit of raising the bridges, certainly when there was a razzia, and closing them off at eight o'clock because nobody was allowed after eight to be in the streets, so this little guy, when he...when he could, he tried to...being a young little boy, he wanted to show that he would get through and all of us, we would be scared to death and I scolded him, you know.</span> <span id="s334">"Don't do it!"</span> <span id="s335">And, "Why did you do it?"</span> <span id="s336">And, "Don't you know what you are doing to Dad and Mom?"</span> <span id="s337">And, you know.</span> <span id="s338">And then afterwards, shortly afterwards, he was taken.</span> <span id="s339">I often...oh, I often told myself, you know, why had I scolded him?</span> <span id="s340">Why I..</span> <span id="s341">.</span> <span id="s342">why did I do that?</span> <span id="s343">Why?</span> <span id="s344">You know...memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: When was he taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: He was taken May 26th, 1943--with my parents.</span> <span id="s347">In '40...after '42, times were horrible.</span> <span id="s348">Times were very intensive, and as I said I was in the Creche and then the, uh, razzias started taking people from the streets, bringing in people from hiding.</span> <span id="s349">Everybody went to the Schouwburg as we said before, and that is when the ordeal started with the Creche and the Schouwburg where there were three transports during the week.</span> <span id="s350">Now I don't recall exactly what evening.</span> <span id="s351">There was one Friday night.</span> <span id="s352">There was probably one Monday night, Tuesday or Wednesday...I don't recall the evenings.</span> <span id="s353">That meant that the children who were given to the Creche to taken care...to be taken care of, to be loved by everyone, they went on transport, transport...those...during those nights, and that was terrible, the way it went.</span> <span id="s354">You see, the Creche was meant for children of parents who worked during the day.</span> <span id="s355">They used to come there at eight o'clock, seven-thirty, between seven-thirty and eight o'clock in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">The parents delivered them, mother usually, and then they got clean clothes and they got breakfast and we played with them.</span> <span id="s357">In the afternoon they got a meal.</span> <span id="s358">They rested.</span> <span id="s359">They were there till five, five-thirty I believe.</span> <span id="s360">When the mother was through with work, she came and picked up the child.</span> <span id="s361">Now an influx of new children came there, that were taken away from their parents.</span> <span id="s362">The Creche was changed then.</span> <span id="s363">It used to have...imagine a building...you enter...there's a big hall.</span> <span id="s364">Where you enter is a big door.</span> <span id="s365">Next door, next to that big door is a smaller door with a smaller hallway.</span> <span id="s366">That is the place where the children were given to us in the morning by the parents when they went off to work.</span> <span id="s367">The big doors, they were usually not even opened.</span> <span id="s368">Every...the whole traffic went through there.</span> <span id="s369">Now let's get back to the big door.</span> <span id="s370">On the right hand side when you come in, there's a door.</span> <span id="s371">That's where the Directrice, Miss Pimentel lived.</span> <span id="s372">The following door on that hall to the right is a dining room for the personnel.</span> <span id="s373">On the left hand side, there was a small room where the babies used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Mothers had babies too, and the babies came there too during the day, so from any time after birth till they were about a year old, they were in that room, in the wicker baskets, in the little beds, and they were very well taken care of.</span> <span id="s375">Next to that baby room, on the left-hand side, was a huge kitchen.</span> <span id="s376">In my mind, huge then, you know.</span> <span id="s377">Uh, then when you go a little bit through the hall, there was a large room but that was where the diapers were washed, because we didn't only take care of the children.</span> <span id="s378">We also had to wash their clothes, at least their, the diapers and the the underwear, etc.</span> <span id="s379">It was a heck of a smell always (laughter), it was terrible.</span> <span id="s380">And we didn't look forward to have, to have "corvée," as it was called.</span> <span id="s381">There was a big staircase going upstairs, with a balcony.</span> <span id="s382">There was to the left, if I remember correctly, a room, a right room and the room to the street must have been up front, a huge big room.</span> <span id="s383">Uh, at the original time it was used for...we had baby little, little, yah, cots standing there, because the kids would sleep during the day.</span> <span id="s384">But now it was converted to a real dormitory.</span> <span id="s385">Cots, little beds, everything that could hold a child would stand there.</span> <span id="s386">The big huge room in the up front, was then used for the age from about the time they were born 'til four or five, and the bigger children would be in another room.</span> <span id="s387">I had, uh, charge of children from zero till four or five years old.</span> <span id="s388">I was in charge of them.</span> <span id="s389">The baby room was moved upstairs because the baby room now became an office where Mr. Süskind, who was working in the Schouwburg, who was in charge of all the registration of all people who came in there, so he had a room in the Schouwburg; and the Directrice converted [NB: conversed] with him--secretly always--in that baby room.</span> <span id="s390">Am I clear?</span> <span id="s391">Yah?</span> <span id="s392">Uh, by '42, not too many children came in but we knew we could count on many more because there were transports but not as regular yet as it would be by the end of '42, middle of '42, '43.</span> <span id="s393">Then really the whole Jewish population was taken away, and they needed every...every centimeter of space they had to put up the children and to put up the people there.</span> <span id="s394">So, they came.</span> <span id="s395">Uh, let me start a day during occupation, during razzias.</span> <span id="s396">They came by tram from the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Who came by tram?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: The...the Jewish people that were picked up in razzias.</span> <span id="s399">The bridges were going up.</span> <span id="s400">The Germans came in the district.</span> <span id="s401">They combed every house.</span> <span id="s402">They first with the big, uh, things... with the how do you call them?</span> <span id="s403">I forgot...where you...where you can call through [megaphones].</span> <span id="s404">I forgot the name for that thing.</span> <span id="s405">Not in Dutch nor English I know.</span> <span id="s406">Uh, they screamed in the streets for people have to come down and old people, young people, men, women, children...everybody had to get down in the streets.</span> <span id="s407">There would be big trucks, huge trucks to pick them up.</span> <span id="s408">They were beaten into the trucks...trucks.</span> <span id="s409">Uh, I saw that...I have seen personally that they threw older...an older neighbor of mine, all the way down from the staircase because he didn't want to come down, and, uh, that was only once.</span> <span id="s410">Then once I was in the Creche, I wasn't in the city anymore.</span> <span id="s411">I was there.</span> <span id="s412">Maybe lucky, I don't know, because the day my parents were taken away from their home with my brother and the whole family- -May 26th, 1943--I was not home.</span> <span id="s413">I was in the Creche.</span> <span id="s414">I was there day and night.</span> <span id="s415">(Cough) So, uh, the children, the parents, they came in the tram, were pushed out of the trams.</span> <span id="s416">They were standing in front and then in the hall of the Schouwburg and they were registered by people there from the Joodse Raad.</span> <span id="s417">The Germans were there standing guard and they were just seeing to it that everything went correctly, that they were registered correctly by name, by number.</span> <span id="s418">So what they tried to do there, they tried not to register children.</span> <span id="s419">They tried if possible, if they could, they tried, uh, a family with four children...uh, mama, papa, child.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: This is the Jewish Council, or the Joodse Raad?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s422">They would try, if possible.</span> <span id="s423">And that was mainly the intent of Mr. Walter Süsskind, with some other people too, because nobody worked alone, nor in the Creche nor in the Schouwburg nor in the underground.</span> <span id="s424">It was all a combined effort.</span> <span id="s425">At...in the beginning, nobody knew what he was doing, just, uh, trying to save, uh, relative, an acquaintance, somebody.</span> <span id="s426">But very soon it became a joint effort to try to save as many as you could in the Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s427">So, as I said before, the people in the Schouwburg, they were crowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Imagine...I don't know how big the theater was...maybe two hundred people at the time...that would have been a big theater I suppose at the time.</span> <span id="s429">Many hundreds were sent in there.</span> <span id="s430">No beds.</span> <span id="s431">No nothing.</span> <span id="s432">They were just sitting on very uncomfortable chairs.</span> <span id="s433">Uh, there must have been two, maybe three, maybe one...I don't know...toilets.</span> <span id="s434">How was that, uh, sixty, seventy years ago when they built the theater?</span> <span id="s435">Maybe there was one toilet, so you can imagine what went on there.</span> <span id="s436">And, uh, so the Germans decided, "All the children, out" And that's where the Creche came in.</span> <span id="s437">We...after awhile, we--the three girls--got orders from our Directrice who was always in touch with this Mr. Süsskind.</span> <span id="s438">She sent us to get the children from there and bring them to the Creche.</span> <span id="s439">Now we all had...the three of us were all in charge of a group, so we all had a number of girls working with us, and something I regret for the rest of my life is--and my husband knows because he became involved there, too--uh, I had a book with every name of every child, when it came in, who the parents were, when it was born, and when it left.</span> <span id="s440">On the last day of the Creche, we left--that's another story--and I couldn't take it with me because that was too dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: How did you avoid this entire time being deported yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Uh, there was no question of avoiding.</span> <span id="s443">Since we were....</span> <span id="s444">the Directrice was supposed to be there...</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: She was Jewish.</span> <span id="s447">She was necessary there.</span> <span id="s448">The three of us were necessary there.</span> <span id="s449">The other girls that worked there were necessary there.</span> <span id="s450">However, I have here with me a picture of the Directrice with the, as was called, the "Onderdirectrice" [assistant director], the director.</span> <span id="s451">She was a non-Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s452">She had to leave the premises I believe already in the beginning of 1941 because she was non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s453">So we were all Jewish there, and the Germans would say, "We have...we need some" ...through the Joodse Raad, I suppose..."We need so many people there, and this person, this person, this person...they are necessary because you can't leave those children alone," so there was no doubt for me that I would stay on.</span> <span id="s454">So was the Directrice.</span> <span id="s455">So were the others.</span> <span id="s456">Now we discussed once in a while, what if something, ...heh?</span> <span id="s457">But we dismissed it from our minds.</span> <span id="s458">We were busy.</span> <span id="s459">We were young.</span> <span id="s460">We didn't think the worst.</span> <span id="s461">We...it it ...now I can honestly say that the big tragedy didn't even penetrate at the time because the people went out to the camps to work.</span> <span id="s462">Who could imagine what was intended for them.</span> <span id="s463">Who could imagine?</span> <span id="s464">Nobody.</span> <span id="s465">So, uh, we just hoped that everybody would come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Now this entire time, what did you know of your family, your parents and... A: My parents were....</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Your sister and brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: My, my sister was in hiding.</span> <span id="s469">I didn't know anything about her.</span> <span id="s470">My parents were taken away on the 26th of May with my brother...</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: In 194....3?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Three...and I saw them because I saw them in the tram as they...as they drove...they were not even in the Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s473">They went directly to the Poldeweg or where ever station... whatever station.</span> <span id="s474">They were going straight to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: How did you find out that they had been taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Because, uh, we found out the same day because other people were brought in and I don't know where the choice was made...this one goes through and that one doesn't go through and this one goes in the Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s477">My parents never made it to the Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s478">They went through, and uh...yeah that was known so fast because that is such an operation.</span> <span id="s479">All the bridges go up.</span> <span id="s480">Nobody comes through.</span> <span id="s481">Not a gentile, not a Jew, nothing, nobody.</span> <span id="s482">So that was known, I think, the same half hour that it started, and messages someway always slip through, come through, and in the Schouwburg they must have known, because they must have been told by the Germans that they could expect many children, many people, many everything.</span> <span id="s483">You asked me something I really, uh, never thought of, but we knew what we kew.</span> <span id="s484">We knew it.</span> <span id="s485">My luck, call it luck...was that I wasn't home.</span> <span id="s486">If I would have been home, I would have had the same fate as all the others.</span> <span id="s487">But, uh, the children came, kept on coming and by that time there were some organizations going without my knowledge.</span> <span id="s488">I mean the underground, the, the, uh, the VN that operated in Brabant and there was an organization in Utrecht and there was an organization in Amsterdam, but unknown to us, because we occupied ourselves only with the children...get them ready, get them from the parents, keep them quiet, play with them, dress them, get them ready for transport, because three times at nig...during the week, the transport would leave at ten o'clock at night.</span> <span id="s489">That meant that we knew in the morning already that kids would have to be delivered to the Schouwburg.</span> <span id="s490">Now which kids?</span> <span id="s491">Most of them.</span> <span id="s492">Sometimes it was a lucky one, the one who was not registered.</span> <span id="s493">There were very few of them.</span> <span id="s494">Those children were hidden within the Creche and my husband can tell his story better than I do, but he stayed with the children that were hidden upstairs in the attic.</span> <span id="s495">That those were mostly bigger boys because how could you do it with very young ones, you know, so they must have been so in the age from eight or twelve, thirteen, fourteen...I don't know exactly anymore.</span> <span id="s496">They were taken out.</span> <span id="s497">They were either on a walk or, uh, over the hedge...over the edge from...over the...over the...yeah...over the gate in the back.</span> <span id="s498">I have never seen it.</span> <span id="s499">I haven't even ever known it, because everybody did their own bit secretly.</span> <span id="s500">Nobody told anybody.</span> <span id="s501">Nobody...you didn't tell your best friend, whatever, because it was just too dangerous.</span> <span id="s502">Not too dangerous...you didn't realize it was dangerous for you, but it was dangerous for the children.</span> <span id="s503">If you would say, "This kid is not registered," then it goes out, then that couldn't be told; and I don't even think anybody knew that that child wasn't registered.</span> <span id="s504">That was something absolutely between something absolutely between Mr. Süskind in the Schouwburg and the Directrice in the Creche.</span> <span id="s505">Uh, to take the children to transport was terrible.</span> <span id="s506">They were all little.</span> <span id="s507">As if they felt, you had to wake them up at nine o'clock to have them ready by ten, and, uh, to get them dressed as if...and as if they felt it.</span> <span id="s508">I don't remember anybody cried, ever.</span> <span id="s509">As...there was such a terrible atmosphere, such fear of not knowing what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s510">Nobody knew they were going to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">You, you, you knew...you didn't know whether they stayed with the parents, maybe in a work camp, maybe...there were work camps, even in Holland you didn't know about.</span> <span id="s512">Uh, there were work camps...they called "work camps" later, when you heard the word "concentration camps."</span> <span id="s513">We didn't know, and that is the tragedy of it all because the people didn't know.</span> <span id="s514">Maybe...maybe the Dutch population would have done more if they would have known, but they were scared.</span> <span id="s515">They were not helpful.</span> <span id="s516">They, uh...there were some...I would say maybe five percent...I don't know.</span> <span id="s517">According to my knowledge, what I saw in my neighborhood, in my...of the people that were saved through others, maybe...maybe a very, very small percentage of the people did something.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Did you know what was going to happen to the children after they were transported?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: No.</span> <span id="s520">That's what I just explained.</span> <span id="s521">How could you know?</span> <span id="s522">How?</span> <span id="s523">How could you know?</span> <span id="s524">They went to...with their parents to to work camps.</span> <span id="s525">Now a work camp, that was something not pleasant but you had to work there, maybe in a factory, maybe make I don't know what; but the children went with the parents.</span> <span id="s526">Now we were told, the three of us were told an org..., underground organizations were set up.</span> <span id="s527">An underground organization, people--individual people--they they would contact people...not that I knew it at the time but they would contact people in, say, Friesland, Limburg, in the country; and they would ask, ask people, "Would you have room for a little Jewish girl or a little Jewish boy?"</span> <span id="s528">This one would be able to have one if it would have blue eyes and blond hair.</span> <span id="s529">The other one needed a four-year-old with dark hair and blond eyes...uh, uh, blond hair and dark eyes, so it would fit in the family.</span> <span id="s530">Those messages came through, through the underground.</span> <span id="s531">Even so, it sounds incredible.</span> <span id="s532">Finally through Süskind who was, of course, completely underground-minded with all he did with the Joodse Raad.</span> <span id="s533">He got the message back to the Directrice; so when we had children that fitted that image, that child would be kept away.</span> <span id="s534">That child...but you couldn't keep a child away from the parents without the parents giving consent to give it away, so the three of us, we were sent to the Schouwburg with the message to the parents as follows.</span> <span id="s535">In your own words: "Look, we don't know what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s536">We don't know where you are going to be, under what circumstances you will have to live with your children.</span> <span id="s537">Would you mind if we tried to find a family, a foster family, for your child, which will keep it until you come back?"</span> <span id="s538">You can imagine the questions would follow.</span> <span id="s539">The mother: "For how long?"</span> <span id="s540">"How long?</span> <span id="s541">Nobody can tell you."</span> <span id="s542">"Where?"</span> <span id="s543">"I..</span> <span id="s544">.</span> <span id="s545">I don't know.</span> <span id="s546">Sorry, I don't know."</span> <span id="s547">"To whom are you going to give it?"</span> <span id="s548">"Yah, to somebody who will take care of your child."</span> <span id="s549">So you speak in, in, in kind of a veil...in kind of....</span> <span id="s550">How would you call it?</span> <span id="s551">Uh, in, in a language that people don't understand, the people cannot trust it.</span> <span id="s552">They trust me probably, so few gave up their children.</span> <span id="s553">Too few, because of...you want to keep your child with you.</span> <span id="s554">If I would have the choice today, I would say, "I keep it.</span> <span id="s555">I keep my child with me;" because those we are talking about...children from from year old to five years old, six years old.</span> <span id="s556">So the few people that gave up their children...there were not so many I would say.</span> <span id="s557">Those children we kept in the Creche when the other children went on transport, but we came to the door...Family A has four children.</span> <span id="s558">The Family B has three children.</span> <span id="s559">Everybody was accounted...had to be accounted for, so now came the family who had given up a child to go in hiding.</span> <span id="s560">We didn't use the word underground with those people because that word didn't exist.</span> <span id="s561">Hiding didn't exist.</span> <span id="s562">No, they would be foster children to someone.</span> <span id="s563">So at night when we came to be counted for, what we did...we took instead of the children, of instead of that particular child that they had consented to go in hiding, we we had a little blanket, blanket with a little piece of rag in there or a doll or whatever looked like a, a child.</span> <span id="s564">If the child would be bigger, a little bit bigger, we would really have something big there, you know.</span> <span id="s565">It was scary.</span> <span id="s566">It was really scary.</span> <span id="s567">But you didn't think.</span> <span id="s568">It was just in the way of work.</span> <span id="s569">You did it uh and you hoped only that the parents wouldn't allow anybody to look at the child.</span> <span id="s570">You know?</span> <span id="s571">Oh, God forbid!</span> <span id="s572">I still, I still get the creeps when I think of it; that the German would say, "Let me see the child."</span> <span id="s573">Which never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: We're in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: We're in 1943.</span> <span id="s577">Uh, there are several razzias.</span> <span id="s578">There are many razzias, small ones.</span> <span id="s579">People are being picked up.</span> <span id="s580">Uh, uh, I skipped the February razzia in 1942, but, uh, that was a different story...political, where the Dutch really went out; and they... there were strikes, railway, trams, etc., public transportation.</span> <span id="s581">But in '43, in, on the 26th of May, there was this tremendous big razzia where they took everybody out of the houses, closed off the city; and (coughs) at that time they picked up as many as as three thousand people at a time, and that was the reason I recall now that my parents did not enter the Schouwburg, that they had because at that time they didn't separate anybody.</span> <span id="s582">They didn't bring anybody down there.</span> <span id="s583">They went straight to the...to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s584">Now in June 1943 there was another razzia; and, well, this time...I think it was the 20th of June, uh, another razzia took place where they took a tremendous big amount of people, whereby my husband's family who had moved...who had lived originally in Rotterdam...they were obliged to mo..</span> <span id="s585">.</span> <span id="s586">to move to the ghetto as Jews, to Amsterdam, and now um in June the 20th, June the 20th, they were picked up in a razzia and taken by train straight to Westerbork and from there on.</span> <span id="s587">That was first my family...now Harry's family.</span> <span id="s588">Uh, at this time the Directrice, liked Harry, liked me; because Harry was...when he came to Amsterdam, got also a job, uh--but he will tell his story himself--and, uh, she decided we should get married before anything should happen.</span> <span id="s589">Uh...we got married on June the 28th, 1943, in the morning at twelve o'clock; whereby Harry came to the Creche and called out to me, "Sieny, uh, give over to somebody else.</span> <span id="s590">Take care that you are ready by twelve because we are getting married."</span> <span id="s591">And at that time we got married in a house which was supposed to be the Joodse Gemeente, the Jewish community, but it didn't exist anymore and it was just a formality, and, uh, there came a few people from City Hall in long...in a long coats and I had just gotten a clean uniform from somebody, a nurse's uniform because, uh, you know, after all getting married is not such a..</span> <span id="s592">.</span> <span id="s593">you don't get married in a dirty uniform.</span> <span id="s594">So that took care of our marriage.</span> <span id="s595">The Directrice was witness.</span> <span id="s596">When we came back to the Creche, she had cookies and then some chocolates which she had kept for a special occasion, you know, and this was it.</span> <span id="s597">Shortly afterwards...it must have been July, Harry moved in the Creche then, too.</span> <span id="s598">We all had little rooms in the Creche, the three girls and uh, now uh, I don't know the date anymore but it must have been the beginning of July, there was another razzia.</span> <span id="s599">I couldn't tell you the date anymore exactly...by which the whole Creche was involved.</span> <span id="s600">They took all the children, all the personnel help including the Directrice and me, and, uh, we all went on transport; so we all went to what was called then the Poldeweg -- which was I suppose a railroad plaats, placement, placement, where the trains turned around, etc. etc.--from where all the razzias, people that were taken in the razzias, went to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s601">We were lying there during the night and, uh, the hos...hospitals were empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Then all the people's homes, whoever was a Jew was brought there.</span> <span id="s603">And, uh, suddenly they called out, "Mrs. Cohen from Das Kinderhaus!"</span> <span id="s604">So, we had with us Virrie Cohen.</span> <span id="s605">She was the daughter of Professor Cohen, the head of the Jewish Council, Joodse Raad; and she went, uh, to where she was called, but it wasn't her, she - they wanted.</span> <span id="s606">They wanted me.</span> <span id="s607">"Das freche Weib."</span> <span id="s608">Now they had...one of the Germans--Von Klingebiel--who was a guard at the Schouwburg, he called me "Das freche Weib" [meaning "the impudent or cheeky woman" in German] because I dared to stand up to the Germans at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: That translates to...</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: That translates to a whole room where children are asleep, a dormitory, and suddenly twenty Germans come in with their boots stamping and screaming and shouting; and there am I, and I call out, "Get out of here!</span> <span id="s611">How dare you to come in here!</span> <span id="s612">How dare you to disturb children that are asleep!</span> <span id="s613">I don't want to see you.</span> <span id="s614">Get out!"</span> <span id="s615">And with that they left.</span> <span id="s616">Unbelievable as it sounds.</span> <span id="s617">Incredible, but it happened.</span> <span id="s618">And from that time on, to the Germans I was "Das freche Weib."</span> <span id="s619">They called me... they called me that.</span> <span id="s620">One day I was called to the...because once in a while you gave up your...you gave up your bed because one of the other girls had family in the Schouwburg, and they wanted to see them for the last time.</span> <span id="s621">For the time being they didn't know, but for the last time, their family or their friends, so we exchanged the beds and she went, you know.</span> <span id="s622">So one day I was called and I was said, "You go on transport," and I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s623">And I..</span> <span id="s624">.</span> <span id="s625">and they said, "Because you have a nerve giving your bed to somebody else.</span> <span id="s626">You are supposed to come here and you gave it....</span> <span id="s627">You go on transport."</span> <span id="s628">So I said, "So send me.</span> <span id="s629">Big deal.</span> <span id="s630">My parents are there.</span> <span id="s631">You took my parents.</span> <span id="s632">I go to my parents.</span> <span id="s633">Take me.</span> <span id="s634">I go."</span> <span id="s635">Whereupon he gave me back my bed and told me to get out.</span> <span id="s636">I don't want to use the word, but to get out fast, go back to the Creche.</span> <span id="s637">So that's my story about "Das freche Weib"; and when I was at the Poldeweg we didn't, between three thousand people, and they called off my name, then Virrie Cohen went because after all she was the daughter of Professor Cohen, and then they needed me.</span> <span id="s638">They put me in a in a truck with all Germans around me.</span> <span id="s639">I think I was stiff with fear.</span> <span id="s640">I, I think I couldn't move a finger.</span> <span id="s641">And they drove off, changed trucks, put me in another truck, and dropped me in front of the Creche in the middle of the night, not a single person in the street, anybody, nobody; and I came back to the Creche, and Mr. Süskind and all the others were standing, not outside the Schouwburg but in the Schouwburg within the glass, without...within the wall.</span> <span id="s642">When they saw me, they couldn't believe their eyes.</span> <span id="s643">And the Germans gave them order, "From now on she is in charge here in the Creche."</span> <span id="s644">But then I was nineteen, and the daughter of Professor Cohen came back the next day and she was something like twenty-five, twenty-six and she was a registered nurse; so it was the logical thing that she would be in charge and she became in charge.</span> <span id="s645">So we stayed in the Creche then 'til the end.</span> <span id="s646">I think it was the 29th of September...</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: 1943...when the Creche was emptied.</span> <span id="s649">If the date is not hundred percent correct...the 29th...was the end of September.</span> <span id="s650">And, uh, at that time, that morning, Harry came over and said, "Sieny, get dressed.</span> <span id="s651">Get out of here.</span> <span id="s652">We are leaving."</span> <span id="s653">And I said, "I cannot leave.</span> <span id="s654">How can I leave?</span> <span id="s655">We still have children here."</span> <span id="s656">Not many...there were not many, anymore.</span> <span id="s657">He said, "You have to, because I heard and I feel it is over."</span> <span id="s658">So we discussed it with a few other girls and they said, "You have to go."</span> <span id="s659">Also Virrie said, "Go."</span> <span id="s660">So we went, and as we went across the street past the Schouwburg, the Germans stopped us and Harry had a false identity card because we all had passports with a J on it, but he had gotten from the underground organization there in the same Schouwburg, he had gotten false identification cards for him and for me.</span> <span id="s661">And as we walked there and we were stopped and the German said, "Show me your papers."</span> <span id="s662">I dropped dead almost because I thought he gave the wrong papers, but he gave the right papers without the J, so he said go on.</span> <span id="s663">And we walked, and we walked all the way to the Amsterkade, which is in Amsterdam, the southern part of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s664">We didn't talk.</span> <span id="s665">We didn't...we didn't dare to sigh.</span> <span id="s666">We didn't...we wanted to keep as silent as...and we walked over there and when we came near that corner, I will never forget...it is a round building on that corner...we stood there and we took off our stars which had been fastened...we had loosened already before...and we took out, off the stars and we went quickly upstairs to the woman who had an address for us to go into hiding.</span> <span id="s667">We came up there and shortly afterwards came a man, "Uncle Hannis."</span> <span id="s668">And this is really the story...the end of my story from the Creche.</span> <span id="s669">I couldn't take a..</span> <span id="s670">.</span> <span id="s671">I couldn't bring along the book with all the names, with all the children, because that would have endangered everybody uh to show them the children, those children have gone on transport and those children are in hiding, so I had to leave it there, not realizing that it wouldn't be there after we came back because we didn't know.</span> <span id="s672">After I came back there was no Creche anymore.</span> <span id="s673">So, uh, that was the end of the most important time in my life for ever and ever to be; and then comes the hiding story which is a story unbelievable, too...</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Before we go into that, Sieny, when you were at the Creche, about how many children were saved?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Well, I always...I always...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - TAPE CHANGE</span></p> <p><span id="s677">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: About how many children were saved from the Creche?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Uh, you ask me a question which is very difficult to answer.</span> <span id="s680">I know I have seen in in in different articles the amount of thousand children.</span> <span id="s681">The number of thousand children, to me, seems almost not possible.</span> <span id="s682">I have always thought from the start when we talked about it while we were in hiding, that the number of children saved from the Creche, actually from the Creche, would have been around three hundred, because it was so difficult; but then I don't know what else played without my knowing.</span> <span id="s683">Uh, to me it always seemed a reasonable number, three hundred.</span> <span id="s684">I've talked about it with some other people too, who thought so....</span></p> <p><span id="s685">But, yah...I, I don't dare to say thousand is impossible.</span> <span id="s686">A thousand maybe would be possible if you calculate the children that were picked up in the streets and were not taken to the Creche, but were were taken immediately to to Westerbork or wherever; but a thousand children...it seems an awful lot to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: You had mentioned something before about going... TECHNICAL DISRUPTION</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: You had mentioned before, before you went into hiding, that your husband had given false papers to a German on the street, but if you were wearing a yellow star, how is it you were able to pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yah...no.</span> <span id="s690">Sorry.</span> <span id="s691">Of course he gave them the correct passport with the J, but I I was scared to death that he would pull out the, the uh...yah...how would you call it...the imitation passport without the J, which to me was as I am telling the story, that was the good one, you know, so my mind skipped and I made from the imitation the good one, while at that time the correct one was the one with the J on it.</span> <span id="s692">So I was scared that he had given the one without the J on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: But the Germans still let you pass?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s695">When he saw that the passport had a J on it, for Jew, he let us go.</span> <span id="s696">He said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s697">And Harry said, "Oh, we are just...we belong...we...we're going back to the Creche.</span> <span id="s698">We were just going for a little stroll.</span> <span id="s699">We just walk around here and we go back."</span> <span id="s700">"OK," he said; but of course we never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: So now it's late 1943 and you've gone into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Hiding just starts as we enter the house of one Mrs. de Swaan,who was a a fantastic woman 3 Truus de Swaan was a woman in Amsterdam who collaborated with Boogard family to help find homes in the country for Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">who saved many many children; and, uh, as we came to her apartment, we had sent there some clothes in a valise and we heard immediately the valise was stolen because there was broken into our house, so we were without clothes.</span> <span id="s704">Uh, a few hours later came the man to pick me up, one of us up, to take to, uh, to somebody's house where we would...where I would be for the time being until Harry could join me, and then he would take us to our house where we would stay, so, uh, there was no time for clothes, for anything.</span> <span id="s705">I went with this man and he took me to a family.</span> <span id="s706">They had...they had nine children of their own and had just lost a child and wanted to take a Jewish child that just fit in the range of their children with the same color eyes and the same color hair at the age in between their children.</span> <span id="s707">That was a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: And where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: That was in (cough)...yah...the family name was [Ablossedam (ph)], and they lived in Lisse.</span> <span id="s710">No, Harry?</span> <span id="s711">I think so.</span> <span id="s712">I believe that.</span> <span id="s713">Yeah.</span> <span id="s714">[Wiewerdam (ph)] was their name.</span> <span id="s715">So I stayed there one day, and at night Harry came with the same man who had taken me there and now the man picked up Harry later because it was too dangerous to take up...to pick up two people at the same time.</span> <span id="s716">So he said, "I'm going to take you to your address where you will stay for the time being until the occupation is over."</span> <span id="s717">So he took us, and we--it was by bicycle, I believe--and we drove through part of the country--uh pasture, water, beautiful pasture, beautiful country, what you don't see...everything you don't see in Amsterdam--and we felt...oh, we could breathe.</span> <span id="s718">As if a brick fell from our heart and our shoulders.</span> <span id="s719">We were free.</span> <span id="s720">We stopped for a boat.</span> <span id="s721">Imagine a boat...half of the...half on the on the ground...a little bit over the water...a home boat.</span> <span id="s722">A houseboat, it is called...a houseboat.</span> <span id="s723">This man held goats.</span> <span id="s724">Oh, what a smell!</span> <span id="s725">It was...the smell was was horrendous, but we didn't mind it.</span> <span id="s726">It felt...we felt, we were free.</span> <span id="s727">As we entered that boat, the man said...the owner from the boat, said to "Uncle Hannis," the man who took us there, "What do you do?</span> <span id="s728">To bring me Jews again?</span> <span id="s729">I just had a raid.</span> <span id="s730">You...I cannot take them."</span> <span id="s731">Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s732">There was...there was the brick again, you know.</span> <span id="s733">We felt terrible.</span> <span id="s734">"Uncle Hannis" said, "But you have to take them, even if it is only for tonight because I cannot take them back.</span> <span id="s735">It is too dangerous."</span> <span id="s736">We came in the boat.</span> <span id="s737">There's a boat...the cabin where where where he has his, uh, steering equipment and behind there a big room, big flowers, gladiolas on both sides, windows on the boat.</span> <span id="s738">As he explained to us the flowers were there to protect the people either from the side of the boat or the side of the land to look into the boat, because there were no curtains.</span> <span id="s739">So, uh, he said "Now, make yourself at home here.</span> <span id="s740">Here is a bed.</span> <span id="s741">I'll give you...I'll bring you some sheets and uh there is no danger here, but be careful.</span> <span id="s742">I have a little dog and if the dog barks, there's danger.</span> <span id="s743">Then quickly open this window on the water...on the water-side and jumped into the water, in the canal."</span> <span id="s744">So we were stiff with cold and fear again, and we put our clothes close behind us and we lie down on this bed.</span> <span id="s745">Who dares to undress, you know?</span> <span id="s746">And behold, the little dog started to bark, and we jump out of the water, out of the window, in the canal.</span> <span id="s747">Don't ask me, "Now, how or or what or how did you come back?"</span> <span id="s748">I don't know.</span> <span id="s749">I don't even remember.</span> <span id="s750">I remember that afterwards he went around with a..</span> <span id="s751">.</span> <span id="s752">with a..</span> <span id="s753">.</span> <span id="s754">with a flashlight and he said, "Tis nothing.</span> <span id="s755">Everything is OK.</span> <span id="s756">He must have smelled a rat or something.</span> <span id="s757">Come back."</span> <span id="s758">So I don't know how we got back, but, I don't know.</span> <span id="s759">Next morning...next morning: "Uh, are you dry?"</span> <span id="s760">"Yes, we are dry."</span> <span id="s761">He said, "I'm getting water."</span> <span id="s762">Now, this is the story.</span> <span id="s763">It shouldn't be told because it is a horrible, terrible (laughter), dirty story; but listen...those people lived still in the country without gas, without electricity, without water, so what did they do?</span> <span id="s764">They had a big pot.</span> <span id="s765">They call it here in Holland a kroes [a pot used for drinking] pot, blue Delft pot or something.</span> <span id="s766">During the night this pot was used for all of us, to do you know what.</span> <span id="s767">In the morning we took this pot, held it over the boat, did like this in the canal, emptied it out, took his little rowboat, went with this pot across the canal.</span> <span id="s768">There was a pump on the other side of the canal, and he pumped water and that was our drinking water and our that we had to cook with and to do with, and we cooked with the water out of the canal.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Well, it couldn't have been worse if you'd just come out of civilization, you know?</span> <span id="s770">Those people never washed themselves, uh...selves and they were used to this kind of life.</span> <span id="s771">But we were not, so not only did we have to look out of the windows that nobody was coming...it became a danger to stay there; so in the evening we had to take that little rowboat and row to a little isle in the canal where somebody had hidden some kind of a yacht, yacht...what you called then a yacht.</span> <span id="s772">A little speedboat or God knows what it was...a boat.</span> <span id="s773">So we sat...we went in that little canoe, it wasn't, and we hurried with paddles, went to the island, and we heard plump, plump, plump, plump...and we thought, "My God...the Germans, you know...they are after us," because it was dark.</span> <span id="s774">We had to go there in dark.</span> <span id="s775">Nobody was allowed to see us.</span> <span id="s776">So when we came within the shelter of the of the... What is it?</span> <span id="s777">Loods where the boat was lying...some kind of a small warehouse or something...we settled...we had taken a blanket...we settled in the boat and then the rats came, all over, because what we had heard were rats.</span> <span id="s778">Well, there we stayed every night, and in the morning early we would be...we went back.</span> <span id="s779">At five o'clock in the morning we went back.</span> <span id="s780">It was now October, November...beginning of October I think.</span> <span id="s781">No...we were not so long there.</span> <span id="s782">We were not...we were about two, three weeks there.</span> <span id="s783">Uh one day somebody visited us from the underground-- because people had applied with the underground through, through...I don't know but through people, because they needed tickets to get food, extra food from the underground-- so a man came and said, "So," he said, "Nice to see you.</span> <span id="s784">You are staying here?"</span> <span id="s785">And Harry told them that I had gotten thinner in a few weeks, so many...shed so many kilos, and food wasn't there and it was so terribly scary and so dirty.</span> <span id="s786">"Couldn't you please get us another place to hide?"</span> <span id="s787">So he said, "I'll try...and do my best," he said--but he shouldn't have told, because it was really dangerous what he did--he said, "In my house," he said, "we have a number of Jews hiding; were under an older man, an old man;" and Harry said, "Who, who?</span> <span id="s788">What's his name?"</span> <span id="s789">He said, "Uncle Hank."</span> <span id="s790">Yah, "Uncle Hank."</span> <span id="s791">That was absurd.</span> <span id="s792">It was a name just taken from from anywhere.</span> <span id="s793">"Mr. Smith."</span> <span id="s794">So Harry went into his pocket and picked out a photo from his father and showed it to the man and said, "Would it be this man?"</span> <span id="s795">And he said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s796">That's him."</span> <span id="s797">And Harry said, "That's my father!"</span> <span id="s798">He said, "Let me see what I can do," and he left.</span> <span id="s799">The next evening he came back and he said, "I have it all arranged.</span> <span id="s800">The moment I stepped in the house, I said to my mother, 'I've been there and there and I met the children of "Oom Hank" and they are in need...they need another place as soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Can they come here?'"</span> <span id="s802">And the mother said, "If they are the children of 'Uncle Hank,' there's no question about it; they come here."</span> <span id="s803">So he and the brother came to pick us up during the night, one evening, and they had three bikes.</span> <span id="s804">One for Harry, and I went in the back of one of the men, and we drove through the polder.</span> <span id="s805">If you take the Haarlemmerweg, through the Haarlemmermeer polder, and we drove and we drove and we drove.</span> <span id="s806">And finally we got to the little house, and came in there and there were...at the time there were seven people hiding, Jewish children and the families, and they were all sitting at a table with cups and saucers and we saw as we came in...heaven.</span> <span id="s807">Free.</span> <span id="s808">So they had already seven people.</span> <span id="s809">We were eight and nine.</span> <span id="s810">Then there came another woman with a baby just born who was...she had lain in the, in, in the grain to hide herself, so she was picked up and brought there too, and so we were with ten people, ten Jewish people there, a little baby and a son of theirs who was hiding from the Arbeitseinsatz.</span> <span id="s811">He didn't want to work in Germany.</span> <span id="s812">They had a room...imagine you come in the house.</span> <span id="s813">You have a door...you stand in the kitchen and you can see this place where I sit and that kitchen wasn't much bigger, about this and this behind me, and that's what they called the kitchen.</span> <span id="s814">There was a cupboard and there was an old sink, and that was the kitchen.</span> <span id="s815">Later on when we took out the bread, the bread had holes in it because the mice walked right through it, but it was delicious.</span> <span id="s816">Uh, we couldn't get up in the morning and wash ourselves because those were city manners.</span> <span id="s817">They didn't like that.</span> <span id="s818">That was unnecessary to get all the fat from your skin...that wasn't necessary.</span> <span id="s819">But they were beautiful, wonderful people.</span> <span id="s820">We have kept a relation with them.</span> <span id="s821">As a matter of fact we just came back from Canada, from the son.</span> <span id="s822">They visit us.</span> <span id="s823">Their life and our lives were from that time on just brother, sisters, father, mother.</span> <span id="s824">Fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: We stayed there for one and a half year, but...we couldn't stay there, as it was, because pretty soon we got raids from the Germans, from the Dutch pol...police; uh, so we had to do something.</span> <span id="s827">Harry...now the man of the house, the owner, he was a farm hand.</span> <span id="s828">They made a few guilders a day.</span> <span id="s829">They were very poor people.</span> <span id="s830">They had seven children.</span> <span id="s831">Their house was...the kitchen, a small living room, an upstairs, an attic, and that was all.</span> <span id="s832">So Harry said, "'Uncle Sam,' what could we do?</span> <span id="s833">Where could we go?"</span> <span id="s834">And "Uncle Sam" said, "I was in the cellar."</span> <span id="s835">There was no cellar, but there was a potato cellar that runs under the living room and that is to keep the potatoes from freezing in the winter.</span> <span id="s836">On top of there there were a few closets in which there were the beds.</span> <span id="s837">Bedsprei [cupboard bed], as they call it here.</span> <span id="s838">And he said, "I went in the potato cellar and on the right-hand side from the wall, I saw that there's maybe eighty...fifty centimeters wide, that cellar."</span> <span id="s839">He said, "In the wall is a crack.</span> <span id="s840">That might be the finger of God, that I have to make a door in that right hand wall; that if I have to hide somebody, they can go through that door in the wall underneath the living room.”</span> <span id="s841">And that's what happened.</span> <span id="s842">Harry and and his sons, they started digging out all the dirt from under the house, the earth.</span> <span id="s843">They could only do that during the night because nobody was allowed to know that we were there, and they put straw in there.</span> <span id="s844">They brought straw in.</span> <span id="s845">So you...you go in the cellar.</span> <span id="s846">You crawl to the back.</span> <span id="s847">Then there is a door, not on the right, not in the floor, but on the right hand side in the wall, higher so you have to step over it, and then you come under the planks from floor.</span> <span id="s848">Now they couldn't dig more than seventy-five centimeters because there was the water.</span> <span id="s849">It was in the Haarlemmermeer polder; so when they hit the water, they put back a little bit more earth, dirt.</span> <span id="s850">"Uncle Sam" had straw, bundles of straw being put down, and that was our living quarter for one and a half year; and the only air, light we had--that was...that were those little things from the foundation.</span> <span id="s851">In each house you have little opening on the bottom so the air can circulate under the floor, and that was where we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: "Uncle Sam" was also "Uncle Hank"?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: No.</span> <span id="s854">"Uncle Sam" was Sam, the man of the house.</span> <span id="s855">"Uncle Hank" was Harry's father, who was also in hiding there, already taken there by the underground before we came.</span> <span id="s856">His name was Solly Cohen, but they called him "Uncle Hank" because just the word "Solly"...if it would slip.</span> <span id="s857">Nobody in that whole neighborhood was called "Solly."</span> <span id="s858">That was a Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So you met with your husband's father when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: We had met before.</span> <span id="s861">He was...he was in the hospital in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s862">As a matter of fact, uh when he went into hiding, that was the night they took all the patients out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s863">He was operated on.</span> <span id="s864">He had an operation and he walked off the operation table, walked out of the hospital some way, somehow, came outside, asked somebody to help him to get there and there and there, and there they helped him to get to the address where he wanted to go, people he could trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: After a year and a half of staying at this place, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: We couldn't walk because we had lain down all the time.</span> <span id="s867">We couldn't sit, because seventy- five centimeters is not high enough.</span> <span id="s868">Our food was brought through a door in the floor.</span> <span id="s869">They had an invalid daughter and whenever there was a raid she would sit on that door.</span> <span id="s870">However, the Germans found that door and went into that door but looked on the floor with their flashlights to find an opening to a hiding place....</span></p> <p><span id="s871">TAPE #4</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: What happened when the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Uh, what happened to the...the Germans came.</span> <span id="s874">There were seven raids.</span> <span id="s875">There were incredible raids.</span> <span id="s876">There were raids that they closed off the whole area, the whole district.</span> <span id="s877">Why?</span> <span id="s878">Because, uh, there was another...there was a farmer, not far away--Boogard--a very well-known name here, because of what he did during the war.</span> <span id="s879">He had sixty Jews and those sixty were hidden in the...in the fields and, uh, the Germans found out.</span> <span id="s880">They rolled up the whole thing.</span> <span id="s881">They took everybody, and our...the family where we were hiding, they had told the underground...they knew what was going on everywhere...to be safeguarded from raids they had told, "Look, we have no Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s882">They left.</span> <span id="s883">We don't know where they are, where they went.</span> <span id="s884">We have no Jews anymore."</span> <span id="s885">So pretty soon it was known all over the place that [Bryer (ph)] doesn't have Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s886">When they made this big raid and they beat the Jews--they beat one man so badly, telling him, "Where are Jews?!</span> <span id="s887">You have to tell us!</span> <span id="s888">You have to tell us!"</span> <span id="s889">His mind ran quickly and he said, "The [Bryers (ph)], they have Jews;" because he knew that they had gone there, they had left there.</span> <span id="s890">They would have told him there were no Jews, so he felt it safe, rather than mention another name, gave the name of people who did not have Jews anymore, you know.</span> <span id="s891">So they came over there with trucks and with raids and with guns and with everything and they they they searched the whole house and they screamed.</span> <span id="s892">We were lying there.</span> <span id="s893">We heard every word of it, and Harry's father at the time was in his sixties, lying there too; and a little boy seven year old lying against his shoulder, who later on told him, "'Uncle'...'Uncle Hank,' I heard your heart go rick-a-tick-a- tick-a-tick," you know.</span> <span id="s894">So, uh, the oldest son, the one we just visited in Canada now, they took...they hit him and they said, "There are Jews here in the house, and you tell us where they are!"</span> <span id="s895">And the mother stood up and she said, "We have no Jews in the house;" and the father said so; and the son said, "You can take me.</span> <span id="s896">You can kill me.</span> <span id="s897">We have no Jews in the house."</span> <span id="s898">"Come along!"</span> <span id="s899">he said, and they were doing as if they were going to kill him.</span> <span id="s900">They didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s901">They left.</span> <span id="s902">And we were all lying down.</span> <span id="s903">Unbelievable, where those people got the power....</span> <span id="s904">Fantastic!</span> <span id="s905">Fantastic.</span> <span id="s906">So that was one of the raids.</span> <span id="s907">There were more.</span> <span id="s908">There were seven in total, the Dutch police included.</span> <span id="s909">They... they...they did their share, and, uh, but we made it.</span> <span id="s910">We made it.</span> <span id="s911">Now, I mean, to tell you the whole story, it would take hours to give you an account of what happened in that little house and who got sick and who didn't and how did they keep people from knowing that, uh, we were lying there; and we were not...we couldn't cough.</span> <span id="s912">We couldn't sneeze.</span> <span id="s913">We couldn't talk because if people would be in the house, they would hear us.</span> <span id="s914">There was only a plank, uh, keeping us away from everybody else, and, uh, but we came through and on the 4th of May, when the war was over, and they said, "You can come out now.</span> <span id="s915">It is all over.</span> <span id="s916">We heard it on the radio...," we came up.</span> <span id="s917">We couldn't come up, many of us; because the doctor had to come and take water out of our knees because we couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s918">We had, uh, to be down there for a year and a half.</span> <span id="s919">You will 4 Boogard was a farming family who lived just south of Amsterdam and known for helping Jews, especially children, find homes during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">ask, "How did you go to the bathroom?"</span> <span id="s921">Well, they put down a coffee can or a cookies can or anything they put down and anybody would go and we would hold it up and they would pick it up but they would give it back again, and that's how we went to the bathroom, and that is how we were fed too.</span> <span id="s922">Bread...bread... bread.</span> <span id="s923">Downstairs.</span> <span id="s924">So, uh, we always tried to keep up the morale because then this one was down and that was down...there were children.</span> <span id="s925">The youngest was seven.</span> <span id="s926">He had to be kept busy.</span> <span id="s927">Uh one form of entertainment was counting fleas in the blanket in the morning.</span> <span id="s928">It...really, you laugh, but it really was..."How many have you?</span> <span id="s929">How many have you?"</span> <span id="s930">Because reading we didn't do.</span> <span id="s931">We couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">The...they were very, uh, Christian, most beautiful people; but the only thing that was being read in the house that was the Bible.</span> <span id="s933">And for the rest of us, absolutely nothing to keep you busy; so my husband, he knows the Bible by heart, the old as well as the new...and, uh, for the rest of us...ugh!</span> <span id="s934">I don't know how we passed the time.</span> <span id="s935">I don't know.</span> <span id="s936">I really don't know anymore.</span> <span id="s937">I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s938">And uh the interesting story also is that the two people, husband and wife, in their fifties, they had different views--but both very religious.</span> <span id="s939">The man said, "I do it because in the Bible it says God gives the order to save people whether it be anybody."</span> <span id="s940">He said, "I would have saved the German who'd come...would he have come to my house for shelter, or a pilot, or a Jew...I give shelter."</span> <span id="s941">And "Tante Anne" ["Aunt Anne], her name--a marvelous woman--said, "I did it because I am sure I will go to heaven."</span> <span id="s942">That was their story.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: So you were never found?</span> <span id="s944">You were liberated then on the 4th of May?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: When we were liberated we came upstairs.</span> <span id="s946">We went in the street; uh, finally you know, after the doctor came and we made it.</span> <span id="s947">We came out, and Harry's father, he couldn't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s948">He had run off the day before.</span> <span id="s949">Danger...danger... danger...but he couldn't.</span> <span id="s950">He just couldn't anymore; and we came up, all of us, with the family.</span> <span id="s951">And then we heard they were shooting, and the Germans are still coming and they were shooting left and right; and Harry and I said, "If it kills us, let them kill us, but we never go down again there.</span> <span id="s952">We have breathed air and we can't go down again there anymore."</span> <span id="s953">But it wasn't necessary.</span> <span id="s954">The Germans didn't come that far, and the next day, uh, we went to church.</span> <span id="s955">That was the biggest thing we could do for "Uncle Sam" and "Aunt Anne"--Annie is her name--and their children.</span> <span id="s956">We all went to church and that was their biggest, biggest, biggest thing; because now all the neighbors, everybody could see: "Look what the [Bryers (ph)] had.</span> <span id="s957">Look what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">How fantastic!</span> <span id="s959">They had ten Jews.</span> <span id="s960">They hid ten Jews and they all came through!"</span> <span id="s961">Because what...whatever place you mentioned, mostly the Jews were taken.</span> <span id="s962">They were....you know, they were taken off until...and with them, they saved ten lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: What was your physical condition like, going to church?</span> <span id="s964">A: Our...</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Wasn't it hard to move?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Our physical condition...it was...we walked over there.</span> <span id="s967">(laughter) It was tremendous.</span> <span id="s968">It was...I don't know how many kilometers.</span> <span id="s969">It wasn't too far to go to church, but to us it was like we had walked from here to, to Paris, you know?</span> <span id="s970">We came back (imitating a panting sound)...haa...haa...haa.</span> <span id="s971">We were dead, but it was also such a satisfaction and because of the happiness.</span> <span id="s972">You were free...now you had to go and look for your parents, for your family, for a house, so somebody had, uh, a bicycle.</span> <span id="s973">He had gotten some money from a farmer to come and visit us once in a while.</span> <span id="s974">We went all through the years, and he came over right away with the bicycle.</span> <span id="s975">It was a bicycle without tires, you know.</span> <span id="s976">There were no tires anymore, so it was a hard bicycle, a big one...and he came over with that bicycle and he said, "Harry and Sieny, I've come to pick you up.</span> <span id="s977">You come with me to Amsterdam."</span> <span id="s978">So we sat and talked to Anne and "Uncle Sam" and everybody and said goodbye for the time being, and we went with him to Amsterdam, and there was shooting on the Dam and we were there at the dam when the shooting occurred, and we just could hid in a store--called at that time Peek &amp; Kloppenberg [a Dutch department store] on the corner of Dam next to the palace.</span> <span id="s979">That was a horrible experience, too.</span> <span id="s980">You...everytime you think you are free and then boom...you are not free, you know?</span> <span id="s981">And then we saw the most horrible scenes.</span> <span id="s982">We saw...later on we saw people being shaved and that gave us the creeps.</span> <span id="s983">It gave us...oh it was so terrible to see that...what you can do to other people.</span> <span id="s984">Those people...that were women that had collaborated with the Germans ...</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: People being shaved in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Being shaved...their hair, being shaved in Amsterdam in the streets.</span> <span id="s987">It was like a like a..</span> <span id="s988">.</span> <span id="s989">a Koninginnedag [the Queen's birthday]...on Queen's Day there is a..</span> <span id="s990">.</span> <span id="s991">everybody is out in the street celebrating, flags, and this was part of the celebration... shaving their heads and and uh, uh...yah... terrible, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Who shaved whose heads?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: The Dutch people shaved...the girls who had collaborated with the Germans, had gone with them, had gone out with them, had worn beautiful clothing during the war while the others had nothing; so they were...in every street you could see a scene where somebody were...was being shaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: But in other words it was one of these Dutch collaborators who was being shaved?</span> <span id="s995">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s996">The girls...mostly girls.</span> <span id="s997">Uh, that is how you got the short hair style after the war, because before that grew in, that took a long time, and they made a whole new style out of it, and, uh, we couldn't see it.</span> <span id="s998">It hurt us so much because to...from verneder [the humiliation] to, to another human being...I, I cannot recall the word for verneder in English right now.</span> <span id="s999">That goes against your strength, against your...no matter what they did, you know?</span> <span id="s1000">Give them a trial but not this...not not...so anyhow we went home, at least was...what was home once, because there were other people now.</span> <span id="s1001">We couldn't enter the house.</span> <span id="s1002">We were not allowed to go in.</span> <span id="s1003">We couldn't get back the property.</span> <span id="s1004">Now I talk about much later.</span> <span id="s1005">We had to fight.</span> <span id="s1006">We had to take a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1007">We didn't get it back until much much later.</span> <span id="s1008">Uh, friends took us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Clothes we didn't have.</span> <span id="s1010">Somebody gave us three hundred guilders...the same man in Deurne, from shoe factory, gave us three hundred guilders to buy, uh, second, third, fourth-hand bed to sleep on.</span> <span id="s1011">The time after the war was so terrible...hunger.</span> <span id="s1012">We didn't have food.</span> <span id="s1013">We had to stand in line to get food because somebody was nice enough to give us...because we were not registered.</span> <span id="s1014">We were...we were...we were people--where did we come from?</span> <span id="s1015">He gave us some money my father had given to him.</span> <span id="s1016">We went to the bank later on with that money.</span> <span id="s1017">The bank said, "Where did you get that money?"</span> <span id="s1018">We went...we got an interrogation, and, uh, these, uh, biljets [bank notes], they are not valid anymore.</span> <span id="s1019">So sorry.</span> <span id="s1020">Oh...the time after the war...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s1021">Was it not for our friends, we wouldn't have got through that time.</span> <span id="s1022">We wouldn't have got through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: You have some pictures here?</span> <span id="s1024">You want to?</span> <span id="s1025">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1026">I have....</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Do you want to show them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: To give you an example, a cousin came back from a concentration camp with her little boy.</span> <span id="s1029">Her husband didn't come back.</span> <span id="s1030">Her family didn't come back.</span> <span id="s1031">She came to Amstelveen.</span> <span id="s1032">The government gave her ten guilders for her and her little boy and said, "OK, you are free now.</span> <span id="s1033">Go on your way.</span> <span id="s1034">Goodbye."</span> <span id="s1035">She come from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1036">She got ten guilders.</span> <span id="s1037">She had to find her way to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1038">She had to find, to beg in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1039">Please, would anybody take her up?</span> <span id="s1040">That was the reception there was because there was no understanding.</span> <span id="s1041">Of course nobody knew how...what had happened maybe, but that was the welcome back...after the war.</span> <span id="s1042">You had to fight your way from beginning to end, to get shelter, to get clothing, to get anything, everything.</span> <span id="s1043">It was terrible...yah.</span> <span id="s1044">And we stayed here because, Harry's father was here and he spoke Dutch and he didn't want to leave and he was broken.</span> <span id="s1045">Otherwise, we would have said goodbye and we would have left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: When did you find out what had happened to your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: That we found out already while we were in hiding because Harry understood English, spoke English; and they had hidden a radio within a shelf of hay...in hayshelf, and that was dangerous to do, but, uh, they did it anyhow.</span> <span id="s1048">But if they keep ten people, they, they, they would certainly keep a radio to keep posted, so Harry heard over the English radio what went on in the concentration camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s1049">The whole world knew--at that time already, in '43.</span> <span id="s1050">And they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1051">If they just would have bombed the little train track from Westerbork or to Westerbork...I don't care...from Amsterdam to Westerbork or from Westerbork to the border...I don't care.</span> <span id="s1052">They should have thrown a bomb there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Nothing happened, because I, I still feel it...I couldn't care.</span> <span id="s1054">I say, I dare to say it, because the Jews were not important to the rest of the world.</span> <span id="s1055">I'm bitter over that.</span> <span id="s1056">I'm terribly bitter over it, because I believe it...so many, so many lives could have been saved.</span> <span id="s1057">So many lives could have been...if somebody would have thrown a bomb.</span> <span id="s1058">If somebody...you know...the English, the Americans...the Dutch.</span> <span id="s1059">It's so easy to say, "Yes.</span> <span id="s1060">Yes sir."</span> <span id="s1061">Well, that's our story, really, in</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">short.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Sieny, is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: We live with this every day.</span> <span id="s1065">If you put two Jews together, here in Holland, who went through it, and they start with a birthday party, they end mourning, because this is with us every day.</span> <span id="s1066">And our second generation, our children, they got their guilt too, and I'm not talking only about our children.</span> <span id="s1067">I'm talking about the children from the people who went through it, because it is...there are no words to describe it, and our future is completely...future...we try to be happy.</span> <span id="s1068">We try...we live and there are good things happening, thank God, but this is the overall most important thing that happened in our lives.</span> <span id="s1069">We can't forget.</span> <span id="s1070">We try to forget; we cannot.</span> <span id="s1071">And that's the sad thing, because you live with it always.</span> <span id="s1072">People have no idea what it means to live without family, without parents, without brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents.</span> <span id="s1073">The generation right after us have nobody.</span> <span id="s1074">They have the parents and further nobody.</span> <span id="s1075">Nobody.</span> <span id="s1076">If the parents die, over.</span> <span id="s1077">No...it's horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: What happened to your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: My sister has two chi...two sons.</span> <span id="s1080">She got married after the war, with this same man I told you about.</span> <span id="s1081">One lives in Israel--does his duty every three months--he goes in the army and has five little daughters.</span> <span id="s1082">And another son they have, also married.</span> <span id="s1083">Yah.</span> <span id="s1084">Something to be very thankful for.</span> <span id="s1085">Our children have no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: You had mentioned a trip to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1088">I went to Germany on a business trip because I worked for French company, and I had to go to the, to the fair.</span> <span id="s1089">And I made myself a commitment; and I told myself I will go under one circumstance [condition], and that is: "Sieny, if you tell every German you meet, what they did in the past, what country they were under Hitler, and what they will do it, what they will do with it in the future."</span> <span id="s1090">And I did.</span> <span id="s1091">I did.</span> <span id="s1092">I took my chance and there is not one single German I spoke to for the business or I told them the whole story.</span> <span id="s1093">I asked them, "Please sit down.</span> <span id="s1094">I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1095">And I want you to listen to me."</span> <span id="s1096">And they did; so at least that's my only satisfaction for having had to go Germany.</span> <span id="s1097">I wouldn't set a step over the border, ever, for vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: What year was this that you had gone?</span> <span id="s1099">A: In '83.</span> <span id="s1100">1983.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Anything else you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Let's hope there will be a world of peace.</span> <span id="s1103">Let's hope this will never happen again.</span> <span id="s1104">And that is the reason I told this story, because I realize there are so few left that I saw that this is a necessity to do this for posterity.</span> <span id="s1105">People should know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1107">Could you tell me about some of the pictures in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: (Shows an album).</span> <span id="s1109">Uh, this is the Creche, the building.</span> <span id="s1110">This is the Directrice, she is a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s1111">And what I did not tell yet on the next page you see this child.</span> <span id="s1112">He was a foundling and that gave her the idea to save the Jewish children, because if he was a foundling and nobody knew....</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: You have some photos you wanted to show us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s1116">I have...I have them in here.</span> <span id="s1117">(Showing photographs) [(1)] This building is the Creche as it used to be.</span> <span id="s1118">It doesn't exist anymore as it is now.</span> <span id="s1119">[(2)] This is Directrice Pimentel, and she is the (clearing throat)...she was the Directrice always there.</span> <span id="s1120">[(3)] Here are some pictures of the Creche with the former onder, subdirectrice, and [(4)] that's me with a child, children, children with some names.</span> <span id="s1121">I still have them because they were on the back of the picture, and [(5)] this is the Directrice again, Miss Pimentel, with a boy that was laid there, that was put as a foundling on the steps of the Creche, not exactly at the Creche but it was someplace else.</span> <span id="s1122">It was found and it was taken there, and she took it in as a foundling, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: (Showing photographs) So this is the Directrice.</span> <span id="s1125">She used to be the Directrice since 1926 or '28, something like that;
