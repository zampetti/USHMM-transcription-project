Q. (not recorded)
A. My mother died, she was burned by a kerosene lamp when I was 7 years old. Her name was Mottel. Before marriage it was Zatterman. My father's name was Meyer Wasserman.
Q. Were they from Poulev?
A. They met there at a wedding. I know that my family were very fine people. My father had a store and he was a teacher.
My mother worked in the house and helped in the store. I had a brother, Shemen, and 2 sisters, one died- I don't remember
her name.
Q. Before the war how was business?
A. He made a living. We were very poor. My dad got married again. I could not stay with them. I was almost 10 years old.
I took my money for shoes and gave it to a man to take me to Warsaw, where my mother's brother lived. They were poor people too. I had to work but they gave me nothing. I got a job in a grocery) 6 days a week. After 7 I had to stay outside to look for policemen~ because we were supposed to close at 7, and we were open from 7-10. Then the maid touched my leg. He scared me and I went away.I went to Prague.
Q. Where did you live?
A. My brother was locked up in jail in Germany. My uncle gave me $3000 and sent me to Germany. I was good-looking and tall.
I went to see my brother in jail. I invited 2 men there to a bar where I worked. They drank and wanted me to drink but I didn't drink it. the men wanted to take me to a movie, but I saw a hotel, not a movie. I say I'm tired and drunk but I would meet them the next night. The second night I said I want my brother. I took him and went back to Warsaw and gave the money back to my uncle. I bought a store when I was 14 years old, a candy store.
I had a husband but I no like him. It was in the Jewish part.
Later I sold the store and I open grocery. I sold vegetables and fruit- the customers know me and like me. Later, Hitler come and take me away. One half hour they gave me. I have 2 kids, a son and a daughter. I make very good business. Lots of people worked for me. I treat my husband very good.
Q. What year is this?
A. I was 15. (could this be a mistake??????)
Q. And your children?
A. They were 5 years old and 7 years old when they were killed. My daughter was Mottel, and a son, Moshe.
Q. What year did Hitler come?
A. In 1939. My children were in the country and I couldn't go pick them up. They took away the kids and put us in the ghetto. My husband got sick, typhus there was no doctor. I got a doctor and he said to put leeches on him. He was sick almost 2 weeks. I went out and I couldn't find the doctor. He (husband) was dead. Every day they send you to another block.
I had a job- I put bristles into the brush. That is why they keep me, they were sweeping brushes. I was there 4 months.
Later they have a selection. they need 10,000. My son was 5 and my daughter 7. They put the kids "5 in a line". They looked you in the face, the people to kill. They pushed me to one side and my sister in law to another. I said I want to go with her. they whipped me and took her, her 2 sons and other
people.
I see the boy. He had a gray suit and black hair. They took him by the arms and threw him out the window. They shot him. I went upstairs- nobody there. Downstairs in the 4 corners were SS men. I beg one, "They took away my kids, please let me go with them!" He took a gun and hit me on the head. I woke up and it is light already. I ran out- I couldn't go back in sharp day. I stay a week. I hide myself underneath stores, with no food. At night I look for food in the basement. there were 2 Jews dressed up as SS men. He said do you have money? The other day they took out all the people and burned them up in the crematorium. They say everyone is going. Everyone was hiding in the basement. He took a newspaper and a match and threw it in. He said, you're going to get gassed anyway... I saw my sister. She had asked how I was. they shot her. Again, I hide without food. Outside the shop there were kids, 1 and 2 years old, laying outside.
Q. They took you in a cattle car?
A. yes. I don't know how long it traveled. The trip to Treblinka was terrible. No toilet, just 3 pails . No a place
to sit.
One person killed the other. There were 10 dead people/ We had to stand up the whole time.
Q. You didn't stay there?
A. I was in Auschwitz maybe a year. In Maydonik they give you a star. But no needle. They said Where is your star? I said I had no needle. I got whipped 15 times. In auschwitz they took off our hair. I got pants and a jacket. We had a cold shower, ice cold. 4 girls sleep to a coil. A fat woman on top fell and broke all the coils. They give you a slice of bread in the morning for all day. You have a dish so big but you only get a coffee cup full of soup. Always the same. You got shoes made from wood, so big. The shoe got stuck on a march and you could not pick it up. I stopped and the German shepherd bit my behind. When I got hungry I go into the dirt. I suck the bones. I was so happy.
Q. How long were you there?
A. About a year. Later everybody had to go out. Not with a train but walk, run. 40 miles an hour. Every minute they shot another one. I said I have to make it. After Auschwitz I went Ravensburg. I went to work. I went to pick up the shit and put it in a trunk. At Auschwitz I do other things. They bring people from other countries. I search their clothes for money or gold, etc. Many times I throw money and gold in the
toilet.
Q. Did people try and smuggle things?
A. No. They give you different clothes when you left. I saw a friend there. She knew she would not make selection, she was too skinny. So first I went for me and then I went for her.
What difference did it make? She died later.
Q. Were you sick there?
A. Yes I got a swollen breast.They put me in the hospital but didn't do nothing. There was a selection and they took out all the people. I say I work everyday. She said they can do nothing. I hide under the straws that we sleep on and I found safety. Later they find me. They say they will shoot me like a dog. I say I don't care. A French girl told many people how to escape. She tried. They brought her back. They said you can say you're sorry. She spit in their face. They were going to hang her. She asked to speak to the girls and she cut her wrists with a razor. They took dead people away in a truck. I beg him to put me with the dead people. He said you got money? I said where would I get money? I no eat for a week. I eat snow. When you got sick, they kill you. The hospital was the worst thing. They say come and take a bath. One body would stick to the other. They would open up the window, and
throw gas in.
Q. Did you say there was a song about Auschwitz?
A. I sing what I know (sings, crying) Where they cook food they give me an axe to chop wood. I knock my finger almost off. I held my hand up for the blood. I showed the cook- she told me to hold my hand down. I couldn't she slapped me. I got no food. I rip off a piece of my dress, and heal it
myself.
Q. I t healed?
A. My breast it was the same thing. I healed it with urine. I don't know if that's what other people did. We got a slice of bread. All these people are hungry on the other side of the fence. I say I'm hungry too but I throw my bread. The SS men see- they ask the people, who threw it? No one says a word- he says the girl will get killed and everyone next. All the people were not killed. They were shaved. But nobody said a word. Because I helped as much as I could.
Q. Were there Polish in the camps?
A. Germans took the children. there were Polish and gypsies.
One day they burned 5000 of the small people and gypsies up,
no selection.
Q. Was there anyone from Poulev?
A. there was no one. There were 4 girls in a bed but they were not friends, because everyone grabbed the quilt. When the Russians came I say I am Jewish. He says I can't believe you are left! He went in a store and got me the nicest clothes. I told him there was a starving boy and he took him.
Q. Is that your number?
A. 47372. they put a needle everywhere. The 4 is 16 times with a needle. It hurts like hell. They do it right away.
they shave you. Every 2 months you take a bath- a cold shower. I have a lot I can't remember- 1939- 1945! How can I
remember?
Q. Did you want to live the whole time?
A. I said I am going to live. They put a truck up. All the people fall like coal. They say to take a bath. They lie. In the selection, you are so skinny- how can you look good?
