id="s4">Abstract Hanna Liebmann was born Hannah Hirsh in Karlsruhe, Germany on November 28, 1924.</span> <span id="s5">Her father Max, a successful photographer, died within 12 weeks after her birth.</span> <span id="s6">Hanna, her older brother, and mother lived in a very comfortable home.</span> <span id="s7">Hanna went to public school, where Jews were harassed.</span> <span id="s8">In 1936, she was forced to transfer to the Jewish school which had opened in September, and was shared with mentally retarded students.</span> <span id="s9">On the day of Kristallnacht, the showcases in Hanna’s home were smashed, all Jewish men were arrested, and the conservative synagogue was burned.</span> <span id="s10">Hanna was sent to a boarding school near Hanover where she stayed until August 1940 when her mother made her return after the mother’s arm became so inflamed that she couldn’t move it.</span> <span id="s11">Hanna’s brother had moved to America.</span> <span id="s12">On October 22, 1940, 12 men arrested Hanna, aged 16, her mother, three aunts, and 91-and-a-half year-old grandmother at the home they shared.</span> <span id="s13">They were on one of nine trains that took three days to arrive in Oloron Sainte-Marie.</span> <span id="s14">At Oloron Sainte-Marie, Hanna and her family were sent to the Gurs camp.</span> <span id="s15">The camp had mud knee-deep, raging dysentery, but a “tremendous cultural life” including chamber music and cabaret.</span> <span id="s16">Hanna worked in the camp’s office where she met her future husband.</span> <span id="s17">Swiss Red Cross provided some food.</span> <span id="s18">A social worker asked Hanna’s mother to allow her to go to the village Le Chambon-sur-Lignon where young people were helped to survive.</span> <span id="s19">After about 11 months in Gurs, Hanna left in September 1941 for Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s20">When Germans came to Le Chambon, Hanna was hidden by various people, including farmers who built a hiding place in woodpiles.</span> <span id="s21">In February 1943, she made her way alone to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s22">She contacted an aunt, and lived with the family until late December 1944.</span> <span id="s23">Hanna ran away because the family could not understand what she had been through, and Hanna came close to a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s24">She made her way to Geneva where she reconnected with her future husband, and worked as a maid.</span> <span id="s25">They had a daughter, and remained in Switzerland until 1948 when the Swiss declined to let them stay.</span> <span id="s26">They immigrated to the United States in 1948.</span> <span id="s27">Also after the war, Hanna’s two surviving aunts immigrated to Cuba, and then to the United States.</span> <span id="s28">Five family members survived, including two cousins who were deported from Prague to Theresienstadt, then Auschwitz, and labor camps.</span> <span id="s29">Fourteen family members died.</span> <span id="s30">She concluded, “in spite of it all, life has been good to us.”</span> <span id="s31">Tape I, Side A Anthony: Today is March 28, 1992.</span> <span id="s32">My name is Anthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Mrs. Hanna Liebmann, Bayside, New York.</span> <span id="s33">I am here to interview her about her experiences and those of her family during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s34">Good evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Hanna: Good evening, Tony.</span> <span id="s36">I am Hanna Liebmann.</span> <span id="s37">I was born on November 28, 1924 in Karlsruhe, Germany as the second child of Max and Ella Hirsh nee Traub.</span> <span id="s38">I had an older brother.</span> <span id="s39">My father died within 12 weeks after my birth which left my mother a widow.</span> <span id="s40">She raised us very well.</span> <span id="s41">My father was in business, he was a photographer.</span> <span id="s42">He started his business in 1901.</span> <span id="s43">He was then 21 years old with this younger brother who was twenty and not yet of age and couldn't put his signature on any business papers.</span> <span id="s44">Within a year my father had acquired a title as hufphotograph, grand-duke of Baden and, of course, subsequently to other small courts and what have-you.</span> <span id="s45">At the time he opened his business in 1901, he was actually despised by the rest of the Jewish population in Karlsruhe for going into such a profession because no Jew had ever done that before.</span> <span id="s46">A year later, when he had become known and had made his reputation, he was the darling of the town.</span> <span id="s47">It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Anthony: Jewish and non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Hanna: Right.</span> <span id="s50">So… Anthony: He was the Grand-Duke of Court.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Hanna: Grand-Duke of Court, right.</span> <span id="s52">In any case, we grew up in Germany in a very comfortable home.</span> <span id="s53">It is true that we grew up without a father; our mother was a very good mother.</span> <span id="s54">She continued to run the business and did so till 1938, December 31 when we had to give up the business due to the laws in Germany.</span> <span id="s55">I started school, I believe, in 1930, I'm not quite sure of this anymore.</span> <span id="s56">I went to public school in Germany till 1936.</span> <span id="s57">I did have, in public school, gentile girlfriends, very good gentile girlfriends.</span> <span id="s58">But after 1935, I did not dare being friends with them because it would have been too dangerous for their parents who were in business and probably would have had to bear the consequences of their children having a Jewish girlfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Anthony: Did you leave school in '36?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Hanna: I left school in '36 in order to enter Jewish school.</span> <span id="s61">All Jewish children whose fathers were not World War I veterans and front-line service had to enter Jewish schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Anthony: So you had to leave the public schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Hanna: We had to leave the public school and enter Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Anthony: This would be the fall of '36?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Hanna: The fall of '36, yes.</span> <span id="s66">It so happens the school year actually starts in Europe, at that time, started at Easter time.</span> <span id="s67">But we had--the Jewish school was opened in September of 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Anthony: This was a new Jewish school or an older one?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Hanna: No, it was brand new.</span> <span id="s70">It had to be created.</span> <span id="s71">We did not have in Karlsruhe a private Jewish school like there was in Frankfurt, the Philanthropin.</span> <span id="s72">We had to go to this school, we had no choice.</span> <span id="s73">We had wonderful Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s74">We were housed in a school building, a public school building that was set aside for the mentally retarded.</span> <span id="s75">We shared this school building with them.</span> <span id="s76">However, we were not allowed to share with them, the courtyard.</span> <span id="s77">They had to stay on one side and we had to stay on the other side of the courtyard during recess.</span> <span id="s78">School was okay, we were no longer exposed to the harassment that we had endured in public school.</span> <span id="s79">So this part was okay.</span> <span id="s80">We come to November '38, the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s81">In the morning I went to school like any other day.</span> <span id="s82">On my way to the school, I saw the fire engines standing in front of a building where the orthodox Jewish community was housed.</span> <span id="s83">Now it was very strange; there was a building in front, you went through a courtyard and then came the synagogue.</span> <span id="s84">The fire engines were standing there and I didn't see any fire.</span> <span id="s85">I didn't see anything.</span> <span id="s86">When I came to school, I said very loudly to my friends, you know the fire engines are standing in front of that synagogue.</span> <span id="s87">They all looked at me and said, don't you know what happened?</span> <span id="s88">I said, no, what's going on?</span> <span id="s89">And here were some of the girls in tears because their fathers had been arrested.</span> <span id="s90">Being that there was no male in our house, obviously they didn't come to arrest anybody.</span> <span id="s91">What they did while I was away in school, is that they smashed all our showcases.</span> <span id="s92">I think they kept us in school for about two hours because again the male teachers were absent--they had been arrested.</span> <span id="s93">There were some female teachers and they made us write some silly composition.</span> <span id="s94">Around ten o'clock, they let us go home.</span> <span id="s95">When I came home and approached the house we lived in, I saw my mother in the street with a broom sweeping up the glass from all of the showcases.</span> <span id="s96">I had never seen my mother sweep the street.</span> <span id="s97">Around my mother, were a lot of people screaming and whistling and making fun of her.</span> <span id="s98">Our employee, which we had at that time, still in the business, a very decent person; his name was Josef Kohlmann, he's still alive, wanted to sweep the street for my mother.</span> <span id="s99">She would not let him because she was afraid he would be killed in the process or at least harmed, let's put it that way.</span> <span id="s100">The next thing I knew, I heard that the conservative synagogue also had been put on fire.</span> <span id="s101">I think Kristallnacht was on a Thursday because I realized all of a sudden that on Friday night, we would not be going to synagogue for services.</span> <span id="s102">It wasn't that I was so religious but I did belong to the choir.</span> <span id="s103">This was a children's choir and so that was the big thing to go there, not for services but a choir.</span> <span id="s104">What can I tell you?</span> <span id="s105">It was a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s106">The men were arrested.</span> <span id="s107">We heard all sorts of things that had been happening.</span> <span id="s108">My aunts' business was somehow spared.</span> <span id="s109">They had no showcases, there were no men in the household and there was a very peculiar situation in the house where my aunts lived.</span> <span id="s110">Downstairs was a business that dealt in wallpapers and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Anthony: Which aunt was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Hanna: My aunts who had the dressmaking business.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Anthony: These were the ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Hanna: Traubs.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Anthony: Two aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Hanna: Three, actually.</span> <span id="s117">Their apartment was on the second floor and the business was on the third.</span> <span id="s118">But the son of these people who owned the house and the business had been a man who went to France very early in 1933.</span> <span id="s119">They were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s120">Every so often he would come home with his car, with the French license plate and drive this car into the entrance of the house.</span> <span id="s121">It was sort of built like the French houses where there's a big door to go in and then there's an entrance--okay.</span> <span id="s122">You could just drive the car in.</span> <span id="s123">He would place it in such a way that you could not get to the staircase.</span> <span id="s124">So nobody could go up.</span> <span id="s125">They see-the Nazis saw a car with a foreign license plate, they would turn around.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Anthony: They left it alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Hanna: They left it alone.</span> <span id="s128">So they were spared.</span> <span id="s129">He did the same thing on the first of April, 1933.</span> <span id="s130">It never dawned on us till later on what this was really all about.</span> <span id="s131">What the man actually did.</span> <span id="s132">Much, much later--only a couple of years ago I found out what it really was all about.</span> <span id="s133">This man had smuggled Jews and others from Germany to France.</span> <span id="s134">He would come at night with his car with the French license plate, take the people to France with his parents' passports, German passports, passed the border into France at night and take the people over.</span> <span id="s135">He did this apparently on quite a regular basis.</span> <span id="s136">So he made it his business to be there on the 1st of April of 1933 so my aunts were very nicely protected.</span> <span id="s137">He was there again on the tenth of November when the Kristallnacht happened.</span> <span id="s138">So at least they were protected.</span> <span id="s139">This was 1938.</span> <span id="s140">School became a sometime affair for quite a few months.</span> <span id="s141">We would have maybe school three times a week for two hours.</span> <span id="s142">What we would have was English, German and arithmetic.</span> <span id="s143">That was about all that could be taught at the time.</span> <span id="s144">It lasted probably two, three months before all the male teachers were back and school started to fall back into place.</span> <span id="s145">At this point so many of the young people had left that we were moved out of the building where the retarded children were to entirely a building belonging to the Jewish community next to the burned-out synagogue.</span> <span id="s146">School took place there.</span> <span id="s147">Makeshift, as more children left, the classes became smaller.</span> <span id="s148">They were being combined so two grades were put together.</span> <span id="s149">We learned anyway somehow.</span> <span id="s150">and I think sometimes better than the other public me.</span> <span id="s151">I had an eighth grade education and since I could not take an apprenticeship, there was nothing for me to do.</span> <span id="s152">She sent me to a boarding school, not a fancy boarding school, near Hanover in the north of Germany.</span> <span id="s153">This was a school that was originally built to teach horticulture.</span> <span id="s154">A Jewish institution that also taught housekeeping, or homemaking and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s155">So this was a solution for a few months and I was there, I think, from March or April, 1940 till August of 1940 when my mother made me come back because she didn't feel well.</span> <span id="s156">She had some sort of an inflammation in her arm, she couldn't move her arm.</span> <span id="s157">There were after all, my grandmother to be taken care of and she was then 91.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Anthony: She was living with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Hanna: She was living with us.</span> <span id="s160">She moved into our house after my brother left for America.</span> <span id="s161">My aunts, my three aunts, the sisters of my mother moved in with us because not having a business any more, you had to conserve funds.</span> <span id="s162">One rent was enough.</span> <span id="s163">Besides that, if you had a large apartment and room to spare, the Jewish families had to move together.</span> <span id="s164">So this was our solution that the whole family lived in one place.</span> <span id="s165">My mother made me come back in August of 1940, in a way lucky for me because we were deported on October 22, 1940.</span> <span id="s166">Had I been still in that school, my way would have been to Theresienstadt and probably later on to Auschwitz or God knows where.</span> <span id="s167">I don't think I would be sitting here in Bayside today.</span> <span id="s168">We got deported to Gurs, six women, we were arrested this morning.</span> <span id="s169">The following thing happened.</span> <span id="s170">My mother went out very early around 8 o'clock to do some shopping.</span> <span id="s171">She came back a very short time later and said she met a man in the street, a Jewish fellow she knew -- who was, by the way, a very distant relative -- who told her that we would be arrested and deported this very day.</span> <span id="s172">My mother said you must be crazy.</span> <span id="s173">She would not believe it.</span> <span id="s174">On second thought, she went to the Jewish community, to the offices, the administration of the Jewish community and she found that it was locked.</span> <span id="s175">Then she realized that the man was right.</span> <span id="s176">She came home and she told all of us.</span> <span id="s177">The next thing she did was to tell me to take various items, very beautiful bohemian crystal stuff that she had promised to a friend who was gentile, that if we ever left, she would give it to her as a present.</span> <span id="s178">She said to me, take these things and bring it to her.</span> <span id="s179">The name of the lady was Erika Fite.</span> <span id="s180">Her husband was a lawyer and they were good friends of ours.</span> <span id="s181">When I came there to drop off the stuff, she said to me, my husband said, you will be deported to the south of France.</span> <span id="s182">I came home, I told my mother.</span> <span id="s183">We had no idea how he knew but he knew.</span> <span id="s184">Again, of course, you don't believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Anthony: So it wasn't a believable--?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Hanna: It was not a believable thing to us!</span> <span id="s187">Right?</span> <span id="s188">Like my husband told you.</span> <span id="s189">It wasn't believable, right?</span> <span id="s190">So we packed the best we could.</span> <span id="s191">I packed for my grandmother; my mother packed for herself and myself; my aunts packed for themselves more or less.</span> <span id="s192">Here we are six women, age 16 to 91 1/2.</span> <span id="s193">There were twelve men arresting them!</span> <span id="s194">Six defenseless women, 12 men, okay.</span> <span id="s195">Now my grandmother, of course, could not walk to wherever people were being sent.</span> <span id="s196">That was clear.</span> <span id="s197">She was totally confused why she was--why was she thrown out of her place.</span> <span id="s198">What was happening, where were we going?</span> <span id="s199">She couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s200">She was not senile, incidentally.</span> <span id="s201">She just could not understand what was happening.</span> <span id="s202">After all, her husband had been in the war, her children were in the war, why was this happening to her?</span> <span id="s203">Why was this happening to all of us?</span> <span id="s204">So we had to sign before we left the apartment, we had to sign papers turning all belongings over to the German Reich.</span> <span id="s205">We had to evaluate how much the apartment was worth.</span> <span id="s206">My mother did and she signed.</span> <span id="s207">My aunt, Helena Goldstein, she did not want to sign.</span> <span id="s208">She just did not want to sign.</span> <span id="s209">So the Gestapo man told her very simply, look, unless you sign, we will send you away from Platform Six on the railway station.</span> <span id="s210">Platform Six meant the trains going to Munich and Dachau.</span> <span id="s211">So she signed very quickly.</span> <span id="s212">Also we realized that what we had been told, south of France, could maybe be correct.</span> <span id="s213">We are not going to Dachau, that was sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Anthony: And it might not be as bad as Dachau.</span> <span id="s215">Dachau, you heard about--?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Hanna: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Anthony: South of France, you didn't know of any camps there?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Hanna: We didn't know of any camps.</span> <span id="s219">We knew nothing at all.</span> <span id="s220">Not anything.</span> <span id="s221">Since my grandmother couldn't walk, they brought around a police car, but an open--like an open truck where they would move maybe 30, 40 policemen at a time for riot control, or whatever.</span> <span id="s222">It was an open car with benches.</span> <span id="s223">Now you try to get a 91-year-old woman up on that truck.</span> <span id="s224">There are no steps going up.</span> <span id="s225">There are only little foot things on the side that flip down.</span> <span id="s226">I tried desperately to get my grandmother up, tried to push her up.</span> <span id="s227">She had nothing to hold on to.</span> <span id="s228">There were people standing, watching this scene of me trying to get this old woman up on this thing.</span> <span id="s229">Finally one of the men who had arrested us, put her up there.</span> <span id="s230">So then it was running back and helping the others bring down the suitcases and all of that.</span> <span id="s231">And that's the way we were transported to the railway station.</span> <span id="s232">What they used at the railway station was an unused entrance.</span> <span id="s233">This was originally the entrance only being used for the royalty.</span> <span id="s234">They had a special entrance at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s235">This is where we were assembled.</span> <span id="s236">It didn't take my mother very long to see that certain things were being filmed.</span> <span id="s237">Because of that, there was a man standing there.</span> <span id="s238">He was a dentist and the tears were rolling down his cheeks.</span> <span id="s239">He was totally out of it.</span> <span id="s240">My mother went over to him and said, you know, we're being filmed.</span> <span id="s241">If you don't stop crying, I'm going to crack you one.</span> <span id="s242">She meant it because she was embarrassed that he would do that and show the Germans, you know, that he was so upset.</span> <span id="s243">He stopped.</span> <span id="s244">We were loaded in the train, probably sometime in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s245">I don't think that in the railroad car where I was--was my family there was any light.</span> <span id="s246">We were in the dark during the night.</span> <span id="s247">I don't know if the other cars had light but ours certainly didn't.</span> <span id="s248">The first stop that I remember making was in Mauthausen, and we were given something to eat.</span> <span id="s249">Also our money, the 100 marks that we were allowed to take along other than the luggage we could carry, was changed to 2,000 French francs.</span> <span id="s250">We were on that train till the 25th of October and we arrived in Oloron Sainte-Marie.</span> <span id="s251">On our train was the only person that escaped from any of the nine trains that made their way down to the south of France.</span> <span id="s252">At one time, the train had to stop and I believe it was to take on water for the engine.</span> <span id="s253">It was already in the French unoccupied zone and the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s254">We managed, some managed--people went out of the train to get water to drink.</span> <span id="s255">I wanted to get out of the train to get water.</span> <span id="s256">My mother wouldn't let me because she was afraid the train would move away and I wouldn't make it back.</span> <span id="s257">I looked out the window and there I saw this woman running away, up the embankment on the side of the railroad station, was a very little railroad station.</span> <span id="s258">Someone, in fact it was a man by the name of Hugo Stein, a lawyer, threw the luggage out the window.</span> <span id="s259">This woman really and truly made it.</span> <span id="s260">She had relatives in the area; she knew exactly where she was.</span> <span id="s261">She made it, she was never arrested.</span> <span id="s262">She made her way to America where she had children.</span> <span id="s263">Unfortunately, her son must be mentally ill because he killed his mother about, I would say, twenty-five years ago.</span> <span id="s264">He murdered her.</span> <span id="s265">The poor woman was, by the way, a widow so it was hard.</span> <span id="s266">When we arrived in Oloron Sainte-Marie, it rained like you cannot believe.</span> <span id="s267">It was just like if you are standing under a huge shower.</span> <span id="s268">We were off-loaded but I would like to interject here, that on the train, my grandmother became totally confused.</span> <span id="s269">She did not know where she was, what it was.</span> <span id="s270">She was totally confused.</span> <span id="s271">There was another man with us in the same car.</span> <span id="s272">He also, very old, he also became confused.</span> <span id="s273">It was somehow possible and I don't remember how, to call the one doctor that was on the train, the one doctor who was still permitted to practice.</span> <span id="s274">He came and he took a look at the situation and he gave me a small handful of sleeping pills to give to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s275">I got them down into her.</span> <span id="s276">Unfortunately, she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Anthony: Survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Hanna: She survived the handful of sleeping pills.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Anthony: So what was your intent in giving her these pills?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Hanna: The intent of the doctor was to put her out.</span> <span id="s281">To really finish it right there and then.</span> <span id="s282">It didn't work.</span> <span id="s283">Maybe it wasn't enough, maybe she was just too strong.</span> <span id="s284">I don't know.</span> <span id="s285">But it was a hard thing to do, to put this many sleeping pills into someone, knowing what it will do.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Anthony: Whose idea was it, the doctor's?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Hanna: The doctor's, entirely the doctor’s.</span> <span id="s288">He was right.</span> <span id="s289">I don't--the man was right.</span> <span id="s290">When we arrived at Oloron Sainte-Marie, she and the other old--the other man--the old man, a Mr. Wital, were removed from the train, separately.</span> <span id="s291">My mother at the time said that she would want to go with her mother-in-law and she was not allowed to go.</span> <span id="s292">We never knew where she was taken.</span> <span id="s293">We were about ten days to two weeks in the camp before we found out that she had been brought back to the camp.</span> <span id="s294">She was perfectly normal.</span> <span id="s295">She recognized us, she knew her surroundings.</span> <span id="s296">She couldn't understand them but she knew.</span> <span id="s297">I mean, who can understand at that age, right?</span> <span id="s298">She was in a different block.</span> <span id="s299">She was not in our block, she was in a different block.</span> <span id="s300">Except they had a barracks over there that was set up for old people and they had some sort of beds for them.</span> <span id="s301">She was better off there than being with us on the floor.</span> <span id="s302">We had to leave her over there and my mother went to see her as much as possible.</span> <span id="s303">She lived till January 7, 1941.</span> <span id="s304">At that time, she just gave out.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Anthony: Passed away?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Hanna: She passed away.</span> <span id="s307">I supposed that she must have gotten pneumonia or whatever from lying there, you know.</span> <span id="s308">You have old people lying down a lot, this is the usual story.</span> <span id="s309">Not enough food and she was--she had a very healthy appetite, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s310">She could outdo a teenager very easily.</span> <span id="s311">She could.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Anthony: The time she died, was she sharing her barracks with anybody in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Hanna: No, no.</span> <span id="s314">But my mother went over there as much as possible.</span> <span id="s315">There were people taking care of these old people.</span> <span id="s316">That was the good part about it, that there were people helping the elderly there.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Anthony: From the camp, or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Hanna: People that were, no--people from the camp.</span> <span id="s319">All of these things were left to the people in the camp, the inmates.</span> <span id="s320">The inmates basically ran the camp.</span> <span id="s321">Every block had its own administration.</span> <span id="s322">Surely the administration of the block was responsible to headquarters, if you wish, but on a daily basis, it was the people in the camp, the interned people that were running it.</span> <span id="s323">My grandmother passed away in January, my mother's oldest sister died in February.</span> <span id="s324">She was, in any case, a very sick person, I had no idea, at the time we were deported.</span> <span id="s325">Again it was hunger, cold, wet, what-have-you that she just could not survive.</span> <span id="s326">She was also nearly blind from diabetes.</span> <span id="s327">Life in the camp--the biggest problem was mud because it rained all the time.</span> <span id="s328">You were ankle deep of earth in the mud.</span> <span id="s329">It was a big problem especially with the old people.</span> <span id="s330">They could not extricate themselves many times when they fell.</span> <span id="s331">It rained constantly during the winter, or almost all the time.</span> <span id="s332">Water was three times a day for two hours each.</span> <span id="s333">In the beginning we had to wash ourselves outdoors.</span> <span id="s334">The men always had to--the women eventually had a barracks where there was just, you know, a possibility to get washed and what have you.</span> <span id="s335">But the men forever had to wash themselves outdoors, no matter what the weather was or whatever.</span> <span id="s336">By the way, in plain sight of the main road of the camp, so that when people walked by, they could see everybody standing there.</span> <span id="s337">It was before nude beach.</span> <span id="s338">It was very, very tough.</span> <span id="s339">I eventually worked in the office of the block and this is how I got to know my future husband who came to see his mother who worked in the office.</span> <span id="s340">She worked there mainly because she spoke fluent French and people who could speak French were needed in order to deal with the administration.</span> <span id="s341">So I worked in this office and this is how I met my husband.</span> <span id="s342">Should we go and tell the rest of the story?</span> <span id="s343">So, one day we got supplementary food from the Swiss Red Cross.</span> <span id="s344">They had established a barracks there and the Red Cross was in charge of it and food was given to the young people, the children, the young people and to the adults that were ailing or so down, so malnourished that they really could barely walk.</span> <span id="s345">We had to go every morning and have our food right there.</span> <span id="s346">We could not take anything out of there to prevent black market, giving it to the family, what have you.</span> <span id="s347">It was a great help, a great help that we got this extra food.</span> <span id="s348">Eventually a social worker came around and asked my mother whether she would let me go to a village in France, Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon where there were people who wanted to help young people to survive, to get out of the camps.</span> <span id="s349">My mother asked me and I said yes.</span> <span id="s350">Then we didn't hear for many weeks.</span> <span id="s351">I would like to mention that there was a tremendous cultural life in Gurs.</span> <span id="s352">There was chamber music, there was an orchestra.</span> <span id="s353">There were cabaret performances, lectures.</span> <span id="s354">Eventually a school for the young children was established and the adults somehow formed some classes for English still hoping that people will make it to an English-speaking country, namely America.</span> <span id="s355">There were French lessons for the children and I did not participate in spite of the fact that my then boyfriend told me that I have to learn French.</span> <span id="s356">Never listened.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Anthony: Was your mother actively involved in these activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Hanna: My mother was involved in the English lessons, yes.</span> <span id="s359">She did not do anything musically, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Anthony: Your aunts?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Hanna: My aunts, the two remaining aunts after--no, no.</span> <span id="s362">They were also busy making maybe out of some old something, maybe a blouse or a skirt or something.</span> <span id="s363">Because this was really their background so if they got hold of anything that could be sewn together, they would do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Anthony: How much time elapsed before your mother found out about your boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Hanna: Oh, no time at all.</span> <span id="s366">She knew.</span> <span id="s367">There was no problem there.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Anthony: She was happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Hanna: She didn't object, she didn't say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Anthony: She thought he was nice young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Hanna: She probably thought it was a perfectly normal thing.</span> <span id="s372">After all I was sixteen years old and he was nineteen.</span> <span id="s373">No, there was never any problem there.</span> <span id="s374">There was once a problem when a lady was mentioning to someone else in the latrine that, and my mother was in one of the stalls of this latrine at this particular moment when the woman said, it's a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s375">This Hannah is pregnant from this fellow she's going with.</span> <span id="s376">Of course, it wasn't true.</span> <span id="s377">My mother heard it and my mother told me about it.</span> <span id="s378">This lady was busy with social work and God-knows-what and she liked to ask me to do things for her, to run an errand or to take care of this or that in the office.</span> <span id="s379">After I heard, my mother told me that when she approached me I said, well I guess from today on you're going to do it yourself.</span> <span id="s380">I'm not going to run for you anymore.</span> <span id="s381">This story had a 'very funny ending in that this woman also went to Cuba, just like my two surviving aunts.</span> <span id="s382">After our daughter was born in 1946, I wrote to my aunts that the baby this particular lady had talked into my belly back in 1941 has now been born.</span> <span id="s383">A long pregnancy from '41 to '46, better than an elephant.</span> <span id="s384">If I have a daughter and she had a daughter who was far away and I don't know what my daughter was doing, then I would be very careful to talk about other people's children.</span> <span id="s385">It happened that the letter arrived at my aunt's.</span> <span id="s386">My aunt was not feeling well and she was in bed and the lady came to visit.</span> <span id="s387">My aunt, innocently said, oh Mrs. would you please read that letter to me.</span> <span id="s388">Of course, she had to read what I had written to my aunts, which was certainly a great embarrassment to her.</span> <span id="s389">But in a way, I got my revenge for being nasty.</span> <span id="s390">But it brings us back to Gurs.</span> <span id="s391">One day, indeed, the social worker came around and said we were ready to leave.</span> <span id="s392">I left, beginning of September, 1941 to go to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s393">Le Chambon was a marvelous experience.</span> <span id="s394">The people there were terrific.</span> <span id="s395">We could feel at home.</span> <span id="s396">Even so, I first had to learn French.</span> <span id="s397">The population to me is the best on Earth and you know there's a documentary about this village.</span> <span id="s398">I was there a year and a half.</span> <span id="s399">Now in the summer of 1942, my mother had been very ill around June, July, I think.</span> <span id="s400">May or June.</span> <span id="s401">I had for weeks, no letters from my mother.</span> <span id="s402">Finally, my cousin wrote me and said she had been very ill.</span> <span id="s403">She was operated in the hospital.</span> <span id="s404">This hospital, by the way, in the camp was only for desperately ill people and not the people who were suffering from dysentery and dying from dysentery in the blocks in the beginning when we were in Gurs.</span> <span id="s405">In Gurs, we would have in the beginning as many as 20 to 25 deaths a day, a day!</span> <span id="s406">Because dysentery was just rampant, other diseases were rampant.</span> <span id="s407">So she was operated in the camp hospital.</span> <span id="s408">Well, we found out--they found out in camp that she actually had diabetes.</span> <span id="s409">People who have diabetes are very prone to come up with all sorts of pus-filled what you would call boils, carbuncles, what have you.</span> <span id="s410">This is exactly what happened to her and she had a very huge one on her back.</span> <span id="s411">Later on someone who assisted at that surgery told me that the cut was about 15 centimeters long which would make it about six inches, right.</span> <span id="s412">It was decided that because she had been so ill that I could come to the camp and visit with her.</span> <span id="s413">All the arrangements were made.</span> <span id="s414">I had pass, a south country pass so I could travel without being arrested or what have you.</span> <span id="s415">I went down to Gurs.</span> <span id="s416">On the way I passed my boyfriend who was then just freshly liberated from the camp to a Jewish Boy Scout farm and I went down to the camp.</span> <span id="s417">When I came to the camp, the first thing I found out that the camp was closed to all visitors.</span> <span id="s418">The thing was that my husband, then boyfriend told me, if you come to Oloron, find out about the ambulance that Gurs to Po because there was the ambulance from the camp would occasionally go up once or twice a week, go to Po, to the big hospital there.</span> <span id="s419">Maybe on their way back, you can hitch a ride up to camp.</span> <span id="s420">Well, when I inquired about camp ambulance in Oloron they told me it had not come for days and that the camp was closed.</span> <span id="s421">So I had very bad vibes right there and then but I went.</span> <span id="s422">Sure enough, when I came to the camp, they would not let me in.</span> <span id="s423">It was closed.</span> <span id="s424">.</span> <span id="s425">So I had to find lodgings in a neighboring little village, village of Chaooz (phonetic) (c.451).</span> <span id="s426">I then got in touch with people in the camp.</span> <span id="s427">I think the next morning, also, it was arranged that I could see my mother, oh about 300 feet away, through various rows of barbed wire.</span> <span id="s428">I was standing on the road and it didn't take long before the police came along and tried to chase me away.</span> <span id="s429">I saw my mother about two times that way.</span> <span id="s430">Then I was told that she would be deported; that the trains would be leaving.</span> <span id="s431">Again the organizations, the Swiss Red Cross, the Quakers, whoever was then working in the camp, saw to it that I was given permission to come to the railroad station, which was again the freight yard.</span> <span id="s432">It's always the freight yard.</span> <span id="s433">I went to Oloron.</span> <span id="s434">I stayed during the night in the street because I didn't dare go anywhere close to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s435">Found a house or two houses, there was a little wall, maybe two feet high between these two houses.</span> <span id="s436">I sort made camp on this little wall--had a blanket with me and a little pillow.</span> <span id="s437">Sure enough the gendarmes came around, the police came around during the night.</span> <span id="s438">Here's a young girl and they are two policemen.</span> <span id="s439">After they looked at my papers, their intentions were not too honorable.</span> <span id="s440">They said something, oh if she's pretty enough.</span> <span id="s441">I became very ugly, very suddenly and they walked away.</span> <span id="s442">Around five o'clock in the morning, I went over to the freight yard.</span> <span id="s443">At that point, everybody already had been loaded into the trains.</span> <span id="s444">I, not knowing in which car my mother was, I sort of leaned back against the loading dock of the freight yards and there was a French policeman standing there.</span> <span id="s445">He asked me what I was doing there and I told him.</span> <span id="s446">Then he told me what's going on here, tears my heart out, and then turned around and said to me, would you like to have a drink?</span> <span id="s447">Because he had a hip flask, you ever seen a French ---?</span> <span id="s448">So I declined that and he was helpful in finding the car in which my mother was.</span> <span id="s449">This is where I saw my mother for the last time.</span> <span id="s450">People were in a terrible condition--they were.</span> <span id="s451">You cannot even describe how these people--most of them were.</span> <span id="s452">Some still did not realize what this was all about.</span> <span id="s453">One woman in the car where my mother was, got ill so they wanted to call for the nurse that was along.</span> <span id="s454">I told them I think you will have to forget about the nurses now.</span> <span id="s455">My mother realized that she would never come back.</span> <span id="s456">In the car--- Anthony: Where were they told that they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Hanna: They were not told anything.</span> <span id="s458">They were not told anything to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s459">I think they guessed very much what the destination, you know, that would be the end, end of the road.</span> <span id="s460">My mother left me no doubt.</span> <span id="s461">She says, I will not come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Anthony: What kind of a train was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Hanna: A cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Anthony: A cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Hanna: Yeah, a cattle train.</span> <span id="s466">In the cattle train, they had straw on the floor and there was some food in the car, which the Quakers had supplied.</span> <span id="s467">This is looking back at the scene the best I can remember.</span> <span id="s468">I do not know if there was luggage in that car or not.</span> <span id="s469">It could be that they threw some luggage in there but I'm not sure but there was some food in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Anthony: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Hanna: The date was August 6, 1942.</span> <span id="s472">The last thing I saw of my--I went to the next car for two minutes to say goodbye to my cousin.</span> <span id="s473">My cousin, Lily Franken nee Traub.</span> <span id="s474">She was in the next car and I wanted to say goodbye to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Anthony: Lily was in the same convoy?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Hanna: The same convoy, so was her husband.</span> <span id="s477">A French policeman came over to me and grabbed me and said I had no business going to this car.</span> <span id="s478">What was I doing here?</span> <span id="s479">I was a civilian person and I explained it to him.</span> <span id="s480">I said I didn't do anything but say goodbye to my cousin.</span> <span id="s481">He dragged me of course to his superior.</span> <span id="s482">He was ready to grab me and dump me in.</span> <span id="s483">I explained it to the superior what I had done and I said I didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s484">I just said goodbye to my cousin, that's all.</span> <span id="s485">He told this guy, forget it, leave her alone.</span> <span id="s486">So I was fortunate that they were not--that the superior, captain or whatever he was, was not that mean that he was going to throw me into the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Anthony: Were you ever able to talk to your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Hanna: Maybe for a minute, maybe for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Anthony: Was she as pessimistic as your mother was?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Hanna: I don't think we ever came to that point.</span> <span id="s491">You know, it was just a kiss, a hug, whatever.</span> <span id="s492">The last thing I saw of my mother after the trains was locked, was a white handkerchief fluttering out of those slits they have in the cattle cars, you know.</span> <span id="s493">Cattle cars in Europe are different.</span> <span id="s494">You have seen the one they have in the museum in Washington.</span> <span id="s495">So you see they are different from the cattle cars here in America, they are more open.</span> <span id="s496">Over there, they are more closed and just have little air slits on the top and that was the last I saw of my mother.</span> <span id="s497">It was abominable.</span> <span id="s498">The scene was abominable.</span> <span id="s499">I went back to the place where I had taken lodgings.</span> <span id="s500">It was a simple farm house, was renting out a couple of rooms.</span> <span id="s501">The next day I went back to Le Chambon.</span> <span id="s502">That is to say on my way to Le Chambon, I again stopped where my boyfriend was.</span> <span id="s503">I told him at the time what had happened.</span> <span id="s504">He told me that they found out that they will be roundups in France.</span> <span id="s505">I told him at the time, if it's not safe where you are here, then come where I am.</span> <span id="s506">Sure enough, within two weeks. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Anthony: He took you up on your offer?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Hanna: Took me up on what I said.</span> <span id="s509">He came with a friend, now a friend, not then.</span> <span id="s510">You didn't really know him at that time, Walter Jacobavich who now lives out in Palo Alto, Jacobovsky?</span> <span id="s511">Now lives out in Palo Alto, calls himself Water Chang, makes it much simpler.</span> <span id="s512">The two of them came.</span> <span id="s513">What happened there is really is in Le Chambon--the seven of us who originally came from Gurs we were seven young people who left Gurs together, had decided, said we cannot, with the danger that it was, stay in the house where we lived.</span> <span id="s514">Said we wanted to go into the other house that the Swiss organization, the Swiss Red Cross was running there.</span> <span id="s515">So at night, we went to the other house thinking that they will not come where the little ones are.</span> <span id="s516">Because we were the big ones, we were teenagers and in the other house they had the little children.</span> <span id="s517">They will look for us where we are supposed to be and not over there.</span> <span id="s518">Well, we slept there a couple of nights.</span> <span id="s519">One morning, on our way back, and it wasn't far, it was just up and down the hill, it was a five-minute walk at best, I hear some whistling behind me.</span> <span id="s520">I was with my girlfriend...</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Tape 1, Side B She turned around and she said turn around.</span> <span id="s522">I said no, I'm going to turn around.</span> <span id="s523">It's the boys from the school here, I'm not going to turn around, leave me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Anthony: She knew who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Hanna: She had turned around for a whistle, you bet!</span> <span id="s526">Eventually, she took me by my shoulder and turned me around and here was my boyfriend who had arrived during the night and had made camp at a tennis court of a family by the name Erinches, right?</span> <span id="s527">Many years later we met the Erinches, that is to say we met their son and daughter-in-law and family.</span> <span id="s528">We told him the story and he was so amused that he took us over to the now totally different tennis court, totally overgrown and took a picture of us because he thought it was so amusing.</span> <span id="s529">Well, Max was hidden in the very same night, Madame Ontre Philip, Mary Philip who died last November, a great lady, terrific person who worked in the underground, French resistance.</span> <span id="s530">Her husband was right-hand to Gen. DeGaulle, a woman who was shot at Lyon and pretended to be dead and remained lying in the street till everything was okay for her to get up.</span> <span id="s531">The Germans thought she was dead.</span> <span id="s532">She was a wonderful human being.</span> <span id="s533">I took him to her and she immediately saw to it that he was hidden the very same night.</span> <span id="s534">He was with a family in some private home.</span> <span id="s535">The next day he was placed with farmers who took very good care of him.</span> <span id="s536">He lived in the hayloft.</span> <span id="s537">He lived in the hayloft for, I guess, close to four weeks.</span> <span id="s538">What the farmer had done--he cut out a square in the hayloft, which was absolutely above the stables where the animals were.</span> <span id="s539">So that was his toilet.</span> <span id="s540">He came down only once a day for the evening meal.</span> <span id="s541">That was it.</span> <span id="s542">He had nothing to read or do but the gospel, the New Testament.</span> <span id="s543">So it was an introduction to something he didn't want to know, I suppose.</span> <span id="s544">He stayed there for four weeks.</span> <span id="s545">They brought him back and the very next day he was sent off to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s546">This was before we, that is my friends and I, the seven of us, or maybe we were even more at that point; who slept in the other house made the acquaintance of the Gestapo during the night.</span> <span id="s547">Because indeed they came.</span> <span id="s548">Of course they knew exactly who we were.</span> <span id="s549">They had our names, they had everything.</span> <span id="s550">The man who was in charge of the Swiss operation in this village, Mr. Bonee explained to the Gestapo, said, they could not touch us.</span> <span id="s551">That we were under Swiss protection.</span> <span id="s552">No way.</span> <span id="s553">But he talked long enough and hard enough to make this person, this Gestapo official sort of start to doubt.</span> <span id="s554">He said, okay, I leave them here in your charge.</span> <span id="s555">I will ask my superiors in the morning whether this true.</span> <span id="s556">If it is not true, I will be back and we will arrest them.</span> <span id="s557">You personally are responsible for them.</span> <span id="s558">They have to stay here in the house.</span> <span id="s559">So they left.</span> <span id="s560">By the way, one of my girlfriends tried to jump out -- did jump out of the house smack into the arms of the police who had surrounded the house.</span> <span id="s561">She wanted to run away, no dice.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Anthony: She was nailed?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Hanna: She was nailed, well; she came back into the house.</span> <span id="s564">They didn't take her.</span> <span id="s565">As morning broke, we went into the woods and disappeared.</span> <span id="s566">We just disappeared.</span> <span id="s567">We were all day long in the woods and evening time people came around and picked us up and brought us to various farms.</span> <span id="s568">We were totally separated from one another.</span> <span id="s569">There was one girl with me, which I had never seen before, did not know her.</span> <span id="s570">We were first on one farm.</span> <span id="s571">Then we were moved after two weeks to another farm.</span> <span id="s572">Both farms, by the way, were searched by the police.</span> <span id="s573">They came around and in the first one, we couldn't quite hear what was going on but the farmers there had built a hideaway for us.</span> <span id="s574">It was all woodpiles.</span> <span id="s575">Wood piled up from floor to ceiling built in a U shape.</span> <span id="s576">You could pullout one bundle of wood and slip in and replace this bundle of wood so you're totally hidden away.</span> <span id="s577">They were in the downstairs and they talked to the farmers and after some time, they left.</span> <span id="s578">The farmer, of course, came and said we can come out.</span> <span id="s579">Then we were moved to another farm and there again they came.</span> <span id="s580">We were hidden in a freestanding closet, an armoire behind the clothes.</span> <span id="s581">In front was a row of shoes so our shoes looked like the shoes that were standing there.</span> <span id="s582">The clothes was hanging very far down so you couldn't see the legs.</span> <span id="s583">We heard police downstairs asking the farmer, are you hiding any Jews?</span> <span id="s584">The farmer calmly replying, I don't know what Jews look like, and offered them a glass of wine.</span> <span id="s585">They declined, thanks God, because we were dying in that closet of fear.</span> <span id="s586">They left so twice they missed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Anthony: Did they return the next morning to the person who was held responsible for your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Hanna: I don't know.</span> <span id="s589">I never even asked him.</span> <span id="s590">I know him very well but I never really asked him.</span> <span id="s591">Next time I see him, maybe when I write him, I will ask him.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Anthony: But he wasn't taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Hanna: No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s594">In February of 1943, I made my way into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s595">I had my mother's sister in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s596">She was married there.</span> <span id="s597">They were very well to do people, more than well-to-do people.</span> <span id="s598">I made it known to my family in Switzerland that I would like to leave.</span> <span id="s599">They did indeed arrange for me to get an entry visa into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s600">Now in order to get the entry visa into Switzerland, you have to have an exit visa.</span> <span id="s601">Of course you could not get an exit visa, that was futile.</span> <span id="s602">So they arranged for a guide but that man said I had to make my way from Le Chambon to Annemasse outside of Annemasse on my own, which I did.</span> <span id="s603">All alone, I had no one to go with me.</span> <span id="s604">I did the whole thing.</span> <span id="s605">I had false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Anthony: Traveled by day?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Hanna: Traveled by day, traveled by night.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Anthony: This is when this part of France had been occupied?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Hanna: In February of 1943 when all of France was occupied.</span> <span id="s610">When I came to Lyon railroad station as well as in (?</span> <span id="s611">c.701), there was a lot of German army people there, standing around.</span> <span id="s612">In Lyon, I had to wait a long, long time for a train going in this direction.</span> <span id="s613">I was sitting in the waiting room with a French magazine, right?</span> <span id="s614">Pretending to be reading it.</span> <span id="s615">I had taken with me a briefcase, a very narrow one, a very narrow one with a zipper.</span> <span id="s616">I had a little bit of food in there, some bread and a little bit of cheese, a towel, maybe a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s617">I'm not quite sure I still had a toothbrush at that point.</span> <span id="s618">I think a nightgown; I don't know why I took a nightgown.</span> <span id="s619">I wore everything double.</span> <span id="s620">I wore two skirts, two sweaters, two blouses, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Anthony: It was cold then?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Hanna: Everything double because it's all I could take.</span> <span id="s623">It wasn't that it was so cold -- and a coat -- because unless I wore it, I could not take it.</span> <span id="s624">So I took nothing, nothing with me.</span> <span id="s625">I just had enough money to get from Chambon to Annemasse and left a few francs at the convent in Annemasse.</span> <span id="s626">This was supposed to be my contact point, the convent in Annemasse.</span> <span id="s627">Since I arrived at night, the gate was locked, the bell was disconnected.</span> <span id="s628">On the train, in the compartment, I was finally able to sit down.</span> <span id="s629">We were three people, two women and a man.</span> <span id="s630">I pretended to fall asleep.</span> <span id="s631">I figured if there they come for papers, I have a long time in waking up and -- you know.</span> <span id="s632">I heard them talk about the underground, which was very foolish of them.</span> <span id="s633">When we got off the train in Annemasse because it was the last stop then for this particular train, he said to me, where are you going?</span> <span id="s634">I said, I'm going to the convent.</span> <span id="s635">They're waiting for me.</span> <span id="s636">He said, you know how to get there?</span> <span id="s637">I said, no, but I will find it.</span> <span id="s638">It can't be so difficult.</span> <span id="s639">He said, I will take you there.</span> <span id="s640">I said, that's not necessary.</span> <span id="s641">I will take you there.</span> <span id="s642">So he took me, and of course the gate was locked, the bell was disconnected.</span> <span id="s643">Now what?</span> <span id="s644">I said, well then I'll have to go a hotel.</span> <span id="s645">So he was nice enough to go to one of the other hotels, and they were all fully occupied.</span> <span id="s646">He finally was able to find a hotel for me if you can call it a hotel.</span> <span id="s647">It was a bit unbelievable.</span> <span id="s648">To me at least, it was.</span> <span id="s649">I had never seen anything like that.</span> <span id="s650">I registered with my phony name, a totally phony address, a place I had never been in my life.</span> <span id="s651">I made it all up.</span> <span id="s652">The whole thing was made up.</span> <span id="s653">If they had asked me where is Rue Garibaldi in Lyon, I wouldn't have known where it was.</span> <span id="s654">But every city in France has a Rue Garibaldi for sure.</span> <span id="s655">Okay.</span> <span id="s656">I registered, I went to my room.</span> <span id="s657">I locked the door very carefully and I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s658">The next morning I left.</span> <span id="s659">I had no breakfast or anything.</span> <span id="s660">I went to the convent.</span> <span id="s661">In the convent, they told me what I have to do, where I have to go and how to go there.</span> <span id="s662">They gave me a breakfast, bread and coffee, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s663">I left them just about the last of my money because I felt it was very nice of them, you know.</span> <span id="s664">To give me anything, right?</span> <span id="s665">I made my way to Annemasse, partly by bus, partly on foot.</span> <span id="s666">On the way, I passed a customs place.</span> <span id="s667">Little customs house.</span> <span id="s668">I figured, hmm, it's wartime.</span> <span id="s669">There's no commerce going on between here and Switzerland, impossible, what for?</span> <span id="s670">Ah, walked by.</span> <span id="s671">Next thing I know, he called me back.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Anthony: Did you have anything to declare?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Hanna: Where you going?</span> <span id="s674">To Annemasse.</span> <span id="s675">Your papers.</span> <span id="s676">So I give him my papers.</span> <span id="s677">Then he looks at me and says are you Jewish.</span> <span id="s678">I still don't know where the answer came from and I said I've nothing to do with that dirty race.</span> <span id="s679">He closed my papers and smiled and said you can go.</span> <span id="s680">That was that.</span> <span id="s681">That was the only time in my life I denied being Jewish.</span> <span id="s682">I don't know where the answer came from, but I guess it was the right answer.</span> <span id="s683">I walked to Annemasse and I think in fact the little place was called Duvin.</span> <span id="s684">I was supposed to go to the priest which I did.</span> <span id="s685">The priest sent a little boy with me to the guide.</span> <span id="s686">The guide had been paid by my family in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s687">There was a woman who already in the First World War did things like that.</span> <span id="s688">She was hard at work again.</span> <span id="s689">I came to the guide and there was a family there with twin boys and the guide was supposed to take us all across the border at night.</span> <span id="s690">It was the only time I played bridge, I know nothing about the game, I was the dummy.</span> <span id="s691">Then they came and brought a young man which they picked up in the church.</span> <span id="s692">The six of us were taken across the border at night.</span> <span id="s693">The guide was a big, heavy-set farmer.</span> <span id="s694">He was a widower and he had I don't know how many children.</span> <span id="s695">I guess he did much of it for the money.</span> <span id="s696">He literally carried us across this little river so we wouldn't be wet.</span> <span id="s697">He explained to us how we have to walk.</span> <span id="s698">He gave the father of this family Swiss money so we could go onto the streetcar that was going back and forth between Geneva and Annemasse.</span> <span id="s699">He told us how to walk in order to come out at the right place to catch the streetcar.</span> <span id="s700">There was only one thing.</span> <span id="s701">The first time around, we walked in a circle because it was dark and we came out exactly where he had started, under the same tree.</span> <span id="s702">The second time around, we knew better and we found our way.</span> <span id="s703">We boarded the streetcar, he paid for all six of us.</span> <span id="s704">That was fine and we were told where to get off and at that place was another contact person, someone of his family.</span> <span id="s705">She, in turn, distributed us into hotels that were willing to take people like that in the middle of the night, which was probably illegal.</span> <span id="s706">The next morning, she came and collected us.</span> <span id="s707">I told her, it was around 11 o'clock at night, to please call my aunt immediately.</span> <span id="s708">She said it’s 11 o'clock, I said do me a favor and call her right away.</span> <span id="s709">She did, and my aunt came the next morning and picked my up in Geneva.</span> <span id="s710">I lived with my relatives in Berne for--from March, actually it was the first of March when I got into Switzerland, till the 23rd of December, the 23rd or the 24th of December, 1944 at which time, I ran away, to put it plain.</span> <span id="s711">I left because I could no longer tolerate the situation.</span> <span id="s712">They had absolutely no understanding for what I had experienced.</span> <span id="s713">They opposed my future husband because how could I make such a decision without asking anybody?</span> <span id="s714">We have nothing, we have no profession, we have no savings, we are nothings.</span> <span id="s715">There was also the thing, that whenever something went on, what would your mother say?</span> <span id="s716">Well, I knew very well what had happened, okay.</span> <span id="s717">At that time in Switzerland the newspapers started to be full of that stuff, okay.</span> <span id="s718">We knew at this point exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s719">Still, what would your mother say?</span> <span id="s720">One day, I had it enough with that, 'what would your mother say'.</span> <span id="s721">I said, leave her alone.</span> <span id="s722">She's dead.</span> <span id="s723">At which point my aunt who couldn't face the truth almost fainted.</span> <span id="s724">It was a major fight.</span> <span id="s725">I think I came as close to a nervous breakdown as I have ever been in my aunt's and my uncle's house.</span> <span id="s726">My cousin, my middle cousin, was no help.</span> <span id="s727">He resented me.</span> <span id="s728">I did not realize at the time nor did anyone else that he was basically a sick person.</span> <span id="s729">I left and I went to Geneva where my future husband was taking a course in social services to prepare for whatever, to have something after the war, to do.</span> <span id="s730">I went to Geneva and took a job as a maid, which was one of the few jobs that refugees were allowed to do.</span> <span id="s731">I was paid sixty francs a month, a Swiss maid got 160 francs a month.</span> <span id="s732">We didn't earn the same money for the same work.</span> <span id="s733">I was lucky to be working for a Bulgarian family where the son had been a diplomat.</span> <span id="s734">He had, however, resigned his diplomatic position because he was opposed to the politics.</span> <span id="s735">So they were refugees in Switzerland as well, but refugees with money, and with a permit to reside in Geneva.</span> <span id="s736">They had a very big apartment, furnished beautiful.</span> <span id="s737">I was the maid there, and they were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s738">I worked for them till we got married in April of 1945.</span> <span id="s739">At that time, when we got married, I entered the internment home to be with my husband which the Swiss government gave me permission to do.</span> <span id="s740">Now sometime later, as my husband explained to you before, the Swiss had a policy that all immigrants who were living in refugee homes had to get out.</span> <span id="s741">They no longer wanted to support them.</span> <span id="s742">It also meant that I had to get out and I had to take a room in the town of Mortrick (phonetic) (c.818).</span> <span id="s743">I have not slept one night in this room.</span> <span id="s744">We had a newborn child, not quite as newborn any more.</span> <span id="s745">She was maybe five, six months old at the time when that happened who remained in the refugee home.</span> <span id="s746">But mother should live outside.</span> <span id="s747">Now this was an intolerable situation.</span> <span id="s748">I was in the home all day to take care of the baby, right?</span> <span id="s749">And at night, I should have slept somewhere else!</span> <span id="s750">I also could not have my meals in the home anymore.</span> <span id="s751">So then finally came a decision that yes, because of the infant, I can stay in the home and I will have to pay room and board at the same rate as the Swiss who were in the home.</span> <span id="s752">I could return officially to the home.</span> <span id="s753">The Swiss had done another nice thing.</span> <span id="s754">Since I was an immigrant in Switzerland and my husband was a refugee, they had a big problem.</span> <span id="s755">Well I came in with a visa, that made me an immigrant.</span> <span id="s756">I came in legally as a far as -- I crossed the border illegally, if you wish.</span> <span id="s757">But once I was in Switzerland, I was legal.</span> <span id="s758">When he and the others crossed illegally, they remained illegal, they were refugees.</span> <span id="s759">So they had a big problem, the Swiss.</span> <span id="s760">Was this baby now going to be a refugee like the father or an immigrant like the mother?</span> <span id="s761">It took several months to resolve this problem.</span> <span id="s762">They came down in favor of refugee, which was wonderful because otherwise we would have had to pay for her room and board as well.</span> <span id="s763">What are you going to pay with?</span> <span id="s764">The reason -- the way we could pay for my room and board was a very sad one.</span> <span id="s765">Because my brother who had come here in 1936 as a sixteen-year-old and by himself, had joined the American army voluntarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Anthony: How had he come here in '36.</span> <span id="s767">?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Hanna: He came here -- my father had a half-brother here who was willing to take him, who gave me an affidavit to come.</span> <span id="s769">He stayed with this uncle and aunt for maybe six or eight weeks, not very long.</span> <span id="s770">Then he struck out on his own.</span> <span id="s771">Because again it was a situation of a young fellow, a 16-year-old who all of a sudden found himself in strange surroundings with people he didn't know, with different habits and what have you.</span> <span id="s772">Because this aunt was not a very nice person, she went into my brother's correspondence, which he had locked away in one of those lock-away briefcases.</span> <span id="s773">She found there a letter from my mother asking him, because, my God, he was six-foot something and 16 years old and could eat a loaf of bread in one sitting; if he had enough to eat, a very normal concern for a mother, right?</span> <span id="s774">She found this letter and it provoked a storm and so he left and struck out on his own.</span> <span id="s775">Sometime later he was down at a university in Georgia, became a radio technician, then came back and took a job with the pilot radio company in New York and eventually, joined the army voluntarily.</span> <span id="s776">He was killed in the Battle of the Bulge, in January 1945.</span> <span id="s777">Incidentally, only a few days after his death and I did not know that he was dead till May of '45 because my aunt in Switzerland did not tell me.</span> <span id="s778">She kept this information from me until after we were married.</span> <span id="s779">That he had been killed in action.</span> <span id="s780">I got a letter sometime in the end of January.</span> <span id="s781">He asking if somehow I could come over to France and visit.</span> <span id="s782">We could meet if he has a few days furlough or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Anthony: So you were in contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Hanna: I was in contact with him.</span> <span id="s785">Of course, this was not feasible.</span> <span id="s786">The gentleman for whom I worked then in Geneva tried everything if this was possible for me.</span> <span id="s787">Because he had a lot of contacts.</span> <span id="s788">The thing was, no, I could not, so I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s789">My aunt in Switzerland, who had the information that he had been killed, withheld the information from me till....</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Anthony: Until the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Hanna: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s792">Till the end of April for sure, shortly after we were married.</span> <span id="s793">Then she did not tell me directly.</span> <span id="s794">She called and told my husband to tell me.</span> <span id="s795">She did not have the courage to tell me.</span> <span id="s796">She came when we were married.</span> <span id="s797">I invited her to keep the peace in the family, right?</span> <span id="s798">So I could not hear from each side, what did you do?</span> <span id="s799">She was at that marriage ceremony and didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s800">I didn't know till May that he was dead or end of April that he was dead.</span> <span id="s801">When we heard the war was over, it meant nothing to me.</span> <span id="s802">It really didn't mean much any more.</span> <span id="s803">I wouldn't say nothing but it didn't mean much.</span> <span id="s804">Right?</span> <span id="s805">We had lost everybody, we knew they weren't coming back.</span> <span id="s806">My brother was dead, the mountains looked the same.</span> <span id="s807">Switzerland was a peaceful country, and here we were.</span> <span id="s808">It was a very strange feeling to hear the King of England on the radio saying the war is over in the little English that I understood.</span> <span id="s809">He stuttered a lot so there was lot's of time to think about what he said.</span> <span id="s810">I sat down, listened to it and it took me maybe ten minutes before I went down to the office to tell him that the war was over.</span> <span id="s811">Then, we stayed in Switzerland till '48, before we came here.</span> <span id="s812">We had a hell of a time getting affidavit to come here.</span> <span id="s813">We tried to stay in Switzerland with his cousin who was in business and wanted him to stay.</span> <span id="s814">The Swiss wouldn't permit us to stay.</span> <span id="s815">So we came here in '48 and slowly had to start building a new life.</span> <span id="s816">Unfortunately we became ill in 1950 with TB and first had to spend close to two years getting well again.</span> <span id="s817">Our daughter was in a foster home.</span> <span id="s818">She was in a very good and loving foster home.</span> <span id="s819">Nevertheless, it left its traces for some time.</span> <span id="s820">We had to start building a life like everybody else.</span> <span id="s821">It's as simple as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Anthony: Now you left two aunts behind in Gurs?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Hanna: My two aunts in Gurs were able to leave in October of 1941 to go to Marseille because they could go to Cuba.</span> <span id="s824">They were first interned in Marseille in the Hotel Bumbaire.</span> <span id="s825">That was an old worn-out place where refugees were interned.</span> <span id="s826">They could go about, though, during the day taking care of the immigration business.</span> <span id="s827">They made their way into Cuba.</span> <span id="s828">They were in Cuba actually till 1948.</span> <span id="s829">In other words, from 1942 -- they left Gurs in October, '41; they left, I think, in January of '42 or before, first to go to Morocco and from Morocco to Cuba.</span> <span id="s830">They came after us.</span> <span id="s831">It must have been April when they came up from Cuba.</span> <span id="s832">The idea was that we would have a joint household.</span> <span id="s833">That I would take care of my aunts in return for not having to pay rent and this and that and the other.</span> <span id="s834">My aunt's son was going to take care of them.</span> <span id="s835">This was the arrangement.</span> <span id="s836">I could never do that because already at that time, I was not well enough to take care of two old ladies plus a child and a husband.</span> <span id="s837">It was just not possible.</span> <span id="s838">So other arrangements were made for them.</span> <span id="s839">It was a good thing because in 1950 we had to go in a sanitarium so the two old ladies would have been at loose ends anyhow.</span> <span id="s840">So they lived till 19 -- Mrs. Goldstein lived, I think, until 1962 and my other aunt, also a Traub, lived until 1969.</span> <span id="s841">She died at 99 years and two months and was fully aware of her surroundings.</span> <span id="s842">She was not senile for a minute.</span> <span id="s843">She was very aware that we were ready to go to the moon, which for her represented an unbelievable thing having been born in 1869 with the gas lamp.</span> <span id="s844">Imagine the whole revolution -- the industrial revolutions that she had lived through plus the trip to the moon.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Anthony: It struck me that your aunt and your grandmother that you had family members who lived long lives when they had the chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Hanna: Yes, very long lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Anthony: You talked about your reaction to the end of the war, the loss of your brother and family members.</span> <span id="s848">I imagine as the war ends, you're finding out more information about other--?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Hanna: Well, all my family members who were deported from Gurs did not come back.</span> <span id="s850">The only ones who came back were my cousins in Prague, Czechoslovakia who had first been deported to Theresienstadt, into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s851">I think I mentioned it at the beginning of the tape.</span> <span id="s852">She and her husband both survived Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and I don't know how many other slave labor camps.</span> <span id="s853">They had an arrangement that if they survive, they would go back to Prague and meet at the house of certain friends.</span> <span id="s854">Indeed, they both survived, and when she came back to Prague and she went to these friends, her husband was sitting there.</span> <span id="s855">It's a miracle that they survived.</span> <span id="s856">That was -- they're the only two other than my self and my two old aunts.</span> <span id="s857">So five people all told survived.</span> <span id="s858">We lost fourteen, I think the total was fourteen.</span> <span id="s859">A disaster, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Anthony: You have any further reflections?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Hanna: I would say that in spite of it all, life has been good to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Anthony: (static) continue to be good and perhaps be better.</span> <span id="s863">Those were the years of the 20th century and the closing moments of this tape.</span> <span id="s864">The gleam in your eyes suggest to me that you have more to add.</span> <span id="s865">Why don't we take a brief break while I add a new tape to the machine and then we will continue on the new tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Tape Two Hanna: Remember I told you at the time we were in the refugee home on Motrick (c.11), to be precise in (unclear) Switzerland, I had to leave the home because I was under a different status, that of immigrant and not refugee, which left the baby in the home.</span> <span id="s867">Eventually, of course, they allowed me to come back to the home.</span> <span id="s868">In return, I had to pay for room and board at the same amount of money or the same amount of money that the Swiss had to pay.</span> <span id="s869">I think it was five or eight francs a day.</span> <span id="s870">Now, you're probably wondering how come we had the money to pay that.</span> <span id="s871">I also told you that I had a brother who was in the American army and was killed in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s872">He had made a life insurance before he went overseas.</span> <span id="s873">His life insurance was $10,000.</span> <span id="s874">It was paid out in monthly installments of $50 over -- I think a twenty-year period, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s875">This $50 allowed us, made it possible for us to pay for my room and board in the refugee home.</span> <span id="s876">So I forgot to explain that to you where the money came from so we could pay this room and board.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Anthony: Well, I remember when we were talking earlier that there were other family members that we hadn't talked about yet.</span> <span id="s878">Hard to believe that there are other family members we didn't talk abut yet, but the Monee family, these were your mother's cousins, your mother's first cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Hanna: Yes, he was my mother's first cousin.</span> <span id="s880">His name was Heindrich Monee.</span> <span id="s881">His wife Paula and his sister Jeannette.</span> <span id="s882">They were deported with us to Gurs at the same time.</span> <span id="s883">Paula was already really starting to go into a depression in Germany, and had all sorts of peculiar ideas.</span> <span id="s884">She accused my mother and her sisters of being responsible for them not having been able to go to Israel, not being able to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s885">Which was, of course, total fabrication.</span> <span id="s886">Neither my mother nor my aunts had any influence or whatever for them to leave or not to leave.</span> <span id="s887">It was something that got into her head and she, I can understand, wanted to go to Israel to be with her two sons, one from a previous marriage.</span> <span id="s888">She was left widowed, then married this cousin of my mother.</span> <span id="s889">Of course, her second son who was also in Israel and then of course, came to deportation and we found ourselves in Gurs.</span> <span id="s890">The poor woman really went into a very deep depression to the point where she wouldn't really take care of herself.</span> <span id="s891">There were weeks on end where she would not speak to anyone in the family.</span> <span id="s892">It was really very hard.</span> <span id="s893">She did come to the funeral of my aunt when my oldest aunt died.</span> <span id="s894">I think she might also have come to my grandmother's funeral.</span> <span id="s895">Incidentally, while we speak of funerals, let me give you a description of a funeral in Gurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Anthony: Yes, ?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Hanna: The funerals in Gurs -- the bodies were every morning collected in each block.</span> <span id="s898">When I first came across this, there were two or three men who would come with a truck, an open truck.</span> <span id="s899">They would come into the office and sort of kick open the door with their shoe and come in and say, you got something?</span> <span id="s900">Meaning, do you have any bodies?</span> <span id="s901">When I heard that for the first time, French speaking, I was absolutely shocked.</span> <span id="s902">You know, that you could speak of people like that.</span> <span id="s903">But I guess when you do this kind of work every day, it becomes sort of routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Anthony: These were French?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Hanna: No, they were refugees as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Anthony: Refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Hanna: Yes, it was all done by refugees.</span> <span id="s908">The bodies were then taken down to the hospital and they were put in caskets, very simple caskets, like you would in a Jewish funeral.</span> <span id="s909">Just six boards.</span> <span id="s910">Then the funeral -- we had a cemetery which rapidly filled up.</span> <span id="s911">The graves were dug and since it was winter and mud and rain, the caskets literally were swimming.</span> <span id="s912">They plunged down into the water, went down for a second and then came back up and were swimming on top of the water.</span> <span id="s913">It was the most awful sight you could ever have imagined.</span> <span id="s914">First, falling into the water, the water splashing up and then the casket coming up again on top of the water.</span> <span id="s915">Then of course, it was covered by earth.</span> <span id="s916">But the funerals were really something, you wouldn't want to really experience.</span> <span id="s917">Now Paula Monee might have come to my grandmother's funeral, I do not remember.</span> <span id="s918">But she definitely came to my aunt's funeral.</span> <span id="s919">Maybe she even said a word or two to the family, but basically she was in such a deep depression that she could not speak to them.</span> <span id="s920">Still and always was the idea, you are responsible for me being here.</span> <span id="s921">It's your fault we couldn't emigrate.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Anthony: How far back would these accusations go?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Hanna: They started in Germany in 19--early '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Anthony: After Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Hanna: After Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s926">The woman was totally desperate.</span> <span id="s927">Unfortunately, she eventually had a granddaughter who was mentally also not very stable.</span> <span id="s928">Only about eight years ago, committed suicide.</span> <span id="s929">So there must have been something.</span> <span id="s930">Heinrich Monee, he was a very nice person, a very good-natured person.</span> <span id="s931">I liked him quite a bit as an uncle.</span> <span id="s932">I really did because he was very good-natured and very nice, you know, just a nice guy too... There was a sister, Jeannette Monee, she worked for my aunts in the business.</span> <span id="s933">She was the bookkeeper and general office manager, if you wish.</span> <span id="s934">She was with us in Gurs.</span> <span id="s935">She was then taken to another camp.</span> <span id="s936">After all, she was an elderly person, and she survived.</span> <span id="s937">She survived in France and after the war, went back to Germany to live in a Jewish old-age home in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s938">This old-age home existed already before the Hitler time and during the Hitler time.</span> <span id="s939">She went back there, probably, very simply because she could have there a life, a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s940">She was entitled to her social security in Germany.</span> <span id="s941">While in France, she didn't have a penny, and whatever little money she had, she probably got from some relatives in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s942">So that she was this way, independent.</span> <span id="s943">I cannot blame her for having gone back to Germany under these circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Anthony: Now Heinrich and Paula were eventually deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Hanna: Heinrich and Paula were deported from Gurs to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s946">I believe they were also deported only four days after my mother, around the 10th of August, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Anthony: Yes, that's …?</span> <span id="s948">(c.88)</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Hanna: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Anthony: I thought of some more questions regarding Gurs, and am very glad that you remembered to describe the funerals.</span> <span id="s951">When you were describing your uncle and your obvious affection for him, it occurred to me how sad it must have been that you were kept separate -- you were kept separate from the men, so you....</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Hanna: Yeah.</span> <span id="s953">The woman and children were separate from the men.</span> <span id="s954">Once the boys were fourteen years old, they had to go into the blocks where the men were -- in the men's blocks.</span> <span id="s955">Whether they had a father or a relative there or not.</span> <span id="s956">In other words, at fourteen, they were taken away from their mothers.</span> <span id="s957">They had to go with the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Anthony: So I had the vision of you separated from one of your dearest uncles and forced to be with this complaining, depressed aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Hanna: Well, she was in another barracks but it was difficult.</span> <span id="s960">I mean, you tried to talk to her, to be nice to her.</span> <span id="s961">After all, she was family, and here was this totally depressed person.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Anthony: What was it like to live in Gurs?</span> <span id="s963">You were there for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Hanna: Eleven months.</span> <span id="s965">Very difficult, extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s966">The sanitary conditions were impossible.</span> <span id="s967">I don't know if I mentioned it before.</span> <span id="s968">There was a lot of illness.</span> <span id="s969">There was a tremendous amount of dysentery.</span> <span id="s970">We had no medications whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Anthony: What kind of food did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Hanna: The food -- well, in the morning we would get what passed as coffee.</span> <span id="s973">We got a ration of bread, about two and a half pounds a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Anthony: Per person?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Hanna: No, excuse me.</span> <span id="s976">Half a pound of bread, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Anthony: Quarter of a kilo?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Hanna: Something like that.</span> <span id="s979">Lunchtime we would have a soup, maybe with some vegetables in it.</span> <span id="s980">Maybe with some chick peas in it.</span> <span id="s981">Occasionally, a little piece of meat.</span> <span id="s982">In the evening, it was basically the same thing.</span> <span id="s983">Very occasionally, we would be given a small portion of brown sugar.</span> <span id="s984">It was the first time I had seen brown sugar, was in France.</span> <span id="s985">The very beginning, we didn't get any soap.</span> <span id="s986">I think we got later on a little bit of soap.</span> <span id="s987">Living conditions were very hard.</span> <span id="s988">The worst thing really was the mud, the incessant rain in winter, the mud, the barracks that were leaking so when you were lying down, the water would drip down.</span> <span id="s989">If you were lucky, someone had taken along maybe an umbrella.</span> <span id="s990">The umbrella would be hung upside down into the rafters to catch the rain.</span> <span id="s991">So that was very nice as long it lasted.</span> <span id="s992">But then came the morning.</span> <span id="s993">You had to empty out the damn thing and when you took it down, more likely than not, it would spill.</span> <span id="s994">You know, it sounds funny today, it wasn't at the time though.</span> <span id="s995">Especially when it was always damp and nothing would dry.</span> <span id="s996">You know, it was... No heat in the barracks, was always cold in winter.</span> <span id="s997">There was a stove in a barracks but nothing to heat with or very little.</span> <span id="s998">[Male voice: "We forgot to mention…it is documented that a portion of the money which was allotted by the French government for food never reached us because it was stolen before we ever got food for it."]</span> <span id="s999">Anthony: Sounds like you were a very resourceful---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Hanna: The people in Gurs became very resourceful, yes.</span> <span id="s1001">You had to be.</span> <span id="s1002">For one thing, tin cans, large tin cans, oh about fifteen inches high and maybe six inches in diameter were turned into ovens.</span> <span id="s1003">Cooking stoves if you wish, whatever you want to call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Anthony: Portable stoves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Hanna: Like a portable stove, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Anthony: How were they put together?</span> <span id="s1007">Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Hanna: They were not put together.</span> <span id="s1009">The top was cut open obviously because whatever was in there had been emptied out.</span> <span id="s1010">You simply put opened on the bottom like a little opening so you could put in some wood.</span> <span id="s1011">The pot you put on, the little pots that we -- they're not really pots, they were like mess kits from the army.</span> <span id="s1012">They had little hands on each side.</span> <span id="s1013">So they were hanging over the edge of the tin can and that would hold them in place.</span> <span id="s1014">Sometimes if there was a little wire, they would put some wire on the bottom in order to put the wood on there so it would have some draft from the bottom up not unlike a grate in the fireplace so there would be some draft.</span> <span id="s1015">And so whatever people could get hold of if they had a little money and could do maybe a little black marketing with the Spaniards, they would cook on these makeshift stoves.</span> <span id="s1016">It worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Anthony: People in your barracks used them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Hanna: Certainly.</span> <span id="s1019">Whoever could afford to get a hold of one.</span> <span id="s1020">Usually you had to pay a little money to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Anthony: These weren't homemade?</span> <span id="s1022">They were made by ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Hanna: They were all made in Gurs.</span> <span id="s1024">They were made by the men.</span> <span id="s1025">The Spaniards made them.</span> <span id="s1026">They earned a little money that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Anthony: The Spanish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Hanna: The Spanish prisoners, yes.</span> <span id="s1029">They made a little money that way, you know.</span> <span id="s1030">I guess they also found most of those tin cans, you know.</span> <span id="s1031">It was a way of if you had a little money to add something to what you were given in the camp.</span> <span id="s1032">Now some people did get money on a fairly regular basis in Gurs from relatives.</span> <span id="s1033">The money would be paid out, whatever the amount was.</span> <span id="s1034">That led to a tremendous inflation in the black market.</span> <span id="s1035">So that we found ourselves in the situation where only a certain amount of money twice a month would be paid out to limit the amount of money that was available to people.</span> <span id="s1036">So the black market or the inflation of the black market couldn't go even higher.</span> <span id="s1037">The ones who had very little money or who got very little money from the outside were not totally shut out from buying some food, right, or whatever was available.</span> <span id="s1038">Also we instituted at that time a percentage of whatever money you got had to be put in a welfare fund.</span> <span id="s1039">I don't remember what the percentage was, maybe 10% or whatever, I really don't remember that.</span> <span id="s1040">But it had to be collected from everyone who got money and was given to the people who had no money whatsoever, who had no relatives who could afford to send them any money or had no relatives on the outside.</span> <span id="s1041">So they also could have a few pennies in their pockets to buy something to add to their diet, whatever was available.</span> <span id="s1042">Some people kicked a lot when they had to give up a couple of percentages of what they got.</span> <span id="s1043">My poor mother was in charge of collecting this money in the barracks and there was always a hassle about this especially from some people.</span> <span id="s1044">But as a whole, it was done well and it was a necessity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Anthony: Socialism is not dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Hanna: It was not dead, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Anthony: There were reluctant socialists in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Hanna: There was some reluctance, yes.</span> <span id="s1049">It's funny enough, it's always the same thing.</span> <span id="s1050">The ones who got the most money, kicked the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Anthony: Kicked the most, yeah.</span> <span id="s1052">And probably complained too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Hanna: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Anthony: How about like with these portable stoves?</span> <span id="s1055">Those who had them, was it possible for someone who didn't have portable stove to use someone else's?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Hanna: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1057">That was not, you know, that was not a problem.</span> <span id="s1058">When I finish, you can have it.</span> <span id="s1059">That was not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Anthony: So they were shared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Hanna: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Anthony: The food that was cooked.</span> <span id="s1063">Obviously it was possible to prepare your own food and this would have been smuggled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Hanna: Well, prepared -- whatever you got, you made something out of it, you know.</span> <span id="s1065">When we left Germany, my aunt went into the kitchen to get some food, which she had never in her life done --cooked.</span> <span id="s1066">She didn't know anything about cooking.</span> <span id="s1067">What she took, she thought it was sugar.</span> <span id="s1068">Actually, it turned out to be farina.</span> <span id="s1069">That was a much better deal to have the farina because you could make sort of a porridge out of it, if you wished.</span> <span id="s1070">Sure it was only water, right, but it was at least something.</span> <span id="s1071">So that lasted for a little while.</span> <span id="s1072">Maybe, you could later on buy a can of milk or you got some food packages from somewhere, which we could receive.</span> <span id="s1073">You used whatever was in there and made meals out of it.</span> <span id="s1074">Meals is an exaggeration, some additional food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Anthony: You had some amateur cooks that were---?</span> <span id="s1076">The image now is not one of people cooking every night -- it's not like your American barbecue and Fourth of July, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Hanna: No, no, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1078">It was an occasional thing.</span> <span id="s1079">It was not… Anthony: These are not heavily used?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Hanna: No, it was not a daily thing.</span> <span id="s1081">It was an occasional thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Anthony: Very occasional.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Hanna: Right.</span> <span id="s1084">[Male voice: “So occasional that I really don't have a recollection that my mother ever cooked."]</span> <span id="s1085">Anthony: Did the men do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Hanna: Less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Anthony: Less.</span> <span id="s1088">Were these portable stoves present in the men's section?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Hanna: ["Some of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1090">But I mean, you know, mostly it was a man who acquired it from the Spanish and it ended up in the women's barracks.</span> <span id="s1091">“] Anthony: Yeah, could you estimate how many of these were in use, just estimate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Hanna: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Anthony: No way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Hanna: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Anthony: Not even between the two of you, you couldn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Hanna: No, I really couldn't estimate how many of these makeshift...</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Anthony: What would be a minimum number that you would have seen or smelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Hanna: I really couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s1099">Whatever I would tell you might not be right.</span> <span id="s1100">And so I rather not put myself down to a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Anthony: They were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Hanna: They were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Anthony: At least a handful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Hanna: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1105">You will even find pictures and I am sure the museum has some pictures of these stoves.</span> <span id="s1106">There is a woman sitting in front of one of these doing whatever cooking she can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Anthony: So it was possible to get warm food but only if you did it yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Hanna: Occasionally, occasionally.</span> <span id="s1109">["We got warm food the only thing is what quality was the food we got. "]</span> <span id="s1110">Anthony: And the quantity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Hanna: Non-existent.</span> <span id="s1112">["And the quantity.</span> <span id="s1113">The nutritional value was non-existent.”]</span> <span id="s1114">Anthony: These empty cans, these large cans you're talking about, by any chance, could these be cans of food that had been sent to the camp for the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Hanna: It could have been food.</span> <span id="s1116">Well they were rather large as I described.</span> <span id="s1117">It could be that they were cans that came into the so-called kitchen which was like a field kitchen, an open thing with, you know.</span> <span id="s1118">That maybe some canned food came into these kitchens, I do not remember it but it is possible.</span> <span id="s1119">["I rather suspect that most of these cans came from the French personnel and the Spanish…"]</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Anthony: Prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Hanna: ["No, sanitation detail just picked them up wherever they found them and didn't throw them away but kept them for..."]</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Anthony: Recycling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Hanna: ["Recycling."]</span> <span id="s1124">Everything was recycled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Anthony: You never saw any of these cans with the original label on them?</span> <span id="s1126">They had already been stripped of their labels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Hanna: Whatever it was, it was stripped.</span> <span id="s1128">But they were around and they did help and when anything was available, they were used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Anthony: Real kitchens were not available?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Hanna: Real kitchens?</span> <span id="s1131">No.</span> <span id="s1132">There was -- in each block was a field kitchen and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Anthony: Did anyone, to your knowledge, bring portable kitchens?</span> <span id="s1134">I know it's been said that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Hanna: No.</span> <span id="s1136">No portable stove was brought.</span> <span id="s1137">A lot of peculiar things were taken along like coffee mills.</span> <span id="s1138">I mean, the most impossible things were taken along.</span> <span id="s1139">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Anthony: There was no opportunity, for example, to use electrical appliances?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Hanna: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1142">Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Anthony: This is a very, very primitive--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Hanna: There was electricity in each barracks but there was no -- there wouldn't have been a hookup for anything.</span> <span id="s1145">["Don't forget in those days, electrical appliances were much less frequent than they are today."]</span> <span id="s1146">Anthony: That's right, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Hanna: You had no electrical… ["You had no electrical appliances, so to speak, especially not heavy appliances."]</span> <span id="s1148">There was no such thing, there was maybe -- maybe some people took along a little field thing.</span> <span id="s1149">You know, like you have -- fed by, what is this stuff called, it comes in a can --.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Anthony: Propane?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Hanna: No, little cans.</span> <span id="s1152">["There were little drops of (unclear?)</span> <span id="s1153">(c.242)"] It was like dried alcohol.</span> <span id="s1154">It was like little bars of dried alcohol that you would ignite and maybe one other person had taken one of those little things but they usually only were for a cup or two, at most.</span> <span id="s1155">[“Eventually, other fuel ran out."]</span> <span id="s1156">Then there was no more.</span> <span id="s1157">But to say that anyone brought along any sort of cooking facility, appliances, or whatever, that is silly.</span> <span id="s1158">Just plain silly, that's plain silly and not thought out.</span> <span id="s1159">Because if you're being deported you don't think of these things.</span> <span id="s1160">Surely people grabbed peculiar stuff but not that, you know…like the one woman who had taken along a coffee mill.</span> <span id="s1161">Now what in the heck she grabbed that heavy coffee mill for, it was a Turkish one at that, a brass one, you know, I mean ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1162">["Don't forget most people didn't have more than two hours time to get their stuff together and pack."]</span> <span id="s1163">Anthony: You were an exception?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Hanna: [" I was an exception."]</span> <span id="s1165">Anthony: How did they wake you up in the morning at camp?</span> <span id="s1166">Particular wake-up time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">There was no--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Hanna: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1169">In the beginning there was a supervising person who came into the barracks and counted heads.</span> <span id="s1170">God forbid if one of the kids had slipped under the blanket and the number didn't come up right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Anthony: So they counted you in your beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Hanna: In the beginning, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Anthony: And these were beds or bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Hanna: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1175">We were on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Anthony: On the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Hanna: We were on the floor.</span> <span id="s1178">She was a very nasty person.</span> <span id="s1179">She would come in in the morning and count heads around 6:30, 7:00 o'clock.</span> <span id="s1180">When we had small children with us in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1181">You know how small kids are.</span> <span id="s1182">They are covered up to over their heads and she wouldn't immediately see them.</span> <span id="s1183">She would be furious if she didn't come out to the right count, and she would go over it and over it till she had all the numbers right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Anthony: These were wooden floors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Hanna: Wooden floors.</span> <span id="s1186">The barracks were wood.</span> <span id="s1187">They were only covered with tar paper, nothing else.</span> <span id="s1188">That's why we had so many leaks.</span> <span id="s1189">No, we were on the floor.</span> <span id="s1190">We were on straw.</span> <span id="s1191">Open straw in the beginning, they just had bales of straw in the beginning when we arrived.</span> <span id="s1192">Later on they gave us something to stuff the straw in, to make something that was a kin to a mattress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Anthony: More like a stable for animals than a bedroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Hanna: Exactly, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1195">In the beginning we were about 60 people per barracks.</span> <span id="s1196">Later on, it sort of thinned out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Anthony: Then how did people go to sleep?</span> <span id="s1198">Did they just lie down and fall asleep or was there an hour, a moment when everything was--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Hanna: I guess around ten o'clock or so, everybody, especially in winter, was ready to… ["Wasn't the light shut off?"]</span> <span id="s1200">No, the light was not shut off during the night.</span> <span id="s1201">The light was on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Anthony: All night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Hanna: They were on, at least one was on in the barracks so you could sort of... But around 10, I should think, 10, 11 o'clock, people sort of tried to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1204">You know, whatever sleep...</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Anthony: How many muddy feet did you have to walk to get to the toilet facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Hanna: [“That depended on the location of the barracks."]</span> <span id="s1207">Barracks, depends.</span> <span id="s1208">Some were very close to the latrine, some were rather far away so it was... ["I was in the barrack, for instance, where I could go on the rear and be closer to the latrine."]</span> <span id="s1209">We were sort of in the middle of the block so we had quite a hike.</span> <span id="s1210">[My mother was also in the middle of the block."]</span> <span id="s1211">So it was quite a hike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Anthony: Did resourcefulness enable you to deal with the mud problem, that is walking?</span> <span id="s1213">Footwear?</span> <span id="s1214">Were you able to--?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Hanna: Well, in the beginning, we had our own shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Anthony: They were not designed for this kind of hiking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">They were not designed for that sort of thing and you would sink in and they would be, of course, full of mud.</span> <span id="s1218">You would go and maybe when the water was running and wash them off and put them somewhere to dry out.</span> <span id="s1219">If you were stupid enough to hang them on the fence as I did once, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1220">So I lost a good pair of shoes that way in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1221">["That was irreplaceable."]</span> <span id="s1222">Irreplaceable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Anthony: What did you replace them with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Hanna: I had other shoes and when I worked in the office...</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Anthony: Because you had brought another pair with you?</span> <span id="s1226">Otherwise -- what if -- maybe you even knew of someone -- what if you didn't have shoes?</span> <span id="s1227">What if your shoes had been stolen or they were worn out, did anyone make provisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Hanna: Not that I can remember.</span> <span id="s1229">Now in the... I worked in the office after some time, and I was a messenger and stuff for the office.</span> <span id="s1230">Each block has its own office which then had to report to headquarters.</span> <span id="s1231">They had a pair of rubber boots.</span> <span id="s1232">I don't know how they had acquired them but they had a pair of rubber boots.</span> <span id="s1233">So when I had to run the errands...</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Anthony: You could borrow them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Hanna: I had these to get around in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Anthony: You had to return them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Hanna: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1238">They stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Anthony: Now given the lateness of the year, when you were deported, imagine that people took winter coats with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Hanna: Yes, most people had taken winter clothes and no matter how much we had, we were still cold.</span> <span id="s1241">No matter how many layers we managed to put on, we were still cold because it was damp and it Gurs through everything.</span> <span id="s1242">So that the clothes never was really dry.</span> <span id="s1243">You know, this dampness went through everything somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Anthony: How was laundry done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Hanna: Laundry was done whenever the water was running.</span> <span id="s1246">There were some troughs which in the beginning were troughs where we had to wash, out in the open.</span> <span id="s1247">Later on the women, at least, had a barracks with running water.</span> <span id="s1248">["We never did."]</span> <span id="s1249">There were some...</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Anthony: Men did not have--.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Hanna: It was simply a long basin probably about two feet across and maybe six, eight feet long.</span> <span id="s1252">It was tin-lined.</span> <span id="s1253">Above it was a pipe and simply had holes in it so the water would come out along these holes and the holes were placed probably eight, ten inches apart, something like that.</span> <span id="s1254">There was the water coming out of both sides of the pipe.</span> <span id="s1255">That was our facility to wash.</span> <span id="s1256">But at least it was indoors, it was closed.</span> <span id="s1257">We weren't standing in full view of the main street of the camp which the men always had to do.</span> <span id="s1258">The troughs that were outside, they were wooden troughs, we used that to wash the laundry.</span> <span id="s1259">So it was always a fight who was going to get the trough to put the laundry in there to wash.</span> <span id="s1260">Since we had very little soap, we sort of soaked the laundry and let it soak before we would use soap to wash it.</span> <span id="s1261">It was a hardship, especially in winter when it was cold.</span> <span id="s1262">The water was ice-cold.</span> <span id="s1263">Water was limited to three times a day for about two hours.</span> <span id="s1264">So it was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Anthony: And you would line-dry the ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Hanna: We would line-dry.</span> <span id="s1267">On the barbed wire, we would line-dry our belongings and stay with it.</span> <span id="s1268">Otherwise, bye-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Anthony: Stolen?</span> <span id="s1270">Socialism has a way of becoming robbery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Hanna: Right.</span> <span id="s1272">Look, some people came with very little.</span> <span id="s1273">The Spanish people who were in the camp for years had very little.</span> <span id="s1274">So ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Anthony: You were rich compared to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Hanna: We were rich compared to them in many ways.</span> <span id="s1277">They had many more small children that we had, in comparison.</span> <span id="s1278">["They were too much younger."]</span> <span id="s1279">They were much younger, of course, we were an over-aged group of people basically, you know.</span> <span id="s1280">Because most of the young people, whoever could had left Germany, right, and left behind were a small group of young people, a small group of children but mostly over-age people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Anthony: In fact, I still remember your description of the deportation -- you and six old women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Hanna: Five old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Anthony: Being escorted by how many guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Hanna: Twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Anthony: Twelve guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Hanna: Twelve guards with six helpless women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Anthony: Was the water drinkable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Hanna: The water in camp, yes.</span> <span id="s1289">We could drink the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Anthony: This came from the Pyrenees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Hanna: No.</span> <span id="s1292">The water could -- you know there's a lot of water in France you cannot drink but the water in Gurs, you could drink it.</span> <span id="s1293">There was no problem there.</span> <span id="s1294">["It probably came down from the mountains."]</span> <span id="s1295">I have no idea where it came from.</span> <span id="s1296">There was a water tank, very high up, as a matter of fact and insufficient, insufficient for the amount of people.</span> <span id="s1297">That's why we were so limited with water.</span> <span id="s1298">There is a picture of Gurs, I'm sure you have seen it.</span> <span id="s1299">It is actually taken from that water tower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Anthony: The water had better be drinkable since they were probably not serving wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">["No. "]</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Hanna: Hardly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Anthony: You never saw anybody drinking wine, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">["Oh, I wouldn't say that.</span> <span id="s1305">I am sure that I saw in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1306">Particularly when I was down there.</span> <span id="s1307">The French personnel had access to wine."]</span> <span id="s1308">Anthony: Of course, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Hanna: Not the refugees, not the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1310">["Neither would we spend the money on something as frivolous as wine."]</span> <span id="s1311">Look, in the beginning when we came to Gurs, we left Germany with 100 marks which was exchanged to us for 2,000 francs, right?</span> <span id="s1312">In the very beginning, when we came, my mother had a chance to buy one egg from a Spanish woman.</span> <span id="s1313">This one egg was 15 francs, okay.</span> <span id="s1314">You have 2,000 francs.</span> <span id="s1315">One egg was 15 francs.</span> <span id="s1316">You think anyone would spend money on anything frivolous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Anthony: No, although the French would not consider wine to be frivolous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">["No."]</span> <span id="s1319">Anthony: Can you give us some more idea of what the prices were?</span> <span id="s1320">Do you remember other purchases?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Hanna: No, I don't really.</span> <span id="s1322">But this really stuck in my mind that 15 francs for one egg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Anthony: The 2,000 francs are not going to last very long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Hanna: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Anthony: Especially if you have to buy a stove?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Hanna: Or whatever.</span> <span id="s1327">["Eventually we had canteens."]</span> <span id="s1328">They were started by the Spanish.</span> <span id="s1329">They were run by the Spanish in our block.</span> <span id="s1330">["In your block.</span> <span id="s1331">In our block we started our own.</span> <span id="s1332">We had one in the hospital which was run by Franken where you could buy some stuff…"] Anthony: You mean Mr. Franken?</span> <span id="s1333">Lily’s ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Hanna: Lily's husband.</span> <span id="s1335">["I was able to help him to get this which gave him some little income.</span> <span id="s1336">You could buy certain things like cans of beans at more reasonable prices than the black market."]</span> <span id="s1337">Anthony: Yeah, even cruddy prices on the sardines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Hanna: No, but in our block, in Block K, the canteen that existed when we came was run by the Spanish women.</span> <span id="s1339">The way we talked to them, actually my aunt, Helena Goldstein, spoke a fluent Italian, and so she could deal with the Spanish women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Anthony: Yeah, they're close enough, Italian and Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Hanna: She managed, and that's the way my aunt would, you know, manage to speak to them and deal with them.</span> <span id="s1342">What the others did, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1343">I guess with hand and any old way.</span> <span id="s1344">Eventually, everyone learned a couple of words of Spanish and they learned a couple of words of German, or French or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Anthony: French above all, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Hanna: Well, there were not too many among us who spoke French.</span> <span id="s1347">I know and some of us were reluctant to learn French but eventually we all did, didn't we?</span> <span id="s1348">They had to, we all had to.</span> <span id="s1349">["Those of us who did speak French were somewhat--had an advantage."]</span> <span id="s1350">Had an advantage, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Anthony: The stubborn ones who didn't want to learn French learned eventually, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Hanna: Yes.</span> <span id="s1353">Their life depended on it, eventually.</span> <span id="s1354">["The trouble you had if you spoke French was to acquire a sufficient amount of knowledge of the local dialect.</span> <span id="s1355">Because a lot of the people who worked there were locals.</span> <span id="s1356">This was not French."]</span> <span id="s1357">Anthony: Not Parisian French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Hanna: ["It wasn't even French."]</span> <span id="s1359">It was not literary French.</span> <span id="s1360">It was not only not literary French, it was almost Spanish."]</span> <span id="s1361">Anthony: Yeah, or Casablanca… Hanna: Yeah, it sort of changes there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">[“I had an awful amount of trouble to learn this."]</span> <span id="s1363">Anthony: You thought you knew French, and you found out that you had to re-learn it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Hanna: He did, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Anthony: No, but I mean he had to re-learn that French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">["At the time I left there, we communicated very well."]</span> <span id="s1367">Anthony: And then you had to go back to your more literary form of French when you finally got to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">["Yeah."]</span> <span id="s1369">Hanna: But you know... Even that French is a little bit different, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">["Sure.</span> <span id="s1371">That French is slightly different but not like Spanish."]</span> <span id="s1372">Like in any country, regionally the language changes.</span> <span id="s1373">["But by and large, the personnel in the Swiss internment complexes -- we had German Swiss, not French Swiss."]</span> <span id="s1374">Anthony: They spoke Volksdeutsch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Hanna: No, they spoke German.</span> <span id="s1376">Swissdeutsch.</span> <span id="s1377">But they know proper German, they're being taught proper German in school.</span> <span id="s1378">They don't like to speak it because it's a little foreign to them but there was no problem there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Anthony: Well, this is a lengthy postscript.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Hanna: We remembered everything?</span> <span id="s1381">I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">["I hope so."]</span> <span id="s1383">Anthony: Well, on that note I wish to thank you for....</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Hanna: You're very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Anthony: We thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">PAGE 2 PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT 1</span></p></body></html>
