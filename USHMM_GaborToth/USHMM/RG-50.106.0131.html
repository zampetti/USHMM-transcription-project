can you trace your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yeah, but I’m not -- I don’t want to say nothing, not yet, yeah.</span> <span id="s15">Maybe we’ll ask about Latvia?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: As far as I can remember, my grandparents were born in Latvia in eight -- 19th century.</span> <span id="s18">And my father and my mother, they came to Riga in 1934, and had a wedding over there and got married and lived in Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My father’s name

village called Babovka, and in the beginning he -- he studied in Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s23">But then he decided to drop it and became a tailor and when he came to Riga he established a small business.</span> <span id="s24">Yeah, a small business.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Did you -- do you have any siblings, any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: I have a half si -- a half sister.</span> <span id="s27">She was born in -- after the war, in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you have a large extended family in Riga, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes, I -- I had a -- a large extended family in Latvia actually, because my grandfather had 15 brothers and sisters, and of course, i-in those times, half of them died early.</span> <span id="s30">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: This is your grandfather on your father’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: On my father -- oh, yeah, my grandfather on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s33">But I-I have known three of his sisters and one brother, I have known personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Tell me where you lived in Riga.</span> <span id="s35">Were you in the center of the town, or on the outskirts?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: My father came over from Barovka, they rented an apartment in Sardonikova Street.</span> <span id="s37">Sardonikova Street was in the -- the so-called Moscow [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s38">And no -- how is it to say maybe less than a mile from the center of the city, because Riga was then a small town, only 300,000 people.</span> <span id="s39">And yeah, this was most -- a lot of Jews li -- used to live there and later it became a ghetto over there, so you should know the area, about.</span> <span id="s40">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: How would you describe the neighborhood, was it a middle class neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: I would mostly describe it as a working class neighborhood.</span> <span id="s43">Across the street they had -- it was not a church.</span> <span id="s44">In Russian language it was called bougadena, where they used to house poor people, you know.</span> <span id="s45">And I would say working class like shop owners or factory workers or small business people.</span> <span id="s46">Like my father was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: How did your parents meet each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, my parents met each other -- you -- the villages where they used to live are very close to each other, about six kilometers, I think, or maybe less from each other.</span> <span id="s49">So one village was called Skundaliena and the other was called Barovka.</span> <span id="s50">And they probably knew each other much earlier than -- before they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I -- I want to ask -- no, just ask me a person [tape break] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And so can you tell us a little bit about your mother’s family and background.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s55">My mother was born actually in Daugavpils in a hospital, but it was si -- six kilometers from the village called Skundaliena as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s56">And my grandmother, he -- her name was -- maiden name, Kuperschmidt, right?</span> <span id="s57">And my grandfather’s name is Hayman.</span> <span id="s58">So where they got married, they had a small farm, let’s say maybe 18 acres, s -- a -- a country store and a few cars, maybe seven cars and th-th-they possess some land.</span> <span id="s59">It -- it’s unusual, I think for the Jews to possess land, right, in Latvia.</span> <span id="s60">So they considered themselves more or less well -- well off, right?</span> <span id="s61">And so my mother actually, since her childhood, she worked in the farm and worked in the store and worked in the office, keep the book -- bookkeeping with her sister and older brother.</span> <span id="s62">Her older brother went to Daugavpils and then became a -- a -- a businessman.</span> <span id="s63">And she and her older sister and their mother, they -- they ran the st -- the business.</span> <span id="s64">And my -- on my father’s side, my father was a blacksmith and so they were poorer, much poorer.</span> <span id="s65">And my -- you see, my mother was a foo -- of the so called -- maybe they considered themself intelligentsia or something.</span> <span id="s66">So she married late, because she was very choosy, I think.</span> <span id="s67">So -- but she realized that my father was a good man and had a -- a head on his shoulders, so I guess it’s how -- what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: How religious were your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: This is a peculiar situation because my mother was never a religious woman, and my father was very religious.</span> <span id="s70">I remember that on holidays my grandfather used to send a -- a kishen.</span> <span id="s71">We’re talking in Yiddish, but it’s a pillow in English, with a -- with a chicken, you know, ga -- slaughtered chicken.</span> <span id="s72">I do -- even remember the blood in the kishen and the -- a-and the feathers, you know.</span> <span id="s73">And my -- my father tried to have a Jewish house, kosher, all of this, but my mother always resisted and sometimes my father was take -- would take a -- a knife my mother used to cut butter and then use it for meat, and throw it out the window.</span> <span id="s74">And this what the situation was.</span> <span id="s75">You know, so there was a -- you know, I would say, a contrarian interest.</span> <span id="s76">Of how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: A little disagreement, contention?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s79">[indecipherable] that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: What language did your parents speak to each other and to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: To each other they spoke Yiddish, but to me they always spoke Russian, and we lived in a -- in Latvia.</span> <span id="s82">Is -- but -- but in -- in those areas, they came from Latgalia where people mostly spoke Russian language more than Latvian, because it was close to Polish border too.</span> <span id="s83">So they spoke Polish, my mother spoke German and my father, of course, spoke Hebrew and Latvian and that.</span> <span id="s84">And my father served in Latvian army too, when he was a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did your parents feel that they were Latvian first, or Jewish first?</span> <span id="s86">What do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No, it’s hard for me to tell because I was very young, but I can imagine that when you live in a bu -- how it is, I -- of course they’re Jews.</span> <span id="s88">F-Fir -- first and foremost they’re Jewish people, but you’re loyal to your country where you live.</span> <span id="s89">It’s -- it’s why he served in the army, and dealt with the -- in business and everything, it’s -- it -- and he stayed, even -- he’s -- his brother actually left for Palestine in 1934 to become a chalut, but we stayed in -- now I want to turn off and I want to say something, but I don’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s90">Turn off, please.</span> <span id="s91">[tape break] What -- where did we stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Well, you were talking about this organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes, you see, in Latvia there was an organization called [indecipherable] and this organization actually an-anybody could belong to -- to this organization, but -- and my mother and my aunt, and probably my grandmother, I’m not sure, belonged to this organization, [indecipherable] just was a pure Latvian organization.</span> <span id="s94">I would call it guards, and because you were a property per-person, you should have belonged to this, especially in rural areas, that’s what I want to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: An-And did they belong?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yeah, they did belong to this organization.</span> <span id="s97">Of course, during the Soviet times it was forbidden and we’d not -- you wouldn’t mention that you belonged to this organization, but if a -- as a matter of survival you would like to belong to this organization, my mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Did it require her to do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, it didn’t require, probably only paid dues, and you know, probably only that.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: What are your very first memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I would say my fir -- very first memories, th-the coming of Soviet army in 1940.</span> <span id="s102">Maybe before I have some memories, but in 1940 I -- I remember standing by school number 56 [indecipherable] Soviet times it was number 56, and I saw Soviet tanks coming off Moscowyella, it’s a street called Moscowyella in Latvia.</span> <span id="s103">And I remember the small tanks, yeah.</span> <span id="s104">And where they parked, they were parked -- there was a -- a street called Zilnaw iela where the great synagogue used to stand, that they burned it.</span> <span id="s105">There was a cor -- small corner between Lacspiesa iela and Zilnaw iela and all the -- right there there was a corner where the Soviet tanks stood.</span> <span id="s106">And this I remember vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did you -- of course, you were born in 1936, so you were so very young, but before that time of the Soviet tanks, do you have any recollection of your parents talking about difficult times, hard times, a man named Hitler?</span> <span id="s108">Anything that brings back that memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I can tell you something about [indecipherable] I’ll tell you, my father was a small businessman and about maybe seven, 10 people used to work for him in the shop, tailor shop, and he made the suits for -- for a company.</span> <span id="s110">So after the Soviets came, of course he had to relinquish his business and what is interesting, that the Soviet government, they hired him to work for them in the army, to make uniforms, I think, and th -- and he was making good money, they paid very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: He was working as a civilian in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes, as a civilian, he was working in the Soviet army as a civilian, yes.</span> <span id="s113">And the -- the former, his employees -- you know, in -- in capitalist countries the employee not -- not always is satisfied with his salary or something.</span> <span id="s114">So they would -- before the Soviets came in, they knew they would come in, they said oh, when they come in, you -- you will not feel so good.</span> <span id="s115">After they came in, my father was hired by the Soviets and the workers made so little that they would meet my father and say, I -- how good it was when we worked for you, in comparison what we make now when we work for the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Let’s get back to your memory of when you were four years old, and you saw these -- the tanks coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s118">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Yeah, what -- can you describe -- what -- what your thoughts were?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: I-I -- I couldn’t have any thoughts for desse -- was too young to, I was not even -- 1940 I was under four years old, still.</span> <span id="s121">But I remember it very well, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Do you remember being frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No, I was never frightened, I couldn’t understand that actually, frightened or not, th-this is a -- not the -- the sense that I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What kind of school were you going to at four years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: At four years old I didn’t go to no school.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Oh, you were just standing on the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Oh yeah, I standing with my mother.</span> <span id="s128">I was standing on the corner and watching this passing by, that’s it.</span> <span id="s129">It’s a -- it’s a natural thing because you know, something new.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did she say anything to you, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No, I can’t remember that she -- she -- she told me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And then when is your next memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: My next memory is when the war started.</span> <span id="s134">In 1941, it was June.</span> <span id="s135">And I think -- I remember my father carrying me -- before that I would say when we left our apartment, we -- we possess some goods, especially with -- my father had some stuffs.</span> <span id="s136">I remember sacks of goods sitting on the floor, we lefted everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Now wha -- wha -- you’re talking about leaving your apartment, why were you le -- why were you leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Why we were leaving?</span> <span id="s139">We had to run.</span> <span id="s140">We had to run for our lives and I think my father took me on his arms.</span> <span id="s141">He only put on -- he had the leather, I remember, a black leather overcoat and my mother took a few things.</span> <span id="s142">She -- my father had the golden watch, and this overcoat and then he carried me to -- to the railroad.</span> <span id="s143">Not to the station, on the Lacspiesa iela there was an overpass.</span> <span id="s144">And that’s to the train.</span> <span id="s145">And I think this was the last train.</span> <span id="s146">And I remember -- I’ll tell you the truth, I remember shooting, and I think shooting and shooting and shooting a lot.</span> <span id="s147">And I wouldn’t say I can say for sure that they were bombing us at this particular time, but I am sure that the train was the last one to leave Riga.</span> <span id="s148">I can’t say the date, but this was the last train.</span> <span id="s149">And I was -- sat in the train, it was a mixed train of civilians and military.</span> <span id="s150">And we took off so slowly, it was so slow -- there was a place called Mezure Park, it’s -- Mezure Park it’s -- it’s like a forest park.</span> <span id="s151">It’s pine trees, you know?</span> <span id="s152">And it took us so many hours to get to Mezure Park, it was maybe five kilometers from us.</span> <span id="s153">And you know what happened?</span> <span id="s154">Turned out the military suspected that the m-machinist there, locomotive machinist, that’s called?</span> <span id="s155">He was probably a traitor is what we understood.</span> <span id="s156">So, I-I -- I saw it.</span> <span id="s157">They pulled him out of the locomotive, put him against the train and shot him dead.</span> <span id="s158">And since -- after that, the train began moving, and quickly -- pretty fast.</span> <span id="s159">And then suddenly, German airplanes came over us and began bombing.</span> <span id="s160">They began bombing, we left the train, began running into the forest.</span> <span id="s161">And I personally, I remember I fell into a pit, a very deep pit with water.</span> <span id="s162">I lost my parents, I didn't know where they are.</span> <span id="s163">And I woke up -- I-I woke up on the -- on the table, operating table, right in the forest.</span> <span id="s164">And the doctors, they patch me up.</span> <span id="s165">I -- I was wounded in my right leg.</span> <span id="s166">Even now I have a big scar.</span> <span id="s167">And yes, it’s how it happened.</span> <span id="s168">We boarded our train back and it turned out that the last three cars, railroad cars, they were blown apart, and my mama to -- mama told me that about 40 people died in the train.</span> <span id="s169">So, I think it was the last train, and from then we moved pretty good to-towards Estonia and we moved pretty fast I would say til we reached [indecipherable], then we came to Yeloslavil.</span> <span id="s170">Yeloslav Skyoblis, it’s a region, Yeloslav Sky -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Let’s move back a little bit.</span> <span id="s172">In between 1940 and 1941, betwine -- b-between the time that the tanks came in and the time you had to leave in that year, do you have any memories of that time, of --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Between 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: In Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: -- 1940 and 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: 1941.</span> <span id="s177">Do you have any memories of that time of things that were happening in the town?</span> <span id="s178">Did you parents say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s180">I-I -- I don’t have memories, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: I know you were very young.</span> <span id="s182">I know you were very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I have memories like, I would say, when I went to my grandfather, yes and you know how in a small, tiny village, there were probably fleas, and my mother didn’t want to keep him overnight over there.</span> <span id="s184">And then we went back to her village and I was running and suddenly a dog bit me on my left foot.</span> <span id="s185">And then I remember there was a circus passing by and the small pony was ki -- pulling a -- a wagon, and behind the wagon an elephant was tied up.</span> <span id="s186">This I -- I remember this, yeah.</span> <span id="s187">This kind of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s189">So during that year, between ’40 and ’41, between -- it had to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: -- i-it -- yeah, a-and you don’t have any --</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: -- other memories that were upsetting or frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: No, no, no, we lived pretty good.</span> <span id="s195">We -- we had the -- my mother w -- and my father, they lived really good life, I would say.</span> <span id="s196">My mother liked theater.</span> <span id="s197">Sh-She liked reading and going out.</span> <span id="s198">And I would say movies.</span> <span id="s199">She could tell you every name of a personage in the movie.</span> <span id="s200">She liked arts.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So until the Germans came in, life wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s206">How would you describe yourself.</span> <span id="s207">Again, you were very young.</span> <span id="s208">Were you very close to your parents, were you very dependent on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Wh-When you -- when you so small it’s -- especially in Jewish families, you know how it is when kids are very close to their parents and so it was -- what I can say, they very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: When it was time for you to leave -- you were saying how your father, you packed up things and you were -- you have memories of st -- of bags on the floor.</span> <span id="s211">What did your parents say to you?</span> <span id="s212">Why -- what did they tell a young child why you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, I-I -- I don’t remember this, I-I -- I can’t say nothing because I -- I don’t remember wh -- if they said anything to me or not.</span> <span id="s214">The only thing I know my mother told me, that my father didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s215">She said he told her, maybe we will overcome this situation, you know.</span> <span id="s216">But my mother loved me so much, and she never believed that -- that we’re going to be safe with the Germans.</span> <span id="s217">And so she insisted of leaving, yeah, this wa -- I -- I know for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So it was her --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yeah, her.</span> <span id="s220">My father was a m -- my father maybe a -- he was a smart person, I know that, but in this case, maybe he was a little naïve about -- like many -- so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Did other members of your extended family leave with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: You see, as I told before, my mother’s sister and -- and her brother, they lived in Skundaliena in next big town called Daugavpils, and my -- my … I’ll call it -- my mother’s uncle had seven kids -- seven children.</span> <span id="s223">Their name was Kuperschmidt and then the -- they remained in Riga with all -- with all seven kids and ob-obviously they were killed.</span> <span id="s224">And my grandfather remained in his town Barovka and he was shot.</span> <span id="s225">My mother’s sister, her name was Dwara.</span> <span id="s226">In Russian they used to call her Vera.</span> <span id="s227">She was kept alive with her son, as my mother told me, for awhile, because she was a translator for the Germans, translated from German into Latvian and Russian, I know this.</span> <span id="s228">And my ol -- uncle, with his wife -- yeah, ma -- my -- my aunt, she was married in 1935 or ’36 and her to a person named Opanansky, who was sa -- later in Soviet army, and he was killed in action.</span> <span id="s229">And she -- she had the small child, two years old, so was -- she was killed in -- with the small child, two year old male.</span> <span id="s230">And my u-uncle, he was shot in the -- in the fortress of Daugavpils with his wife and the three year old too -- male child.</span> <span id="s231">And then I had the -- my grandmother’s sister, on my mother’s side, sh-she -- she didn’t have her own kids, but she -- she married to a person who had his own four.</span> <span id="s232">But two of them escaped.</span> <span id="s233">One of them actually, a woman, I don’t remember her name, she was a communist.</span> <span id="s234">And in 1937 the -- she was caught by Latvian police and probably worked over good in the prison.</span> <span id="s235">And then they probably released her and she went to Russia.</span> <span id="s236">But you know what happened in Russia in 1937.</span> <span id="s237">So they -- they grabbed her and sent her to Magadan.</span> <span id="s238">She got married in Magadan, f-far eastern Pacific Ocean, she got married.</span> <span id="s239">And I saw her in 1957, she had a son.</span> <span id="s240">And sh-she spent 20 years in Magadan, from ’37 to ’57, it was precisely when I came from the army and I saw her.</span> <span id="s241">It was strange that she never blamed the communists for her misfortunes, which was very strange.</span> <span id="s242">And my grandmother’s si-sister, as I mentioned, they were business people, dealt in lumber and had properties and houses in Daugavpils, so everything gone.</span> <span id="s243">I even remember my f -- my uncle’s building had three stories in -- on Riga Street in Daugavpils.</span> <span id="s244">It stands now.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Speaking of the communist party, when -- before you left Riga, and did that word mean anything to you as a very young child, the communist party?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: No, if you ask me about the communist party, it never meant to me nothing because I -- a -- a -- nothing at all.</span> <span id="s247">The only th -- I began understanding wa -- the co -- what is it probably when I was nine, and I began s-seeing the pictures of Mr. Stalin, because before that I -- I -- I haven’t seen these, I never read nothing.</span> <span id="s248">There was no time for reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Before you left Riga, had you heard of a man named Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: No.</span> <span id="s251">I never heard th -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: So it was just the three of you who left, your mother, your father and you, and getting on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: As -- as far as I can -- as far as I can remember o -- for my family only.</span> <span id="s254">No, I would be wrong.</span> <span id="s255">I forgot my -- my father’s sister.</span> <span id="s256">She -- she was with us, too.</span> <span id="s257">Four people.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And you were together in one car?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yeah, we were together in one car, we went to this [indecipherable] an -- a village called Pol’kino.</span> <span id="s260">What is interesting, then we met over there a family, they were our neighbors.</span> <span id="s261">They lived next building from the yard across this.</span> <span id="s262">Their last name was Pantz.</span> <span id="s263">We met them in this town -- not town, it’s a village, Pol’kino.</span> <span id="s264">Because I was wounded my mother had to carry me once a week or whatever to a doctor about eight kilometers away for bandages.</span> <span id="s265">It’s an interesting story there.</span> <span id="s266">My father and some of his friends, they -- they tried to catch some fish in the river.</span> <span id="s267">And you know what?</span> <span id="s268">After all their efforts, they caught only one fish.</span> <span id="s269">One fish, I remember this, one fish.</span> <span id="s270">And why I remember that very good, because now my -- my daughters-in-law father, he came from Byelorussia -- but actually, it’s not like that.</span> <span id="s271">My son went to -- with his wife to Byelorussia with all his fishing equipment and I telled -- I tell him, you know what my son, you will not catch one fish over there, they ate it, everything.</span> <span id="s272">So -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Michael Lin.</span> <span id="s274">This is tape number one, side B, and you were talking about the fishing.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s276">The -- th -- good enough, my son returned from Byelorussia and he told me, I did catch one fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Just to get back to that beginning train ride, did your -- did you have enough food, what was the conditions like in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: We lived in the village Pol’kino for a short time, maybe f --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: No, no, no, I was talking about that train.</span> <span id="s280">Do you remember when you got on the train out of Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Ah, out of Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Did your mother -- did you have enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah, but this was -- oh, okay, on the train from Riga after we got bumped, we left these three railroad cars behind and I-I don’t remember precisely, but it took us very short time to reach Yaroslavl.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: What -- were ther -- was this a train car with seats?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No, this was -- as I mentioned before, this was a train, a mixed train with civilians and military.</span> <span id="s286">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: But did you have seats to sit on, did you have benches?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Wa -- yes.</span> <span id="s289">It was -- those cars were called, I remember, Pullman.</span> <span id="s290">You probably have them in United States, it’s what kind of here.</span> <span id="s291">It’s regular passenger c-cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And how did you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: We slept on benches.</span> <span id="s294">They have just benches, that’s it, nothing we -- no pillows, or mattresses or something like that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you take -- you were very, very young, did you take anything special with you, a special toy, something you wanted to play with?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, I-I think we didn’t have any time for taking more valuable things than toys.</span> <span id="s297">I don’t think we took anything with us besides just a few things, as a -- as I mentioned before.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: B-Before you left, did -- did the word ghetto ever -- was that ever mentioned?</span> <span id="s299">Did it ever mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: No, I wouldn’t say that the word ghetto ever meant to me anything, I -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So you left before the ghetto was established in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Obviously I left before the ghetto was established because as far I know from -- now I know from literature that the Germans entered Riga about July first, probably.</span> <span id="s303">And then we left with the last train, what can it be, 28th of June?</span> <span id="s304">So there was no time to waste and we had to run for our lives.</span> <span id="s305">That’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: So yo-you -- you’re saying you left the end of June?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yeah, twen -- yeah, I left 27th to 28th.</span> <span id="s308">This was the last train, I -- I thought I -- as far as I have in my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Why do you think your mother knew enough to leave?</span> <span id="s310">Well, how do you think she knew?</span> <span id="s311">I know this is looking back, obviously, as an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes, well I -- I -- later -- I-I can think that my mother is a -- was a woman -- she died already -- she was a woman of perception.</span> <span id="s313">I think she was a very bright woman.</span> <span id="s314">And besides, my mother mentioned to me that of course she s -- learned everything, she read newspapers and listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s315">We -- we knew what’s going on in -- in Germany and Poland, it’s obvious.</span> <span id="s316">And besides, w-we had the relative, I think, my mother mentioned him.</span> <span id="s317">Very removed, but he was a [indecipherable] I think, in Lithuania, I think, a [indecipherable] you know, the chief -- yeah.</span> <span id="s318">And he predicted that -- of course, I don’t know how they predict, but they know what they talking about.</span> <span id="s319">So we knew very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did your -- now you’re in Yaroslavl, what -- h-how -- did your wound heal all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s322">Yes, in this Pol’kino, it took me ow -- actually, I’ll tell you, maybe.</span> <span id="s323">You know, with this primitive medicine, they patched up my wound so badly that even now it’s -- you know.</span> <span id="s324">So it took me about eight months for me to heal it.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: How did your mother find you when you were thrown out of the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I don’t remember -- I don’t rememb -- I was on the ma -- on the table operated.</span> <span id="s327">I woke up, I see the doctors, my mother saw them -- me too.</span> <span id="s328">So wa -- wa-wa -- we were all running and the bombs were falling all over the place.</span> <span id="s329">And I saw the airplanes, they were very low.</span> <span id="s330">Actually, it was covers -- fa -- co -- forested area and only you could see th -- I would say from above, you could see the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s331">So -- so they can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Were there other children from other families on that train?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s334">I think I had a distant cousin who was me -- his name was Yosef Zaks.</span> <span id="s335">This -- it -- maybe I forgot a little bit, but my father’s first cousin, Riva Zaks, she was with her ch -- with her child, Joseph Zaks.</span> <span id="s336">Yeah, Yosef Zaks, in -- in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Do you remember talking to him on the train at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No.</span> <span id="s339">No, on the train, I -- no, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s340">I only m -- I -- met him only in 1945.</span> <span id="s341">She -- she was -- I would say -- this is personal, but I would say my mother loved me more than she loved her son, because my mother never gave me away to this -- how you say, we call it in Russian language the dom.</span> <span id="s342">It’s called, like for orphans.</span> <span id="s343">Orphanage.</span> <span id="s344">And -- and my father’s first cousin, she gave him away into orphanage.</span> <span id="s345">So my mother always mentioned that.</span> <span id="s346">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: How long did you stay in Yaroslavl?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: We stayed o-only for, I think a month.</span> <span id="s349">I want to say something about -- this is not Yaroslavl, this is Pol’kino, the village.</span> <span id="s350">One day I was walking alone, and I saw a peasant woman.</span> <span id="s351">And there wa -- high in the sky was an airplane, I guess it was a German airplane.</span> <span id="s352">And this woman took off a kerchief off your head and began waving to the German airplane.</span> <span id="s353">Yo -- I -- I think it was a sp -- how you say, a spy plane, yeah, and she -- I remember it.</span> <span id="s354">She -- she waved to the German airplane.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Did you tell your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, no, I -- I didn’t tell this, but I -- I kept it inside there.</span> <span id="s357">You ga -- I didn’t know what I -- what it is, but looking back I know what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Did you have enough food at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: In Pol’kino, yes, we -- we had what to eat -- we had what to eat, but if you want to know how it went further, our journey from Pol’kino to cur -- to central Asia, Dalino, it’s called Vallo Furginah, we’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Well, before we get there, I just want to talk about --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: [indecipherable] Pol’kino [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: -- you -- you had enough food.</span> <span id="s363">Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: We had a -- I remember th-there was a two story -- a two story house, I think.</span> <span id="s365">Yeah, even I remember the color, it was gray.</span> <span id="s366">Yeah, you know, there wasn’t hung -- a hunger right away of the first days of war.</span> <span id="s367">It started later.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: What does a five year old know about war at that time?</span> <span id="s369">What -- what -- do you remember questioning your parents?</span> <span id="s370">You were five years old, you had to leave your home, you’re in this new s -- town --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: [indecipherable] I was not five yet, September would be five.</span> <span id="s372">But I don’t think, when we talking about a five year old having any judgment to judge what the war is, or peace, it’s only the minute he feels it, in my opinion, he feels it, what a war is, you know, or what hunger is.</span> <span id="s373">But I don’t think it -- after awhile, if you, under peaceful conditions you have bad impressions, maybe if you personally affected, you know, physically, then you probably will remember, but otherwise I -- I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s374">It’s philosophical point, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Did you stay very close to your parents in Pol’kino?</span> <span id="s376">Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes, of course, it was my parents.</span> <span id="s378">We slept in one bed, obviously, you know.</span> <span id="s379">Since 1941 til 1944, I slept in one bed with my mother.</span> <span id="s380">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And then you stayed there and then when did yo -- how -- for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: We stayed in Pol’kino for about a month, I think.</span> <span id="s383">And this was already I would say end of July, or beginning of au -- August, and then we took off from there because th-the Germans were moving and actually it’s much to the north of Moscow, but they were moving qui-quick, I don’t -- I w -- I have to look up in a -- if the Germans reached Yaroslavl, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: And then you got back on another train?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s386">We got back on a train, but this was not a -- already not a Pullman, this was a cattle train.</span> <span id="s387">And we were sleeping on shelves, there were no pillows or mattresses or something like that and it took us about a month.</span> <span id="s388">Actually, we were changing trains.</span> <span id="s389">In the beginning my -- my mother told me we had the train loaded up with coal and we were sitting on the top of this sc -- railroad car with -- full with coal for awhile, until we got another one that was empty, a cattle train and we -- from there we went all the way down to -- to central Asia, as I said.</span> <span id="s390">That town was called Utchkulgan.</span> <span id="s391">A damned place, I would say.</span> <span id="s392">Damned.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s395">My father was still not in the army.</span> <span id="s396">They -- he probably got sick or something, they didn’t ask him til 1943.</span> <span id="s397">I remember 1943 they’d -- they -- they were all in -- lined up and when the [indecipherable] came, and they lined up and sent him off.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Bu-But now you’re still -- the three of you are still together.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yes, and my father’s sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Oh, the four of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: And my father and me and my mother, and we lived in a barrack.</span> <span id="s402">No, at the beginning I would say not, it’s -- was not a barrack.</span> <span id="s403">I remember January 1942, we lived in a big wooden house.</span> <span id="s404">And -- and the hunger began to set in.</span> <span id="s405">You know why I remember this very well?</span> <span id="s406">Because there was an 80 year old person, and he probably had money.</span> <span id="s407">And he had the girlfriend who was about 30 years old, so -- and we lived together in one room, about maybe, I would say 30 people.</span> <span id="s408">I remember another thing.</span> <span id="s409">He had money, so he bought some carrots.</span> <span id="s410">They dug a -- a -- a pit and buried the carrots into the pit and covered it so -- some food, right?</span> <span id="s411">So this -- what I want to say, this old man lived with this younger woman -- well she lived with him for -- of course for food.</span> <span id="s412">And suddenly this house burned down.</span> <span id="s413">It -- I remember snow in central Asia, snow.</span> <span id="s414">January there, snow.</span> <span id="s415">And then -- it was ’42, yeah, we moved to a barrack.</span> <span id="s416">My mother worked at the factory that used to make ropes, and she would leave me alone, obviously, in the barrack.</span> <span id="s417">Yeah, I was bitten by a scorpion at night once, in my left leg, and my father once reached into his pockets at night and got bitten in the -- in his hand.</span> <span id="s418">I would say with food the situation was so bad, if I tell you that I didn’t see any milk for four years, you wouldn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s419">And bread, they used to make it from a little cornmeal, how you say, the dark, dark bread, mixed with -- we call in Russian language mich.</span> <span id="s420">It’s a -- parts of sunflower seeds, but they’re not sunflower seeds, it’s the -- the waste of sunsower -- flower seeds, because you could see the --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: The hull.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: The hull -- hulk.</span> <span id="s423">No, hull --</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Hull.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Hull?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Hull.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: The outer part of the seed.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">Yeah, yeah, the -- the hull mixed together, it was kind of bread that he was yellow inside.</span> <span id="s431">In 1941 I’ll tell you -- we were going to sit here for a long time --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: In 1941 I caught malaria.</span> <span id="s434">Yes.</span> <span id="s435">An-And lucky for me -- and then I had a little bit pneumonia too, maybe in light form.</span> <span id="s436">I thought I’m going to die, I said my mama, I’m dead.</span> <span id="s437">I remember she began crying and all this, but survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Wh-Where were you living then?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Then, in Utchkulgan.</span> <span id="s440">No, th -- no, this was not Utchkulgan, this was Andejan.</span> <span id="s441">This was Andejan.</span> <span id="s442">And luckily for me, my grandmother’s brother lived there with his daughter-in-law in there -- and -- hi-his daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law’s daughter.</span> <span id="s443">This I have to tell you, his name was Moskevich.</span> <span id="s444">Velville Moskevich, Velville.</span> <span id="s445">In Russian language they call him Vladimir, but he was Velville.</span> <span id="s446">Actually we would say wolf in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s447">His son was a famous flyer, everybody knows him, Yakov Moskevich, a general and commander in chief of Soviet Air Force.</span> <span id="s448">Two times hero Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s449">As we know, he was arrested in 1941 and with other generals, and shot.</span> <span id="s450">So -- but in Uzbekistan where I lived in, they probably didn't know about the situation with him yet, so they supplied food to -- to his father.</span> <span id="s451">So it’s how we survived, because they didn’t know of the situation.</span> <span id="s452">But later on they arrested his daughter-in-law and sent her to -- to far away places, this I know.</span> <span id="s453">So I survived 1941.</span> <span id="s454">So I mentioned you about the burning down of the house.</span> <span id="s455">So, after that we moved to a barrack.</span> <span id="s456">I would say maybe seven families lived there, in the barrack.</span> <span id="s457">My mother worked at the f -- rope factory, suppli -- they supplied us with bread, as I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: We’re -- we’re in Utchkulgan now?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Utchkul -- yes, Utchkulgan.</span> <span id="s460">Tiny piece of bread, of this mixture.</span> <span id="s461">Tiny piece.</span> <span id="s462">It was absolutely piece -- if you -- if you press it in your hand, I-I think water would come out.</span> <span id="s463">There was a kindergarten, yeah, I attended kindergarten as I remember, but the food was, you know, a little pea soup.</span> <span id="s464">Whole day, that’s it.</span> <span id="s465">Believe me.</span> <span id="s466">So my -- my mother had to survive somehow.</span> <span id="s467">She began dealing -- how you say selling and buying fruits, vegetables, you know and selling and buying and sometimes she would go into the desert and collect tortoises, yes.</span> <span id="s468">She had a big, how you say, not a hammer, but an axe.</span> <span id="s469">And she would discard the par -- carapaces and only take meat out and the eggs, and bring it in a sack.</span> <span id="s470">One time she was really caught in -- in a storm.</span> <span id="s471">It was a terrible storm, I remember and -- but she brought the sack with -- with the turtles, anyway.</span> <span id="s472">She got sick, but -- but my father’s sister, she probably didn’t have a strong constitution my mother had.</span> <span id="s473">So sh-she began actually starving to death.</span> <span id="s474">One day she had diarrhea, they took her to a hospital.</span> <span id="s475">And they took her hospital -- after she became a little better they fed her sauerkraut soup.</span> <span id="s476">And you know what it is, sauerkraut soup?</span> <span id="s477">You eat it, in a few hours you’re dead.</span> <span id="s478">That’s what happened to her.</span> <span id="s479">I remember it was raining, ter-terrible rain and my father was coming from the hospital and he was crying.</span> <span id="s480">Yeah, it’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Were -- were -- was your family able to bury her?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: I-I don’t remember actually, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s483">I don’t remember how they did it because they didn’t take me with -- with them.</span> <span id="s484">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: What was your father doing?</span> <span id="s486">Was he working?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yeah, my father was working.</span> <span id="s488">In the beginning, I don’t know what he did.</span> <span id="s489">In the beginning we -- we’re together with the Bukara Jews, you know, Bukara Jews, they used to have collective farms over there, they used to go to synagogue over there in b -- with the Bukara Jews, but later I don’t -- I can’t say that I remember.</span> <span id="s490">Go -- in 1943 he was drafted to -- into the army and he never came back.</span> <span id="s491">And [indecipherable] when I lived in barrack, the situation was so bad about -- I think it was about like Ethiopia in modern times.</span> <span id="s492">I -- I was then seven years old, a-and a young guy maybe 10 years old lying on the floor on a mattress, and you -- he was squirming like, because he was dying.</span> <span id="s493">And I was with him together in this room.</span> <span id="s494">I remember getting so scared I crawled along the wall and bolted the door and ran and ran til I -- I don’t know for how long I ran.</span> <span id="s495">I stopped and I -- in a few hours I came back and I remember some me-medical personnel, of course not in a car, medic -- some medical personnel gave him an injection, I think and he died over there.</span> <span id="s496">He was swollen like three times his regular size, I -- I’d -- I think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: So while you were there, you said you went to kindergarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Why did I -- why --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: When you were there, you went to kindergarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yes, I don’t remember what year I went to kindergarten, but probably it was ’42.</span> <span id="s501">For awhile -- I didn’t even go for a long time there, because you know, there was no -- there was no food over there, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Were you parents very comforting to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Well, everything they could get, they -- what can I say about my parents?</span> <span id="s504">The best in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: I-I was just wondering what you tell a young chil -- what a parents says to a young child going through such traumatic experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: I-I don’t remember actually, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s507">F -- my -- of course my mother, what can she do?</span> <span id="s508">She comfort you and the -- if there’s no food you -- what can you do?</span> <span id="s509">You want a piece of bread, but how to get it?</span> <span id="s510">So when we had these turtles it was already a holiday, right?</span> <span id="s511">But this was already when my father was in the army.</span> <span id="s512">I remember it when she began going into the desert to get these turtles.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How long -- how long did you stay in Utchkulgan?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: In Utchkulgan we stayed til 1944, when my mother got news from Ural mountains -- beyond Ural mountains, it was the cor -- valley -- it’s not a valley, actually.</span> <span id="s515">Beyond the Ural mountains there was a town called Tavda.</span> <span id="s516">So in 1944 -- you know, I had nothing to wear, because we lived in a s -- I -- I -- actually, I was sick for three years with malaria, right?</span> <span id="s517">I got some quinine, right?</span> <span id="s518">I remember sitting on the -- in 120 degrees Fahrenheit sitting on -- on the -- on the stone and shaking.</span> <span id="s519">You know what malaria is?</span> <span id="s520">After three years of malaria?</span> <span id="s521">So, my mother got the news that my father’s first cousin, he was a -- a soldier in Tavda, there was a -- a prison for -- maybe for all kind of people, political and the criminal elements.</span> <span id="s522">And they called her to come over there.</span> <span id="s523">So I had nothing to wear so my mother knitted something for my feet, and it was December already.</span> <span id="s524">You know, I had to wear this.</span> <span id="s525">We stopped over in [indecipherable] town, right?</span> <span id="s526">Now it’s probably called Orenburg, if I can remember.</span> <span id="s527">I look out the window -- you know, we took a train, right?</span> <span id="s528">We come to Orenburg.</span> <span id="s529">We stayed only there, my mother had to look -- somebody told her maybe my father is alive, because she got the news that he was released from the army because of sickness, but she couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s530">We stayed over -- the wind was sweeping -- this is an open plain, no forest over there and the wind was sweeping so horribly that my mother couldn't take it any more, so we -- we boarded a train to Swedlofska and from there to Tavda.</span> <span id="s531">I’ll tell you, we had the very [indecipherable] small luggage.</span> <span id="s532">There was no -- no luggage, actually, and she placed it on the -- on the floor and somebody wanted to steal.</span> <span id="s533">So my mother was pretty alert, she gave him a -- a kick in the behind so he fell in -- on the railroad tracks, I remember that.</span> <span id="s534">When we boarded the train -- of course there are no toilets.</span> <span id="s535">There are toilets, but you know what, no heat.</span> <span id="s536">So the human excrements and all this urine, was frozen and piled up I would say maybe three feet high.</span> <span id="s537">Yeah, and that’s how we traveled to Tavda.</span> <span id="s538">This was not Tavda, it was called a town, Saragolka.</span> <span id="s539">You see, I remember all the names.</span> <span id="s540">Yeah, it was Saragolka.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Wh-What was it like when your father was called up into the army?</span> <span id="s542">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: No.</span> <span id="s544">I -- I -- I wouldn’t say that I remember.</span> <span id="s545">I only, when I -- as I mentioned, I saw him lining up on the -- on the sk -- square of this town, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: D-D you remember missing him and asking where he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: I don’t remember missing or asking where he was.</span> <span id="s548">I-I -- I don’t -- I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s549">I -- I-I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So when he left it was just the two of you, you and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s552">After he left, my aunt died, just me and my mom, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s553">Two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did you mix with other children at that time, when you were in Utchkulgan?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: No, I wouldn’t say that I mixed with any other children, I was by myself.</span> <span id="s556">By myself all day.</span> <span id="s557">You know -- you know the two --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: What -- what did you think about?</span> <span id="s559">What did you do to occupy your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: What did I do to occupy my mind?</span> <span id="s561">I was looking for food, and you know what?</span> <span id="s562">I remember this case -- you see, I am shaven now, right?</span> <span id="s563">I am 63 years old now and I am shaven.</span> <span id="s564">It’s how I was shaven when I was seven or eight years old.</span> <span id="s565">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s566">You know p-peaches -- actually not, apricots.</span> <span id="s567">And the Usbecks, of course they had their orchard in somewhere else -- there was a market, surrounded by a high wall, as they do it in Asia, was a clay wall.</span> <span id="s568">So one time I stole a -- you know, I stole a melon from one Usbeck, and he ran after me with a n -- with a knife.</span> <span id="s569">But he -- of course he couldn’t catch me.</span> <span id="s570">And the -- in the corner I remember there was a bank, and the bank had a nest of wasps.</span> <span id="s571">Yeah, the wasps, of course, the melons are not like in this country, they are a little bit be -- sweeter and better.</span> <span id="s572">The wasps has very sm -- good smell, right?</span> <span id="s573">So they attacked me and bit me se -- I di -- I remember seven times in my head.</span> <span id="s574">So my head had big bumps.</span> <span id="s575">Then I -- in order to survive I collect -- I of -- of course I dropped this melon, what could I do?</span> <span id="s576">And in order to survive I would pick up the seeds from apricots.</span> <span id="s577">But a -- I remember being ashamed doing this, so I wouldn’t do it bending, with my hands, but I would pick them up with my feet.</span> <span id="s578">With my toes.</span> <span id="s579">With my toes, yeah.</span> <span id="s580">And collected them ca -- then coming home and taking a -- a stone and breaking, and they were nutritious.</span> <span id="s581">So -- so I ate like the s -- the seeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Why did you not have any hair on your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: You see, during the war we had the la -- lice.</span> <span id="s584">In order to get rid of them we had to shave our heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Wh-Who did that for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I -- I actually don’t remember who -- who shaved my head, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Was that hard for you, as a small child?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No, I had no feeling there about having hair or not having hair, probably the same I don’t have now.</span> <span id="s589">I don’t remember having any feelings about styles.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Did that hold true for your mother too, did she have to have her hair taken off?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Oh no, my mother never shaved her head, no.</span> <span id="s592">She didn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: So now, your father had gone and your -- yo-you’ve moved -- you’ve continued on your journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes, we came to Saragulka, was December 1944, and my father’s first cousin, his name was Ulman, Schmul Ulman -- Schmel Ulman, Schmel, Schmel, yeah.</span> <span id="s595">And my grandfather’s sister, my -- my f-father’s side, she was there too with her daughter.</span> <span id="s596">And it turned out that Siberia was much better than central Asia in -- as food is concerned, because my mother began working, not chopping wood, but sawing wood, you know, big logs of -- she worked all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: How had your mother’s health been up to that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: You know, it’s very interesting, my mother’s health was very good.</span> <span id="s599">She was a very strong woman despite later starting to complain about high blood pressure or something, but I remember she had her -- her -- when she was younger, she had her, you know, w-women’s characteristics a little, about -- complaining or something, but actually her health was pretty good, considering the horrible times.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Michael Lin.</span> <span id="s602">This is tape number two, side A. I just wanted to ask you, when you were in Uzbekistan, were -- did your mother know what was happening in Europe, and if so, did she talk to you about it?</span> <span id="s603">Did you as a child, have any idea of what was happening with the war, and the Jews also?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: I-I -- I would say I-I can’t recollect if she was talking with me about the war, and these other things.</span> <span id="s605">The -- mostly we were talking about food, I think.</span> <span id="s606">To me was, at least the -- but what was happening, of course she knew what was going on, but she never talked with me about the situation, I would say.</span> <span id="s607">And I never attended school yet, I was in a -- I don’t think I had any strength to attend any school.</span> <span id="s608">I was young til then from -- I began going to school, I was only eight years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s610">You were living under these terrible times, under these terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s611">Did you -- and -- and did you feel very Jewish?</span> <span id="s612">Did you -- were you angry that these sad times were happening to you because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s613">Did any of those thoughts come through your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: You see, the -- I -- I didn’t know what Jew and not Jew is.</span> <span id="s615">Later on I real -- I understood what a Jew is or not a Jew, but at a young age I probably didn’t understand what it is, what -- to be Jewish or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s616">I -- I -- I didn’t know nothing about it yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: I-I was just asking were you -- in case you were angry that this is happening cause you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No, no I -- I couldn’t say that, because later on when I understood, then I -- I knew what it is to be a Jew, but in th -- then, I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s619">Now, my mother, of course, ne -- obviously I -- I don’t even want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s620">But she knew all the situation, but she never converse with me about this -- what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: So now it’s December 1944 --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yes, it’s December 1944, we come to Saragulka.</span> <span id="s623">Seemed like it -- the end of the world.</span> <span id="s624">There was a -- a sc -- a school, I began going to school at the edge of the village.</span> <span id="s625">A -- a s -- a small -- and there was a club.</span> <span id="s626">S-Strange enough, I began performing i-in the club, ju -- reciting poetries suddenly, I remember.</span> <span id="s627">And s --</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: You were now eight and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes, I was about eight and a half years old.</span> <span id="s630">I be -- I remember applaud -- applauses.</span> <span id="s631">I don’t even know where I got this poetry from, you know, and declamations, you know, this kind.</span> <span id="s632">I don’t even know.</span> <span id="s633">I don’t remember how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Did your mother recite poetry to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Probably she did.</span> <span id="s636">My mother probably said it, poetry to me, because when I last saw her, she was close to 85, she was still reading in German and reciting great authors.</span> <span id="s637">Yes, she had the very good memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: What language were you reciting your poetry in?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Of course in Russian, it was Russia.</span> <span id="s640">Obviously.</span> <span id="s641">So, Russian language.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Did your mother -- when you were very young, did your mother sing you any songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I-I can’t say that.</span> <span id="s644">But there’s an interesting case, when I was younger, I can remember.</span> <span id="s645">Maybe it’s imagination or something like, about the angels.</span> <span id="s646">I remember was a taholim, as they say in Yiddish, like a dream.</span> <span id="s647">But I was lying in bed, I think I was maybe three years old, or four and I saw somebody in white clothes above me, hovering above me, and I -- I-I think it was an angel.</span> <span id="s648">And I -- even now, I -- after all these years I think that angels exist.</span> <span id="s649">I remember this, yeah, it was wa -- I-I never forget.</span> <span id="s650">I tell my -- my sons that angels exist, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Di -- had your mother sang you any songs about angels?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: No.</span> <span id="s653">I don’t think my mother -- she was not a religious woman, so it was a -- of course she knew th-the Bible.</span> <span id="s654">My father used to tell her stories from the Bible.</span> <span id="s655">I -- I remember this very well, about -- yeah, I can -- now I recall when we -- when we led me to this.</span> <span id="s656">I recall it, about -- about Eliyahu Nawi, I recall when -- when my -- my father used to tell stories about how he u -- would be invisible, go to place, to place, help people and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s657">I -- I recall it vividly now because it has to come to me, you know, maybe I have something I forget, but I remember, yeah.</span> <span id="s658">From the Bible my father used to tell a lot of stories to my mother from the Bible and she would -- yeah.</span> <span id="s659">Sometimes you s -- like you see dead people.</span> <span id="s660">My mother told me a story, she thinks she saw her mother in the -- in the square.</span> <span id="s661">O-Of course I don’t believe this, but maybe she imagining, but it’s what she told me.</span> <span id="s662">Yeah, it happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Do you remember your father conducting any Passover Seders?</span> <span id="s664">Do you remember your father conducting any Passover Seders?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Not that -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s666">I don’t think we would be -- as I mentioned to -- when they -- he -- he used to go to the Bukara Jews in Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s667">I was not a participant, he -- he would go by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: So, I-I -- he -- I don’t think we would be able even to conduct any Passover Seders if you don’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s670">You could only use your hands, nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: And -- and no memory of Seders when you were very young and in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yeah, I remember -- well, I would not -- not say that we -- I have memories of Seder, but I remember o -- the -- when they bought fish, usually a -- a live pike, long pi-pike, long.</span> <span id="s673">And the fish was alive, I even dipped my finger into his -- caught me by -- yes, caught me, th-the pike caught me, it’s a vicious fish, yeah.</span> <span id="s674">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: An-Any memories of sitting around with other relatives at a Seder table in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No, I-I don’t have these memories, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Mm-hm, okay, we’re move -- we’ve moved forward and you’re in S-Saragulka?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yes, w-we’re in Saragulka and it’s wintertime, December.</span> <span id="s679">You see, th --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: December ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, December ’44.</span> <span id="s682">And it was a much better place, at least we started school, going to school in the middle of season.</span> <span id="s683">And the school was about a -- a sh -- a small -- not a building, a -- a house, a wooden house in i -- in one -- in one room the -- the teacher had four classes, starting with first and -- to fourth, yeah.</span> <span id="s684">Right on the edge of the forest.</span> <span id="s685">They used to tell me that bears are crawling around during summertime.</span> <span id="s686">Because they had this tree they called in Russian, Kairda, but it -- it se -- they have seeds.</span> <span id="s687">In Siberia they have this -- maybe it’s called pignolis, in Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Oh, pignoli seeds.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yeah, it’s -- actually it’s -- they look like pine trees, but they have the seeds, very edible, contain a lot of -- of oil, so it’s very -- so we use -- they used to collect this, the autumn time.</span> <span id="s690">Then they used to go hunting too.</span> <span id="s691">One times -- wintertime I saw my father’s cousin with his soldier -- fellow soldiers, going a hunting expedition, bear hunting.</span> <span id="s692">And I don’t know what gratta -- hit me.</span> <span id="s693">I was sitting in my shorts, actually.</span> <span id="s694">The houses over there are very peculiar.</span> <span id="s695">They’re very long, wooden houses, and the entrance is from both sides, both sides of the houses.</span> <span id="s696">So I was sitting on the one side, the end of the house and looking through the window I see the soldiers going bear hunting.</span> <span id="s697">And I -- I bolted out through the door, it was about 40 degrees Centigrade, minus, and I jumped on the sleighs, and my hands and knees got stuck to the sleigh, so they had to pull me off the -- the steel.</span> <span id="s698">I was crying, of course, but they know what to do, they put in a -- in a big pot they put some cold water and they dip your hands into -- in this cold stuff.</span> <span id="s699">Yeah, but it’s very painful.</span> <span id="s700">So, it was a much better place than in the Uzbekistan, plus they had some dried nettle.</span> <span id="s701">Nettle is a -- in Europe -- they have in America or not, I don’t even know?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, so you make soup o -- from it, in your -- nettle.</span> <span id="s704">Then they had potatoes and because here the celery, he was a guard over there in the prison.</span> <span id="s705">And so it was much better than in central Asia.</span> <span id="s706">But in a few months they -- they drafted him and he joined the army.</span> <span id="s707">I mean, in the front, he went to the front in 1945.</span> <span id="s708">So we stayed til May 1945, we stayed in Saragulka.</span> <span id="s709">And -- and then we t -- went to Riga, but I don’t even remember what trains we took, was it the passenger trains or any other.</span> <span id="s710">I -- I -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Le-Le-Let’s talk a little bit about May 1945.</span> <span id="s712">How did -- th-the war is over?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yes, the war was over, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: What did that mean to you as a eight and a half year old child?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: You see, they tell me the war is over, we’re going home.</span> <span id="s716">And what can I say, we’re going home.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t think I had very -- a reaction very viv -- I don’t remember that I had a reaction, positive or negative.</span> <span id="s718">I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Was there any celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I don’t think we celebrated anything, no.</span> <span id="s721">But j-just casually.</span> <span id="s722">We had a patch of potatoes, so we sold it, this potato patch.</span> <span id="s723">Yeah, my mother and my relatives, they had a patch of potatoes and they sold it to somebody and -- and we went to Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: How did you hear about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: I think my -- my mother had a -- news from somebody.</span> <span id="s726">It was not official.</span> <span id="s727">It was not official, somebody told her something, that he’s supposed to come home.</span> <span id="s728">And he never came.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Did you miss your father while he was gone?</span> <span id="s730">Did you talk about him a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No, as I mentioned, I -- I don’t remember talking about my father.</span> <span id="s732">Me -- maybe I did, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s733">But did I miss him, or -- I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Or your mother talk about him to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No.</span> <span id="s736">I am -- I am telling you maybe I’m a little angry at my mother, that she didn’t search for him, but she told me she couldn’t take it in -- in Skalif the weather was so bad and we sat at the railroad station and there’s no food and no clothing and no nothing.</span> <span id="s737">She couldn’t ex -- possibly to look for him.</span> <span id="s738">I remember the wind, it was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s739">So maybe I shouldn’t blame her, but it’s how -- what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: So now it’s May 1945 and your mother’s preparing to leave and to go back to Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: We’re not preparing, we just -- we just left and that’s it.</span> <span id="s742">We sold our patch of potatoes and took a long way from -- it’s not Ural mountains, but beyond Ural and we came to Riga.</span> <span id="s743">It was in May or beginning of June -- I wouldn’t -- I -- I remember passing by, there are a lot of cemeteries, there were cemeteries, some were close to Leningrad.</span> <span id="s744">And a lot of German soldiers, I remember, buried over there, with crosses, crosses, crosses, crosses, I remember those cemeteries, for miles, seems to me.</span> <span id="s745">And you can -- the northern route we took.</span> <span id="s746">We took northern route and we came to Riga in -- in May, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Did you have any memories of Riga from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: No, from before I didn’t -- I probably did, yeah.</span> <span id="s749">I remember the f -- I remember vividly the street and I remember this bogaden as I told you, the f -- the poor house, like -- like a church, it was a hospital hou -- for the poor.</span> <span id="s750">I remember the yard, it was like a -- the buildings were about five stories high, I think, I’m -- and there was a yard, and buildings surrounding the yard.</span> <span id="s751">I remember this is -- yes, and the school where I stood in 40 -- 1940 in the street, Menishnai and th -- and the other Yikapils over there and Lascpiesa street and Moscow Street, I -- yellow, in Latvian language, it’s called yella.</span> <span id="s752">I remember them.</span> <span id="s753">They were --</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Wer -- were you happy about returning?</span> <span id="s755">Were you excited?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: No.</span> <span id="s757">I-I don’t recall that I was any different from -- you know there was a few Jewish families in -- in Urals and I remember a brother and sister there from Harkov in Ukraine.</span> <span id="s758">And yeah, we did a few things that I recall.</span> <span id="s759">Yeah, I remember -- this I will tell you.</span> <span id="s760">One time, what they did, they -- they made for me like boots, high boots, called buky.</span> <span id="s761">And one day, it was probably January, there was only one tractor and one lorry.</span> <span id="s762">Lorry is in English a truck.</span> <span id="s763">And it was disabled.</span> <span id="s764">Zilfife the lorry was.</span> <span id="s765">So the tractor was pulling the lorry and we kids were running after this -- the lorry.</span> <span id="s766">And we got into -- deep into the forest, everybody of the kids they jumped into the top, I would call it, of the truck, and I tried to do it too.</span> <span id="s767">So unfortunately I stepped on the -- on the wheel, and the wheel turned and my left leg got under the five ton truck.</span> <span id="s768">And the kids didn’t see me, so they left me alone crying in the forest, and you know.</span> <span id="s769">So I -- I cried and I called and called and called til the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s770">And during the war, because they probably didn’t have adults, so a 15 year old, about, a girl was checking the tracks, and she saw me.</span> <span id="s771">She grabbed me, put me on her shoulders and brought me home to the village.</span> <span id="s772">So -- yeah, for three months I -- I had this swollen leg, but fortunately nothing broke.</span> <span id="s773">Probably the snow was so thick and soft that it just pressed into the so -- snow and didn't break my leg, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did you experience any anti -- any anti-Semitism when you were in Russia?</span> <span id="s775">You said this Russian girl brought you home --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: -- which was a positive.</span> <span id="s778">Did you have any negative experiences with the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: During my chil -- early childhood, the seven, eight, and ni -- I’ll tell you, the first experience in anti-Semitism I probably began having when I was in fifth grade, I think, understanding -- understanding what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Okay, now you’re back in Riga and where did you s -- where did you and your mother settle?</span> <span id="s781">Did you go back to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No, we didn’t go back because my mother went over there and this was alre -- a ghetto region.</span> <span id="s783">And he -- she remembers she climbed the stairs, everything broken over there of -- piled up.</span> <span id="s784">So she just turned around and run from there.</span> <span id="s785">But r -- as I mentioned, we left a -- a lot of stuff over there.</span> <span id="s786">So one day my mother came back -- I don’t remember whether -- our neighbors, where they lived then.</span> <span id="s787">She entered their apartment alone, and you know what?</span> <span id="s788">She found -- she had -- in those times there was style overcoat with a fox -- entire fox over the shoulder, right?</span> <span id="s789">You maybe remember right?</span> <span id="s790">And she found this.</span> <span id="s791">She found -- she took away the overcoat, and the fox.</span> <span id="s792">She found a golden watch.</span> <span id="s793">And I think a few other things.</span> <span id="s794">And she told me about that.</span> <span id="s795">And this is interesting because h-her friend told her, why you didn’t take everything away from her, what belonged to you and even didn’t belong to you?</span> <span id="s796">And my mother says, I wouldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s797">[indecipherable] I only took what I saw mine, and nothing else.</span> <span id="s798">That’s how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And then where did you settle in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: In Riga we settled -- they gave us a room on the -- by the small Daugava -- small Daugava upe.</span> <span id="s801">And Dauga upe, it’s a -- a river, upe in Latvian language, upe.</span> <span id="s802">And there were -- it was a -- a church for the old believers.</span> <span id="s803">There is a church for old believers somewhere, from Moscow a small street takes you.</span> <span id="s804">And they gave us a room in the -- in the house that belonged to the old believers before.</span> <span id="s805">I think it was even beyond the walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: When -- when you say they gave us a room, who was they?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Nu -- who gives us?</span> <span id="s808">The -- probably the government, probably, or whoever they -- who gives you -- you don’t enter the room by yourself, right?</span> <span id="s809">So somebody gave you the room.</span> <span id="s810">So i -- after the war the si -- the situation was pretty bad with food.</span> <span id="s811">My mother managed always somehow to survive, so she began trading.</span> <span id="s812">There was a -- a market, you know, in old stuff, clotheses and all, she sells and buys.</span> <span id="s813">Then she had connections with the army.</span> <span id="s814">She would get some American sugar, and -- it’s called tushunka, it was -- it was canned meat, you know, from America.</span> <span id="s815">And I remember it was very tasty, very tasty.</span> <span id="s816">So in 1946 she got married.</span> <span id="s817">Actually ’45 or ’46, and he was a -- a soldier, he served in the army, his name was Raishstain.</span> <span id="s818">Raishtain, Hugo Raishtain.</span> <span id="s819">Actually, his name was -- Hugo is he called himself, but he -- actually Kyos his name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: When da -- when did you definitely hear about your father?</span> <span id="s821">When did you and your mother definitely hear about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: About our father?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Well, what had happened to your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: About my father, I mean?</span> <span id="s825">I -- I th -- up til now I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s826">My mother thinks sh -- that he died on the way home.</span> <span id="s827">Or somebody -- even -- she even mentioned maybe he had the -- a little money, and maybe somebody killed him, or he died -- or he died because he was sick, is what --</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: So you never got any definite information?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: I never got any information about my father, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: So your mother remarried, and you’re at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes, my mother remarried, but he was an invalid, actually.</span> <span id="s832">He got hit in the leg and -- in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Were there other Jewish children who had returned like you did, and did you spend time with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yes, I had, later on in -- already in third, fourth grade and I -- I had Jewish kids, friends of mine, Lotkin, Izzie Lotkin, Joseph Pomeranzif.</span> <span id="s835">I don’t even know --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Did you talk about what you had experienced with these other children, during the war?</span> <span id="s837">Did you -- did you as children speak about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: No, I wouldn’t say that I talk with them about our experiences.</span> <span id="s839">The only -- the only person I would talk with is -- I mentioned before my -- Riva Moskevich, my father’s first cousin had the son, yu -- Joseph.</span> <span id="s840">So with him we were friends.</span> <span id="s841">He was my third cousin, I would say.</span> <span id="s842">With him we talked about a lot.</span> <span id="s843">But beside that, I-I-I -- I talked very little with my mother.</span> <span id="s844">Was -- probably there was a reason, I didn’t like sh-she -- she remarried, probably, you know.</span> <span id="s845">And many times I would run away from home and slept in -- underground -- you know big buildings, they have basements.</span> <span id="s846">I would slip -- it’s wintertime and there were gangs, even kids of my age, 10 - 12 years old, 14, I joined with the gangs, you know.</span> <span id="s847">Not rough stuff or some, no, but just we had gangs, called spana in Russian language.</span> <span id="s848">Moscow gang or -- or [Russian] gang or some -- from other parts of the city.</span> <span id="s849">So we fought each other, you know, with sticks and stones and clubs and bottles and those --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Did you -- did you feel very tough because you had been through such a difficult childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah, I was very tough, I felt it tough, because I’ll tell you, I didn't hesitate to use my fist right away.</span> <span id="s852">If I didn’t like, or somebody bothered me, I would use my fist right away, bam and that’s it.</span> <span id="s853">I didn’t know any better, you know?</span> <span id="s854">Very tough, I was very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Well, you had seen so much as a young child, and ha -- and been through so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: I don’t know what th-the reason, because I’d been through so much, or just the character.</span> <span id="s857">I can’t judge, but I was pretty tough.</span> <span id="s858">I was hit one time by an -- one guy hit me with a knife on my chin, a little.</span> <span id="s859">Well, since -- we run barefoot on asphalt, since I -- I was -- you know, barefoot, I never knew what footwear is.</span> <span id="s860">I’ll tell you the truth, my f -- soles of my feet were so thick.</span> <span id="s861">I used to like to play soccer and ice hockey, you know, so we play on a -- in the dusty field soccer and a nail hit my foot, the sole of my foot.</span> <span id="s862">As I mentioned, the sole of my foot was so tough, that I tried to pull the nail out, it wouldn’t come out.</span> <span id="s863">I pulled it and pulled it, at last I pull it out and a tiny blood appeared.</span> <span id="s864">It was by the river, I just washed it up and then we continued playing soccer.</span> <span id="s865">We swam since I was a ch -- nobody bothered me, my mother never [indecipherable] me where I am.</span> <span id="s866">All day I was by myself with kids and -- I liked school, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s867">I liked school.</span> <span id="s868">I wouldn’t miss it because I knew I need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Were you with Jewish and non-Jewish children in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Yes, the school was mixed, and there was no such thing Jewish or non-Jewish, everybody together.</span> <span id="s871">And I attended 50 -- Latvian 56 school that before the war was a Jewish school where my father’s first cousin Shaina, she was a teacher there.</span> <span id="s872">And we lived -- later we got an apartment, it was basement apartment in 1946 when my sister was born, half sister, we got an apartment next to the school, it’s called Male Lacspiesa, little Lacspiesa iela.</span> <span id="s873">I just would climb over the fence and I was in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s875">And did you experience any anti-Semitism in elementary school?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: I would say the first time I understood what it is -- maybe I didn’t understand then what it is, but later on I -- I began when my teacher of sports, of the physical education, I remember even his name, Vasily Vasilivich, was his first name and his father’s name, Vasilivich.</span> <span id="s877">Fa -- Vasily Vasilivich.</span> <span id="s878">You know, as a kid I w -- I liked to prank -- pranks and everything.</span> <span id="s879">So one time he takes me by the shoulder and say -- and says me -- tells to me, you know what?</span> <span id="s880">We saved you for -- from death in -- Germans, and you behaving like that?</span> <span id="s881">I understood right away what it means.</span> <span id="s882">This was my first experience with this kind of -- excuse me -- garbage.</span> <span id="s883">Since then it’s how it went, many times.</span> <span id="s884">Of course, I couldn’t hit him.</span> <span id="s885">I should have, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: What were some of your other experiences like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Th--This was when I was adult already.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: You don’t -- you’re not interested, or I’ll tell you when adult --</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Well, we’ll co -- we’ll come to that</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: But when you were in school, were there any incidents with the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: No, when I was at school, y-you know, I wouldn’t say that somebody would say kike or something like that.</span> <span id="s894">Maybe I heard somewhere far, but nobody would dare to tell me in my face.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: So you felt safe on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes, in those times I felt pretty good -- safe, because you belong to a gang, and local ki -- local persons would never touch you, only somebody from outside.</span> <span id="s897">I felt -- what I want to mention, in 1946, this I mention -- I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s898">As you remember, maybe some of wa -- you, all these German and Latvian collaborators.</span> <span id="s899">Not -- Germans are not collaborators, like Drexel, but collaborator with Dunkel, you know, about 10 of them, when they had a [indecipherable] a trial?</span> <span id="s900">I remember 1946, about February, I went to my friend.</span> <span id="s901">I was about nine -- less than 10 years old -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Michael Lin.</span> <span id="s903">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: -- all the time my mother was telling me about the Germans and Latvians and -- and as I mentioned, I was standing on the corner between Lacspiesa -- no, it was Zilnow iela and Moscow iela, yes.</span> <span id="s905">And my mother asked me, do I want to go to the -- to vi -- vitness -- witness?</span> <span id="s906">Witness the hanging of the -- of the 10 people, I think there were 10 people.</span> <span id="s907">I said -- I said no, I don’t want to go to wit -- witness.</span> <span id="s908">It was a -- I remember the -- vividly the day when they were hanged, because it was snowing and no sun, the sky was covered with clouds, but it was not dark.</span> <span id="s909">And my mother se -- went with my stepfather to witness the -- the hanging of these 10 -- I think 10 people.</span> <span id="s910">Then he told me what -- how happened.</span> <span id="s911">They were brought by trucks and then they was -- they stepped on stools, and the stools were knocked under them and she -- she was witnessing -- it was on the -- a big square in r -- in Riga on -- what was it?</span> <span id="s912">It’s called the parade square or I-I -- I’ll not -- I don’t recall precisely how the square, but I remember the square, it’s very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: What was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: I think it’s February 1946.</span> <span id="s915">My mother witnessed the -- the hanging of these bastards.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Why do you think she went to witness them?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: I don’t think for enjoyment, but for -- for justice, or it’s supposed to be.</span> <span id="s918">Tooth for a tooth.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Did your mother at that time, or even during the war, ever talk about going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: You see, you -- going to Palestine you have to be a dedicated person, but -- and as you know before world wars, not too many Jews went to Palestine, only very dedicated, as my uncle [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s921">And you know how people are.</span> <span id="s922">When they s -- well established in certain place, they want to live there in this, like anybody else.</span> <span id="s923">So now it’s something else, and then was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: So you continued on with school.</span> <span id="s925">You were 10 - 11 - 12, and what was life like for you then?</span> <span id="s926">Do you have any specific memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: No, what to say?</span> <span id="s928">It was hard in the beginning, you know.</span> <span id="s929">A stepfather is an invalid, he gets unpatient.</span> <span id="s930">You know how much patient you can get in certain instances.</span> <span id="s931">And he worked.</span> <span id="s932">He worked, not always, and my mother didn't have an official job, but she tried to -- later on she began -- began working in trades.</span> <span id="s933">I mean, a saleswoman.</span> <span id="s934">She wa -- became a saleswoman, yeah.</span> <span id="s935">And th-then 1946 my stepsister was born and we sa -- lived in very small apartment.</span> <span id="s936">No, I would say, we began eating better than before and slowly, slowly, life improved.</span> <span id="s937">I remember when I was a kid attending this school, first time I saw, during the -- the -- how you call it, elections?</span> <span id="s938">This was a Soviet style election.</span> <span id="s939">In school they would organize -- I don’t know, it was specially for new republics, like Baltic Republic, where it was als -- also [indecipherable] I’m not sure, but over there I -- they would bring artist and singers and all kinds of stuff and all day they would play music and -- and praise Stalin and all the party and we used to watch it, enjoy it actually, I would say.</span> <span id="s940">You know, everything is good for a peasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Were you part of any Russian youth group?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: No, I would say I was never even not a peer -- Pioneer.</span> <span id="s943">They used to force you to become a Pioneer and wear this -- how you call that, tie.</span> <span id="s944">This is like a tie and in public maybe I would put it on, but then I would take it off and put it in my pocket, because I never wanted to be a part of it.</span> <span id="s945">I don’t know, it was mainly in -- inside me that I didn't want to be a member of any organization, even from childhood.</span> <span id="s946">Not a Pioneer, later on a [indecipherable], later on a party member.</span> <span id="s947">I know many Jews were party members, I -- I have friends that live in the United States, a lot of who were party members, but I, never.</span> <span id="s948">I felt I don’t belong there.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Was your mother a member?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Or your stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No.</span> <span id="s953">My stepfather was a Zionist before World War 2.</span> <span id="s954">Of course, he never mentioned, you know [indecipherable] were a Zionist, what happen to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: What would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: If you were -- what would happen?</span> <span id="s957">Will go to faraway places, is what would happen.</span> <span id="s958">So, you know, I-I [indecipherable] but in a quarrel, let’s say my mother would quarrel with him.</span> <span id="s959">And she would give a hint that he was a Zionist, he was scared, you know.</span> <span id="s960">Obviously my mother was joking, but you see, Zionist is a good cause.</span> <span id="s961">It’s why we have our country there, and he was a Zionist and didn't want anybody -- he belonged to a sports club and he was, himself from Rezekne, and his -- two of his sisters, they went to Palestine in 1933, but his mother and two br -- an older brother, they all were killed in Rezekne.</span> <span id="s962">So -- and he always dreamed about coming to Israel, so they managed to come to Israel in 1966.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: When you were 13, did you think about having a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: No, nobody gave me Bar Mitzvahs, nobody gave me Bar Mitzvahs, no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s965">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s966">Yes, when I -- I was Bar Mitzvahed -- I don’t remember, but I -- I was in Jewish circles because my father-in-law had his cousin and the -- the cousin had two --</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Your st -- your stepfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yes, my stepfather over there.</span> <span id="s969">He had a cousin, he was an invalid too after the war, who got hit in the head.</span> <span id="s970">And he had two daughters and a son.</span> <span id="s971">Yeah, and they really wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Was it safe to be outwardly Jewish in Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Outwardly?</span> <span id="s974">Q: At that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: You say outwardly, nobody wore beards, or didn’t wear -- I never seen anybody wearing Jewish uniform, you know, I recall the black stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Did you do anything religiously in the late 40’s - 50’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: No, I never did, despite that my father was a Chabadnik.</span> <span id="s978">My father, personally was a Chabadnik before war.</span> <span id="s979">You know Chabadnik, in Israel they have this.</span> <span id="s980">But I personally, no, I was not religious.</span> <span id="s981">I -- what to say about religion?</span> <span id="s982">I believe that I am a Jew by blood.</span> <span id="s983">I don’t have to be very religious to confirm it.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: So then you went on to high school.</span> <span id="s985">Any experiences there?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Yes, I went to high school -- a-actually, you see, he was not my father, right?</span> <span id="s987">So he always insisted that I go to work.</span> <span id="s988">I was 13.</span> <span id="s989">Go to work, go to work, but I want -- I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s990">I wanted to study and I went -- actually I went to school evenings, high school.</span> <span id="s991">I went to work, I was a lathe -- lathe operator, worked a little here, a little there, you know, what do you want, you were 13 or 14 or 15 years old, you know.</span> <span id="s992">And that was tough actually, in many ways, obviously.</span> <span id="s993">So one time I worked at the big factory, they used to build floating cranes over there.</span> <span id="s994">They -- and you know how in Soviet Union is, they you -- they s-send you to collective farm to work summertime.</span> <span id="s995">So I am 17 years old, they send me to a collective farm.</span> <span id="s996">There was about five people, or seven people, maybe.</span> <span id="s997">One Jew, engineer, me, 17 years old, and ab-about five schlubs.</span> <span id="s998">Big, huge.</span> <span id="s999">Out of the army already.</span> <span id="s1000">You know what -- what they did to this engineer?</span> <span id="s1001">They actually treated him like piece of dirt.</span> <span id="s1002">All the time, kike, kike, kike to him, and he couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s1003">He was a -- a weak person.</span> <span id="s1004">It what my opinion is he looked weak and he behaved weak.</span> <span id="s1005">I didn’t say noth -- a word, but one day we’re sitting by a table, the engineer was not there, these five guys and me.</span> <span id="s1006">And you know what he says -- one of the guys tells me?</span> <span id="s1007">Hey, hey you, kike, give me the -- pass me the leffel.</span> <span id="s1008">Leffel, he need a sh -- a spoon.</span> <span id="s1009">Pass me the spoon.</span> <span id="s1010">I don’t know what hit me.</span> <span id="s1011">I -- I jumped up, ran toward the guy and hit him with my left, right in the jaw, right in the bloody jaw.</span> <span id="s1012">He fell on -- on the floor, right?</span> <span id="s1013">He fell on the floor and then he got up and tried to jump on me, but the others, they -- how we say, they s-stop him.</span> <span id="s1014">So they separated us, but we lived on the -- how you call it -- sarai in Russian language, how you call -- with this hays -- haystack?</span> <span id="s1015">How you call it, barn.</span> <span id="s1016">Yeah, we lived on the u-upper part of a barn, in the huge barn.</span> <span id="s1017">So I was afraid to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1018">We slept on the straw, you know, there was nothing, just maybe you -- you take from home a blanket, maybe.</span> <span id="s1019">I was afraid to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1020">We had to climb a -- a ladder.</span> <span id="s1021">But the -- I had to go to sleep, so I collected a lot of stones, maybe five, six big stones.</span> <span id="s1022">I climbed the ladder, stepped i-in the opening, and I say, now approach me one by one.</span> <span id="s1023">And nobody approached me.</span> <span id="s1024">It was some kind of psychological thing.</span> <span id="s1025">Nobody approached me, I throw away the stones and went to -- into my corner.</span> <span id="s1026">And nobody touched me.</span> <span id="s1027">That’s how we tre -- it was instinctive, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1028">But it’s how a Jew should behave with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Do you think you behaved that way again because of what you had experienced before that?</span> <span id="s1030">A: I actually behaved like this again, and it happened I’ll tell you when, in 1960 -- ’61.</span> <span id="s1031">I -- I was a seaman on a fishing boat.</span> <span id="s1032">It was not the fishing boat, it was a transport boat actually, the -- named Riga.</span> <span id="s1033">And we would cross the Atlantic by Canadian shores -- how to recall it precisely not to make a mistake -- by Canadian shores w -- you know what I did, I loaded up barrels with herring from other ships.</span> <span id="s1034">And you worked like this 12 hours a day.</span> <span id="s1035">It was a int -- it was [indecipherable] of six hours and six hours.</span> <span id="s1036">And there was one from Latgalia.</span> <span id="s1037">A guy -- I -- I have a picture some of this, but I didn't bring it.</span> <span id="s1038">He was from Latgalia, a lat -- a Latgo, and he called me kike.</span> <span id="s1039">In those -- then, I didn't hit him, but I took a -- this worn out glove, with salty gloves herring and I -- three times I hit him in the face, crisscross like this.</span> <span id="s1040">And this was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1041">One guy approached me and says later on and says he could kill you -- you.</span> <span id="s1042">And I said, well, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1043">And what is interesting, next year I was going from Riga to Moscow and th-they stopped at the station, right, in Latvia over there.</span> <span id="s1044">And I walking along the train and I -- I see this guy.</span> <span id="s1045">He runs towards me as if I am this best friend.</span> <span id="s1046">It wa -- you probably have to give them a good shot that they remember you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: So when you were -- you said you went to school at night and worked during the day -- and th-this when you -- we’re going back in -- years when you were in high school.</span> <span id="s1048">An-And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: No, I worked in th -- during the d-day and went to high school.</span> <span id="s1050">I graduate from high school and then I was drafted to -- in -- tha -- I want to mention -- yeah, you’re -- I am okay, I am okay.</span> <span id="s1051">I want to mention one thing.</span> <span id="s1052">Maybe it has to do something with anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1053">I -- when I graduate from seventh grade I wanted to go to junior college.</span> <span id="s1054">I always dreamed about becoming a geologist.</span> <span id="s1055">So, I have a -- I had a friend at the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1056">He was already a student in -- in Siberia geological faculty.</span> <span id="s1057">And so I was talking with him what he is doing and -- and I ask him, wh-where do you think should I go for these courses?</span> <span id="s1058">He says, come to us to Swedlosc over there.</span> <span id="s1059">But I didn't want to go cold, I remember this, cold.</span> <span id="s1060">So I say, I’ll go to Ukraine, be -- for exam.</span> <span id="s1061">Well, it was 1952.</span> <span id="s1062">I went -- okay, I send my papers, they had invited me for it.</span> <span id="s1063">I passed the exams very good.</span> <span id="s1064">I think I should have became a student of -- in Kiev, capital of Ukraine, but I got a letter that I was not taken, so I think i -- there was a reason for n -- me not being taken.</span> <span id="s1065">An-And this ta-tartar told me, you will never be a student in Ukraine, he told me himself, my fr-friend.</span> <span id="s1066">He says --</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: This is because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1069">He says, come to Urals.</span> <span id="s1070">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1071">I think it’s better that I didn’t go and become a geologist.</span> <span id="s1072">I -- I feel that otherwise I would be staying in Russia til now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: So what did you do instead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: When I came home I go this information that I -- so I went to high school, because this was junior high school.</span> <span id="s1075">So in 1955 I was drafted in the army.</span> <span id="s1076">So they took me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: This is the -- the Russian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1079">I was in the Russian army, it was September 1955, I think.</span> <span id="s1080">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: What’s it like to put on a Russian uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: First I want to say that I didn’t go to college.</span> <span id="s1083">I don’t know, I didn’t feel like -- to go -- going to college.</span> <span id="s1084">And I -- I went to the army, I would say, not thinking about anything.</span> <span id="s1085">So, of course wa -- how they transport you, they transport you cattle cars.</span> <span id="s1086">Later there was no -- any accommodations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Did that bring back any memories to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1089">And especially what was interesting, one time -- okay, wh-wha -- what happened, we were traveling and suddenly we stopped.</span> <span id="s1090">We heard shots.</span> <span id="s1091">Shots, shots, we stopped, everybody began running toward the sounds.</span> <span id="s1092">They opened wide the cattle car, the doors, and they see a soldier is lying -- he was then not a soldier, in civilian clothes, were not soldiers yet.</span> <span id="s1093">And I see he was dead.</span> <span id="s1094">What happened, a -- a drunk sergeant, he was drunk, he gathered all these boys together, drove to -- into a corner and began shooting, and he hit only this guy, fortunately.</span> <span id="s1095">So what -- I had my first experience with the army.</span> <span id="s1096">Then we came to a town called Perlomiesk.</span> <span id="s1097">You have a lot of tr-translation to do here.</span> <span id="s1098">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1099">And we came to a town called Perlomiesk and a big division over there called [indecipherable] division.</span> <span id="s1100">Do -- don’t write this.</span> <span id="s1101">This [indecipherable] division it’s called because they don’t have a full, how you call, personnel.</span> <span id="s1102">It’s only maybe half or a quarter or whatever, during peaceful times, I think.</span> <span id="s1103">So I went to this Molodog Bietz, it’s called the young soldiers’ training.</span> <span id="s1104">We lived in barracks, 200 people.</span> <span id="s1105">The food was, you know, we used to call it kairza.</span> <span id="s1106">It’s like they gave us boots, only they’re not from leather, they’re made from some kind of plastic.</span> <span id="s1107">So we called the food they gave us, this kairza, like plastic it was kasha, like porridge.</span> <span id="s1108">And a little bit of sugar and a little bit of meat.</span> <span id="s1109">Yeah, everybody was hungry, you know, hungry, I will tell you.</span> <span id="s1110">So we spent like this maybe ha -- training half a year, you run, you -- maneuvers, you shoot, you know, and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1111">You go to -- a -- a bathroom is about in the middle of the -- we call it -- we call it town over there [indecipherable] bathroom.</span> <span id="s1112">A big barrack with -- for about 200 people, opened ho-holes over there, and around too, everybody urinates around the barrack.</span> <span id="s1113">The barracks were so cold, it was about four degrees Centigrade.</span> <span id="s1114">And -- and thievery?</span> <span id="s1115">I had hundred rubles and my glasses, I had begun wearing glasses.</span> <span id="s1116">And so I put it under my pillow, gone.</span> <span id="s1117">Forget it.</span> <span id="s1118">You know, if you’d -- even -- we call partienki, it’s not like socks, but a piece of cloth you wind around your feet, right?</span> <span id="s1119">And even this would be stolen, if they were new, at least, you know.</span> <span id="s1120">I-I’ll tell you, two years I was in the army, I remember going to -- taking a bath only four times.</span> <span id="s1121">In the beginning we went three times and then I didn’t go to -- didn’t have a bath for a half a year.</span> <span id="s1122">I -- we were wearing underwear, s-summer underwear.</span> <span id="s1123">For winter they would give us like formbika, it’s like cotton, right?</span> <span id="s1124">And there was so -- supposed to be white, but it was not white, it was earthy color, you know, black.</span> <span id="s1125">An-And the [indecipherable] were all -- the shirt -- the green shirt, you -- you would take a -- a knife and clean with a knife the dirt off the -- you know, to come off.</span> <span id="s1126">This what kind of an army.</span> <span id="s1127">I used to play pretty good soccer, and -- but I didn’t want to play soccer, you know, no matter how hard they tried to convince me.</span> <span id="s1128">Swimming, I swam very good and I wanted to get away from there, not to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Were there a lot of other Jewish -- very many other Jewish soldiers, and did you stay together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: With me, was only one Jew, Dick -- Dick Teryoff.</span> <span id="s1131">And this Dick Teryoff was treated pretty badly.</span> <span id="s1132">You know when you her -- see small people, short and weak?</span> <span id="s1133">They have a field day with them.</span> <span id="s1134">But I wouldn’t say that anybody touched me, because I came, 18 year old, I weighed six -- 73 kilograms and then in about a year ya -- I became 82 and pretty athletic.</span> <span id="s1135">One day my lieutenant saw me naked, took a look at me he was oh -- he was a very short guy -- and he look at me and se -- says, oh how beautiful you developed.</span> <span id="s1136">You know, I was athletic, I only needed meat a little bit on my bones, you know?</span> <span id="s1137">But when you are short like Dick Teryoff and -- you were treated like a piece of dirt.</span> <span id="s1138">And besides we had a lot of -- from Asia, Cos-Cossacks, Uzbeks, Chuwash from Volgar region.</span> <span id="s1139">And I’ll tell the u -- the Ukrainians were the worst.</span> <span id="s1140">Especially I remember sergeant Ukrainian.</span> <span id="s1141">He didn't dare to tell me a bad -- bad word, but I -- I felt he had something inside.</span> <span id="s1142">He wanted to say something, but he didn’t dare to.</span> <span id="s1143">But those [indecipherable] people, they were called churek, chumek, and all kind of, you know, words that they wouldn’t like it, to hear.</span> <span id="s1144">One guy turned out to be a German over there, and with a strange name.</span> <span id="s1145">His name was Ingalls.</span> <span id="s1146">Is it strange or not?</span> <span id="s1147">Friend of Karl Marx.</span> <span id="s1148">And I think he was pretty anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s1149">A German guy from Volgar region.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Did he -- did he attempt anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: No, no, he didn't attempt to play with me, no.</span> <span id="s1152">He was a big, strong guy, but he didn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: How long were you in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: I was almost two years.</span> <span id="s1155">What happened, in 1956, as -- as -- as you know, or maybe know, Czechoslovakia, through Russia -- or Russia through Czechoslovakia began selling weapons.</span> <span id="s1156">And all the weapons went to Egypt through port of Nikolaev.</span> <span id="s1157">So they sent us to Nikolaev to load the ships.</span> <span id="s1158">And you would do 12 hour shift with very little food.</span> <span id="s1159">I would say they would bring at night, if you worked at night, they would bring you a -- two slices of bread with a cup of tea and a piece of sugar.</span> <span id="s1160">It’s all what you would get.</span> <span id="s1161">And I worked over there all summer, July -- it was in June, July, August, I think three months.</span> <span id="s1162">It was this funny in-incident in my -- I wouldn’t say incident with me.</span> <span id="s1163">I was on guard and there was a raider on ze -- on the truck, Zeil.</span> <span id="s1164">And one -- I was on guard there, and one day, I don’t know what hit me, I took my rifle and had -- had the sh -- stick, it’s called like a -- it’s like a knife, how it’s called in English, I don’t know, a knife on the front of the rifle.</span> <span id="s1165">And I hit with this -- with this knife, a tire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: A bayonet, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Bayonet, right.</span> <span id="s1168">And I hit the -- I hit the tire of the raider.</span> <span id="s1169">Then it, I think something going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s1170">I became scared.</span> <span id="s1171">And they didn't notice.</span> <span id="s1172">And next few days I was not there on the guard, but when I came back I noticed that everything went over the -- overseas.</span> <span id="s1173">And I was lucky enough to escape this kind -- they would prescribe me probably treason or something, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Were you involved with anything going on in Hungary at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1176">Okay, so -- so we left Nikolaev in end of summer, I think.</span> <span id="s1177">We came to our base -- and they send -- this was October, I think, 1956, they send us to collective farm, to work on a collective farm, and we slept in a church, a former church.</span> <span id="s1178">They -- they didn't have any electricity there.</span> <span id="s1179">They only had electricity for a few hours.</span> <span id="s1180">The -- the gi -- girls would come over, you know, with soldiers and you wouldn’t even see their faces.</span> <span id="s1181">They used to show movies over there and use their diesel, you know, so there was some light maybe inside there, in the church.</span> <span id="s1182">But otherwise, hm.</span> <span id="s1183">So, one night, it was maybe three o’clock in the morning, they say alarm, alarm.</span> <span id="s1184">We got up -- it was about 150 kilometers from our base -- we didn’t ask nothing, nobody asks, you have an orderly row.</span> <span id="s1185">And we came to our base, and -- and they tell us something happened in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1186">It was November, October ’56, somewhere.</span> <span id="s1187">And they said -- so they took half of our battalion.</span> <span id="s1188">They di -- it took only about a day or two, they gave out uniforms special for battle, battle gear, and fortunately they only took half of our battalion and they sent it to Hungary, and I was lucky, stayed home.</span> <span id="s1189">And later I -- I met one guy and he was wounded in the cheek.</span> <span id="s1190">A -- a bullet went through his -- both cheeks and never touched his teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Were you proud to be in the Russian army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: In those times, you know, I wouldn't say I was very proud to be in Russian army, but I actually had no feelings, is what I want to say, I had no feelings.</span> <span id="s1193">I lived there, and you have to do what they tell you.</span> <span id="s1194">And I -- I -- I wouldn’t -- I didn't think about it.</span> <span id="s1195">There is no -- they wanted me to be an officer, one time they approached me and said we’ll send you to acadamia -- academy in somewhere -- Odessa.</span> <span id="s1196">But I never wanted to be nobody there.</span> <span id="s1197">I didn’t want to be nobody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: It’s probably -- you know what?</span> <span id="s1200">I’ll tell you the truth, I think subconsciously it probably had to do with happened to my father’s cousin.</span> <span id="s1201">I knew that no -- no matter who you are there, this -- the higher you climb, the faster you fall.</span> <span id="s1202">I had the feeling like this.</span> <span id="s1203">So this what -- I -- you know, maybe -- I remember my father-in-law, he -- maybe he was proud of having a guy like Kaganovich in the ku -- in the government, but I didn’t have such a feeling because I know who Kaganovich was.</span> <span id="s1204">If you can’t speak Yiddish, or your own language, you don’t have your culture, what kind of -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Did you feel very Jewish when you were in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: I felt it, yeah, I felt good that I am Jew.</span> <span id="s1207">I am not religiously, but -- but -- but my blood.</span> <span id="s1208">You know, wa -- I remember when I was younger, when Stalin died and we had this situation, my mother was very afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with M-M-Michael Lin.</span> <span id="s1211">This is tape number three, side A. And you were talking about Stalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah, I was talking about I remember in 1953 when Stalin died, and my mother was scared because of the situation, you know, with the -- I heard all -- all the time about the doctors and the ti -- timosh -- what her was named, this Ukrainian last name?</span> <span id="s1213">Timoshuku or whatever, I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s1214">And one day yo -- actually I -- I would say they were talking about [indecipherable] being prepared for transportation as to somewhere, faraway places.</span> <span id="s1215">So that’s why my mother was really afraid.</span> <span id="s1216">One day Stalin died suddenly.</span> <span id="s1217">It was March nine, I think or -- or earlier.</span> <span id="s1218">I was skating alone in a park, Catholic park in Riga and I heard this.</span> <span id="s1219">I had -- for me, it didn't bother me at all.</span> <span id="s1220">I -- I don’t even believe that somebody cried with sincerely.</span> <span id="s1221">Maybe somebody did.</span> <span id="s1222">For me this was absolutely non-event that he died.</span> <span id="s1223">I was skating, then I come home and my mother say -- say -- says to me, what’s going to happen to us?</span> <span id="s1224">And I remember precisely what I told her.</span> <span id="s1225">I say, somebody -- they will find another one.</span> <span id="s1226">It was -- was my words, precisely.</span> <span id="s1227">This was -- was my recollection about the situation with her, was in ’52 - ’53.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: What did you do when you left the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: When I left the army, I didn't go -- want to go to work right away, so I went to technical school.</span> <span id="s1230">I went to te -- actually, I went to Leningrad Geological Institute, but I forgot, I’ll tell you, mathematics, and I -- I couldn’t pass properly.</span> <span id="s1231">I -- I passed, but it was not good enough.</span> <span id="s1232">It was a very prestigious institute -- college, I would say.</span> <span id="s1233">So I went to a technical school, after a year and a half I graduated, I went to work.</span> <span id="s1234">I worked at a power station.</span> <span id="s1235">I worked at a power station and then I went to a diesel plant, where I met my wife, and my wife was from Moscow region.</span> <span id="s1236">She was a -- she even used to work at the power plant in krem -- in the Kremlin.</span> <span id="s1237">Yes, she was an ice -- insulation mechanic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Rya Lin.</span> <span id="s1240">Rya Bramawa, her maiden name.</span> <span id="s1241">But she -- she never saw nothing, and her father died in action.</span> <span id="s1242">And they lived in a village beyond Moscow [indecipherable] Vladimir, and she doesn’t know nothing about nothing.</span> <span id="s1243">Nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: So you met your wife, and then did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Here we go, I met my wife and I don’t know if maybe I married young a little bit.</span> <span id="s1246">Was 23 years old, she was 22, we didn't have an apartment and we didn’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s1247">And I had -- first we lived with ma -- my mo-mother and my stepfather didn’t want us, so I’m -- I -- I -- I make him to want us.</span> <span id="s1248">And then I tried to collect some money to buy an apartment during the Khrushchev time.</span> <span id="s1249">You know they allowed to buy?</span> <span id="s1250">So I went to -- became a seaman to make a little money, because you don’t spend it.</span> <span id="s1251">And my wife worked, and we bou-bought our own apartment, a small one in Riga.</span> <span id="s1252">And we had the son over there in ’64.</span> <span id="s1253">But my parents, they always wanted to emigrate to Israel, and they started very early apply, and I applied too.</span> <span id="s1254">Oh, it was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: When did you first start thinking about emigrating to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Oh, I think I began thinking about 1963, but I didn’t apply yet.</span> <span id="s1257">I let my parents apply.</span> <span id="s1258">They began probably ’64 to apply, or maybe even earlier.</span> <span id="s1259">You see, I -- I was a seaman in a -- on a si -- on a fishing boat, right?</span> <span id="s1260">On a -- then I wanted to be in a -- on a boat that, how you call a -- how you say it?</span> <span id="s1261">A boat -- goods?</span> <span id="s1262">To -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: A freighter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes, I want to be on a freighter.</span> <span id="s1265">And you know tha -- I applied to be on a freighter and they never took me.</span> <span id="s1266">You know, there is a reason why they didn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1267">They didn’t want -- they understood maybe I run away or something.</span> <span id="s1268">I wouldn’t do this.</span> <span id="s1269">I was a very placeable person.</span> <span id="s1270">I wouldn’t run away and leave my parents and my wife and my -- this was impossible.</span> <span id="s1271">But nevertheless, you know the situation.</span> <span id="s1272">So then in 1960 I went to college, nights.</span> <span id="s1273">I took -- I took shipbuilding courses.</span> <span id="s1274">Yeah, I worked daytime and I took sh -- courses in shipbuilding in Russia five years, nights.</span> <span id="s1275">But everything til -- diploma, I didn’t want to take my diploma.</span> <span id="s1276">I’ll tell you the truth, I was afraid that they impose a penalty when I leave Soviet Union, and I felt that wouldn’t be proper that I take this diploma.</span> <span id="s1277">It was mo -- my feeling.</span> <span id="s1278">But my parents, they left -- we managed to leave in 1966 September, with my sister, she was then 17 years old.</span> <span id="s1279">I went to Moscow with them, and you know, they had this embassy and police, a lot of police was standing behind.</span> <span id="s1280">I was very naïve probably, or what, I don’t even know why.</span> <span id="s1281">The policeman approached me and began talking so loud.</span> <span id="s1282">I -- he began talking so loud that I -- I -- I even asked him, why are you talking so loud?</span> <span id="s1283">I didn't realize that he had the microphone probably over there hidden.</span> <span id="s1284">So -- but then when I -- we entered the embassy, we went to some of the persons over there and I see a map hanging, of Israel, and it was ’66.</span> <span id="s1285">We -- we couldn’t talk loud over there, so in whispers I -- I took a pencil and on the map I made the West Bank like this, I surrounded the West Bank, I say, it has to belong to us.</span> <span id="s1286">And you know, fortunately the next year it happened.</span> <span id="s1287">And then they left in 1966 for Israel and I was applying, applying of -- five times.</span> <span id="s1288">They were applying many times too.</span> <span id="s1289">Refusenik, refuse, refuse, refuse, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Did you have many friend who were applying also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: I know only -- only one, but he was, I think he was a -- a activist.</span> <span id="s1292">I don’t remember his last name.</span> <span id="s1293">He was an active -- Jewish activist because one time I -- in old Riga I -- I saw him in his apartment, he had all kind -- he even gave me a book to study Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1294">And I took this book and then I had a friend, he was much younger than I am, his -- his mother -- his last name was Sefian.</span> <span id="s1295">She -- she taught mathematics in -- in the college.</span> <span id="s1296">So with him we studied a little Hebrew, you know?</span> <span id="s1297">I began writing a little bit and -- and so I don’t know Hebrew now, I forgot, but I can recall, I -- I think.</span> <span id="s1298">And this guy, Sefian, he was a student with me too, he studied Hebrew with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: So your -- your parents left, you stayed with your wife and continued to work, and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Yes, I continued to work --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: -- and then what was your reaction after the ’67 war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Oh, I -- I always find myself in the -- in cul -- Kulhorz.</span> <span id="s1303">They send me to Kulhorz and we -- the weather was so bad we didn’t even work there, because it was June, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: And it was so cold I was shivering even my -- as soon as I her -- there was no radio, but somebody had a radio somewhere and I heard about the war.</span> <span id="s1306">Immediately I took a bus.</span> <span id="s1307">I left everything, my -- my belongings, I-I took a bus, I wanted to hea -- to listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s1308">It was by Yelgiva 50 kilometers from Riga.</span> <span id="s1309">So I took the bus, came to Yelgiva, from the Kulhorz to Yelgiva.</span> <span id="s1310">From there I took a taxi.</span> <span id="s1311">It turned out I was not by myself, there were other -- about three or four Christians and they were talking about the war, the -- even they mentioned one guy tells about that Israeli ar -- tanks hit -- hit them so hard that it -- and they went to -- into Sinai peninsula.</span> <span id="s1312">And it was probably, okay, June fi-fifth, or it was about June sixth --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Sixth, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: -- yeah, I think.</span> <span id="s1315">Yeah, first time I -- I heard about this, it was in a taxi in 1967, June sixth, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Did you feel proud?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yeah, it was very good feeling, very good feeling.</span> <span id="s1318">I had a very good feeling.</span> <span id="s1319">What else can you say?</span> <span id="s1320">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: And how did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: And my mother was de -- my mother was there already, and my sister was there, they lived in Kiryat Yam, by -- by the -- by the sea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Then how did you finally get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: So I applied and applied and then suddenly my mother send me [indecipherable] you know who used to send me?</span> <span id="s1325">My uncle, who used to send me a -- I would call it a weisof.</span> <span id="s1326">It’s a -- papers for.</span> <span id="s1327">And then my mother began.</span> <span id="s1328">So in 1969 they finally let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: So you and your wife left in 1969?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yes and my -- my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: I had -- I had already a son who was four and a half years old, almost.</span> <span id="s1333">’69 -- was ’69 February, so my son was four years and about three months old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Acardy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: What were your thoughts about leaving Riga?</span> <span id="s1337">You were born there.</span> <span id="s1338">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: I would say I was happy.</span> <span id="s1340">And you know, I had a -- a guy -- another Jewish guy, my friend, Igor Pavlowski, yes, and this Igor Pavlowski, I asked him to see me -- see me, how you call it -- see me going away.</span> <span id="s1341">He came and then came one my Jewish friends, Cherfus Laib.</span> <span id="s1342">Yeah, this Cherfus Laib worked with me and we attended college together.</span> <span id="s1343">He was a manager at the diesel plant.</span> <span id="s1344">He came with his wife -- now they are in America, but they came 10 -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1345">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Was it very emotional for you to leave Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: No, I was just happy.</span> <span id="s1348">That’s it, happy.</span> <span id="s1349">I am a person, maybe late now, I am older, I have such em-emotional feelings, you know.</span> <span id="s1350">But when I was younger I was -- I -- I didn’t have any emotions like now I have.</span> <span id="s1351">Even about my dead relatives, the older I get, the angrier I become.</span> <span id="s1352">I don’t know, maybe not everybody like this, but with me it’s like -- like this.</span> <span id="s1353">I-I am very angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: You’re angry at what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: I am very angry of what’s going on in the world, with the Nazis, Holocaust denial, with this Calley person, you know, Calley, the Latvian guy?</span> <span id="s1356">They say they can find nothing wrong with him, but take a look.</span> <span id="s1357">Just go through the list of ar -- RS command, and you will find all these SS [indecipherable] people.</span> <span id="s1358">They’re all there, and his name is there.</span> <span id="s1359">So everybody of them is guilty.</span> <span id="s1360">Just by joining, you can imagine that you are guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: What was it like to arrive in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Before we’re -- I -- I spent four days in Vienna, yeah, in the castle, yeah.</span> <span id="s1363">And then we -- in those times not many Jews used to leave Russia for Israel, you know, so they treated us pretty well, and allowed us to stay in Vienna for four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Did you ever consider coming to the United States instead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: No, in those times, no.</span> <span id="s1366">In those times I didn’t consider come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1367">But -- this a different story.</span> <span id="s1368">Okay, so we spend four days in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1369">I came to Israel, it was March fir -- March third or fourth.</span> <span id="s1370">It was a hot day and I was wearing a bla -- black suit.</span> <span id="s1371">So, my parents had a big car for me waiting.</span> <span id="s1372">Black car, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: What was it like to put your foot down on Israeli soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: First of all, I was happy, pretty happy.</span> <span id="s1375">And so we came to Kiryat Yam, she -- they had a small apartment, because they were a little -- I don’t know, the -- my stepfather’s sister brought them to Kiryat Yam and put them in a small apartment, three people, when they could get any apartment they wanted, you know?</span> <span id="s1376">So I came to Israel, I didn’t go to any [indecipherable] like many other people, I didn’t take any loans or something like this.</span> <span id="s1377">In two days, because my profession was very good, I went to work for Kablan.</span> <span id="s1378">It’s a private entrepreneur.</span> <span id="s1379">So -- and he put me to work Haifa Kimikali.</span> <span id="s1380">Haifa Kimikali it was a plant that was built in Haifa, a chemical plant, and it was just -- they’re beginning to build with a French firm together.</span> <span id="s1381">So I worked there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1382">I worked there for awhile, but then I decided -- but there were no benefits.</span> <span id="s1383">I didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1384">I didn’t even know how much I get, and I worked 24 hours a day many times.</span> <span id="s1385">And they didn’t pay too much.</span> <span id="s1386">But I think -- I got an apartment, nice apartment in Kiryat Shmuel, and I thought I am in paradise.</span> <span id="s1387">[indecipherable] I considered, my wife doesn’t work, my kid is okay.</span> <span id="s1388">I ma -- make money that I can pay rent.</span> <span id="s1389">The rent was cheap then.</span> <span id="s1390">I can eat whatever I want and still put aside something in the bank.</span> <span id="s1391">So what do you expect?</span> <span id="s1392">Even I worked a lot, but I was strong guy, I worked.</span> <span id="s1393">But then I -- I just -- I had a bad experience with my -- Kablan, you know [indecipherable] business, he want to squeeze out a few.</span> <span id="s1394">So I -- they took me Vulcan.</span> <span id="s1395">It wa -- they used to build military, th-the, you know, duds.</span> <span id="s1396">You know what a dud is, like bomb that -- no, it doesn’t exist now, so I can say.</span> <span id="s1397">So it was like a cast iron fact-factory, they used to cast iron, yeah.</span> <span id="s1398">And I worked there for awhile, but you see the problem -- and we went through a -- this Suez crisis, you kno0w, ’69 - ’70 - ’71, and I -- they never too -- took me to -- into Israeli army.</span> <span id="s1399">I was a -- you know, I came 32 years old, nobody touches me?</span> <span id="s1400">I work, but I felt somewhat -- something small, felt like I’m confined, you know?</span> <span id="s1401">I wanted something bigger, some -- it’s what my feeling was.</span> <span id="s1402">It was not maybe financial, no.</span> <span id="s1403">But something bigger, like.</span> <span id="s1404">So one day, we -- we had the relatives in America, my grandfather’s sister.</span> <span id="s1405">She -- she was here since 1920.</span> <span id="s1406">I never knew about her, but she -- she -- I asked her to send me a letter.</span> <span id="s1407">So she send me a letter, I came on a tourist visa and -- by myself.</span> <span id="s1408">A few days we [indecipherable] here, a owner of a factory, textile plant.</span> <span id="s1409">So, he hired me.</span> <span id="s1410">The sooner you’re hired -- in those times I was making, like I said a -- I would say equivalent of our times maybe 1500 dollars a week, you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: What city were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: It was east Rutherford in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1413">So -- so I worked there since ’72 January til ’73 May when I got -- yeah, I got my papers, you know, through Tolstoy Foundation and they didn’t charge me nothing.</span> <span id="s1414">Praise [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1415">In those times they didn’t charge me nothing, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: And your wife and son are still in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: They’re still there, yeah.</span> <span id="s1418">And then this, you know, I think I got my green card, right, and I say, I’ll go to Israel, check on my -- I had another son, this guy, who was born there, Eugene.</span> <span id="s1419">So I -- I’ll check -- I buy -- buy a ticket, I have my green card, I go over there, stay there for a few weeks and then suddenly at the airport they say, oh you can’t go, you have to go through the army first.</span> <span id="s1420">So they -- they took me about for six, seven weeks, I don’t remember, Mechana David.</span> <span id="s1421">Now of course I was not very happy, but what can you do?</span> <span id="s1422">They actually didn’t need me.</span> <span id="s1423">Well, okay, I went through the same motions as a young fella, Mechana David.</span> <span id="s1424">I took my oath of religions, and after that they released me and after six or seven weeks and I went back to America.</span> <span id="s1425">Then the papers -- my wife got the papers with my sons, and in 1973 October they arrived, and that’s how we’ve stay here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Did they come before the Yom Kippur war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: No.</span> <span id="s1428">They came after Yom Kippur war.</span> <span id="s1429">Of course, I was nervous.</span> <span id="s1430">And I had a friend, a older man, so I called up and my wife didn’t have any telephone.</span> <span id="s1431">So through upstairs neighbors, Romanian people, I called my wife up and everything was okay.</span> <span id="s1432">Of course, she -- she spent a little time in basement, you know, but everything turned out, you see, we’re goo -- we’re si -- where we should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: So then your wife and two children came to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: -- and where did you all live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Well, I rented an apartment, and I rent it now.</span> <span id="s1437">Small apartment I rent and we both sp -- after a few years she began working, I -- I worked -- I am a good machinist and -- screw machine.</span> <span id="s1438">And maybe in the beginning was not as easy because my language was not as good enough, but -- so I didn't think about going to school or something, becoming some contin -- maybe engineer or something.</span> <span id="s1439">But the money was good, so I say, ah, hell with it, you work, you make a living and -- and my wife began working and she worked nights for 10 years.</span> <span id="s1440">She worked really nights, from 12 o’clock at night til seven in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: She factory worker.</span> <span id="s1443">She doesn’t know any English now, even.</span> <span id="s1444">Never learned.</span> <span id="s1445">We worked and I’m happy.</span> <span id="s1446">My -- both sons graduate from universities, and we have grandchildren one, and a second one coming up and -- and my son now -- I mean, my older, married to a old country woman, she is a doctor ni -- future doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: And where do your children live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: My -- my oldest son lives in New York, 85th Street and Central Park, he bought a -- a condo.</span> <span id="s1449">He’ll -- gonna move, buy an apartment, because too small now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: And what kind of work does he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: He works -- he graduate from Long Island University, but he became a blue collar worker, but he works for Bell Atlantic.</span> <span id="s1452">He enjoys it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: And your younger son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: My younger son is, what to say?</span> <span id="s1455">Graduated from Florida State University with a Masters degree in international relations, but he wants to get a job in Washington, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1456">He works for somebody, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1458">Can we talk now a little bit about your thoughts and feelings about what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1460">In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Just generally, after the war.</span> <span id="s1462">Do you feel you would be a different person today if you hadn’t gone through the experiences that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: If not for the war I would be -- even my thinking would be different, obviously.</span> <span id="s1464">First of all, my father wanted to expand his business, one thing.</span> <span id="s1465">Second, I had some talents for music, I think, and I want play s -- fiddle.</span> <span id="s1466">So everything would be different and pro -- we probably would be well off people, you know.</span> <span id="s1467">Latvia small country, but industry was not too big, so our size of business would be a pretty good one, I think.</span> <span id="s1468">So it’s how the situation you keep -- it’s hard to say what I would be thinking about, but it would -- everything would be different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: You -- your childhood was very difficult, extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s1470">Do you feel you’d lost it?</span> <span id="s1471">That you never really had a childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I never had any toys, but I never felt that my childhood is lost because I was involved in rougher stuff like sports, gangs, and you know, I-I -- I -- I wouldn’t say that I miss, you know, what it means to be a childhood, to be patted over your head?</span> <span id="s1473">It depends on your way of thinking, it’s -- I think, right?</span> <span id="s1474">And so I-I -- I -- whatever I had, I had, and I can’t -- you can regret or not regret, you can’t change it, right?</span> <span id="s1475">I -- I don’t think I have hard feelings like -- like what -- about childhood.</span> <span id="s1476">The only hard feelings I have, what happened to my family and to all of us, all Jewish people, this what I have.</span> <span id="s1477">That to me personally, I -- I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Do you think a lot about your wartime experiences now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: You know, when time passes, you always remember the better parts of it, right?</span> <span id="s1480">And the hard parts you -- as if you forgot.</span> <span id="s1481">I [indecipherable] I -- I think so.</span> <span id="s1482">So I remember my childhood with -- seems to me with a smile, yes.</span> <span id="s1483">Cause a smile, I -- I feel this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: This is your -- your postwar childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: After, when you got back to Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Yes, yes, postwar.</span> <span id="s1488">Well, before I can’t say because I too young to remember very much.</span> <span id="s1489">But I was very spoiled I remember and I -- I don’t think I would be -- you see, in those times even my mother was giving me so much bananas -- can you imagine bananas in Latvia in those years?</span> <span id="s1490">Because she was so do-doting.</span> <span id="s1491">It was too much.</span> <span id="s1492">Even I met one woman who even remembers how m -- my mother was doting over me then.</span> <span id="s1493">So I don’t know, maybe I would be spoiled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: You’re talking about after the war was over she spoiled you because you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: No, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: Oh, be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Oh, before the war she spoiled me, not after.</span> <span id="s1498">After the war she didn’t have the means to spoil me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: When your children, when your sons were little, and the age that you were when you were going through hard times, did that bring back memories for you?</span> <span id="s1500">Wh-When your boys were four, five, six, seven, eight, when you were going through such awful times, did that bring back memories for you when you were that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">A: You see, when you have kids and they have -- they don’t have to experience what I had, you feel happy.</span> <span id="s1502">And sometimes when they me -- misbehave, or don’t achieve what you wanted them to achieve, you regret that they didn’t do it, I’m say didn’t achieve.</span> <span id="s1503">But this is a life, their own life to live, you know, if they’ve -- everybody has his own character.</span> <span id="s1504">And you c -- you can’t do nothing about.</span> <span id="s1505">If you have a -- the way you born, the way you die, it’s what I think.</span> <span id="s1506">My philosophical -- it doesn’t matter what background you come from, you’re already born with the genes that command you what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: But your childhood was so unusual, do you not think that affected your character, all the difficulties that you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Obviously.</span> <span id="s1509">Environment affects everybody, an animal, right, according to Darwin, right, believe it or not.</span> <span id="s1510">So it affects your brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Well, that’s why I was asking before.</span> <span id="s1512">How do you think that affected you growing up, not -- not in what kind of job you would have, but just psychologically, because you were tested so unusually for a young child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Did it make you tougher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I can only think about it and say that I -- of course it made me tougher.</span> <span id="s1516">If I were -- if there was no war and all these conditions I lived through, I would probably be, as you call in Russian language, Mami kin sinook.</span> <span id="s1517">Mother’s -- how we call?</span> <span id="s1518">Mother’s son, or what?</span> <span id="s1519">Yeah, just a spoiled brat, yeah.</span> <span id="s1520">And I -- you know.</span> <span id="s1521">I have something to say about Christian people.</span> <span id="s1522">You see I have a ring here, my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: -- and my wife has this.</span> <span id="s1525">This ha -- ring has a history.</span> <span id="s1526">Not this ring, but the gold.</span> <span id="s1527">My grandmother used to have a -- a armband, right?</span> <span id="s1528">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Right, a bracelet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: A bracelet made from gold and pearls, right?</span> <span id="s1531">My mother always mentioned it.</span> <span id="s1532">So one day, it was 1952, I think, I coming home -- I was about 15, I coming home and I see a woman sitting by our door.</span> <span id="s1533">A very skinny woman.</span> <span id="s1534">I remember her, she was so skinny.</span> <span id="s1535">She asked me, here Chaya lives?</span> <span id="s1536">Chaya, my mo -- my mother.</span> <span id="s1537">I say yes, but my mother wasn’t home, so I didn’t let her in.</span> <span id="s1538">After a few hours my mother came from work and -- her name was Antya and she was of Polish origin.</span> <span id="s1539">Turned out she was from my mother’s village, Skundaliena.</span> <span id="s1540">And we didn’t have a big place, so she slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1541">Mattress was on floor After she left, my mother showed me a bracelet, this bracelet.</span> <span id="s1542">She says, you know what Antya bought?</span> <span id="s1543">This bracelet.</span> <span id="s1544">My grand -- my mother, she -- my grandmother’s bracelet, she brought it from Skundaliena.</span> <span id="s1545">She said, my sister, before she was shot with her son, she handed over to my -- this Antya, and this Antya kept it til sh-she brought it to my mother, this bracelet.</span> <span id="s1546">I’ll tell, this Antya was so poor, hungry and she brought this bracelet to my mother.</span> <span id="s1547">What happened to this bracelet?</span> <span id="s1548">In 1966 when my mother was allowed to travel to Israel -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Michael Lin.</span> <span id="s1550">This is tape three, side B, and you were talking about the bracelet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yes, so when my mother was allowed to travel to Israel she took the bracelet with her, and in Keev -- Tamozhnya it’s called, the checkpoint, they na -- didn’t allow her to take it with her.</span> <span id="s1552">So -- but they were kind enough to write out a receipt.</span> <span id="s1553">So two years later I was traveling to Crimean peninsula with my wife, so we spent a month vacationing.</span> <span id="s1554">On the way back I went to Keev, and the -- and the checkpoint the -- I had this receipt because my mother sent it from Israel.</span> <span id="s1555">So I had this receipt and they gave the bracelet back to me.</span> <span id="s1556">And I knew that I would do -- be going to Israel, I didn’t want to lose it, so what I did, I made two wedding rings for me and my wife.</span> <span id="s1557">So it’s how it is, it’s what to ba -- story.</span> <span id="s1558">But I wanted to emphasize how goyim, some goyim are good, good people.</span> <span id="s1559">Oh, the other friend of my mother Kuiznitz Orway, who used to live right on the Moscow Street, close to Rumbula forest where the Vulcan, there used to be a factory, a rubber factory, he used to work, this g-guy in there, and they were witnessing the slaughter of Jews in Rumbula f -- th-the her -- they probably didn’t see in person, but they heard the shots for sure, and they told my mother.</span> <span id="s1560">And they were g -- very good people.</span> <span id="s1561">Maybe they didn’t hide Jews because -- but as Russian people, they were from -- from her village, from Skundaliena, they were very good people.</span> <span id="s1562">And it’s -- not everybody’s a villain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Talking about all the terrible massacres and pogroms and killings that went on in Riga after you left, and when you heard about them, as -- and when you were older, ho-how did you respond to hearing those -- news of these terrible atrocities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: You see, I don’t re-recall my reaction to this, but I never went to see our apartment, old apartment.</span> <span id="s1565">I’ll tell -- I never went to see.</span> <span id="s1566">I -- I didn’t go no cemeteries, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1567">I -- I felt I don’t want to see it any more, you know?</span> <span id="s1568">Maybe it’s wrong, but it’s how I feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: Too painful you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1571">Because one time when my -- it was 1965, we went -- we had -- had a Jewish cemetery in Riga, in Yugla area, where my grandmother was buried.</span> <span id="s1572">And then my -- my mother’s aunt died in 1965 and they buried her in Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s1573">And when I was in the Jewish cemetery there was nothing to remind me of my grandmother, there was ground.</span> <span id="s1574">My -- my mother stomped the ground in the place where my grandmother was buried and said, here is the place where she was buried, as far as she could -- could remember.</span> <span id="s1575">But there was nothing, they destroyed everything there.</span> <span id="s1576">So this year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: So you have been -- you have been back to Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Since when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Have you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: No, no, no, this was in 1965.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Oh, ’65.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1583">I-I -- I intend to go, but my wife doesn’t feel too good, so -- I wanted to go three years ago, just -- over the phone I-I realized that somebody knew my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1584">Old woman, but this was three years ago.</span> <span id="s1585">She even mentioned him like a [indecipherable] name, it like -- like a darling name.</span> <span id="s1586">She called him gidelka, my grandfather, so she was a very old woman.</span> <span id="s1587">I don’t even know if she alive now because she was 87 then, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: What are your thoughts about Germans and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: You know, I have some relatives who live in Germany, moved over there.</span> <span id="s1590">As I mentioned, my father’s cousin, who was a guard in Ural mountains, in the prison, his wife lives in Germany, in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1591">And she has two daughters, one in Sweden, and one a -- one in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1592">She -- they lived there in -- from the 70’s, I think.</span> <span id="s1593">And her hu-husband is a dentist and she is an owner of some -- what -- my feelings are very confused about the situ -- Germany.</span> <span id="s1594">First of all, of course, they helped to build Israel, it’s for -- we know it, money-wise, ah -- they must.</span> <span id="s1595">Maybe new generation, they better.</span> <span id="s1596">Was it only brainwashing, o-o-or else during the Hitler’s time?</span> <span id="s1597">I don’t -- I don’t know, this a -- or, weren’t there anti-Semites before Hitler?</span> <span id="s1598">As we say, a dirty pond breeds mosquitoes, no?</span> <span id="s1599">So it was a dirty pond, Germany, that bred these mosquitoes.</span> <span id="s1600">What I say, a lot of people don’t like Jews.</span> <span id="s1601">You have to read history of our people.</span> <span id="s1602">And no matter how hard you try to escape, some people try to escape to be Jew, it will not help them any way.</span> <span id="s1603">It’s showed through history that even in fifth generation, you will be one day hit hard.</span> <span id="s1604">I am proud to be Jew, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1605">And I always said I am Jew, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1606">What can I say?</span> <span id="s1607">Who escapes our n-nationality?</span> <span id="s1608">I call it nationality, not just a religion but -- because anybody ha -- can have a religion, but nationality, it’s one.</span> <span id="s1609">You have certain features, you have certain blood, maybe.</span> <span id="s1610">But religion, it can have any religion.</span> <span id="s1611">Karl Marx was a -- a Christian, right, considered.</span> <span id="s1612">What kind of feature he had?</span> <span id="s1613">Everybody -- if you walk through Moscow, everybody would call him kike, take a look at him.</span> <span id="s1614">No matter how hard he tried to escape Judaism, or Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Have you become more religious in any way since your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: No, I didn’t become religious, but I am proud of our achievements.</span> <span id="s1617">I am proud that we have Bible.</span> <span id="s1618">I am proud that people -- that everybody, e-especially in the western world has a part of our culture.</span> <span id="s1619">Everybody, and they can’t escape it.</span> <span id="s1620">Sometimes I even have a feeling that everybody wants to be a Jew, but in their own way.</span> <span id="s1621">And this is impossible.</span> <span id="s1622">So I -- I am proud of our achievement.</span> <span id="s1623">Maybe I would like to have m -- cultural achievements like the Greeks, maybe in architecture or in some other things.</span> <span id="s1624">Maybe I would be in disagreement with the Bible, but actually they were different times.</span> <span id="s1625">You had to take from the pagan world, you had to take a certain people and make them who they became.</span> <span id="s1626">And there was no other way, because you couldn't pray to a -- to a statue, right?</span> <span id="s1627">This was ma -- now, of course we a little bit we are out of -- separate from religion, it was -- in some ways it g-gave us the opportunity to achieve our greatness, actually Jewish people are great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: How did you impart that feeling to your children, about the greatness of the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: I-I -- I tried to knock in their head all the time.</span> <span id="s1630">My older is not -- you know.</span> <span id="s1631">Maybe he has in his heart, but he -- but my younger is very proud, and he work for Jewish causes and he went to Israel, served voluntarily in the army, worked in kibbutz.</span> <span id="s1632">And this is a different k -- person.</span> <span id="s1633">But my older is more materialistic, you see.</span> <span id="s1634">I don’t know how to express this.</span> <span id="s1635">[indecipherable] materialistic too.</span> <span id="s1636">A lot of them, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Are you more comfortable around people who experienced World War two firsthand than those of us who did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: No, it depends on situation.</span> <span id="s1639">You know, I don’t have many friends I would say, but I don’t talk -- people in America they don’t understand, many of them.</span> <span id="s1640">They don’t understand what it is.</span> <span id="s1641">They have it too fat here.</span> <span id="s1642">They’re only complaining.</span> <span id="s1643">Complaining and complaining.</span> <span id="s1644">They took one dollar away from them, they already think that they are hungry.</span> <span id="s1645">You see, depends on situation.</span> <span id="s1646">Comfortability depends -- of course I am happy to see my old friends, we have organization with survivors of -- Holocaust survivors from Latvia, so I am a member, pay my dues.</span> <span id="s1647">But -- but I know a few of them, one or -- one, two.</span> <span id="s1648">That’s it, because they’re all from different places and older people than I am, even.</span> <span id="s1649">Some of them younger, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Did you go to the large 1983 American gathering of Holocaust survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: No, I didn’t go to Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1652">You see, those Jewish organizations are so fragmented, and it seems to me I don’t like many things about this, reparations and this, all what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1653">Pay the personalities from -- maybe if you have your name in the s -- in the bank, your personal name, you should get paid, yeah.</span> <span id="s1654">But in general, my opinion is, it should go to the state of Israel, everything.</span> <span id="s1655">I-I have the feeling all the monies, it -- where we’re building our country, that’s where it should go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: How would you describe yourself today?</span> <span id="s1657">Israeli, American --</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: First of all, mostly I describe myself as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1659">My first love goes to Israel.</span> <span id="s1660">I -- I -- I’ll tell you, even when the -- the weather is over there no rain, I feel bad when they have no rain, you know?</span> <span id="s1661">And this is first, these are my -- my head is -- it’s -- you know, it’s separation of head and heart.</span> <span id="s1662">My head is materialistic, my heart is -- probably a lot of people like this, it’s my -- I’m not the first.</span> <span id="s1663">My heart is with m -- Israel and the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1664">I know we have a lot of faults, obviously, like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1665">I don’t say that we are better than anybody else, but we are peculiar people, we’re special.</span> <span id="s1666">And that’s what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: You were here in the 70’s in the United States and of course there was the big Civil Rights movement that started in the 60’s here.</span> <span id="s1668">Do you feel that you, who lived through times when your rights were taken away, and your parents and everybody else, that you have a more -- a bigger sensitivity to people whose rights have not been addressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: When -- you’re talking about the black ama -- African Americans?</span> <span id="s1670">You -- you see, like I said you’re a person, no matter what color.</span> <span id="s1671">If you’re a good person, you’re a good person, if you’re a bad person, you’re a bad person.</span> <span id="s1672">And I didn’t live through Civil Rights movement during the 60’s over here, I was in the 70’s.</span> <span id="s1673">But I heard about the Black Panthers, and I -- but it’s a radical organization.</span> <span id="s1674">I -- I don’t think by bullets and wa -- and bombs, you will achieve too much in this country, because this country, despite its democracy, we have a very strict police over here and -- and intelligence.</span> <span id="s1675">I don’t think -- and -- and lately I began feeling that -- you see, I am a middle class person with a blue collar back-background, right?</span> <span id="s1676">We start in polit-politics now.</span> <span id="s1677">And I feel that a lot of blacks don’t like Jews, unjustly.</span> <span id="s1678">I-I have my philosophy about that.</span> <span id="s1679">Jewish people tried to help everybody, they out of their skins to help everybody but always it turns out against them.</span> <span id="s1680">It’s what happens with us.</span> <span id="s1681">No matter what you do good for them, one day they will say you didn’t do nothing for us and you going to be a Jew anyway.</span> <span id="s1682">So we have to mind our own business.</span> <span id="s1683">We have to be strong, we have to know how to defend ourselves and I think we have to keep our culture alive.</span> <span id="s1684">I -- I don’t say about, let’s say inter-marriages, or some other things like this.</span> <span id="s1685">I’ll frank -- I’ll tell you, new blood helps.</span> <span id="s1686">Because I know in our religion we even allow cousins to marry, first cousins and this is not good.</span> <span id="s1687">It creates monsters during generations.</span> <span id="s1688">It’s why short people or weak people or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Are there any smells or sights or sounds that come back to you now as an adult that you remind you of your difficult times during the war?</span> <span id="s1690">Anything that triggers your thoughts about the war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Yes, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1692">I don’t think it’s right to dislike people of -- Latvian people of -- in general.</span> <span id="s1693">But I have the feeling that they -- they wronged us.</span> <span id="s1694">They wronged us and during Ulmenist time it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s1695">You know, we had culture, we had the -- you could do anything you want.</span> <span id="s1696">But probably -- the fascists are fascists, they always felt the -- with the help of Nazis they tried to achieve Ju-Judenfrei country, you know, so -- but this is not the first time, and I hope it’s the last, but I’m a pessimist about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: You think this could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: As long as Israel is strong, I don’t think so, but it’s gonna -- goes into realm of politics.</span> <span id="s1699">So I think we’re becoming weak in Israel.</span> <span id="s1700">Too m -- you see, you can’t even compare Israel of today and Israel even 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s1701">No, I don’t even know what to say.</span> <span id="s1702">What to say, we just giving away -- our tiny country away.</span> <span id="s1703">O-Of course we have to separate from the Arabs, we have to separate somehow.</span> <span id="s1704">But t -- empty land, we have to keep it.</span> <span id="s1705">We have to keep it.</span> <span id="s1706">When I look, let’s say at Golan Heights, it’s not only defense of the country, we’re always emphasizing defense and defense and defense.</span> <span id="s1707">It’s not that.</span> <span id="s1708">Take a look.</span> <span id="s1709">Who divided up Africa, Middle East?</span> <span id="s1710">The Colonial powers.</span> <span id="s1711">They divided up, they set up borders and they set up their rules, their international borders.</span> <span id="s1712">Who gave them the right to separate [indecipherable] Jordan from Israel -- from -- or to separate Golan Heights from Israel?</span> <span id="s1713">Who gave them the rights?</span> <span id="s1714">It’s what I me -- question.</span> <span id="s1715">Don’t forget, Golan Heights was a tribe of Manasseh once.</span> <span id="s1716">And you have to look at the historical prospectus.</span> <span id="s1717">You know, during Roman times, your first je -- war, Golan Heights belonged to -- to Jewish state.</span> <span id="s1718">Was it under Agrippa, or what his name was, [indecipherable] the second?</span> <span id="s1719">I don’t remember the name of the king with the [indecipherable] but it was under Jewish rule.</span> <span id="s1720">I remember this vividly.</span> <span id="s1721">So if French or English they decided to, for their own purpose to put new borders, why -- I don’t go along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: What do you think the role of education should be about the Holocaust to the next generation?</span> <span id="s1723">Something like the Holocaust museum, for example?</span> <span id="s1724">Do you think lessons can be learned from the Holocaust, or is it too large, too much to be grasped?</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: You see, we have many deniers of Holocaust, right?</span> <span id="s1726">I -- I don’t know, when people come and -- and look at the exponents, right?</span> <span id="s1727">Exponents or exponents?</span> <span id="s1728">I think it depends on the person what his feelings are, or he doesn’t want nothing happen to u -- anybody else.</span> <span id="s1729">Or some people cu -- come with a vicious heart.</span> <span id="s1730">It -- it can happen too.</span> <span id="s1731">They look and look and say, ah good.</span> <span id="s1732">This what happened to them, fine.</span> <span id="s1733">You can’t -- you can’t get into a heart of a person.</span> <span id="s1734">Sometimes they’re frank, you know, I -- I worked with bl-blue collar workers and I know how they smell, even in America.</span> <span id="s1735">So there’s nothing new that the anti-Semitism exists.</span> <span id="s1736">I don’t know what is the percentage, but everybody whispers, right?</span> <span id="s1737">And especially for me, I don’t look like Jewish, sometimes they think that I am a German.</span> <span id="s1738">So they are frank with me.</span> <span id="s1739">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: And how do you answer them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: It’s a big surprise to them.</span> <span id="s1742">You see, I don’t use my fists any more because it would be a prison term.</span> <span id="s1743">So I know how to behave, but you know, whatever was said about Jews over the centuries, it’s alive today, in -- in their hearts, in their minds.</span> <span id="s1744">They don’t -- they will never change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: Do you feel another Holocaust could happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Maybe not, maybe not like a Holocaust, but you see, t-take Austria.</span> <span id="s1747">You see coming to power people like this Hey -- Haider.</span> <span id="s1748">See, that’s very simple.</span> <span id="s1749">Good that Haider is a small politician in a small country, right?</span> <span id="s1750">Suppose somebody comes in United States.</span> <span id="s1751">It can’t happen?</span> <span id="s1752">Ah, anything can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Do you feel safe here in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Yes, I feel safe now because we have a good economic climate.</span> <span id="s1755">Ec-Economy is good and everything is prosperous.</span> <span id="s1756">You always feel safe when there’s something like this.</span> <span id="s1757">In Germany we didn’t have this situation with the inflation and unemployment and all that, Hitler would never come to power, you know that.</span> <span id="s1758">Now there -- if the situation comes back, huh?</span> <span id="s1759">I remember the situation here when -- about the loans to the farmers in Iowa.</span> <span id="s1760">Right, they began blaming their bankers, the Jewish bankers, right?</span> <span id="s1761">No?</span> <span id="s1762">So see, you can’t change.</span> <span id="s1763">How you say, a -- a leopard can’t change its spots, right?</span> <span id="s1764">So what can you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Do you speak openly about your wartime experiences to others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: I-I would say I don’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: Well, what to talk about it?</span> <span id="s1769">You know, the locals, they wouldn’t understand what it means, you know?</span> <span id="s1770">How you talk to them?</span> <span id="s1771">They -- you -- why would I talk, it will be complaining like, I feel.</span> <span id="s1772">You can’t teach nobody nothing.</span> <span id="s1773">I know how they smell right away, ar-are you at least neutral toward Jews, or you friend of Jews, or you against us.</span> <span id="s1774">It’s -- it’s in your heart, it’s not that you can change by words.</span> <span id="s1775">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1776">You don’t change people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Is -- is there anything you wanted to add, or leave a message to your grandchildren for the future?</span> <span id="s1778">Anything you wanted to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: No, I’ll leave it open.</span> <span id="s1780">I’ll -- I’ll not say
