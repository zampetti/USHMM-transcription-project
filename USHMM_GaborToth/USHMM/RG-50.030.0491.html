didn’t give up, because I was Arnosht -- Ernst Lemberger on -- on the official papers, but among ourself they called me Moshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: How did that start?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Everybody used her middle name.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s670">Was that to be more jew -- more bonded in your Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A:

including non-Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Who sold them?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: That Palestine office, because i-i -- the head of the chi -- pi -- tels -- Palestine office w-was Mr. Jakov Edelstein.</span> <span id="s694">He s-sold them.</span> <span id="s695">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So Jews were exploiting other Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes, because they -- they needed the money, because w-why give certificates to -- to poor people, proletarian, if they can get a lot of money for this -- for this certifi -- certificates.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: So you were stuck with a bunch of proletariat?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s700">I believed in that, because we -- we went -- w-we wanted to go to dol -- the real kibbutzim in Israel, and that was proletarian culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: But you couldn’t if you didn’t have a certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yes, because we waited.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: So what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Well, I got disappointed very early, and that -- and then I -- I -- at the beginning, I published two

<p><span id="s725">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A2: They wanted to declare them as social cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A2: Well, see, that’s what you wrote in the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Because the -- there has -- the be -- Jewish community had a social department.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: And that -- there was a number of organizations, social -- social organizations, Beit Karlotseim was separate because there was a separate o-organization, not -- not --</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: And the -- the organiz -- the social services department turned the Beit Karlotseim into a social organization.</span> <span id="s734">And this I acs -- saw it, but this was a move to young people to prepare the transportations w-when -- if c-comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: You s -- okay, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: And organized the young people of -- who lived in the Beit Karlotseim, to -- they must [indecipherable] against this move.</span> <span id="s739">And they didn’t appreciate it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: So the young people didn’t go along with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: No -- yes, is --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: They didn’t go -- because the head of the social bi -- department, Dr. Katz didn’t even talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So the so-called adults --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: -- just made a decision that you felt put the youth in peril?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: And you fought against that?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: And you got all the youth to go along with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s752">Because then I was a -- then I was a -- a -- I was no longer head of the hek -- Beit Karlotseim, because I was sus -- suspect, because I said -- and that was actually what happened.</span> <span id="s753">The young people were sent to a -- a -- a -- a -- a camp in -- in Bohemia to -- to prepare the -- the -- the future ghetto in Terezín, because that time, Jewish community got the idea that -- that Terezín is the future of the Jews, a-and why at that time already two transportations went to -- to Lódz, because -- and that’s -- the Jewish community -- I’d believe so, they -- they -- they believed that was at -- a -- a solution for the Jewish problem in -- in ber -- bets -- ter -- te -- ter -- [indecipherable] Berman and Melber -- Bohemia and Moravia, because they would save the Czech Jews from being sent abroad to -- if -- ist -- it’s proved to be death camp.</span> <span id="s754">But they a -- the Jewish community believed in that.</span> <span id="s755">I didn’t.</span> <span id="s756">And -- and th-the youth repaired th -- Terezín as the ghetto.</span> <span id="s757">They were -- th-they were -- we -- s -- were strong.</span> <span id="s758">And youth, be -- I -- and young people, and dup -- keek -- they did prepare it.</span> <span id="s759">And when the ghetto came into being, I -- the -- the -- I can’t.</span> <span id="s760">I can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: When -- when the ghetto came into being, did you feel vindicated in any way?</span> <span id="s762">Did you feel like, look, I -- I pointed this out to you, that this was a problem here?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s764">And how in -- how long --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A2: The directorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: The directorship of the ghetto was almost hundred percent Zionist, because that was Jankov Edelstein’s work, because he -- he believed in that, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: And where was the rest of your family during this time?</span> <span id="s768">Where was your mother, and father, and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Fa -- Father was dead, and Mother -- and the sister lived i-in pa -- sw -- in a -- a one room, expecting to -- to be transported, but it was not -- she -- she

Hatzair, and they voted against it.</span> <span id="s777">They wanted to keep me.</span> <span id="s778">Bu-But -- because I went to live with a friend of mine, a -- a German Jews -- Jew, who was

then there was a bombing it takes, o-of course, not many were s -- to gentle Germany, it was a c-cat -- catastrophe for the Czechs.</span> <span id="s1072">But of course, I had to -- I was -- spoke to

the -- the Gestapo man beca -- he -- he was not a traitor.</span> <span id="s1098">Of course, the -- the -- Greece considered [indecipherable] a traitor, because h-he was -- he was a go-between.</span> <span id="s1099">And -- and I told him this story, and a few weeks after -- after I told this Stella, and he -- he told me that I -- I shouldn’t panic the Jews, and he made a hint that he knows where I was living, and I -- I knew that ri -- Friedman must have known this thing a-all the time.</span> <span id="s1100">And wi -- and after -- a few weeks afterward, the two were shot, because -- how one man, a Czech shot two German guards, cause he missed them.</span> <span id="s1101">And a -- he was a -- a -- he was a -- a -- a -- a agent of the Gestapo, and she -- he threw away a briefcase, and there was all the -- all the member of his group, and I was not among them.</span> <span id="s1102">Of course, maybe I was Kaliwater, because he didn’t -- didn’t know -- know my name.</span> <span id="s1103">And -- and all the -- all the members of this group were arrested, and ol -- only one came back.</span> <span id="s1104">Because he -- everybody was kept alive three

months, a-a-and he was late, he was arrested late, because he -- i-i-in the meantime, the war was over, he -- he came back.</span> <span id="s1106">And Eleanor was also arrested, because he was not on

about this.</span> <span id="s1125">It seems that people -- well, not -- it seems like people obviously had to lie and be deceitful, and keep track of all of these different forms of truth
