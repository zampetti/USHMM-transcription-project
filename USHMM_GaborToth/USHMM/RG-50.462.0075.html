one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">VK: April 22nd, 1985.</span> <span id="s3">My name is Vivian Korman, and I am recording the oral history of Jack Zaifman from Lambertsville, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s4">He will now continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">JZ: Vivian, thank you for the introduction.</span> <span id="s6">Like I said before, I was born in Radom, Poland, on March the 2nd of 1925.</span> <span id="s7">And my childhood was quite, quite good with my parents and my sister and brother.</span> <span id="s8">We were brought up in a semi-Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s9">My father was a merchant.</span> <span id="s10">And we wouldn't say that we were very rich, but we weren't poor either, so we had a good life.</span> <span id="s11">We had a good life.</span> <span id="s12">And we had very good camaraderie among, among the kids.</span> <span id="s13">My sister—I was the oldest, like I said—my sister was the second, and my younger brother was the third, which he was, he adored me in any way because everything I'd done was the best to him.</span> <span id="s14">I know I was a bicycle racer so when he talked to his friends, I was the best in the world to him.</span> <span id="s15">I played soccer and I was the best soccer player to his, his brother was the, everything was the best.</span> <span id="s16">And we were very, very happy together.</span> <span id="s17">I had a very large family of cousins and aunts and grandmothers—two grandmothers.</span> <span id="s18">I never was, I never saw my grandfathers, because one got shot on a holdup in one of his stores.</span> <span id="s19">And my father's father was, died very young.</span> <span id="s20">So, I never met them.</span> <span id="s21">But my grandmothers were very, very beautiful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">VK: I just want to make sure it's working.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">JZ: Yeah.</span> <span id="s24">[tape off then on] Like I said, my grandmothers were very great because she raised—my grandmother of the father's side—raised that family all by herself, of eight children.</span> <span id="s25">And she did a very good job by providing for them.</span> <span id="s26">She worked very hard.</span> <span id="s27">I remember in.</span> <span id="s28">And their home was always open to anybody who walked in.</span> <span id="s29">There was always food on the table.</span> <span id="s30">There could have been always a party of twenty coming in at, unexpectedly, and she always made sure that everybody will go away from the table full.</span> <span id="s31">She was, in that respect, she was one of the greatest—a beautiful, beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s32">My mother's mother, too, is a story in itself, because she was always telling me that she had a cousin in the States.</span> <span id="s33">I remember her always telling me that she has a cousin and he converted to Christianity.</span> <span id="s34">And his name was Goldwasser.</span> <span id="s35">And he was from Mlawa.</span> <span id="s36">And till Barry Goldwater was running for president, and I saw his biography in Life magazine that I started putting things together.</span> <span id="s37">And I, for one, think, that he is the guy of my grandmother's, that he is the cousin, not, his father was the cousin of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s38">They come from the same town, and they were both the same last name.</span> <span id="s39">Her maiden name was Goldwasser.</span> <span id="s40">So, I never actually followed it up, but deep in the inside of my heart I feel that he is one of them.</span> <span id="s41">I had aunts and, which were two very beautiful people, with families, and cousins.</span> <span id="s42">And like I said, we had a beautiful relationship among them because there wasn't a Saturday we shouldn't go to see them.</span> <span id="s43">This was like a ritual, that every weekend we had to go see our grandparents and our aunts and cousins.</span> <span id="s44">They came to our home, we went to them.</span> <span id="s45">And this is the way we were living.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">VK: What was your mother's maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JZ: My mother's maiden name was Obornyek, Hassel Obornyek [phonetic].</span> <span id="s48">She was too a, five daughters and one brother they had.</span> <span id="s49">And my mother looked comp-, like Polish.</span> <span id="s50">When you looked at her features, she would, she didn't resemble a Jew.</span> <span id="s51">And I remember when she used to go out to shop that, from the farmers, they always used to say, "I'd rather sell it to a non-Jew."</span> <span id="s52">And she used to laugh like crazy because when she used to come home she'd just look at those baskets, you know which they stole, they stole, are so bitter about it, about the selling it, selling to a Jew.</span> <span id="s53">So but this is one of the things.</span> <span id="s54">We went to school.</span> <span id="s55">I went to a public school in Poland.</span> <span id="s56">And I went after school, I went to cheder, which I had my Hebrew education, to a degree.</span> <span id="s57">I wasn't really that much in Hebrew versed, but I learned Chumash and I learned Rashi a little bit.</span> <span id="s58">Gemora I never went into.</span> <span id="s59">I could daven very well and I always laid the tefillin in the morning before I went to school.</span> <span id="s60">So, I mean, my upbringing was pretty decent, and I believed that there is a God in heaven.</span> <span id="s61">This, for sure, I was left with till this day.</span> <span id="s62">Till 1939 of September One, when I walked home with my cousin, my cousin Gessel.</span> <span id="s63">We were playing soccer, a matter of fact, in the park, when the bombs started dropping down in my hometown of Radom.</span> <span id="s64">And he got hit right next to me, walking.</span> <span id="s65">He got killed, and I walked away.</span> <span id="s66">I walked away and I ran home to my mother, crying that Gessel just got killed.</span> <span id="s67">She tried to comfort me the best possible way she could.</span> <span id="s68">But it's one of those things, nothing would bring him back.</span> <span id="s69">They took three days of more bombardment of our city.</span> <span id="s70">Buildings were collapsing with people in them.</span> <span id="s71">And I, for the first time in my life, I saw destruction and killings for the first time of my young life.</span> <span id="s72">And it was really an agonizing thing to see.</span> <span id="s73">And it took three more days and the German troops marched into our hometown of Radom.</span> <span id="s74">And hell broke loose.</span> <span id="s75">It happened so suddenly that nobody imagined the atrocities with such a fear of life, that the killings were going on every day.</span> <span id="s76">There wasn't a day, I remember, the Germans laid cables on the streets for their telephone, for the, and somebody cut a cable.</span> <span id="s77">We don't know, till this day I would, I don't know if there was a sabotage or just by accident.</span> <span id="s78">They took out five people, and they were hung.</span> <span id="s79">This was at random.</span> <span id="s80">So among them was one priest, the Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s81">The other ones were four Jews.</span> <span id="s82">This is what we had to stay and watch at the age of 14.</span> <span id="s83">The killings were going on unmercilessly.</span> <span id="s84">They were grabbing people in the streets, every day, cutting their beards, not just the beards but with the flesh.</span> <span id="s85">And they were just roaring in joy for doing those things.</span> <span id="s86">The savagery was so bad.</span> <span id="s87">And I myself was always thinking, Why?</span> <span id="s88">Why?</span> <span id="s89">I was trying to get that answer.</span> <span id="s90">Why is it happening to us?</span> <span id="s91">What did we do to deserve it?</span> <span id="s92">Till one day they surrounded a whole group of people, and they rounded us up.</span> <span id="s93">And this was like maybe about three months into the war.</span> <span id="s94">Rounded us up, and they took us to the train station.</span> <span id="s95">At the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">VK: Was this your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JZ: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s98">Just myself.</span> <span id="s99">Only young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">VK: Just individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">JZ: Individuals.</span> <span id="s102">They grabbed them, and there was a few thousand.</span> <span id="s103">And I was among them.</span> <span id="s104">And they took us to the station.</span> <span id="s105">They took everybody's name, address and age.</span> <span id="s106">And I lied about my age because I was 14.</span> <span id="s107">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s108">I was a short little fellow so I was afraid.</span> <span id="s109">I says, "I'm 17."</span> <span id="s110">They always used to say that if you're too young or too old, they'll get rid of you.</span> <span id="s111">So, we always, in the home we said, "If they catch you, lie."</span> <span id="s112">So I did.</span> <span id="s113">I was 17.</span> <span id="s114">And they took us to the train station.</span> <span id="s115">And towards evening, after all that commotion with all that writing and names were done, they started loading us up into cattle cars.</span> <span id="s116">So we were living right near that station.</span> <span id="s117">I knew every little part of it.</span> <span id="s118">We were playing there as boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JZ: So instead of, while the people were pushing to get into the cattle car, I went in underneath the cattle car, and I took off.</span> <span id="s121">I ran away.</span> <span id="s122">I ran away and back home.</span> <span id="s123">My parents asked, "Well where were you all day?"</span> <span id="s124">And I says, "Didn't you know that they took me away with all the people there from all the streets around?"</span> <span id="s125">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s126">Then they were happy that I was home.</span> <span id="s127">But that same night, the Polish police were knocking on the door, and I anticipated what they were coming for.</span> <span id="s128">So luckily we were living on the first floor.</span> <span id="s129">I jumped out through the window and then listened.</span> <span id="s130">It was late at night.</span> <span id="s131">And I heard, they asked my dad, "Where is your son?</span> <span id="s132">At the last count, he wasn't there.</span> <span id="s133">At the last name calling he wasn't there."</span> <span id="s134">My dad says, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s135">They searched that little apartment which we had, and they left.</span> <span id="s136">I got back into the house, and we were, the rest of the night we were sitting, thinking, what are we gonna do?</span> <span id="s137">Because we, this time was, this was still the period when there was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s138">So we were afraid in case some of the neighbors will see me...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">VK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">JZ: They'll squeal and my whole family would be shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">VK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">JZ: So, my father had a friend in a little town away from Radom which was called Wolanow.</span> <span id="s143">And he told me if I would go to Wolanow, maybe those people of his would take me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">VK: [unclear] O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">JZ: So I went on a bike, and I pedaled down to Wolanow over night.</span> <span id="s146">And it was martial law.</span> <span id="s147">A matter of fact if I would have been caught I would have been shot.</span> <span id="s148">But I took that chance.</span> <span id="s149">I says, "Better I get shot than the whole family would get shot."</span></p> <p><span id="s150">VK: Do you remember when that was, what date or...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">JZ: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">VK: Year?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JZ: The year was in '3-, this was in '39, still in '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">VK: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">JZ: So I took off, and I went to Wolanow, and I moved in with a family of tailors.</span> <span id="s156">They were friends of my dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">VK: Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JZ: And I..</span> <span id="s159">.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">VK: Non-...</span></p> <p><span id="s161">JZ: Yeah, Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">VK: Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">JZ: Oh sure, were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">VK: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">JZ: This was a little town.</span> <span id="s166">It was only 12 kilometers.</span> <span id="s167">Was a small little, there may be, I would say in that whole town, if there were 100 Jewish families there was a lot.</span> <span id="s168">Was alone, and we were surrounded by a lot of farmers and Poles which lived in that little town, village-town so to say.</span> <span id="s169">And I, for the upkeep, I tried to help them.</span> <span id="s170">I was only fourteen and so I says, "Let me help you something."</span> <span id="s171">So he trained me how to be a tailor.</span> <span id="s172">He gave me a thimble, I remember, and how to hold the needle.</span> <span id="s173">And that's how I started to tailor business.</span> <span id="s174">We stayed there for another, about a year.</span> <span id="s175">And all of a sudden they decided there, that's enough of that Wolanow town and they're gonna liquidate it.</span> <span id="s176">So they surrounded the whole town, and they start like, the story was told before to me that if you're too young or too old they'll eliminate you.</span> <span id="s177">That's what they really were doing.</span> <span id="s178">They took all the old people on one side.</span> <span id="s179">They took all the young on one side.</span> <span id="s180">Now there were mothers with young babies.</span> <span id="s181">And the mothers, they felt they could still work, so they grabbed the babies out of their arms.</span> <span id="s182">And they were throwing them in, into the trucks.</span> <span id="s183">And the mothers didn't want to give up the babies.</span> <span id="s184">And they were being clubbed to death with those, with the butts of their rifles, and being beaten.</span> <span id="s185">Oh, that was an agonizing thing to see.</span> <span id="s186">Finally, whichever, some mothers jumped with the babies.</span> <span id="s187">They didn't want to go, and they finally let them go with the babies.</span> <span id="s188">And us they took away to a camp of Wolanow.</span> <span id="s189">They had already prepared a camp, Wolanow, surrounded by electric wires.</span> <span id="s190">And this was right next, about four kilometers away from a German camp—the air force, the Luftwaffe, the German Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s191">And we were supposed to be the slaves for that camp.</span> <span id="s192">So we were 600 people in that camp.</span> <span id="s193">Those guys, which we got in there, and we settled, the next day they took us out again and loaded us up into trucks and they took us out to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s194">And all the people which they took out, the old and the young, were, all of them, shot to death.</span> <span id="s195">And we had to dig trenches and bury all those bodies.</span> <span id="s196">This was near Radom, between Radom and Wolanow, was a big cemetery.</span> <span id="s197">That's where we buried all those people—the babies with the mothers, with the old.</span> <span id="s198">And this is what we have done.</span> <span id="s199">And they took us back to Wolanow.</span> <span id="s200">Lucky I was registered as a tailor so I worked inside, sewing uniforms, repairing uniforms for the German Army.</span> <span id="s201">The other guys weren't as lucky as I, because they worked on the outside.</span> <span id="s202">And they were being beaten to death, every day, every day dogs tearing them apart.</span> <span id="s203">You had a broken leg or you broke an arm, or if you hit something, you got shot, because they didn't take care of you.</span> <span id="s204">The conditions were terrible in that camp.</span> <span id="s205">Typhoid fever broke out, typhoid fever broke out and people were dying like crazy.</span> <span id="s206">So, Radom wasn't too far so they were always, in this camp they had always a force of 600.</span> <span id="s207">So say if ten people died today, they brought in ten from Radom.</span> <span id="s208">So the, when the Appell was in the morning, when they counted you, there were always had to be 600 people.</span> <span id="s209">When the typhoid fever was so, the epidemic was so great, that all of a sudden one morning before we went to work, the Appell, because they counted you like you would have been gold, every day there had to be the exact number.</span> <span id="s210">They surrounded us with the Gestapo, a lot of Ukrainers, a lot of Lithuanian troops which joined the German Gestapo.</span> <span id="s211">For no reason at all they started calling out the ten, "Out!"</span> <span id="s212">The men that went out, they got shot.</span> <span id="s213">They got shot.</span> <span id="s214">I had a friend of mine which had a brother.</span> <span id="s215">They called up my friend, and a brother went out begging, and they shot them both, two brothers.</span> <span id="s216">There was a father and two sons from Wolanow which they called up one and they both ran out, "Please!"</span> <span id="s217">begging, and they were all three shot.</span> <span id="s218">Three hundred and fifty people were shot from the 600.</span> <span id="s219">Three hundred and fifty.</span> <span id="s220">We all stayed and we died a thousand deaths not being shot.</span> <span id="s221">We didn't know what's gonna, who's gonna be the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">JZ: And they were shooting you with dum-dum bullets.</span> <span id="s224">A dum-dum bullet is a bullet, when it hits your body, it explodes.</span> <span id="s225">So it tore you apart.</span> <span id="s226">This was a day which till this day, I cannot forget.</span> <span id="s227">Because you lay sometimes at night and you wake up, with seeing those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">JZ: Because it's so imbedded in my mind that it's very hard to erase, very hard to erase it.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">JZ: After that massacre was finished, we had to dig trenches again and bury those bodies.</span> <span id="s232">I contracted the typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s233">I don't know how, or from fright, from fear, or from picking up one of the bodies, who knows?</span> <span id="s234">And I got typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s235">Typhoid fever is a sickness which burns you up alive.</span> <span id="s236">It's, temperature goes up to 106 and it's terrible.</span> <span id="s237">You're delirious.</span> <span id="s238">For three days I walked to work, from Wolanow to the camp of the Germans.</span> <span id="s239">I was, I, the fourth day I felt that I couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s240">I really couldn't.</span> <span id="s241">And the minute you sat down on the road, you got a bullet.</span> <span id="s242">So with all your might, you walked.</span> <span id="s243">So the fourth day my friends carried me under the arms, really carried me.</span> <span id="s244">I was just dragging my feet.</span> <span id="s245">And I got, finally I got to the place.</span> <span id="s246">I got into the shop.</span> <span id="s247">And there was a German in charge of that shop of mine, a guy by the name of Fritz Steinmetz, a decent person.</span> <span id="s248">A German, but a decent guy.</span> <span id="s249">I walked over to Steinmetz and I says, "Mr. Steinmetz, please help me, because if you won't help me you won't see me tomorrow.</span> <span id="s250">I'll be shot.</span> <span id="s251">I'm sick.</span> <span id="s252">Please help me."</span> <span id="s253">And he called in another guy, a guy by the name Adolf Hammel, Adolf Hammel.</span> <span id="s254">He was a Sergeant in the air force, but he was in charge of the clothing.</span> <span id="s255">So they were working always together because we had to fix uniforms.</span> <span id="s256">He gave the uniforms.</span> <span id="s257">So they were very friendly.</span> <span id="s258">And they were discussing amongst themselves what to do with me.</span> <span id="s259">And they decided to save me.</span> <span id="s260">Adolf Hammel took me in his car, and took me deep into a Polish village, and bribed the farmer to keep me there.</span> <span id="s261">And I stayed there for another four days in that Polish farmer's house.</span> <span id="s262">He came every night, Adolf Hammel, to find out how I am.</span> <span id="s263">And the one thing which I remember saying to him, "Ich brauch einen Arzt.</span> <span id="s264">Ich brauch einen Arzt."</span> <span id="s265">[I need a doctor.</span> <span id="s266">I need a doctor.]</span> <span id="s267">And this man went to, back to Radom, which was only twelve kilometers, and he asked for a pass, to bring me back to the Radomer Ghetto.</span> <span id="s268">Because that time was already a ghetto in Radom.</span> <span id="s269">And they had a primitive hospital.</span> <span id="s270">They had doctors.</span> <span id="s271">And they took me back there.</span> <span id="s272">And I stayed there till my, the epi-, you know, the typhoid holds you for 13 days and 13 nights and then the crisis sets in.</span> <span id="s273">And luckily I got some medication and I started feeling better.</span> <span id="s274">But I remember the 13th night.</span> <span id="s275">I remember I got the shakes so bad that I thought I'm gonna fall out of that bed.</span> <span id="s276">But after that, for about a couple hours, I felt that the temperature was going down and I started thinking.</span> <span id="s277">I could feel, and my head was getting easier.</span> <span id="s278">But it leaves you so weak that you cannot even lift a pen.</span> <span id="s279">Your muscles in your body are all burned out.</span> <span id="s280">You cannot walk at all.</span> <span id="s281">You have to start learning all from the beginning how to walk and how to lift your arm.</span> <span id="s282">It took about another two, three weeks and I came back to my strength.</span> <span id="s283">And they called the camp, and Adolf came and picked me up.</span> <span id="s284">He picked me up and took me back to Wolanow.</span> <span id="s285">I wanted to point out that there were, in those dark days when the murderous gangs were doing, there were still some decent people among the Germans too.</span> <span id="s286">And I stayed in Wolanow yet till the end of 1941.</span> <span id="s287">Because in, after the Germans attacked the Russians in 1941 in June, they, we stayed another few months and they liquidated Wolanow.</span> <span id="s288">And they took us closer to the German border, a camp by the name of Blizyn.</span> <span id="s289">And we went into a camp called Blizyn which was ten thousand inmates, ten thousand.</span> <span id="s290">And it was women and men.</span> <span id="s291">And that camp was set up of shops, shops of making uniforms from scratch, uniforms.</span> <span id="s292">Matter of fact I was in that shop with Zalmud Kizar, [phonetic] which wrote the book, Blood and Hope.</span> <span id="s293">I was with him in that camp.</span> <span id="s294">He was from Bialystok and I was from Radom, but we met there.</span> <span id="s295">I made jackets for the German Army, reversible jackets, green on the one side and white on the other, to camouflage for the Russian front.</span> <span id="s296">There were shops where they were making boots for the Germans, shirts, sweaters, and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s297">And in that shop, in that camp, there was a guy which was in charge of it he was an Oberscharführer, a guy with two stars, and a black uniform.</span> <span id="s298">He just walked around every hour on the hour.</span> <span id="s299">He visited every shop, see if everything is in order.</span> <span id="s300">In that camp I got acquainted with a guy, in Wolanow, and we got very friendly, like brothers, a guy by the name of Michael Berkowitz.</span> <span id="s301">Michael Berkowitz contracted typhoid fever in that camp.</span> <span id="s302">And what they were doing with guys in there, they put you in, in a barrack, and you laid there till you died.</span> <span id="s303">I did one day, I boiled up some hot water.</span> <span id="s304">I had a lump of sugar.</span> <span id="s305">So, I melted down this sugar, and made a like a tea for him.</span> <span id="s306">And I had ten minutes' time to go out to the washroom.</span> <span id="s307">So I what I had done, I ran across the camp to the other end of the camp to give Michael the tea.</span> <span id="s308">When I got, I got to the camp, until I got in there, because I was already, after that typhus I wasn't afraid that I'm gonna, because I was immuned already to it.</span> <span id="s309">So I got in.</span> <span id="s310">I gave him the tea, and thank God he survived.</span> <span id="s311">Hopefully it's the tea.</span> <span id="s312">First we have to thank the Almighty, but hopefully the tea was number two.</span> <span id="s313">And he survived.</span> <span id="s314">He's alive and he lives in Australia.</span> <span id="s315">I gave him the tea, and I ran back to the shop.</span> <span id="s316">I had the ten minutes' time, and there was a Jewish policeman at the door.</span> <span id="s317">And my number was 1675.</span> <span id="s318">He looks up the number, to take off my number, he says, "You were out fifteen minutes.</span> <span id="s319">Where were you?"</span> <span id="s320">And I says, "You know, Michael Berkowitz who sits right next to my machine?"</span> <span id="s321">I says, "He's sick, so I took over some tea, and please, don't make a issue.</span> <span id="s322">I'll finish my work on time."</span> <span id="s323">And I went to the machine to work.</span> <span id="s324">And a few minutes later the hour was that the, that Oberscharführer came into our shop.</span> <span id="s325">He walked in, and my number is being called, 1675.</span> <span id="s326">I walked up to him, and he asked, "Where were you?"</span> <span id="s327">Before I had a chance to say anything, I got a beating.</span> <span id="s328">And the man walked around with a whip like you train animals, and a piece of leather at the end.</span> <span id="s329">Each time he hit me I was cut all over like a German Shepherd which tore me apart, which I have scars till this day from the beating.</span> <span id="s330">The whole shop cried from the beating which I got.</span> <span id="s331">I cried, but not from pain.</span> <span id="s332">I cried for being betrayed, being betrayed by a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">VK: By a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">JZ: Which reminded me again to those two Germans which saved my life, and I almost lost of it because of a guy which wanted to be a Good Samaritan for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">VK: Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">JZ: Surely.</span> <span id="s337">Milstein, a Kapo.</span> <span id="s338">So this Yilek Milstein, this man did this to me.</span> <span id="s339">For two weeks I was swollen, swollen.</span> <span id="s340">But I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s341">Because if you didn't work you got shot.</span> <span id="s342">I worked.</span> <span id="s343">I couldn't sit, but I had to work, and finish my work too, on time.</span> <span id="s344">This was the life in Blizyn.</span> <span id="s345">And this was the people you're surrounded by some, some of them, some of our Jews too.</span> <span id="s346">Finally they liquidated Blizyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">VK: Who liquidated it?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">JZ: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">VK: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">JZ: They finally says, "That's enough of the shops.</span> <span id="s351">We don't need more uniforms."</span> <span id="s352">And we were hearing about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s353">We heard about a camp, about gassing people, but we still didn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s354">Even being, seeing all the murders going on, we still didn't believe that there is mass murdering and there's people are being gassed.</span> <span id="s355">And we wouldn't want to believe it.</span> <span id="s356">They loaded us up finally into cattle cars out of Blizyn.</span> <span id="s357">Out of the 10,000 people which we stayed in Blizyn, 3,000 came out alive.</span> <span id="s358">3,000 only!</span> <span id="s359">That means 7,000 died or that they got killed or they got shot, whichever it is, whether from typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s360">This is the way we got out.</span> <span id="s361">They got us into cattle cars so tight that we couldn't sit down.</span> <span id="s362">Three nights and three days we were on the train, from Blizyn to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s363">We couldn't sit down.</span> <span id="s364">There were people, people died standing in that cattle car.</span> <span id="s365">Finally we got to Auschwitz, and they opened up the doors and they started screaming, "Raus!</span> <span id="s366">Raus!</span> <span id="s367">Raus!"</span> <span id="s368">And we started jumping out of those cattle cars.</span> <span id="s369">And something told you very, very definitely, there is something wrong here.</span> <span id="s370">Because you, we smelled in the air, burned flesh.</span> <span id="s371">And I says, "My God, that's really true what they were saying.</span> <span id="s372">They're burning people here."</span> <span id="s373">And they started lining us up to five.</span> <span id="s374">And we marched through the gates of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s375">And there was that man with the black shiny boots which with the finger, left and right.</span> <span id="s376">At the time I didn't know who he was.</span> <span id="s377">I had, in later years, I found that this was Mengele, the Angel of Death, which stood there and directed.</span> <span id="s378">And we were being torn apart.</span> <span id="s379">You're going maybe with your brother, or you're going with your father, you're going with your friends.</span> <span id="s380">One to the left, one to the right, one, tearing apart.</span> <span id="s381">And that's how it was.</span> <span id="s382">I went to the left.</span> <span id="s383">The left was people to life.</span> <span id="s384">The right, that time was the people all on the right side went to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s385">What was my job in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s386">Auschwitz was a camp of death, of destruction only.</span> <span id="s387">My job was to sort out the clothing of the dead.</span> <span id="s388">You should have seen–thousands, thousands of unifor-, of suits, ladies' dresses, shoes, mountains of shoes, mountains of glasses.</span> <span id="s389">There was a group was just pulling out the teeth, the gold teeth from the bodies.</span> <span id="s390">Drums, drums of gold.</span> <span id="s391">Drums, like you see in some of the shops which they have those drums, those metal drums, full of gold teeth.</span> <span id="s392">This was the job.</span> <span id="s393">And I was one day laying in the bunk, on the bunk bed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s394">And next to me was a guy by the name of David Friedman, from Lodz.</span> <span id="s395">And Mengele walked through and picked him out, picked him out.</span> <span id="s396">It could have been just...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">VK: You.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">JZ: It could have been me.</span> <span id="s399">He took him out.</span> <span id="s400">And three weeks later I seen him again.</span> <span id="s401">He was castrated...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">VK: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s403">JZ: Without anesthesia.</span> <span id="s404">This was some of the experiments what he was doing while I was there.</span> <span id="s405">I stayed there at that Kommando and I says, one day there was a group going by.</span> <span id="s406">I says, "Maybe I'll walk away from it.</span> <span id="s407">I'll walk away."</span> <span id="s408">I don't know where I was going.</span> <span id="s409">I didn't realize it wasn't, it was like God's hand took me from there and He says, "Walk."</span> <span id="s410">I walked.</span> <span id="s411">I walked, and we walked out of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s412">They took my number, they registered me, and that means that everything jived.</span> <span id="s413">And I was loaded up again to a cattle car.</span> <span id="s414">And I was shipped to Dachau.</span> <span id="s415">I got into Dachau.</span> <span id="s416">There they didn't need no more, first of all Dachau was a camp, a working camp.</span> <span id="s417">They worked you to death, worked you to death.</span> <span id="s418">The job which I was doing in Dachau was carrying cement.</span> <span id="s419">We were building hangars for airplanes underground.</span> <span id="s420">So they were building mountains of dirt and then pouring cement on top of it.</span> <span id="s421">Then we had to dig out the dirt so there was an empty shell left.</span> <span id="s422">And in that cement which we carried, hundreds daily were killed.</span> <span id="s423">Daily.</span> <span id="s424">Because, you know, you fell with a bag and you spilled a bag, you got shot right away.</span> <span id="s425">You're, you know, and they chased you, or emptying those cars from, with those bags of cement, some of them were loose cement.</span> <span id="s426">We were spitting up cement.</span> <span id="s427">We were walking, we were gray from the cement.</span> <span id="s428">The food which we were getting in that camp was, towards the end, it was terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s429">We were getting a slice of bread which was mildew.</span> <span id="s430">And it was so dry and mildew, when you blew at the bread, it fell apart.</span> <span id="s431">That's the way we were fed.</span> <span id="s432">And a cup of coffee, ersatz coffee, and a dish of soup.</span> <span id="s433">This was the meal for the day.</span> <span id="s434">I worked at this place a few months, and then they took me to another place to dig trenches for laying pipes.</span> <span id="s435">I laid pipes and it was a terrible thing, because you felt like you're dying a thousand times a day.</span> <span id="s436">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">VK: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">JZ: In Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">VK: In Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">JZ: Yeah, outside...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">VK: Outside of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">JZ: Outside of Dachau they were taking us out to build all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s443">We were laying pipes there.</span> <span id="s444">And one of those days a guy, which was the guard, was just going back and forth watching us.</span> <span id="s445">For no reason picked up the rifle and hit me and I [unclear] two feet.</span> <span id="s446">He hit me right in the [unclear] and he grabbed the shovel and showed me how to work.</span> <span id="s447">Surely, for two minutes you could do a job.</span> <span id="s448">But you stay, you stay for years, you're undernourished and you're almost a skeleton, that shovel felt like a thousand pounds each time you had to lift it.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">JZ: So, this was Dachau, the way I lived in Dachau.</span> <span id="s451">And I have seen guys which gave up, really gave up.</span> <span id="s452">They says, "Looks like humanity and God has forsaken us.</span> <span id="s453">No use living because..." And so help me, like they would commit suicide.</span> <span id="s454">Like, they would take poison.</span> <span id="s455">You found them dead the next day, next to you, laying on the bunk bed, dead.</span> <span id="s456">Dead.</span> <span id="s457">One thing about me, I have to say, because I am analyzing myself a thousand times...</span></p> <p><span id="s458">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">JZ: How come?</span> <span id="s460">How come I survived?</span> <span id="s461">And I had the will of a, you have to first say that God which carried you through, but I had a will to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">JZ: I really didn't want to give up.</span> <span id="s464">A matter of fact, when I was in Auschwitz, when I was going through Auschwitz and I was going to be tattooed, crazy how it sounds, I watched who has a good handwriting.</span> <span id="s465">Crazy, you know?</span> <span id="s466">A young mind, in those dark days when people were being burned, I say, now I went to, over to a Frenchman because his, he was, his numbers were even.</span> <span id="s467">They weren't big and small and big and small.</span> <span id="s468">So I stayed in the line.</span> <span id="s469">I could move from one till the other till I got that guy, he should do my tattooing.</span> <span id="s470">I says, "If I survive I want to have a decent number."</span> <span id="s471">It's crazy how it is, you know, but that's the way I was thinking.</span> <span id="s472">Everybody has different ways of trying to latch on.</span> <span id="s473">I latched on...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s475">VK: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">JZ: You asked me about my parents.</span> <span id="s477">I'll tell you about my parents.</span> <span id="s478">My father was shot in Radom at the, when they were liquidating the ghetto, he was shot.</span> <span id="s479">How do I know?</span> <span id="s480">My father's brother was with him, the youngest brother.</span> <span id="s481">And he is alive.</span> <span id="s482">He lives now in Israel.</span> <span id="s483">And he was, he fell right next to my f-, matter of fact, they were both shot.</span> <span id="s484">But my father was killed instantly, and my uncle was shot in the shoulder.</span> <span id="s485">And when he fell, he cut his head open.</span> <span id="s486">Where they were chasing him, they were drunk.</span> <span id="s487">The Germans were drunk, and they were shooting at random whoever they got a hold of.</span> <span id="s488">And he fell, and he laid a whole night among the dead.</span> <span id="s489">And they brought down from another ghetto, the people to bury those.</span> <span id="s490">My uncle says, "I'm alive."</span> <span id="s491">So one took off a raincoat and covered him up, and he was only shot through the, and this was only a wound.</span> <span id="s492">So he went through and he survived.</span> <span id="s493">So he's, a matter of fact, written up in the book of Radom, that he is a survivor of that killings which was going on when that liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s494">My mother, sister and brother, were taken away to Treblinka, which nobody came out of there.</span> <span id="s495">So, this was one of the things that I know that they're not here.</span> <span id="s496">A matter of fact, I went, my kids, I have here my own kids with me.</span> <span id="s497">And they begged me to go and put in the names in the computer, which I did.</span> <span id="s498">They still hope.</span> <span id="s499">But I know that it's, you know, I was searching all over Europe prior to my coming to this United States.</span> <span id="s500">And that was an endless, endless hope.</span> <span id="s501">So, but for the sake of my own children, I went and I registered the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">VK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">JZ: And we'll see, hope.</span> <span id="s504">So this is what happened to my family.</span> <span id="s505">I was talking to you about Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">VK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">JZ: And I stayed in Dachau till the liberation, not completely the liberation because April of 1945, April the 24th of 1945, they rounded us up, the able bodies which were able to walk, and they marched us out of Dachau.</span> <span id="s508">And we walked with the Germans towards Buch-, towards Mittenwald, towards the Tyrolean mountains.</span> <span id="s509">They wanted to set up another front against the Allies.</span> <span id="s510">And we were the slaves to carry all their equipment.</span> <span id="s511">And all of the way from Dachau till the destination where we were liberated, there were bodies alongside, on both sides of the road, because people were giving up.</span> <span id="s512">They couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s513">And the minute you gave up or you sat down at the road you got a, you, every minute you heard, "Boom.</span> <span id="s514">Boom.</span> <span id="s515">Boom."</span> <span id="s516">Every minute there was somebody shot.</span> <span id="s517">Every minute!</span> <span id="s518">The whole way we didn't even bury those people because we were being chased by the Americans.</span> <span id="s519">So we kept running, running.</span> <span id="s520">We got over through a town, the last town I remember it was Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s521">And this is in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s522">We got over to this town and we got out of the town and we got into a little village by the name of Buchberg [phonetic-May mean Buchenbert, a village in Bavaria].</span> <span id="s523">We crossed a big bridge.</span> <span id="s524">There was a river.</span> <span id="s525">I don't remember the name of the river, but the Germans dynamited the bridge.</span> <span id="s526">We were on this side, and we saw the American comes on the other side.</span> <span id="s527">Now, just to last another few hours.</span> <span id="s528">And so many died.</span> <span id="s529">So many died the last minute.</span> <span id="s530">But, it took, oh, about two hours and they put up a hanging bridge over.</span> <span id="s531">And they surrounded us, surrounded us, and the joy was something which it's hard to describe.</span> <span id="s532">The Americans cried, and we cried for joy and they cried over looking the way we looked.</span> <span id="s533">And I remember an American which took off a coat, wrapped it around me, and carried me off to an ambulance.</span> <span id="s534">Because I was seventy pounds at liberation, a walking skeleton, a man with no hair at all.</span> <span id="s535">No hair.</span> <span id="s536">I lost all my hair from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s537">Swollen.</span> <span id="s538">I looked like a hundred years old.</span> <span id="s539">And so many people died after the liberation, because the Americans gave them everything they could.</span> <span id="s540">They took their, they would give their heart at that time.</span> <span id="s541">Food, and this wasn't, our systems weren't used to that kind of food.</span> <span id="s542">The people were dying from good food.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">JZ: So, luckily I was, again taken to the hospital, which I was fed accordingly to my weight.</span> <span id="s545">And I came back to my strength.</span> <span id="s546">They say, "There's bones, there's flesh."</span></p> <p><span id="s547">VK: Where was the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">JZ: The hospital was in Wolfratshausen.</span> <span id="s549">It was set up by the Americans, a clinic.</span> <span id="s550">And it was a primitive but there was, at least there were doctors and they know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">JZ: And it took a few weeks and I was back on my feet.</span> <span id="s553">And we settled in a little displaced camp called Feldafing, in Feldafing, in Germany.</span> <span id="s554">And there we stayed.</span> <span id="s555">And I met a girl there.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">VK: Yes, oh good.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">JZ: I met my wife, which I married in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s558">I had, I was married in 1946.</span> <span id="s559">We married under the sky by a very Orthodox rabbi from Hungary, because my wife is Hungarian.</span> <span id="s560">And we stayed and I went to school.</span> <span id="s561">While I was in Germany I never had the opportunity before, before the war started.</span> <span id="s562">So I went to the Academy of Art and I learned cutting and designing.</span> <span id="s563">Since I was a tailor, I says, "Let me be at least a full fledged tailor."</span> <span id="s564">So I learned cutting and designing.</span> <span id="s565">And I, we waited to come to this United States.</span> <span id="s566">My wife had family in Trenton, an uncle, which she kept writing to him and he was very happy to hear that she is alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">VK: What's his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">JZ: Joseph Kraus, from Trenton, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s569">He had a restaurant, a Jewish deli and another restaurant.</span> <span id="s570">And he sent papers for us.</span> <span id="s571">But she, since she was a Hungarian, the quota was very slow, and we had to wait till '49 to be able to come to this United States.</span> <span id="s572">And there was a long wait and we almost gave up really.</span> <span id="s573">But at the last minute when President Truman signed the law for admitting 200,000 refugees to this United States, we were among them on the list.</span> <span id="s574">So we came and, but one of the unfortunate things, it happened that the uncle which we wrote to and which I never met, and she never met, died while we're aboard ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">VK: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">JZ: So we never saw him.</span> <span id="s577">But he had a son which he left a son, a doctor, Dr. Kraus, which was waiting at the, he was waiting at in the har...</span></p> <p><span id="s578">VK: At the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">JZ: At the boat, in Boston.</span> <span id="s580">And, as a matter of fact, I got a telegram on the boat.</span> <span id="s581">I didn't want to tell my wife that her uncle died.</span> <span id="s582">And everybody was rushing to get off the boat and I says, "What am I gonna rush?"</span> <span id="s583">To myself.</span> <span id="s584">I says, "There's nobody waiting for us."</span> <span id="s585">So we got off the last people.</span> <span id="s586">The last people.</span> <span id="s587">And that was a boat I think of 1100.</span> <span id="s588">We got off the last people, and that cousin was already going frantic.</span> <span id="s589">He says, "What happened?</span> <span id="s590">Did they miss the boat?</span> <span id="s591">There's something, you know?"</span> <span id="s592">And he was walking to the HIAS and to the Joint to find out.</span> <span id="s593">And they said, "No, he's there on the list."</span> <span id="s594">But we finally got out and there is a man which hardly spoke Yiddish, and we couldn't speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s595">That was a, but it was a cry, it was a reunion of, a very emotional reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">VK: How long did the boat take to come over?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">JZ: Ten days.</span> <span id="s598">I lost 25 pounds coming over, on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">VK: I'm sure!</span> <span id="s600">The North Atlantic, sure!</span></p> <p><span id="s601">JZ: I was at that time, the ocean was so rough, I was, I remember getting on the boat in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s602">And we got on the boat, and the first, we must have got on, that must have been like 3:00 in the afternoon, and the first dinner was served to us on the boat.</span> <span id="s603">We ate a fine dinner because it was, the boat's name was the S.S. Marina Fletcher, and it was with the waiters and oh the whole thing, that was really a real unique boat.</span> <span id="s604">And after we finished dinner we went to a place where we slept.</span> <span id="s605">And my wife in one end of the ship, I went in the other end of the ship.</span> <span id="s606">And in the morning we got up and I learned one word, a few words really.</span> <span id="s607">I said, "Juice, eggs, toast."</span> <span id="s608">Because you had to ask, tell the waiter what you want for breakfast.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">JZ: So I walked in the dining room for breakfast and I, the minute they was, start bringing the juice I felt like something is coming.</span> <span id="s611">And I was holding my mouth and I ran out to the washroom and that was the end.</span> <span id="s612">This was, I never had anything in my mouth for the ten days!</span> <span id="s613">Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s614">It's a funny thing the way, before I left Germany I bought, I made myself clothing like I would, new clothes.</span> <span id="s615">So I says, "I'm gonna come to the United States.</span> <span id="s616">Let me not be like a beggar.</span> <span id="s617">Let me look like a mensch."</span> <span id="s618">And I bought myself a hat.</span> <span id="s619">So when I got dressed to come off the boat, I put on, the pants were falling off.</span> <span id="s620">Luckily I had a belt to hold on!</span></p> <p><span id="s621">VK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">JZ: Everything was hanging.</span> <span id="s623">But I put on my hat, and it fell over my ears!</span> <span id="s624">And I says, "My God, how could I lose in the head!"</span> <span id="s625">So I says, "Well, my body lost, but the head?"</span> <span id="s626">So, this is a story in itself that I lost...</span></p> <p><span id="s627">VK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">JZ: Even my head shrunk at the time!</span></p> <p><span id="s629">VK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">JZ: So, this was the life which we went through.</span> <span id="s631">And we came to this United States in 1949, April 5th.</span> <span id="s632">And the experience was, we were very lonely, really, because we looked very much to see her uncle, and to have somebody of a family, to touch somebody which is our own.</span> <span id="s633">And he died.</span> <span id="s634">So, even the son and the rest of the family were quite, quite good to us.</span> <span id="s635">Because they took us into their home for a little while.</span> <span id="s636">And then we struggled like the rest of everybody.</span> <span id="s637">Well my wife worked and I worked.</span> <span id="s638">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s639">VK: You worked as a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">JZ: As a tailor.</span> <span id="s641">I worked as a tailor, and she worked as a seamstress, because she had training from the ORT in Europe.</span> <span id="s642">So she knew how to sew a little bit.</span> <span id="s643">So she went to work, and we both worked and saved and saved and saved and were able to buy ourself a home which, and then we started planning for, a family.</span> <span id="s644">And the first child of ours which was born was a girl, which I was pretty, we were disappointed because I wanted a boy.</span> <span id="s645">But you know, it's...</span></p> <p><span id="s646">VK: You love her.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">JZ: Sure do I love her.</span> <span id="s648">The story...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">VK: When was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">JZ: She was born in '51, yeah, '51.</span> <span id="s651">So, we had our first child.</span> <span id="s652">My wife stopped working.</span> <span id="s653">And then we had another daughter.</span> <span id="s654">Then we had two more sons.</span> <span id="s655">So, it's, if you believe in fate, the way things go, that I have a name after my father, I have a name after my mother, I have a name after my sister and I have a name after my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">VK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">JZ: So, the whole family has names.</span> <span id="s658">And it's so beautiful to see that the chain puts links on again, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">JZ: And there's still a continuation of life itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">VK: And that's why it's so important for you to do this taping, so it will be forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">JZ: You know, did I tell you, I never wanted to talk about it, truthfully, not.</span> <span id="s663">Till 1977.</span> <span id="s664">I never, I never told my own kids.</span> <span id="s665">I never told my own kids.</span> <span id="s666">And you ask me, "Why didn't you tell your own kids?"</span> <span id="s667">You know, when I was laying in Auschwitz and in Dachau, on the bunk beds, and I was trying to think why are people so bad, what did they want from the Jews?</span> <span id="s668">I was philosophizing with my own way of living.</span> <span id="s669">And I came to the–actually an understanding of myself, that hate is the reason of all those things.</span> <span id="s670">And looking back, I says, "People are born innocent.</span> <span id="s671">People are really born innocent.</span> <span id="s672">How, how do they start hating?</span> <span id="s673">There must be an implantation in the mind of a child to hate."</span> <span id="s674">So I says, "If ever I survive, if I ever survive, and I have kids of my own, I'll never let them hate, because I don't want to put that seed in their mind."</span> <span id="s675">When they're grown people is a different story.</span> <span id="s676">Then they could think for themselves.</span> <span id="s677">But if I implant that little seed of hate for the Germans, they'll hate for the rest of their life.</span> <span id="s678">See because I always thought, well those two Germans which saved my life, that there were still good people.</span> <span id="s679">And I says, "Maybe there were thousands more like who save others."</span></p> <p><span id="s680">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">JZ: So I, how could I implant something in the mind?</span> <span id="s682">So I says, "Never."</span> <span id="s683">Till '77.</span> <span id="s684">'77 I had a rabbi in my congregation, came into my store one day.</span> <span id="s685">And he says, "Jack, do me a favor, please."</span> <span id="s686">I says, "Yes, rabbi, anything.</span> <span id="s687">Anything.</span> <span id="s688">What can I do for you?"</span> <span id="s689">He says, "I committed myself to Pennsbury High School in Levittown, PA to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s690">And since I know you are a survivor and you're a member of my congregation, would you please come with me?"</span> <span id="s691">I says, "Rabbi, everything you ask, but not this, please, please.</span> <span id="s692">I want to erase it from my memory.</span> <span id="s693">I don't want to remember it."</span> <span id="s694">And, since he was a psychology major he knew how to put it to me.</span> <span id="s695">He says, "Jack, what do you attribute your survival?"</span> <span id="s696">And without even thinking I says, "A miracle, rabbi.</span> <span id="s697">I walked through the shadow of death every day of my life.</span> <span id="s698">A miracle!"</span> <span id="s699">He says, "Don't you think the miracle was to tell the world what really happened?"</span> <span id="s700">He says, "Don't give me an answer.</span> <span id="s701">Think about it, and let me know."</span> <span id="s702">And like, you know, he left.</span> <span id="s703">And I couldn't forget that miracle which I just said to him nonchalantly.</span> <span id="s704">I says to myself, "Maybe he has something which I don't know."</span> <span id="s705">I finished the day's work.</span> <span id="s706">I went home.</span> <span id="s707">I ate dinner.</span> <span id="s708">I couldn't forget it.</span> <span id="s709">I laid in bed and couldn't fall asleep.</span> <span id="s710">I says, "You know, it's 32 years after liberation.</span> <span id="s711">I guess I'm hardened enough to be able to talk about it."</span> <span id="s712">And I called that rabbi the next day and I says, "Rabbi, you know, I never talked about it, but maybe I'll go with you."</span> <span id="s713">Oh, he was very happy.</span> <span id="s714">That rabbi is from Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s715">He used to be now in Trenton, Rabbi Gary Charlestein.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">VK: Oh, I know Gary.</span> <span id="s717">From, he grew up at my synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">JZ: So, and Gary...</span></p> <p><span id="s719">VK: In fact, his wife is here doing the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">JZ: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">VK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">JZ: Gary Charlestein put me into this.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">VK: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">JZ: He's the guy which is, has to take the credit for me going around talking, because he was the guy.</span> <span id="s725">He put it to me with the miracle which I never thought of.</span> <span id="s726">So, Gary says, he was very happy.</span> <span id="s727">He took me to Pennsbury High School.</span> <span id="s728">He is a very eloquent speaker.</span> <span id="s729">He knows history a lot better than I.</span> <span id="s730">He is an educated person.</span> <span id="s731">He gave the history of Nazism, how Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s732">And then he says, to an audience which was over 780 students and the faculty members in the auditorium, he says, "We are fortunate enough to have with us a survivor, which went through Auschwitz and Dachau, to tell you his life story."</span> <span id="s733">And he put me up in front there.</span> <span id="s734">He introduced me as Jack Zaifman.</span> <span id="s735">And like I said, I thought I'm hardened enough to talk about it.</span> <span id="s736">And I started opening my mouth, and like somebody would tore my wound open all over again, I started crying.</span> <span id="s737">I started crying.</span> <span id="s738">[Gasp!]</span> <span id="s739">My God, I couldn't stop crying, in front of all those people.</span> <span id="s740">I really was ashamed of myself.</span> <span id="s741">I says, "Oh my God."</span> <span id="s742">It took me about ten minutes and I composed myself, and I wiped my tears, and I looked out at those people in front of me.</span> <span id="s743">And I have seen something which every human being would like to see.</span> <span id="s744">I have seen compassion.</span> <span id="s745">I have seen love.</span> <span id="s746">I have seen those young people who would like to embrace the world and make a better life for everybody, not only for the Jews alone.</span> <span id="s747">And I says, Jack, to myself I says, Jack, if you could put an impression like this on young minds, even how much it hurts, you'd do it.</span> <span id="s748">And since then I'm doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">VK: So you go all around to different high schools...</span></p> <p><span id="s750">JZ: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">VK: And organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">JZ: I graduated, now I'm going to colleges.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">VK: Oh well that's good!</span></p> <p><span id="s754">JZ: I just did Ryder College.</span> <span id="s755">I did Trenton State College.</span> <span id="s756">And I do all the high schools, yeah.</span> <span id="s757">Like I says, "If they ask me what are you doing I says, 'I graduated from the high schools.</span> <span id="s758">I'm going now to college.'"</span></p> <p><span id="s759">VK: What about your wife's history?</span> <span id="s760">Has she talked about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">JZ: My wife don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s762">Really, she don't.</span> <span id="s763">She says one is enough in the family.</span> <span id="s764">So, she doesn't.</span> <span id="s765">She was only a short while, because the Hungarians didn't go into the war, actually till being taken till '44.</span> <span id="s766">And Wallenberg tried saving so many of them.</span> <span id="s767">And she was only one year, actually 13 months exactly, where she was in camp.</span> <span id="s768">But I was since day one.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">VK: Well; Jack, I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">JZ: I [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s771">VK: On behalf of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s772">And I'm sure that whoever else you want to get this tape, they'll make copies.</span> <span id="s773">One copy will go to you, one copy will go to Gratz College and for any other archive museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">JZ: I appreciate it.</span> <span id="s775">Thanks.</span></p></body></html>
