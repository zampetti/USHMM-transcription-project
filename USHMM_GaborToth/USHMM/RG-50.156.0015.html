So you would say that papers and books were your primary source of information?</span> <span id="s45">Or did you hear any news over the radio?</span> <span id="s46">Or word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Radio, but it wasn’t very popular at that time.</span> <span id="s48">Not everybody had it.</span> <span id="s49">Once in a while only.</span> <span id="s50">But mostly from the newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: In what setting or settings did you have contact with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: School.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did your family do

preaching from the pulpit?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: I would say, yes.</span> <span id="s63">They were Catholics predominately there.</span> <span id="s64">They were influenced by it.</span> <span id="s65">Of course everyone had “his Jew”, the Polish people.</span> <span id="s66">They thought, “You aren’t like the other ones are.”</span> <span id="s67">But in general they were very anti-Semitic, the Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Did that affect your family and people in your community?</span> <span id="s69">Have any direct effect on you?</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s76">A: Yes, I had uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Where did they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: They lived in Wlodzislaw.</span> <span id="s79">There were uncles there, and they moved in other cities, then, Ulkush and Vulburum.</span> <span id="s80">They moved away, because they had the same occupation, all of them; there were seven brothers from my father, and they all -- because the grandparents were, too -- they had a small machine shop, so there wasn’t room for them, so they moved in adjacent cities in order to exercise their profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s82">Do you know what became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: They all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Do you know when they died?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Do you know any details about their death?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes, from one uncle that came to our city when he escaped from Wlodzislaw.</span> <span id="s88">He survived only, after they evacuated or finished the ghetto, cleaned out all the Jews.</span> <span id="s89">He escaped and he came to our town, but unfortunately I couldn’t rescue, I couldn’t help him, because we were taken away.</span> <span id="s90">So he, too, perished, and I don’t know where or when.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Did any of your relatives serve in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: How old were you at the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: I was 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And how did you receive news of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: It was through radio and the newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Do you remember where you were at the time when you first learned of the outbreak of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Yes, we were expecting it, because it was brewing for quite a few days.</span> <span id="s99">So everybody was tuned in to radios or whatever you can find, newspapers.</span> <span id="s100">Nobody did anything, because the world was stopped completely for quite a few days, and everybody listened and waited for the unfortunate news.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What was the reaction of the Jewish community where you lived, to the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s102">Were there any meetings held in the synagogues, or didn’t that work?</span> <span id="s103">How did people feel about the outbreak of the war?</span> <span id="s104">Worried, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: There was despair.</span> <span id="s106">I mean, people were worried about it.</span> <span id="s107">But nobody imagined to what extent that will change everybody’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: That’s the next question I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s109">How did it immediately affect you and your family’s life economically and socially after the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Economically, it didn’t affect maybe as much.</span> <span id="s111">But first of all, my brother and I set out to escape.</span> <span id="s112">And we actually were marching east towards the Russian front, because the Russians occupied half of the Polish territory, so everybody tried to get there.</span> <span id="s113">But we were on foot, and the Germans proceeded with their motorized divisions, so we were overtaken, and then we turned back and went back to our hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: So do you have any recollection of when the Nazi occupation of your hometown occurred?</span> <span id="s115">Dates?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: It would be the 7th of September, 1939, when they marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What actions did the German forces take in the early months or years of the occupation that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: At the early stages, it wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s119">It was the Wehrmacht, or the armed forces.</span> <span id="s120">They were more lenient and actually, we were the only machine shop in the town.</span> <span id="s121">We spoke Jewish, which is similar to German, so we actually did some work for them, and repaired some things.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Can you recall any specific anti-Jewish measures or legislation by the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s124">If something happened to a German soldier or somebody from the occupation forces, they took hostages.</span> <span id="s125">They took fifty people.</span> <span id="s126">They kept them, actually in seclusion, so if something would happen to anybody, they would execute them.</span> <span id="s127">They were afraid for violence or that somebody will revolt, or do something to somebody from the German occupation, so that was instituted first.</span> <span id="s128">Then they started to recruit people for work, clean-up work, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: And were people contained in a ghetto in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s131">Not until 1941.</span> <span id="s132">Then they took a few streets in the city, close to the synagogue, and converted it, and put some walls up, that nobody could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: During the first year of occupation by the Germans, did you have any knowledge of what was going outside of Poland, and what was going outside your community?</span> <span id="s134">Did you know anything about any other ghettos?</span> <span id="s135">Or any mass killings or any concentration camps at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: We did not at that time, not in 1939.</span> <span id="s137">That would be later.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: When did you think you first learned about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: The first when we learned is in 1942.</span> <span id="s140">First they took several hundred people in boxcars…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: From your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: …from our community, and took them away.</span> <span id="s143">and at that time we knew they were going near to Bergen, to Belsen, to Belz, close to Lvov.</span> <span id="s144">That was in the eastern part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: How did you learn about that they were going to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: First of all, we had some people that escaped from there.</span> <span id="s147">A girl, her name was Tiflubiteh, she’s now living in Toronto, and she escaped close to the city, to Belz, where she escaped from the train, from the boxcar.</span> <span id="s148">We knew about it.</span> <span id="s149">A lot of people were traveling -- Polish people -- which informed us.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So then what were the dates and circumstances of your deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: I was, as I mentioned before, I was recruited to fix automobiles and locks, and all the machinist works.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: You were fixing automobiles and trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Yes, not for the army, for the local administration.</span> <span id="s154">That was German occupation force, but the administration, actually.</span> <span id="s155">That wasn’t any more the army.</span> <span id="s156">The army were only the first two, three months.</span> <span id="s157">Then they sent in people that occupied, like the mayor, a German, and all the administration.</span> <span id="s158">The Polish people, they didn’t have nothing to say at that time any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: So you were working on the vehicles, so you weren’t one of the first, then, to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No, I was one of the last ones, actually, to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes, that was in 1942, in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: And you remember who ordered it?</span> <span id="s164">How it came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: The Gestapo.</span> <span id="s166">They sent us to -- because we were profession that they needed -- we went to the airport in Cracow.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did they contact you at your home, did they come to your door, did they send you a letter, or how did it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, they told us that they are going to transport us.</span> <span id="s169">We were only, at that time maybe, 15 people, because I had some people helping me.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: So your family, what had become of them in the meantime?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: When I went, my father was still at home, because he was also a professional, so he was spared, that they didn’t go with the big transport where they sent everybody away.</span> <span id="s172">And my brother was a tailor, which they needed also.</span> <span id="s173">And my younger brother, he helped me.</span> <span id="s174">And my mother and a sister, we had people, a German that we got to know, and he worked at construction company in Cracow, which is 40 kilometers from our town, and he took them and he kept them through the war.</span> <span id="s175">My mother survived and she passes away in 1975 here.</span> <span id="s176">My sister was here also.</span> <span id="s177">Survived, kept hidden by a German.</span> <span id="s178">He was just in a private construction company, employed, and he lived in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: So you were the only one in your family that was deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: No, my father, myself and my two brothers.</span> <span id="s181">We were at first sent to the airport in Cracow.</span> <span id="s182">That was a military airport.</span> <span id="s183">We were employed as machinists fixing autos and cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: What was the means of transportation that they used to deport you?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Truck.</span> <span id="s186">Because we were only about 50 peoples.</span> <span id="s187">Otherwise, other people that they deported to Belz, they were transported in boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: And what were the traveling conditions like in these trucks that you were on?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: It was only 40 kilometers, which is about 25 miles.</span> <span id="s190">It took only an hour-and-a-half or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And what happened at the airport then?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: At the airport?</span> <span id="s193">We had barracks.</span> <span id="s194">There were a few hundred Jewish people, because they worked in the Landmanschaft, which was in agriculture.</span> <span id="s195">They worked in the field.</span> <span id="s196">They had a lot of leaders there, and a lot of them were the professions.</span> <span id="s197">We were, actually, in barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: And what did you do there in these barracks at the airport?</span> <span id="s199">Did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A; No, in the barracks, we lived there, we slept there only.</span> <span id="s201">To work, we went to tailor shops which they established.</span> <span id="s202">Or a lot of people worked in the fields.</span> <span id="s203">They raised, they did harvest.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Were you continuing to work on vehicles then?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: And how long were you there, at the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: There I was only four months, because my sister and my mother, they needed some papers.</span> <span id="s208">I had some Polish people that worked there at the airport -- Poles -- and I got in contact with somebody that’s supposed to make some papers that my sister and my mother, that they aren’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s209">False papers, actually.</span> <span id="s210">And I got caught with the papers.</span> <span id="s211">Somebody, another Pole, reported it to the authorities.</span> <span id="s212">And then the Gestapo came and they arrested me and they wanted to know.</span> <span id="s213">And I got beaten so that when I went to the toilet, the only thing that came is blood.</span> <span id="s214">So they transported me.</span> <span id="s215">At that time they established the concentration camp in Cracow, Plaschau.</span> <span id="s216">That wasn’t even finished yet.</span> <span id="s217">I was arrested and taken there, and not in the camp, but in the jail, of the Cracow Plaschau concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: When did you arrive there?</span> <span id="s219">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: That was in March, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Did anyone else go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No, because I didn’t implicate anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q; How were you processed or registered into the camp or jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: There was no processing.</span> <span id="s225">I don’t know if they kept names or papers.</span> <span id="s226">That was immaterial to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Can you give me a description of what the camp was like --to the best of your recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: At that time, that was the Jewish cemetery, Jerusalemska.</span> <span id="s229">The street, it was in a suburb of Cracow, Plaschau.</span> <span id="s230">And there was an Arbeitslager, which was a camp for people there working, Jewish people, and across from the cemetery there, they constructed their concentration camp.</span> <span id="s231">When I came there, that was just started.</span> <span id="s232">They had only a few barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What were the living conditions like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: (Laughs).</span> <span id="s235">First…it evolved.</span> <span id="s236">They built new barracks, and there were beds erected on top of each other, and there were a few hundred people in each barrack.</span> <span id="s237">They always brought some new people in, from all sorts.</span> <span id="s238">They caught people from Holland, from Germany, and from Belgium.</span> <span id="s239">And at the end, in ’44, they brought a lot of people from Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Can you tell me what a typical day was like at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: A typical day was at 5 o’clock they had Jewish musicians, in the morning, to wake up.</span> <span id="s242">On the trumpet they played the -- like in the army--</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Reveille or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A; In the morning, yeah, to wake ‘em up.</span> <span id="s245">So everybody got up and we got to the kitchen where they served some little soup or bread, and then everybody went to work.</span> <span id="s246">It was strictly a camp where everybody worked.</span> <span id="s247">They had a lot of tailor shops, and they had a lot of manufacturing, products where they made, and a lot of ‘em went out to shops in the city.</span> <span id="s248">They were escorted by the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Were you working/</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: I worked inside.</span> <span id="s251">At that time, I had a friend.</span> <span id="s252">They had a lot of horses and wagons, a few hundred horses.</span> <span id="s253">And a friend of my father, he was in charge.</span> <span id="s254">When I was imprisoned there, and he found out, he told me that I can be saved only if I say that I know how to shoe horses.</span> <span id="s255">And that was so.</span> <span id="s256">I told them that I know how.</span> <span id="s257">And I started, and that’s how I was saved, and that’s how I got out from the jail.</span> <span id="s258">I was in concentration camp still, but I wasn’t jailed any more.</span> <span id="s259">In jail they came in every few days and took out 30, 40 of ‘em and shot ‘em.</span> <span id="s260">So I was lucky to be spared.</span> <span id="s261">And so, I established a shop in there, in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s262">I told them what I need for equipment, and they got it, and I had quite a few people helping me, including my father, my brother.</span> <span id="s263">They were there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Were they transported there at the same time you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A; Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And what were the sleeping conditions and the food conditions, and the health and medical conditions like, there at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: It’s barely to survive.</span> <span id="s268">I mean we still could survive and live, but so many people…if somebody didn’t work, they just shot ‘em.</span> <span id="s269">And that’s what we went through, all the time, either torn by dogs…</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Torn by dogs.</span> <span id="s272">There was the commander of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s273">He had a few dogs always with him, and all he had to say, to “Get somebody.’</span> <span id="s274">Then you saw this.</span> <span id="s275">And all the time, it was one hell there on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s276">Everyday you see people marching up, and they shot by the SS.</span> <span id="s277">That’s always the fear!</span> <span id="s278">The depression!</span> <span id="s279">That nobody knew, from the last minute, is approaching.</span> <span id="s280">So that was the worst.</span> <span id="s281">But living condition?</span> <span id="s282">Of course it was no picnic, and a person was hungry all the time, but you still could survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Was there any communicating among the prisoners?</span> <span id="s284">Did you get to know any people in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s286">There was the outside camp where some worked, and some worked separated from the living quarters.</span> <span id="s287">In the evening we went back.</span> <span id="s288">There was “appell” where everybody was counted, and then we went back in the barracks, and that was electrical wire, fenced around, and in there you could go and communicate, and then it comes 9 o’clock and the lights were out, and everybody had to go to his own place, and to sleep, because they counted again there.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Were there other people in the camp?</span> <span id="s290">Were the rest of them Jewish, were they gypsies, were they…?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No, they were all Jews.</span> <span id="s292">Early in 1944 they brought in some Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: In 1944.</span> <span id="s294">And you were there in that camp until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: I was there in that camp ‘til January, 1945, the beginning of the year, right after New Year.</span> <span id="s296">The Russians were approaching already, camp of Plaschau, so we were put on horses and buggies, what we had, and we went west to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s297">In Auschwitz we were only two weeks.</span> <span id="s298">That was because Auschwitz from Cracow -- from Plaschau -- that was only about 30 miles, at the most, and the Russians were approaching there, so we were taken from there, and transported to Czechoslovakia, to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: So you were in three camps, then, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I was in Auschwitz, then Buchenwald, and then in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s301">That was my last camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Do you remember the names of the major German personnel at any of the camps that you were at?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I wasn’t long enough in Auschwitz to know anything about it, because we were completely isolated there from the other prisoners, from the other inmates.</span> <span id="s304">In our camp, yes.</span> <span id="s305">There was Hauptsturm Goett.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: In which camp was that in?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: That’s Cracow Plaschau.</span> <span id="s308">And there was Shuppker Anthoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You already said you were aware of systematic killing and fatalities, but did you witness any systematic killings or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s311">(Laughter) Oh, gosh!</span> <span id="s312">Saw hundreds, hundreds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: In all these camps?</span> <span id="s314">Or in some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, in all the camps, except in Auschwitz, we did not.</span> <span id="s316">But in Buchenwald and in Cracow Plaschau.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Was it a daily occurrence?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes, it was a daily occurrence, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: So you were liberated then.</span> <span id="s320">Was that by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: No, I was liberated by the Americans.</span> <span id="s322">From Buchenwald we were transported to Flossenburg, which is south, in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Who transported you?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: The SS.</span> <span id="s325">Just marching.</span> <span id="s326">We were marched, and in the march hundreds of people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: How long did that take?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: That took about two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And then what happened when you got to Flossenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Flossenburg we were only about two weeks.</span> <span id="s331">The Americans were approaching Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s332">So we were transferred -- we were marched to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Marched by the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: By the SS, yeah, all the time, we were escorted by them.</span> <span id="s335">To Dachau.</span> <span id="s336">And on the way to Dachau, I escaped, in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: How many days were you gone from Flossenburg when you escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Four days.</span> <span id="s339">In the night -- the fourth night -- that was a night was raining, and we were marching in the woods, or through the woods.</span> <span id="s340">So I run into the woods and escaped.</span> <span id="s341">I wandered around that night until I came in that village, German village.</span> <span id="s342">It was a farm.</span> <span id="s343">So I crawled in where they keep their, what do you call it…”schoineg”…their corn, and…their food that they stock.</span> <span id="s344">What they harvest.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Oh their silage.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: The silage, right.</span> <span id="s347">In Germany they have it out of wood.</span> <span id="s348">So high.</span> <span id="s349">And I climbed on top and…</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Like a silo, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: A silo, right.</span> <span id="s352">That’s where I climbed.</span> <span id="s353">And I waited a few days there, and I lived on the…</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: On the silo?</span> <span id="s355">You waited on -- in -- the silo?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: I crawled in to the top.</span> <span id="s357">Very high so nobody can detect me.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: How did you breathe in there?</span> <span id="s359">Was there ventilation in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yeah, it was open.</span> <span id="s361">On top of it I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: How many days were you in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Four days.</span> <span id="s364">Then the Americans…</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: How was it possible to keep track of days…I guess you could see the sun come up, perhaps?</span> <span id="s366">How did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Just the corn, or grain, or whatever that was in the silo.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: So you were in there four days.</span> <span id="s369">And what happened then?</span> <span id="s370">The Americans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No.</span> <span id="s372">They brought in Russian prisoners in the same silo.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Who brought in Russian prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: The SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: The SS, yeah.</span> <span id="s377">They brought them.</span> <span id="s378">They had some Russians.</span> <span id="s379">I don’t know from where.</span> <span id="s380">They were working maybe someplace, and they brought the men there.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Did they see you when they brought them in?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s383">Because I was way up on top.</span> <span id="s384">And a few hours later everybody disappeared, so I knew that something incredible…</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Who’s everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A; The prisoners, the Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s387">And the people that…</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Were they Russian Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s390">They were Russian Russians.</span> <span id="s391">Prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: And then they disappeared, the Russian prisoners…</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s394">I didn’t hear anybody, so I climbed down, and there were the American tanks already, and the American soldiers, rolling by.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: What happened with the SS?</span> <span id="s396">Where did they go?</span> <span id="s397">Were they captured by the Americans, or you don’t know…?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No, I don’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s399">But later they captured a lot of ‘em.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: What happened when the Americans came?</span> <span id="s401">You came out of the silo and…what was that encounter like, with the American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well there were Jewish, American Jews.</span> <span id="s403">And we could talk to them, and they understood us, and they took us to the next town.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Which was what?</span> <span id="s405">Do you remember the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A; The town was Floss.</span> <span id="s407">It was a little village nearby.</span> <span id="s408">That’s where they put us up and the German families, they told them to give us food and shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q; When you say “us” who was with you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A; There was already that came out, a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s411">A lot of people that were marching to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: How big a group would you say…</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Oh, there were a few thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: So the Americans took you to Floss, and did they put each and every one of you up in a German home?</span> <span id="s415">Was Floss in Poland or Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: That’s in Germany, in the east.</span> <span id="s417">That’s in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s418">Because from Poland, the Russians occupied half of Germany…</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: They put you in individual homes?</span> <span id="s420">Is that what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah in homes where they told them to give us a room and food.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Let’s go back here a second, before we continue talking about what happened in these German homes at Floss, and bring me up to date as to what happened to you.</span> <span id="s423">You were in the camps with your brother and your father…</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: At that time I was alone.</span> <span id="s425">I didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s426">We were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What became of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: My father went to Grossrosen, a transport before I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Was Grossrosen a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: That was a camp near Breslau, in Germany.</span> <span id="s431">And (sigh) we went there, and we couldn’t find any sign of, and nobody knows about it, what happened.</span> <span id="s432">My brother…</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: You went there after you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: After liberation, yes.</span> <span id="s435">My brother, he was in Valdenburg, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Is that a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: That was a concentration camp, but a work camp, where they work in factories.</span> <span id="s438">And he survived, and I met him after a month.</span> <span id="s439">I was liberated in April -- the end of April -- and I met him in June.</span> <span id="s440">So I found my brother.</span> <span id="s441">And then I knew…</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: When you say you were liberated in April, was that when you met the Americans at the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s444">That was in April, 1945.</span> <span id="s445">And because I knew that my mother and sister, they were hidden in Poland, by the German.</span> <span id="s446">So I went…I took a motorcycle, which you could get at that time, because a lot of Germans were…so I got hold of a motor cycle and I went to Czechoslovakia, to Poland, to Cracow, in order to find out if my sister and mother survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: How long were you in Floss?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: The war ended May the 8th and I was in Floss until the beginning of June.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: And how long did you travel on the motorcycle looking for your mother and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: From Bavaria to Czechoslovakia is approximately 700 miles to Poland.</span> <span id="s451">So I went through Prague, and traveled east, and it was in the evening, I saw a Russian.</span> <span id="s452">He was from the army -- a guard.</span> <span id="s453">So I asked him if there’s a place where I could stay overnight, because it was getting dark and I didn’t want to travel any farther.</span> <span id="s454">So he took me someplace, and sure enough, they took away my motorcycle, and they threw me in a cellar, where they keep the potatoes in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s455">Without windows -- just in the ground --a hole -- with a door on top.</span> <span id="s456">They locked me in there.</span> <span id="s457">And then I was there for 48 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Why did they do that?</span> <span id="s459">Did they explain?</span> <span id="s460">Or did you ever find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: I said I was in the concentration camp, and I want to go back to Poland to find out about my mother.</span> <span id="s462">They didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s463">So they locked me up.</span> <span id="s464">So after two days they took me to the headquarters and there was a Jewish…</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Headquarters of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: For the Russians.</span> <span id="s467">Headquarters, someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Do you remember the town…or was it in the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: It was in the middle of someplace, near a town, I don’t remember exactly where it was.</span> <span id="s470">And they took me to the headquarters with the cocked guns, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Pointed at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A; Pointed, yeah.</span> <span id="s473">And they took me there, and luckily there was a Jewish officer, a Russian.</span> <span id="s474">I told him, I was in concentration camp in Plaschau, and I was in Buchenwald, and now I’d like to go back to find out about my mother and sister.</span> <span id="s475">So then he let me free.</span> <span id="s476">The motorcycle I couldn’t get from him.</span> <span id="s477">Like he didn’t want to give the motorcycle up.</span> <span id="s478">So I walked, and went by train, until I came to Cracow, and luckily my mother and sister survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: And you found them?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I found them, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: How did you find them?</span> <span id="s482">By luck, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Not by luck.</span> <span id="s484">I knew.</span> <span id="s485">I knew where they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Somebody had told you then.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s488">Even from the concentration camp, I had opportunity to visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: You wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s491">Even the SS, there were some people there that were sympathetic.</span> <span id="s492">If they could, they would do you some favor.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: The SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s495">Some!</span> <span id="s496">That was very rare!</span> <span id="s497">They took me there one day, and I visited with my mother and sister.</span> <span id="s498">I didn’t tell ‘em, of course, I didn’t tell ‘em who it is.</span> <span id="s499">I just told them I had some friends I would like to visit there.</span> <span id="s500">I couldn’t trust them so far that to tell them my mother and sister.</span> <span id="s501">I said I had some “Polish friends” and I’d like to visit, and they took me there and then I saw my mother and sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And where were they located?</span> <span id="s503">What town was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: They were in Popochin, which is about five miles from the concentration camp in Cracow-Plaschau.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: People in the camp had told you that they were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s507">I knew.</span> <span id="s508">Because they went there before I went to the airport, where I worked for the military.</span> <span id="s509">When I was at home yet, in Mierhauf, that’s where we took care of…my brother and I --my older brother -- he perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: He perished from…</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: My older brother.</span> <span id="s512">My younger brother survived.</span> <span id="s513">He’s living in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Do you know the circumstances of your older brother’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yeah, we were taken to the airport there -- to the military airport to work there.</span> <span id="s516">He was the tailor.</span> <span id="s517">He made all the suits and everything for all the people.</span> <span id="s518">The German people.</span> <span id="s519">And then two months later they locked him up, and they just finished them all.</span> <span id="s520">They locked him up in the local jail for a few days and then they just (sigh) they liquidated every one of them.</span> <span id="s521">There was no one left, because I came after the war to my hometown, and inquired about it, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And that’s how you learned?</span> <span id="s523">What had happened to your older brother?</span> <span id="s524">Now, your younger brother had survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: My younger brother survived, yes.</span> <span id="s526">We were in a concentration camp in Cracow-Plaschau, then they (sigh) took them out, a few.</span> <span id="s527">By the end of 1945 they took every few weeks.</span> <span id="s528">They had some transports out of the concentration camp, Plaschau, but they took him west, inside Germany.</span> <span id="s529">And he survived there, so I found him also.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And did you inquire about other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes, yes, but there was nobody survived.</span> <span id="s532">But one incident, what I will never forget in my life, is concentration camp at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s533">There were quite a few Poles.</span> <span id="s534">And at one time, they announced, “Alle Juden raus” -- “All Jews out.”</span> <span id="s535">They should get out from the barrack to the…there was a big, like a football field, a big field there, and they had “appells’ every day where they counted in the morning and in the evening.</span> <span id="s536">Everybody should go out.</span> <span id="s537">It was almost the end of the war, so everybody tried to hide and not admit that you are a Jew, because they didn’t know, looking at you, that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s538">So “Alle Juden rous!</span> <span id="s539">Alle Juden rous!”</span> <span id="s540">they announced on the thing.</span> <span id="s541">So the Polish inmates, they came and dragged almost every one of them out!</span> <span id="s542">They could “smell” a Jew!</span> <span id="s543">I was lucky enough that I didn’t get out at that time.</span> <span id="s544">So many people perished.</span> <span id="s545">Because the Germans wouldn’t know the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: How did they perish after they drug ‘em out?</span> <span id="s547">Do you know the detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s549">I had a cousin in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s550">I never met him, I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s551">And before, I had contact with him.</span> <span id="s552">But the Polish inmates, they helped drag out the Jewish!</span> <span id="s553">I’ll never forget that incident!</span> <span id="s554">So when I heard that the Russians occupied Poland, they should be there.</span> <span id="s555">God should do it so that they are there the next thousand years!</span> <span id="s556">‘Cause they were, in my estimation, they were a lot worse.</span> <span id="s557">If they had the power, nobody would survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: During the time you were in the camps, was it possible to get any information about the progress of the war?</span> <span id="s559">You said at one time that you knew that the war was coming to an end there?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: We knew, because a lot of people worked in factories where other inmates, people, let’s say Russians and French and Danish and Belgish -- from Belgium…</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: These were prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: They were prisoners also.</span> <span id="s563">Like in Buchenwald, Leon Blum, he was there -- the French Premier?</span> <span id="s564">The Jewish, from before the Second World War?</span> <span id="s565">Leon Blum?</span> <span id="s566">He was in Buchenwald, also.</span> <span id="s567">He died there.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: So these people would give you information, then, about the progress of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s570">You could always find out…like when I worked in repairing cars, they always had radios in it.</span> <span id="s571">I always could pick up either from Russia, or London, mostly.</span> <span id="s572">They had the broadcasts in German and in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: You mentioned that you recall the SS in the camps.</span> <span id="s574">Do you remember any other specific units of the German Army or the Nazi police in the camps, or outside of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Outside of the camps they had the Shutzpolitzei and they had the…</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What would that be translated to?</span> <span id="s577">What would that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: First of all, they had the Gestapo, and then they had the police, actually, the Shutzpolitzei, that means the occupation police.</span> <span id="s579">They were separate from the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s581">So when you found the surviving members of your family, then what did you all do?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Then we went to Sosnowiec, which is a town near the former German border, the southeast corner of Poland, and there were quite a few Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Survivors, yes.</span> <span id="s585">I came from Bavaria, from the American zone, and I decided to take everybody, and we traveled quite a few days, because the bridges were destroyed, through Czechoslovakia to Bavaria, until we came to Munich, and there was…</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: How did you travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: After the war?</span> <span id="s588">By trains and boxcars.</span> <span id="s589">But what would normally take one day, it took ten days, because the bridges were destroyed.</span> <span id="s590">We wanted to get out from Poland and get in American zone, because I came from there too, and I knew that it’s a lot better conditions there than it would be in Poland or under the Russian occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So you went to the American zone in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A; In Germany, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And how did you arrange to travel there?</span> <span id="s594">Were there a group of you that did it?</span> <span id="s595">Or was it arranged for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: No, nobody arranged, you had to take care by yourself everything.</span> <span id="s597">I mean, you didn’t even have to buy a ticket.</span> <span id="s598">There was a train, you just got on it.</span> <span id="s599">Nobody checked on it, and they just had some trains going.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s601">And you were in a boxcar yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah, we were in a boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q; And for how many days?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A; Oh, about ten days it took to get to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: What were conditions like in the boxcar?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: It wasn’t like before, because it was more roomy, because it’s only to get there, because that’s all they had at that time.</span> <span id="s607">That’s all you can find to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Who was running the trains at that particular time, do you know, was it the…</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: In Czechoslovakia there were the Czechs were running, and in Poland they had the Polish people running the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s611">Where did you wind up in Germany, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: In Germany I wind up in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s613">That was a camp established for the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Displaced persons?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Displaced persons, yes.</span> <span id="s616">There we were provided, by the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s617">They provided the food and the barracks.</span> <span id="s618">There were buildings actually.</span> <span id="s619">There were no barracks any more.</span> <span id="s620">It was the former German barracks for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s621">They made a camp there for the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And that’s where you stayed?</span> <span id="s623">How long?</span> <span id="s624">What dates, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: It would be July, 1945, until the beginning of 1946.</span> <span id="s626">Then I moved to northern Bavaria, in a small town where I had some friends, a cousin living there.</span> <span id="s627">That was Munzburg, near Bayreuth.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Was that still in the American zone?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: That was American zone yet.</span> <span id="s630">But I didn’t want to live any more in camps, and so I went to a city, and rented an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Did you have some work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yes, I did some work.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: What happened with your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I had at that time, I had everybody now.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: They were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: In Bergen-Belsen, I found a sister, yet, so we were…</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: You went to Bergen-Belsen and you found a sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Yes, I got news that my sister survived Bergen-Belsen and we went there and picked her up.</span> <span id="s639">Then we were my mother and two sisters, and my brother.</span> <span id="s640">So we, thanks God, we were a sizeable family, which didn’t happen very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s642">So you all, all of you then, went to this small town in Bavaria?</span> <span id="s643">And you found work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A; At that time, yes.</span> <span id="s645">I had friend, a German Jew.</span> <span id="s646">His name was Kobeit.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: How did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: He was in concentration camp, also.</span> <span id="s649">But they survived and they were living there, in Munzburg, and he approached me, because he knew I’m from the metallic profession, if I would go with hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q; Metallic profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I mean metal.</span> <span id="s652">I knew about metals a lot because I was machinist still.</span> <span id="s653">He wants to buy in steel, or in some tooled machinery, and so on, because he lived in Germany, he had some friends there from before the war, that he had some connections if I would go with him.</span> <span id="s654">And so I said, yes, and that’s when we established a company.</span> <span id="s655">Then we bought steel and sold it.</span> <span id="s656">From the steel mills.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You were kind of a broker?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No, just a business.</span> <span id="s659">Like here, they had a hardware store, but this was on a little bigger scale, that you buy direct from the mill, and sell it to the hardware stores or to builders.</span> <span id="s660">So that’s why I decoded to leave the camp, because I had some responsibilities.</span> <span id="s661">I had two sisters and a mother to provide for and I had a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q; Were any of them working?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: How old was your younger brother at this time then -- approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: He was at that time about nineteen years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Were you undecided at this time what you wanted to do?</span> <span id="s667">Where you wanted to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Of course, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So how long were you there and in business with this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Until 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: How did that go?</span> <span id="s672">How did you like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Pretty good, yes.</span> <span id="s674">It provided.</span> <span id="s675">I married off my two sisters and made nice weddings for them.</span> <span id="s676">And my mother, we had a nice apartment, and bought nice things, and clothes, and so on.</span> <span id="s677">I didn’t want to rely on anybody giving me any welfare, so I tried to provide for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did you have any thoughts then about possibly going to Palestine or the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yes, either to Palestine -- or to Israel, at that time it was Palestine, but they changed the name later -- or to the United States.</span> <span id="s680">I was undecided.</span> <span id="s681">And later I decided to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: When did you decide, and who did you have to see?</span> <span id="s683">What did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A; Well, there was the United Nations Relief Organization or agency, and you registered there.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: When did you register there, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A; 1948.</span> <span id="s687">You had to take some tests, if you were healthy, and we all took the test and we came here to the United States, my mother, my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: And so you decided on the United States.</span> <span id="s689">Did you have any people here?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A; No.</span> <span id="s691">I didn’t have anybody, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Did you come right to… A; To Saint Paul.</span> <span id="s693">And that’s where I stayed.</span> <span id="s694">(Laughter) Q; There wasn’t any Jewish agencies involved that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: There weren’t.</span> <span id="s697">How long did it take you to get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: We came by ship.</span> <span id="s699">Because we had to go through different camps, it took about six weeks until we landed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q; You maintain contact with the Jewish community here in Saint Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s702">I belong to B’nai Brith.</span> <span id="s703">And I am very active in Toastmasters.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Do you maintain any contact with any other survivors?</span> <span id="s705">Or any survivor organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes, sure, constantly, with people that were also in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s707">But you can’t just be among them, you just looking to broaden your friends to have different people with you, because you don’t want to talk or be reminded all the time of it.</span> <span id="s708">I have plenty of nightmares without that.</span> <span id="s709">It’s many times that I, in the middle of the night, scream and…(pause).</span> <span id="s710">Yeah, you can’t just wipe it up, wipe it away.</span> <span id="s711">You can’t forget it.</span> <span id="s712">Although you have to try and live a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Maybe you can sum up what you think it means to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: (Sigh).</span> <span id="s715">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s716">I can’t believe it myself, that I survived it.</span> <span id="s717">And, luckily, that I had the right profession, the right thing, that they needed me.</span> <span id="s718">I can’t attribute that I became more capable than anybody else.</span> <span id="s719">I was lucky, lucky to survive.</span> <span id="s720">There were a lot of people more capable than I am, and they did not.</span> <span id="s721">It was just by chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Do you believe that any of the films or books that you may have seen or read about the Holocaust accurately tell the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A; Nothing can describe it accurately.</span> <span id="s724">That’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s725">I lived through it, and I can’t believe it myself, that things like this can happen.</span> <span id="s726">It’s…it’s…beyond comprehension.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: What would be your feeling then about human nature, and non-Jews, and Germans, or Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: The Polish people, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s729">I don’t hate anybody.</span> <span id="s730">I might not love everybody, but I hate no one, even…but I don’t know…on the bottom, the list of people that I hated, would be the Polish people.</span> <span id="s731">When they took everybody away from our city, it was in August, 1942.</span> <span id="s732">They came then, the people, the Germans that were the occupation force, and they needed people, because the Polish people there are not in the professions.</span> <span id="s733">If there was a tailor, or shoemaker, or any other profession, or to repair watches, there were seldom that you found Polish people that could do it.</span> <span id="s734">Mostly Jewish people.</span> <span id="s735">So they needed somebody.</span> <span id="s736">So they took out, maybe fifty people, they took out from the train, in order to have ‘em yet, to work for them, to carry out the work what they need, the Germans, in the occupation of Poland.</span> <span id="s737">And the Polish people, they didn’t give them any weapons, they had shovels -- that was the Arbeitsteins, they called them, that was the work force -- and they were guarding.</span> <span id="s738">The Poles with the shovels killed more Jews than the Germans with the guns!</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Because they hated the Jews!</span> <span id="s741">They were just brutal!</span> <span id="s742">They were just brutal with hatred!</span> <span id="s743">They couldn’t stand a Jew.</span> <span id="s744">And I blame mostly the priests and the Catholic Church.</span> <span id="s745">They instilled in ‘em that hate every Sunday and every day they went to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Was there a Catholic Church located near where you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s748">A few of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Did you ever have any incidents with the Catholic youth you knew?</span> <span id="s750">Did they ever beat up the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Oh, yes, yes, so often --before the war.</span> <span id="s752">And in the war they had a field day, that they could do anything they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: On a somewhat different note, did you meet your wife in this country or in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: In Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: In Europe.</span> <span id="s756">In Germany, or in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: After the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: When you were working in the metal business.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s763">Was there anything else you’d like to add that I may have missed in this format of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: What I couldn’t understand…(Laughter).</span> <span id="s765">I didn’t think highly about the Americans -- what their process was at that time.</span> <span id="s766">They were so infested with anti-Jewish, a lot of them, that it’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: This is the occupation force.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: The occupation force.</span> <span id="s769">And the people that processed us.</span> <span id="s770">I mean that there would be from the State Department.</span> <span id="s771">That was scary at that time.</span> <span id="s772">I thought, “We are running from…,” but thanks God, it’s a lot better.</span> <span id="s773">It got better with time.</span> <span id="s774">Through the years, it’s improved greatly.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: So there was some anti-Semitism exhibited by the American occupation forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s777">And especially the people from the State Department, that processed us.</span> <span id="s778">It’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Do you recall any incidents?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: There was constant reminders the way they treated us, the way they talked to us.</span> <span id="s781">They didn’t hide it, at that time.</span> <span id="s782">It really was scary!</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: How much did you have to deal with these people in the occupation, in the State Department?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: We stayed at quite a few camps where we went through.</span> <span id="s785">Each camp we stayed a few days, and they processed again, and they took pictures, and they took x-rays, and they asked questions, hundreds of questions, and really, it really showed.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: How come they kept sending you to different camps?</span> <span id="s787">Did you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Until they had the transportation ready.</span> <span id="s789">Then we were in Schweinfurteng and Vichtburg, and then in Bremen, in the port city, where we waited for our ship to come.</span> <span id="s790">We went by military ship at that time.</span> <span id="s791">General Hahn was the name of the ship.</span> <span id="s792">Was an old broken down thing.</span> <span id="s793">I was quite disappointed at the way a lot of them behaved.</span> <span id="s794">I can’t say every one of them, but there were a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: This completes the interview with Peter Gersh by
