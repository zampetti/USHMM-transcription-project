–</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Baer.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Baer, for coming to speak with us today.</span> <span id="s17">And as I said in our introduction that was not on tape, what we’d like to do is start at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s18">Where were you born; did you have siblings; what was your family circumstances – what were your family circumstances; who were your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: So maybe we could start there.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My – my name is Joachim Baer.</span> <span id="s22">I was born in Hamburg in December 20, 1929.</span> <span id="s23">I have a sister who is about four years older than I am.</span> <span id="s24">My father was a physician, he was a Zionist, and he didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s25">And he had good pair – relation with patient.</span> <span id="s26">Interesting enough, my – the patient always talked to the – to the – the doctors, and they told my father that Hitler is building tanks and preparing for war.</span> <span id="s27">And he make a statement and everyone thought that he is crazy, that he say that Hitler is going to gas the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Who, this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, my father make that sta –</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Your father – your father made the statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: – ke – statement that that’s what he’s going to do.</span> <span id="s32">And most people thought my father is crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: And that was the atmosphere that time.</span> <span id="s35">And interesting enough, my w – my wi – my mother was afraid to go to Palestine, that was like a desert land.</span> <span id="s36">And in 1933 they took a ship and went to Palestine to see if you can live there.</span> <span id="s37">And then he saw that’s not so terrible, and that’s when he start making preparation.</span> <span id="s38">But the t-turning point was that one day, I believe in 1935, Hitler decided Jewish phi-physician cannot have any more non-Jewish patient.</span> <span id="s39">And my father was a doctor like [indecipherable] where he lost a lot of his business.</span> <span id="s40">So that was a turning point, and he say, it’s time to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Can I i-interrupt just for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Because I’d like to even step back a little further.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: You were born in 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: And with a sister who was four years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: About, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s50">And your father was a physician.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Did your mother work outside the home, or was she at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No, no, she was a homemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Do you count yourself as a well-to-do family because your father was a physician, or was that not as such a prestigious post as it is in the United States, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, doctors in Germany, they didn’t wa – didn’t make that kind of money like they do in the United States.</span> <span id="s56">But we had a very nice apartment, and he had a office near the harbor, because his specialty was venereal disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Ah, venereal diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: And – yeah, and so he had to have all those sailor, which had syphilis.</span> <span id="s59">In those days there was no penicillin to cure them.</span> <span id="s60">So they suffer and it was a booming business, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: I can imagine, because there was that section in Hamburg, isn’t there, where there’s – what is it called now?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yeah, there – yeah, the – the Reeperbahn.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Reeperbahn, yeah, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yes, yes, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s65">So – so we were well-to-do, but I mean, the – it – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Did you have servants at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes, we had a dienstmädchen, you know, for the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: A nanny.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: A nanny, and we had, I think, another help, we had about s-seven, eight rooms, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s70">It was a – it was well-to-do, nice neighborhood.</span> <span id="s71">But we didn’t go – the thing is, he was – I don’t know what time, when he got to Hamburg to settle down, but it was not too many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Oh, so he wasn’t from Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s74">He was born in Posen, which is in east Germany, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: And then after World War I, Posen turned to be Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: So the family went and settled down in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: And the reason we got to Hamburg, because my father needed to have a harbor where the sailor comes.</span> <span id="s81">My father was high intellect person, and he knew all the language, Norwegian [indecipherable] so he could talk to all the sailors.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Sailors.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: I wonder what he – if there was no penicillin, what kind of treatment he did give them.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Was a very unpleasant treatment.</span> <span id="s86">It wa – was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: – was a – was a tough, yeah, it was a tough one, right.</span> <span id="s89">So, the thing is, one – how we got to – my mother wanted to go first maybe to Europe.</span> <span id="s90">And she and my father say no, if we go, we get out of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Oh, wo-would your – I’m still back in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Oh, oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Yeah, I really want to start at the beginning, before the politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So, was your mother from Posen as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: No, she was from Marineburg(ph) with Auspoyzen(ph), you know, was the same.</span> <span id="s97">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: So, Auspoyzen(ph) near Königsburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, she was Marineburg(ph), was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Marineburg(ph) is –</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: – was a small town.</span> <span id="s102">No, not sm –</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Would that be Marienbad today?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: So it’s in Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, I think?</span> <span id="s106">A Marienbad –</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No, no, there’s a different Marienbad, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: – I think she – it’s part of – part of Poland, you know, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s111">She was from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s113">And my father came from a Zionist background family.</span> <span id="s114">My mother not.</span> <span id="s115">My father was – came from a religious, not – not super Orthodox, but conservative Orthodox family.</span> <span id="s116">And my mother had very little Yiddishkeit, so to speak.</span> <span id="s117">So he was a – he was a philosopher too.</span> <span id="s118">I mean, he knew Shea, he knew Spinoza and he knew th-the Bible, and he was a high intellected person.</span> <span id="s119">He gave speeches, he was the president of a synagogue and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s120">So he was a –</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What are your first memories of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, they were very nice parents, I mean, they were very lovely to me and as – my sister.</span> <span id="s123">And he was high intellect, so he used to take me for a walk and show me the – the – the st – the stars, and this is the big [indecipherable] there’s the smaller [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s124">And he gave lectures, and you know, so it was – and I had problem with my Bible, he always explained to me.</span> <span id="s125">So he was high intelligence.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: And do you have memories of Hamburg itself, of the apartment that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yeah, well, interesting, I remember – see – see, the harbor was a main port.</span> <span id="s128">And one day my father had a patient, a captain on the ship.</span> <span id="s129">So he mem – he took me, I think with my mother, for dinner, whatever it is, on this – on th-the captain table.</span> <span id="s130">An orange was a big sensation those days, an orange.</span> <span id="s131">So – so as I wi – wouldn’t be caught in a – in a custom, I put the orange in my little ba – in my little coat.</span> <span id="s132">So this way we went though the custom.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: So, in other words, in order to be guests of the captain on the ship, you ha – you were leaving the territory of Germany, and had to go through customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Well, any time when you go in and out the harbor, you have to go through a checkpoint, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: You have to do this all over the world, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: How old we – how old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Oh, so it’s the sort of thing a five year old would remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s141">The thing is, I – only the [indecipherable] thing I remember, there was a Greek boy in our building and I used to play with him.</span> <span id="s142">And one day he didn’t want to play with him.</span> <span id="s143">So I came to my mother, oh, crying, he doesn’t want to play with him.</span> <span id="s144">But the reason he wouldn’t play me, because he knew I am Jewish, and Jewish was taboo.</span> <span id="s145">But my sister, who was 10 years old, she knew what was going on, and she really was so relieved getting out of Germany, because she knew what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: That – those few years made a huge difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s148">Also, my – my sister was very – she got my intelligent of my father.</span> <span id="s149">She knew what exactly.</span> <span id="s150">Also, she went to a Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: The Mädchen school.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And you were – were you already going to school when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, this – I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Unfortunate, because I would have gotten some money from Germany, as i-interrupting of – of my studying.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Of education, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s159">And I didn’t get it.</span> <span id="s160">So I really was – I didn't suffer from the Holocaust, we – only this instant from the boy.</span> <span id="s161">But my sister, she knew what was going.</span> <span id="s162">Hamburg was a liberal city.</span> <span id="s163">I know I have a friend of mind who was from Königsburg, and that sh – the parents sent him to Hamburg, because Hamburg was more liberal.</span> <span id="s164">And he went to Talmud Tora Schule, which was the school for the boys.</span> <span id="s165">And my sister went to the Mädchen Schule.</span> <span id="s166">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Mm-hm, the school for the girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: – yeah [indecipherable] we were invited by the German – city hall you can call it, a-and my sister came from Israel and I came from here, and we visited Mädchen Schule and there were paperwork for my sister, me s – playing on the shoka(ph) there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Oh – oh, you mean a photograph of you playing on –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: No, they ha – ha – a memory book with painting and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: It was very interesting, yeah.</span> <span id="s173">So that’s – it g – it – it brought it back to me.</span> <span id="s174">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: So Hamburg itself, so you remember in your mind’s eye the harbor.</span> <span id="s176">You remember your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: We-Well, no, the harb – and the fi – funny thing is, there was a Jewish, famous Jewish ware – not – what do you call it?</span> <span id="s178">It’s a big store.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Bertheimer(ph)?</span> <span id="s180">Bertheim(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, I mean like – like a Macy’s here, you know, and it was called Tietz.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: And I-I – they had act – also a store in – in Berlin, which I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s184">So when I came to Germany, I don’t know, you know, after war, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: And I ask people, young people, where’s Tietz?</span> <span id="s187">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s188">Then I asked an older people that she knew, and she knew that there was a – that’s a Jewish store, and they change it to Alster, or whatever you want to change it.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Well, I remember in Berlin, there is a store that the hu – the biggest store, department store in Berlin –</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Ye-Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: – was KaDeWe.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, that was Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span

id="s209">A: Well, naturally they were Gentiles, you know, and I don’t know, we had full time – I – I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s210">But the only thing which I remember is this Greek boy, he didn’t want to play with me.</span> <span id="s211">And I didn’t understand what the others were talking about.</span> <span id="s212">But I – I remember my – my mother tried to sell some of her furniture, because they had what they call a lift.</span> <span id="s213">A lift was like a container –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: – to take to Palestine.</span> <span id="s216">So, I remember selling the merchandise, and put it in a container.</span> <span id="s217">The interesting was, my father had to leave before January 1936 to Palestine, because it was a law, th-the British [indecipherable] any doctor who came before the first can practice their medicine without going for a test.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Without

is we went to Yugoslavia – forgot the name.</span> <span id="s236">And that time there was war of Italian and Abyssinia.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: And there was not enough coal for the ship, so the ship had to make a stop in Yugoslavia to get coal.</span> <span id="s239">So we got off the ship, and for the first time I saw Muslim, with – you

way of life.</span> <span id="s373">And my father had a hard time to make a living, because – well, he knew Hebrew before, so there was no problem.</span> <span id="s374">He knows Arabic later on.</span> <span id="s375">But there were so many doctors.</span> <span id="s376">There were more doctors than patients.</span> <span id="s377">Herr doctor begets a doctor begets a doctor.</span> <span id="s378">So it’s – so we really had a hard time to make a – the first year or two he eats – he ate up what he’s – from the saving he brought from Germany, and then was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: And we really had a hard time to ma – he claimed that he cannot – many doctors switched to another occupation, was a bus driver,

jewelry, whatever she has, to make – to buy bread.</span> <span id="s404">I mean, it’s was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Is this before the war, or even during –</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Well, wa – in 1939, well, then you had the – remember the war where Italian came and bombarded Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: So this

grocery to save few pennies, and it – it was very – it was hell, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And how many years did this last?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Well, the biggest things came in 1953 - ’54, Adenauer make arrangement reparation, and then the German money came in.</span> <span id="s423">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: So, it was a good 18 years –</span></p>

like to start before –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: – when you’re still a boy at – at 1939, and the – the World War II starts.</span> <span id="s439">What kind –</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Well, the thing is – well, the thing is, between ’36 and ’39 was a [indecipherable] they call it.</span> <span id="s441">It was Arabs start attacking Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: And was very unpreda – I remember someone came, and it was fully of blood, it was stoned by the Arabs, and you know, it’s – we live inside a Jewish area.</span> <span id="s444">I mean, there was no Arabs living there, so we were, so to speak, safe, to speak.</span> <span id="s445">But there was tension of all those attacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Attacks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: So bese – between economy and attacks, it was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s448">And in ’39 came the World War II, with the bombs.</span> <span id="s449">And then – then I was 16 or something, sevent – they ca – they start approaching me to be a member of the Haganah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Excuse me for a second.</span> <span id="s451">[tape break] Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Well, in 1944, I began [sneeze]</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Bless you.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: I began the technical high school.</span> <span id="s455">In fact, it was expensive, so a friend of my father, who was qu-quite well-to-do, he pay for my tuition.</span> <span id="s456">And – and my sister til this day don’t forgive me, because when she was 14 she had to go working.</span> <span id="s457">See, they had primary school eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: And then, oh, you went to high school, or you went to – to go working.</span> <span id="s460">And she – went – had to go to work to earn some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Well, she was working for the seamstress, and then she was working as a secretary, and you know, she –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Did she ever finish higher education?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s467">She went – she worked for a hospital as a medical secretary.</span> <span id="s468">In order to do that, she went to school to medical secretary.</span> <span id="s469">And – but si – til this day she doesn’t forgive me, cause she was a intellect, she could have been a doctor just like that, she was very intellect – she is intellect, and I am not so intellect, so I got the [indecipherable] because I am the boy, and the girl didn’t have to have, in the education, you know, that’s the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: I know, that’s the old fashioned way.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: What did I want to ask?</span> <span id="s473">Did World War II, in some ways aside from the bombing, did it ever kind of come up in conversation as to what’s going on in Germany, what’s going on in –</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s475">In 19 – 1943, I was 13 years old, and my father author big speeches for my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s476">And in the Bar Mitzvah – I still have that – that thing, he mentioned that the Holocaust in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Well, very few people knew, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, they knew, in 1943.</span> <span id="s479">And he talks about and – you know, and there’s a – and he – I really have to go find his li – li – speech, it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s480">And the thing is, in World War II, naturally, we had American and Australian, and we had a lot of military people base in Haifa, in the area, in the camps, in the airport base.</span> <span id="s481">But there was no more friction between Jews and Arabs in World War II, that was stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: That stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And why?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Because the – the war, when they knew they cannot achieve anything, you know.</span> <span id="s486">But then it was the white paper, so to speak, in 1939.</span> <span id="s487">And I remember marching in the street against the white – white paper and all the others, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s489">What was the white paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: White paper say to l-limit immigration to Jews to 1,500 people a month, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: And so that’s when the illegal Aliyah came.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: The people – I remember boats came and – and the patrian(ph) and they sank the boats, and so people got the – well, some hundred people got killed in that thing, what th – it was a lot of friction.</span> <span id="s495">So, you lived a daily friction over there, always something.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Tense.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Tense, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Sounds tense.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Tense, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s502">And I remember walking on the street one day, probably 14 years old, and suddenly a British – some kind of mini truck or whatever it is, stop and he got off and say, where’s your papers, to me.</span> <span id="s503">I gave him the paper, and I had my paper.</span> <span id="s504">But it was not pleasant, you know?</span> <span id="s505">And the reason they did it, because a lot of il-illegal immigrant came and if they didn’t have their paper, they would send them to Cypress or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s506">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And did these illegal immigrants also talk about what’s going on in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Or did news come from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Oh yes, I mean, let’s face, I mean you know the story.</span> <span id="s511">There was a – a – a Polish priest, who he managed to get to London.</span> <span id="s512">I know this [indecipherable] and he told Eden –</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: – about.</span> <span id="s515">And Eden say yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s516">The thing is, Eden knew about it, because they had the teleprinter, and they were listening to the German conversation.</span> <span id="s517">So they knew what’s going on, but they cou – he couldn’t tell him that I know what’s going on, but they didn’t do anything anyway, you know?</span> <span id="s518">So it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: But you didn’t know that at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: No, no, no, the – but they all knew in – in Israel, that’s – that the Holocaust going on, they knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: That’s why Hannah Szenes was sent to Yugoslavia and – and they were talking about it.</span> <span id="s523">That’s time they started very – getting the Palmach.</span> <span id="s524">And when I was a kid –</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: The Palmach was an underground organization, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: Well, but it was sponsored by the Jewish agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: And I was – was more in the kibbutzim when they got mili training, and then came Wingate, the – the British officer, who was very poor Jewish, and he trained them the night fight against the Arab and all that.</span> <span id="s529">But they approached me to join Hagana and I was not the type of fighting, so I di – I had a hard time to [indecipherable] but when we were in high school, we had m – po – military – you could call it military, mini-military training, you know, with a stick.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And you si – when – did you learn Hebrew fairly quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I had a hard time.</span> <span id="s532">I had a hard time, but in about a year I learned Hebrew, because first they send me to kindergarten to learn, and then I had – I had a very good teacher in my first grade.</span> <span id="s533">So I didn’t miss any – any – because I went to first grade, and it was close to seven, but still good enough to be in th – in the six [indecipherable] so I really didn’t lose –</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: – any – yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s537">But at home it was alisov(ph) deutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Alice(ph) deutsche, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Alice(ph) deutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: That’s what I speak in Germany,

married in Israel, and my wife pick up the German from my mother.</span> <span id="s543">She knows a little bit Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Was she an Israeli, your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No, she’s an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: She was an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, that’s a little more story.</span> <span id="s548">I was in the Israel Navy, and they sent me to Washington in 1952, because there was an opening for a technical [indecipherable] school in – in Washington southwest naval gun factory.</span> <span id="s549">And the reason they picked me out, because I was the only one who [indecipherable] technical high school, I knew English.</span> <span id="s550">And I had a hard time here [indecipherable] because the people in the [indecipherable] optical experience, and I had no experience, so I really had a hell of a time here.</span> <span id="s551">But I – I got my C and I survive.</span> <span id="s552">But I really had a hard time here.</span> <span id="s553">And there were anti-Semitism there.</span> <span id="s554">The-They didn’t like Jews [indecipherable] I had a hell of a time, really.</span> <span id="s555">But anyway, so that’s where I met my wife, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And then she finished college and then she came to Israel and we got married there, and she learned from [indecipherable] German.</span> <span id="s558">So she can speak German, and she also had to pick up Hebrew.</span> <span id="s559">So she learned Hebrew and German.</span> <span id="s560">She is very intelligent, my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And – and now, between you, what is it, English?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: We speak English, yes.</span> <span id="s563">But when the children grew up and we didn’t want – want [indecipherable] we spoke Hebrew, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: That came – that was a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: But when we visit Israel to my parents, and it was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So when did you leave Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: In 1956.</span> <span id="s572">The thing is, my – my wife was a single daughter – I mean the only kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: The only daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Only daught – only kids.</span> <span id="s575">And they used drive us crazy, the parents, come back, come back, come back.</span> <span id="s576">And I wanted to study, so I went to G.W. here in Washington, and I study.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: What did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: E-Electr – electrical engineering, but then my kids came along.</span> <span id="s579">So I figure out another two years, it’s – it’s too much, you know, to live, and they have to support me, I say that’s – that’s so – so I stop my – my – my study, and so – but we di – she was a teacher, so she could make good money, and I make some money, so we did okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: When did you go back to Germany?</span> <span id="s581">You mentioned that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Well, we were – well, in 19 – when – when my mother passed away, I went there before she passed away, about a week before she passed away, and she was told she got a health [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Okay, so health – some – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Some compensation with health.</span> <span id="s585">She has a – so – so I went to Hamburg to talk to the lawyer.</span> <span id="s586">So that’s when I first came to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: And that was in 19 –</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s589">Well, let’s see, my – my daughter was supposed to have Bar Mitz – Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s590">No, she was supposed to be 80, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s591">I don’t know, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s592">So anyway, so that’s my first time I was by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Well, would it be like the 70s, the 80s?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yeah, something like that.</span> <span id="s595">But then we were invited by the municipality to visit, and they pay for everything.</span> <span id="s596">And so – and my – my sister turned 70 in that year, so I told the German I want to celebrate my sister’s 70 in Germany where she was born.</span> <span id="s597">So they say okay, so we both came to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: So that would have been mid-90s.</span> <span id="s599">1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: My sister is now – my sister is now 80 – 75, and that was 10 years ago.</span> <span id="s601">So, 10 years ago –</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: No, now she would be 85.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Yeah, pushing 80 – no, no, no, no, she is going to be 85 in this year, in this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s605">So it was seven – her seven –</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Her 70th was 15 years ago, yeah s –</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Years ago.</span> <span id="s608">So 1995, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And how did you feel when you were in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Well, I was – see, I [indecipherable] remember anything.</span> <span id="s612">So, my sister remember, and she show me all the places.</span> <span id="s613">And there is also a book who – it was written on the Holocaust survivor that her name is – and has a picture of [indecipherable] of my sister, and I’m a little boy there, in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s614">And she wrote three books about the Holocaust, she was the f – so sh – no, what was this – she – she wrote the three book, she lecture in Holocaust all the time.</span> <span id="s615">Name?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: It will come to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah, right, anyway, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: It will come to you.</span> <span id="s619">But – so your sister remembered things, but did you have any feeling at all, positive or negative?</span> <span id="s620">Did you feel at home when you heard German, or was it still in some ways fremd, strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Well, some people went to Israel, they didn’t want to hear German, they were very –</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: – mad about German, they didn’t want recuperation and all that.</span> <span id="s624">See, my father liked the German culture.</span> <span id="s625">He knew Spinoza, he knew Schiller, he knew all that culture of German.</span> <span id="s626">So he say well, this is Nazi, but it’s German culture, so you cannot mix them up, you know.</span> <span id="s627">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: He sounds like a very wise man.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Oh yes, he was, he was, he was.</span> <span id="s630">And my mother didn’t need any other language because every one her friends spoke Germany, the grocery spoke Germany, and also when she went to the bus, they knew all German, or Yiddish, you know, so she – there was no – but she tried to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s631">She went to school to Hebrew, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: It wasn’t as successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: No, i-it was okay, but – but she didn’t had no need for it, you know.</span> <span id="s634">And when they came to the – the patient came in [indecipherable] sit down and Herr doctor is gonna – it was okay, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: And – but when you went back, being in this German speaking environment, did it – did it affect you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Well, on – I remember that on the bus there was a young teenager, the daughter of one [indecipherable] and the explanation was in German, and she told them, in our house they forbid to speak German and you – oh, here everything is in German, everything in German.</span> <span id="s637">So then, the next day, they brought the German student who spoke English and German, and he did the explanation in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s640">So it was a resentment.</span> <span id="s641">The – one of the people that, at the end of the thing, there was a party with the mayor.</span> <span id="s642">And the – our spokesman say – he said that his father, like my father, had the hakenkreuz.</span> <span id="s643">And two of my brothers –</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: A hakenkreuz is an iron cross, right –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: – from World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s648">In fact, two of my brother, they gave their life in World War I. And he [indecipherable] and say, we fought, Germans, our country and all that, and look what you guys did to us, you know, and he gave it to them.</span> <span id="s649">And naturally the – this was younger generation, you know.</span> <span id="s650">My father made one statement which is interesting.</span> <span id="s651">They say, why don’t you go back to Germany?</span> <span id="s652">He say, how can I go back as a – as a physician, and th – my patient can be one of the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: The – the – fe – one of the criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s655">How can I treat as a doctor?</span> <span id="s656">I cannot do it, you know.</span> <span id="s657">But he was a Zionist anyway, had even – he didn’t think about it, but some doctors from Haifa went back to Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s660">And they practi – what I think I couldn’t understand is, when we were to the [indecipherable] of the Black Forest, that’s where I met my parents, and there was people from Israel, who went to ho – went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s662">[tape break] Sorry.</span> <span id="s663">Uh-huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: There was people who went from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s665">The German government paid for their holung, for their treatment.</span> <span id="s666">But I couldn’t understand, how can you go through hell, and come to Germany, and get treatment here?</span> <span id="s667">I couldn’t not under – understand it.</span> <span id="s668">And then also we met one Gentile from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s669">And he said, oh, this building is caput, this one is caput.</span> <span id="s670">And I was thinking myself, good, that he went caput, but he, oh, caput, caput, caput, caput.</span> <span id="s671">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: It’s a – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: It’s a – now today you have only new generation, you know, so – but interesting, the guy in the – in the bus, which I mention, his – his grandfather was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s674">And he was very, very interesting about the Holocaust and what they did.</span> <span id="s675">And he really – that’s why he had this job to translate, because he really wanted to have [indecipherable] Holocaust survivor, because he was inside, very, very disturb about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: So, that was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: This is in ’95, when you were there with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s681">Well, is there anything you would like to add to this, that you think is important for people to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Well, even I didn’t go for the Holocaust, and even I didn't really knew too much about it, cause I didn’t – it still in the back on – of you.</span> <span id="s683">You know, you went through all that hell, so to speak.</span> <span id="s684">Even was not hell, but it’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Well, your life was affected by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yes, it’s – someone asked me, what is the most in – who was – who – who – who affected your life the most?</span> <span id="s687">And my answer is Hitler.</span> <span id="s688">Hitler got me – in fact, when I came back to Germany, to Hamburg, and I wanted a money from them for the interruption of my education, I told them if I would live today in Germany, I would have been probably a doctor like my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: And you say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s691">But I told him that.</span> <span id="s692">And interesting, I says, the Nazi, they didn’t like to hear the word Nazi.</span> <span id="s693">They said sociale – they – the Nazi didn’t – Nazi –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Nats – Nationale Socialiste [indecipherable], yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Yes, they didn’t – didn’t want me to say the word Nazi.</span> <span id="s696">So that hits me.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: So, anyway, I mean, you never forget about this period.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Well, I think that what you bring up is something extraordinarily important.</span> <span id="s700">Your father is the one that seems to have saved your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: You know, with a great deal of foresight.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: And yet, nevertheless, even though you were spared all of that catastrophe that others –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: – you had so many years in Israel where you struggled.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: It was Palestine then [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: – and that’s – in Palestine, in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Now, during those 18 years, was your father a doctor the whole time, in good and bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: In – in – in World War I, he was not a full doctor, he wa – he worked with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s712">But he was more assistant, as he was too young.</span> <span id="s713">He was born in 1890.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: But what I’m talking about is from a – 1936 to 1954, when you had such a hard time, he never did any other profession, just doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No, no, yeah.</span> <span id="s716">My – my mother – my mother had to – she was a good cook, so she had like a restaurant inside our little two room.</span> <span id="s717">The people came for lunch, and she fa – cooked for them for lunch, and – and we really struggle, you know, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s719">Well, that’s also a legacy.</span> <span id="s720">That’s also a legacy, it wouldn’t have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: So – well, thank you for – thank you for sharing –</span></p> <p><span
