id="s2">MS: Mr. Glass, could you tell me something about your life in Germany before the Nazi era, including your birth date and place, residence, name, of course, education, religious affiliation, occupation or that of the family, experience, and any experience with the non-Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">WG: I was born in Berlin in 1927, and I lived there with my parents, Dr. George Glass, G-L-A-S-S, and his wife Anna.</span> <span id="s4">Her maiden name was Wolff, W-O-L-F-F.</span> <span id="s5">My father had been born in West Prussia and, after World War I, moved to Berlin.</span> <span id="s6">My mother had been born in the Rhineland and during the French occupation after World War I moved to Berlin.</span> <span id="s7">And this is where they met and got married.</span> <span id="s8">I had an older sister, Helga, H-E-L-G-A, who was born in 1924.</span> <span id="s9">We lived in Berlin where my father practiced as a pediatrician, and we lived there till 1933.</span> <span id="s10">We left very early right after Hitler came to power and the reason for this was that in the apartment house where we lived, the next door apartment was occupied by one of the Nazi leaders in that part of Berlin, Ignor Koern.</span> <span id="s11">And he hadn't paid his rent for quite a while, back in 1932, so the landlord had him evicted.</span> <span id="s12">And, as the apartment next to ours was empty, my father decided to move his office to that apartment and thus have it more convenient to him.</span> <span id="s13">And while it was being remodeled into an office, the Nazi leader--who was unhappy at having been dispossessed--broke in one night, with his boys, and smeared paint and swastikas all over the place, and hung, hanged a banner outside the window saying, "This Jewish swine has stolen my apartment."</span> <span id="s14">Of course, my father--being a good, law abiding citizen--said, "He can't do this to me," and promptly instituted a suit against him.</span> <span id="s15">When Hitler came to power in '33, the suit was still awaiting court appearance, and, of course, it was not a great idea to have a suit in against the local Nazi leader.</span> <span id="s16">So my father tried to get the suit dismissed, but German law being what it is, once you have filed a complaint, the complaint has to be carried forward.</span> <span id="s17">And at that point we thought it might be a good idea to get out, because the Nazi that was making all kinds of threats as what he would do to this Jewish doctor who had dared to sue him.</span> <span id="s18">So we decided to get out.</span> <span id="s19">At first my father wanted to go just to Holland, and said, "You know, how long can this last?</span> <span id="s20">After all, you know, it's just a phase."</span> <span id="s21">But my mother said, "We have to go as far away as possible.</span> <span id="s22">It's just gonna get worse."</span> <span id="s23">And as far away as possible, we decided on China because, for several reasons.</span> <span id="s24">One, it was one of the few places in the world where you did not need a visa or anything, and where you could practice medicine as soon as you got there.</span> <span id="s25">We found out about this because my father was the pediatrician to the children of the Chinese Ambassador in Berlin.</span> <span id="s26">And he said, "Why don't you go to Shanghai?</span> <span id="s27">There are many, many children, and many of them are sick, so you'll have no problem getting patients."</span> <span id="s28">Well, Shanghai seemed far enough away, even for my mother, so we took off--my parents, my sister and myself and my governess, who we took along.</span> <span id="s29">She was not Jewish, but her brother was a well-known Communist, and she thought it also better for her to get out.</span> <span id="s30">Her brother had been arrested already, and so she thought she had better leave.</span> <span id="s31">So, we left by, we left in the summer of 1933, and at that time you could still take your property with you.</span> <span id="s32">And we took all kinds of things with us--furniture, a car, an x-ray machine, and God knows what else--by boat.</span> <span id="s33">Well, first by train to Genoa, and then by boat through the Suez Canal, around India, Malaya, the Philippines, and to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s34">The boat trip took 37 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">MS: Do you remember the name of the ship that you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">WG: The name was the motor ship Fulda, F-U-L-D-A, of the North German Lloyd Line.</span> <span id="s37">It was a, most of the passengers were missionaries on the way to save the heathen in Asia.</span> <span id="s38">And it stopped just about at every port you can imagine, which is why it took so long.</span> <span id="s39">But I remember very little of my life in Germany prior to that.</span> <span id="s40">I was six years old when we left.</span> <span id="s41">I went to school for a grand total of four months or so, and then we had the ocean voyage, of which I also remember very little, except for the fact that most people seemed to get sea sick except my sister and I.</span> <span id="s42">We were the only children on board, and we thought it strange nobody wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s43">Nobody wanted to do anything.</span> <span id="s44">And apparently children were pretty immune to this sort of stuff, and so we finally got to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s45">And again, we got off the boat, and there was no expectation of refugees coming or not coming.</span> <span id="s46">There was no interest particularly on anybody's part.</span> <span id="s47">People got off the boat, fine, they were off the boat.</span> <span id="s48">And, you know, they were on their own.</span> <span id="s49">There was, at the time, a sizable--actually two sizable Jewish communities--one, a Sephardic one, of Jews from Baghdad and Basra primarily, and one an Ashkenazic one of primarily Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s50">Neither side, neither one of these communities, expressed any particular interest in refugees from Europe.</span> <span id="s51">Of course, there were very few.</span> <span id="s52">Within the next six months or so there were a grand total of nine families that arrived, all for one reason or another.</span> <span id="s53">Of those, eight were doctors.</span> <span id="s54">So they formed a new Shanghai Doctors Association...</span></p> <p><span id="s55">MS: That's great!</span></p> <p><span id="s56">WG: â€¦and they could all practice medicine, of course, as soon as they got there, as there were no licensing requirements.</span> <span id="s57">In fact, you could also practice medicine if you didn't have an MD degree.</span> <span id="s58">If you just hung out a shingle, that was, it was a very free enterprise kind of town.</span> <span id="s59">You did what you wanted to do and nobody cared much one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">MS: Mr. Glass, since you arrived so early, you could live wherever you wanted to, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WG: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">MS: Could you tell us where your family settled within Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">WG: Yes.</span> <span id="s64">In Shanghai we lived in what was known as the International Settlement at first.</span> <span id="s65">This was an area governed not by the Chinese, but governed by elected council, consisting of nine members--five British, two American, and one usually Dutch or Swedish or Spanish or something else, and one, again, from some other country.</span> <span id="s66">These, the only people who could vote for this council were people who had what was known as extrality.</span> <span id="s67">That is, they were not subject to Chinese law.</span> <span id="s68">As part of the "unequal treaties" that obtained by gunboat diplomacy, various countries had effectively obtained diplomatic immunity for all their citizens.</span> <span id="s69">This included initially England, France, the U.S., Spain, Switzerland, and many other European countries, along with Russia and Germany.</span> <span id="s70">After WWI, Germany was deprived of extra territoriality, or extrality, so people with German passports, which we had at the time, went, did not have extrality and could not vote.</span> <span id="s71">Russians, the Soviet Union had given it up voluntarily at a time when Chiang Kai-shek was still a Communist, back in the early '20's.</span> <span id="s72">So Russians did not have extrality.</span> <span id="s73">But most other, what were known as foreigners, or whites, had extra terri--eh, extrality.</span> <span id="s74">And the Japanese had the same rights.</span> <span id="s75">So the only ones who could vote for the council were a very small group of people.</span> <span id="s76">Most, the Chinese, could not vote.</span> <span id="s77">And most of the whites, most of the foreigners who were German or Russian, primarily Russian, could not vote.</span> <span id="s78">But this International Settlement was run by what was known as the Shanghai Municipal Council, and not at all subject to Chinese law, except for people who had no extrality, who were naturally subject to Chinese law.</span> <span id="s79">We lived in an apartment house, which most people lived in who were not very wealthy.</span> <span id="s80">The very wealthy lived in individual homes, but these were few and far between.</span> <span id="s81">But most people lived in apartment houses, either in small two story houses, which were sort of row houses, or they lived in high rises.</span> <span id="s82">We lived in a high rise.</span> <span id="s83">And we lived there from 1933 till 1937, when we moved--this first high rise known as Dennis Apartments--we then moved into a newly opened high rise, which was nicer, the Metost [phonetic] Apartments.</span> <span id="s84">Both of these were on the street called Bubbling Well Road, which was a mix of residential and light commercial shopping activity.</span> <span id="s85">We lived in this apartment, and my father had his office in the apartment, so it was not as spacious as it had been in Berlin, but it was a very nice apartment, and we lived there.</span> <span id="s86">In addition we had, there were, it was a five-room apartment plus two servants' rooms.</span> <span id="s87">The servants, because everyone had servants, they were very cheap and reasonable, and, in fact, if you didn't have servants you found you couldn't get any delivery of anything, because, of course, the servants got a cut of everything.</span> <span id="s88">The way it worked was that you hired one servant, called the Number One Boy.</span> <span id="s89">And he was in charge, and he hired as many of his relatives as he could afford to feed, because the more people he had working for him, the bigger his face was.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">MS: Was he responsible, you say, like, for feeding?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WG: He did, he was responsible for maintaining the household.</span> <span id="s92">He himself would do as little as possible, because it was beneath his dignity to do very much.</span> <span id="s93">He would wait on table, and that was about it, and sometimes cook.</span> <span id="s94">But his wife would do the cleaning, and his, he, every Chinese Number One Boy had an infinite number of nephews, nieces, and assorted relatives who would do other things.</span> <span id="s95">And so we had anywhere from three to six servants, depending on his own needs.</span> <span id="s96">These servants lived in the servants' quarters.</span> <span id="s97">Each apartment house, major apartment house, had a separate wing for servants, with their own elevator, their own toilet facilities, and the like.</span> <span id="s98">Our Number One Boy was very entrepreneurial, and his family did not live in the servants' quarters.</span> <span id="s99">Instead he ran a gambling casino out of his quarters.</span> <span id="s100">As I said, Shanghai was a free enterprise zone.</span> <span id="s101">If you wanted to run a gambling casino, fine.</span> <span id="s102">We occasionally got complaints from the management because it got too noisy.</span> <span id="s103">We had to tell them to stop this nonsense and calm it down a bit.</span> <span id="s104">In fact, almost none of the servants lived in the servants' quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">MS: Within your family apartment.</span> <span id="s106">Within...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">WG: With, any of the apartments...</span></p> <p><span id="s108">MS: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">WG: Because, the quarters were--they considered them too luxurious, and they would rent them out.</span> <span id="s110">Most of them would rent them out to others for pay, and they themselves would sleep in the kitchen, or wherever, or in the garage.</span> <span id="s111">The apartment also came with a garage, and one of the servants was a chauffeur, because no foreigner would dare drive in Shanghai, because if you hit someone, you were responsible for all that, not only their injuries, but their family, and God forbid you should kill them, then you were responsible for their family for life.</span> <span id="s112">And, whereas, if you had a chauffeur and he hit someone, they'd never bother suing him, because what could they collect from him anyway?</span> <span id="s113">So, we had the car and the garage and the chauffeur.</span> <span id="s114">The house servants worked full-time, which meant they were on call 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s115">The chauffeur worked only half-time, from 7 in the morning till 7 at night, seven days a week.</span> <span id="s116">[tape off then on] The whole mess of servants, which was paid in one lump sum to the Number One Boy, came to maybe the equivalent of three or four dollars U.S. a month, but, of course, he got commissions on things that were bought.</span> <span id="s117">He got all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s118">God knows how much he stole from the kitchen, from the food supply, but it still did not amount to very much.</span> <span id="s119">And, the life in general, once my father's practice was established, was pretty good.</span> <span id="s120">When I first got there, my parents, of course, were worried that here I'd been out of school for three or four months, and so they put me in what was the Kaiser Wilhelm Schule, which was run by the German community, and was at that time a hotbed of anti-Nazi activity.</span> <span id="s121">These were old-line Germans who had been there for many years, and felt it was terrible that this Austrian paperhanger had taken over Germany.</span> <span id="s122">This didn't last very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">MS: Did their sentiments change?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">WG: I don't know if their sentiments changed, but the German Consulate changed, and the message was soon out, and when they introduced a Heil Hitler salute in the morning, I left, because that's not what we had come to Shanghai for.</span> <span id="s125">And by--this happened after we'd been in town for almost six months, which was very fortunate, because I could, once we'd been there for six months, I could go to the, a school run by the Shanghai Municipal Council, which was an English language school run along English lines.</span> <span id="s126">It was not a public school in the British sense of being a boarding school, nor was it a public school in the American sense of being a free school.</span> <span id="s127">It was a school that was open to "residents of Shanghai", where residents meant you had been there for six months, and if you were willing to pay, too, a sizable tuition.</span> <span id="s128">So my sister and I both went to the local "municipal school."</span> <span id="s129">Of course, they had separate schools for boys and for girls, which were next to each other, but separate and far from equal.</span> <span id="s130">The only people who were eligible to go to this school, whether they paid tuition or not, were non-Chinese.</span> <span id="s131">Chinese were not admitted.</span> <span id="s132">There were municipal schools for Chinese, also non-compulsory, also charging tuition, where the language of instruction was Chinese.</span> <span id="s133">In the other municipal schools, the language of instruction was English.</span> <span id="s134">So, I went through this school, and picked up English, which, of course, up to this point I hadn't known, but when you are six years old, you learn it very rapidly, and I went through the municipal school, both grade and high school, as did my sister.</span> <span id="s135">Life was very uneventful until 1937.</span> <span id="s136">In 1937 war broke out.</span> <span id="s137">The Japanese attacked the Chinese, surrounding the International Settlement, and in part of the International Settlement--that part north of the Soochow Creek known as Hongkew.</span> <span id="s138">There was fighting for, from August 13, '37, till about December 1st, during which time we had no school, and we watched the bombing and the fires and the casualties.</span> <span id="s139">Most of the casualties south of the Creek were caused by anti-aircraft shells falling back onto the town, and by bombs that the Chinese air force missed when they tried to hit the Japanese battleship in the harbor.</span> <span id="s140">They managed to hit a Chinese refugee camp, because the town was crowded with Chinese refugees from the surrounding countryside, and they hit several hotels and a bank, but they never did hit the Japanese battleship.</span> <span id="s141">But after December, the Chinese forces withdrew to the interior.</span> <span id="s142">The Japanese occupied the surrounding territory of the settlement, and the settlement north of the Creek, that is Hongkew.</span> <span id="s143">The rest of the town within the Settlement, and the French Concession, which was next door to the Settlement, suffered very little, really, during this 1937 incident, as it was called.</span> <span id="s144">School started up again and everything went along much as usual for us, till early in 1938 when our passport was up for renewal.</span> <span id="s145">My father applied to the German Consulate to get his passport renewed.</span> <span id="s146">It had been a five-year passport.</span> <span id="s147">And they told him that before they could renew it, he had to pay back taxes that were due in Germany.</span> <span id="s148">And he said, "That's impossible.</span> <span id="s149">You know you can't leave Germany owing taxes."</span> <span id="s150">And they said, "Well, we have a record here that you owe taxes."</span> <span id="s151">And my father asked, "How much?"</span> <span id="s152">Because he realized this was just a shakedown.</span> <span id="s153">And they said, "Well, we don't know the amount, just sign here that you'll pay the back taxes, whatever they are, and then you can have your passport."</span> <span id="s154">My father says there's no way he could sign a blank check, so from that time on we were stateless.</span> <span id="s155">We did not have a passport, which again, initially was not much of a drag.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">MS: I was going to ask how did that affect your standing, your dad's standing?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WG: Nobody really cared.</span> <span id="s158">It only meant that travel out of Shanghai became practically impossible, not totally, but practically impossible.</span> <span id="s159">But then again, where would we have gone anyway?</span> <span id="s160">My father was well-established by this time.</span> <span id="s161">He had a thriving practice.</span> <span id="s162">My sister and I were going to school.</span> <span id="s163">Everything was just fine.</span> <span id="s164">Our governess had finally left us to get married and remained in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s165">And oddly enough, she married the official photographer for the Nazi party in Shanghai, and their wedding took place at the German Evangelical Church, and it was paid for and the reception was paid for by my parents [chuckles] in loco parentis, which was the one and only time I was in the German Evangelical Church, which had, amongst other things, Nazi banners displayed and the like.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">MS: That had to have been rather uncomfortable for your family, I would think, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">WG: It was uncomfortable, but, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">MS: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">WG: This gal had been with us for quite a few years and she had no one else and she was getting married, and, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s170">MS: So be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">WG: So be it.</span> <span id="s172">So, and then, that was early in '38.</span> <span id="s173">Meanwhile in Europe, of course, things had been getting worse.</span> <span id="s174">My father had written to his brothers and his sister and our mother's parents, "Come on out.</span> <span id="s175">Get out of there.</span> <span id="s176">Come to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s177">You can have a life here.</span> <span id="s178">You can make a living."</span> <span id="s179">But, of course, they said, "Well, it's just a phase.</span> <span id="s180">It's not gonna get any worse."</span> <span id="s181">By 1938, they were beginning to think maybe it would get worse, and my father's sister and her husband and my mother's parents both decided to come to Shanghai, whereas my father's brothers and my mother's sister and their spouses decided not to come, that they would wait it out.</span> <span id="s182">My uncle and aunt and my grandparents arrived in Shanghai late in '38, but both of them missed Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s183">By the time they came, significant numbers of other German and Austrian Jews started to arrive in Shanghai, and housing was very tight, so what we did is we threw our number one boy and his gambling casino out of the servants' quarters, and put up my grandparents and my aunt and uncle in the rooms there instead, which was not the greatest of things, but there simply was no housing available.</span> <span id="s184">Gradually, housing became available in what had been Hongkew, which had been largely bombed out during the 1937 war.</span> <span id="s185">It was now being reconstructed and by 193--eh, by 1940, early in 1940, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents moved to Hongkew to their own quarters there.</span> <span id="s186">And in 1940 I was Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s187">Let me talk a little bit about religious upbringing in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">MS: Very good.</span> <span id="s189">I wanted to ask you that question.</span> <span id="s190">I'm glad you got to it.</span> <span id="s191">That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WG: When we first got to Shanghai, as I said, there were two Jewish communities, the Sephardic one and the Russian one.</span> <span id="s193">The Russian community was quite, not only unaccepting of German Jews, but significantly opposed to them, antipathic, I suppose.</span> <span id="s194">Whether this was in revenge for the treatment of Russian Jews by German Jews in Germany earlier on, I don't know, but there was no particular desire to integrate with the German Jews.</span> <span id="s195">The Sephardic community, on the other hand, was far more accepting, although naturally customs were very different.</span> <span id="s196">But the social contacts were much more with the Sephardic than the Russian community.</span> <span id="s197">And my parents said, well, it's time I went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s198">And I lasted exactly two weeks, because, of course, in the Sephardic community--when I went there I was six-and-a-half years old, almost seven--and the other seven-year-old boys naturally knew the daily prayers by heart, could read Hebrew fluently, and were busy discussing special prayers for the holidays and so on.</span> <span id="s199">I sat there like a good German Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s200">I knew the Shema and that was about it.</span> <span id="s201">And I could probably make the Motzi, and the teacher, the Hacham, thought that I was a disruptive influence, which I probably was, as I didn't know anything and was not very good at sitting quietly and absorbing nothing.</span> <span id="s202">So my parents took me out of there.</span> <span id="s203">And my religious education became very spotty until about 1939.</span> <span id="s204">By then I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s205">My Bar Mitzvah was approaching, but, of course, by this time there was a very significant number of German and Austrian Jews in Shanghai who had come there from '38 on.</span> <span id="s206">And in fact my father was the first President of the JÃ¼dische Gemeinde [Jewish community].</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s208">MS: We will continue at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">WG: By 1939, as I've said, there was a sizable number of German and Austrian Jews in Shanghai who had formed the JÃ¼dische Gemeinde, a community of central European Jews.</span> <span id="s210">My father was the first president.</span> <span id="s211">His main function was to make up the deficit, as he was not really an organizational type.</span> <span id="s212">But it was actually founded, the organizing part was by Jacob Steinhart, and this community was, had been set up, and a lot of activity occurred in the housing, feeding, and medical, and other care for the large number of refugees that were beginning to come to Shanghai and who, at that time, were allowed to leave Germany with only ten marks in their pocket.</span> <span id="s213">So that a lot had to be done, and a lot was done.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">MS: Finish your statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">WG: Yes.</span> <span id="s216">And also, of course, by this time, the Joint, that is the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, had become active in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s217">The Sephardic community was very forthcoming and, as they included very many very wealthy people, they soon came and took over the deficit reduction function from my father, and in fact they provided an enormous amount of help.</span> <span id="s218">They founded a school.</span> <span id="s219">They set up a hospital.</span> <span id="s220">It was known as the Kadoorie School, for the Kadoorie family.</span> <span id="s221">They set up a hospital.</span> <span id="s222">They provided a lot of the funds for the soup kitchens, for the meals, for--they provided--they bought the houses that were converted into Heime, the homes, where many of the refugees were put up.</span> <span id="s223">And in general the Sephardic community, along with the Joint, with some minor contributions by the Russian Jewish community, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s224">MS: The Russian Jewish community was not that forthcoming?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">WG: Not nearly as much as the Sephardic.</span> <span id="s226">The Sephardic community was very forthcoming.</span> <span id="s227">The Russian community was somewhat forthcoming.</span> <span id="s228">They were more forthcoming when Polish Jews started to come in.</span> <span id="s229">And then they started to open the purse strings a little wider, because apparently they felt more at ease helping the Polish community.</span> <span id="s230">And this JÃ¼dische Gemeinde was organized on very Germanic lines.</span> <span id="s231">It covered all kinds of governmental activity, from housing allocations to food allocations, to a polyclinic, to schools, and also what was called, Kultus, that is the religious life.</span> <span id="s232">There was a Kultus Dezernat [Religious Department] along with other commissioners, if you will.</span> <span id="s233">The rabbis and cantors were all employed by the community and were rotated between congregations.</span> <span id="s234">There were many prayer areas set up.</span> <span id="s235">The one we went to was within the Sephardic synagogue, the Sephardim--being sensible people and living in a subtropic area like Shanghai--had their Shabbat services usually from 7:00-9:00 in the morning, when it wasn't too hot.</span> <span id="s236">And, of course, we had services from 9:30 to 12:00, when it was hot as the dickens.</span> <span id="s237">But the Sephardim made their synagogue available for High Holy Days and the like.</span> <span id="s238">What was usually done was, movie theaters were rented and the services were held in them, because the congregations were much larger, obviously, at those times.</span> <span id="s239">And the JÃ¼dische Gemeinde held services in various degrees of Orthodoxy or Conservatism and the like.</span> <span id="s240">They, the rabbis, were rotated around and in good Germanic fashion, of course they had ranks.</span> <span id="s241">There was Rabbiner.</span> <span id="s242">There were Oberrabbiner [Chief Rabbis].</span> <span id="s243">There were Gemeinderabbiner [Congregational Rabbis].</span> <span id="s244">There were Cantors.</span> <span id="s245">There were Obercantors [Chief Cantors].</span> <span id="s246">There were Gemeinde Cantors [Congregational Cantors].</span> <span id="s247">And it became very important that not one of these praying locations got only the top level ones, not the low level ones.</span> <span id="s248">It was a bureaucracy hard to imagine--but it worked.</span> <span id="s249">And the, one of the cantors, not an Obercantor but just a plain cantor, was engaged to tutor me.</span> <span id="s250">As I am totally tone deaf and cannot carry a tune for the life of me, he was very worried that, God forbid, I should display my lack of talent in public and people would know he had tutored it.</span> <span id="s251">And so I managed, I was told that I had to, and I did.</span> <span id="s252">I read my Haftorah.</span> <span id="s253">I read my Maftir.</span> <span id="s254">No lightning struck, and we--I had my Bar Mitzvah, of course, in the Sephardic synagogue--at, but not at a Sephardic service.</span> <span id="s255">It was a good German Jewish service.</span> <span id="s256">Naturally, in the Sephardic synagogue, the women sat upstairs and the men downstairs, but that didn't strike me as strange, or anyone else, because that was the way it was.</span> <span id="s257">After the service, everybody came back to our apartment and we had sandwiches and sponge cake, and the whole thing lasted maybe an hour or so, and that was that.</span> <span id="s258">And I got my usual set of fountain pens and books and other good things as presents.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">MS: And, Mr. Glass, can I ask you about your family's associations with other peoples in the community?</span> <span id="s260">Obviously they had a large circle of friends by this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">WG: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">MS: Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WG: Actually, there was extremely limited social contact out--with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s264">There was very limited social contact outside of German Jews.</span> <span id="s265">Some Sephardic Jews.</span> <span id="s266">Most of their contacts were with other German Jews, most of them ones not living in Hongkew, but living in the International Settlement or in the French Concession.</span> <span id="s267">So, by this time there were maybe 20 families or so living outside of Hongkew--German Jews--but there was social, significant amount of social interaction with.</span> <span id="s268">Plus, of course, we had relatives.</span> <span id="s269">In addition to my aunt and uncle and my grandparents, some cousins of my father and cousins of my mother had come to Shanghai, all of whom lived in Hongkew and whom we saw once or twice a month.</span> <span id="s270">But, as far as more frequent social contact, this was usually primarily with the other doctors of the New Shanghai Doctors Association, and with a few families who had also come more or less at the time we had come and were very well established.</span> <span id="s271">The, as far as the kids were concerned, there was relatively little socializing outside of school.</span> <span id="s272">The only socializing was in the Boy Scouts or Girl Guides that my sister was in, or the Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, that I was in.</span> <span id="s273">And there wasn't this continual socializing of the children.</span> <span id="s274">Children were seen and not heard.</span> <span id="s275">They came home from school, school lasted till 4:00.</span> <span id="s276">If you came home, it was 4:30, you had tea, then you did your homework, then you had your supper, and then you went to bed.</span> <span id="s277">And that was your life, and it went on like that.</span> <span id="s278">So, I don't say that, the socializing that I did was in school or in the Scouts, and very little outside of that.</span> <span id="s279">The Scouts, I belonged to a Jewish Troop, the Fifth Jewish Troop of Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s280">I had first belonged to the Third Pack of Wolf Cubs, or Cub Scouts, which was not affiliated with anybody or anything.</span> <span id="s281">But then I went to the Fifth Troop, which was a Jewish Troop.</span> <span id="s282">And the main difference between the Jewish Troop and the other Troops was that we did not meet on Saturday, we met on Sunday.</span> <span id="s283">But, and we had the usual things that a city Scout Troop does, there was great difficulty finding places to hike.</span> <span id="s284">So we would hike around the town.</span> <span id="s285">And we, there was a campground that was run by the Boy Scouts Association, which was slightly out of town.</span> <span id="s286">It was almost a mile away, and in the midst of rice paddies and the like.</span> <span id="s287">And we would camp out there, cheek by jowl, usually with lots of other tents and other Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s288">The, all these Boy Scouts of course were non-Chinese.</span> <span id="s289">The Chinese had their own scouting association, and there was zero interaction among them, between the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">MS: I was going to ask if any...</span></p> <p><span id="s291">WG: And socially, the only Chinese that we socialized with were Chinese who the Chinese would not socialize with, i.e., mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s292">There was a Dr. Whong, who had married a German gal, when he was in med school in Germany.</span> <span id="s293">And they were fairly well ostracized by the Chinese community.</span> <span id="s294">And so they were more, they were accepted by this small group of German Jewish doctors.</span> <span id="s295">Although Mrs. Whong was not Jewish, she fit in very nicely, as she had had a rather miserable life as a white wife of a Chinese...</span></p> <p><span id="s296">MS: I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">WG: â€¦which was looked down upon both by the whites and by the Chinese.</span> <span id="s298">And her children, of course, being what were known as half-cast, had an even tougher time.</span> <span id="s299">Mixed bloods were looked on with disfavor, and this was part, of course, of the English heritage of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s300">That it simply wasn't done.</span> <span id="s301">And there were many things that weren't done--one of them was marrying a Chinese.</span> <span id="s302">Of course, people did it, but then they found life very difficult in most circles.</span> <span id="s303">The main focus of our social activity in Shanghai were--of the whites, the non-refugees, the ones who were in the International Settlement, and not in Hongkew--was usually centered around clubs.</span> <span id="s304">And, as a matter of professional necessity, my father was a member of many clubs.</span> <span id="s305">He was a member of the International Recreation Club which ran the race track, and of the Shanghai Jewish Club, and of the Club Lutzitano, which was a Portuguese Club, and of the Sepals Port [phonetic] FranÃ§ais, which was the French Club.</span> <span id="s306">A club that he couldn't--two clubs he could not join--one was the Shanghai American Club, which did not admit Jews, which was known as the Country Club, and the Shanghai Club, which admitted only English--not British--if you were Scottish or Welsh or Irish, or Canadian, or, God help us, Australian--you could not join the Shanghai Club.</span> <span id="s307">It was for English only.</span> <span id="s308">So, the Shanghai Club was out, and the Country Club was out, but all the other clubs that were around, my father joined, and the activities centered around those clubs, and, oh, he also joined the Russian Club, which was run by the Soviet community.</span> <span id="s309">And we had a pretty good time.</span> <span id="s310">Everything went very well until Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">MS: Yes.</span> <span id="s312">This is interesting.</span> <span id="s313">How did life change for you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">WG: And Pearl Harbor, let me go back a bit just before Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s315">Everybody in Shanghai knew war was coming.</span> <span id="s316">That was absolutely self-evident from the actions of the Japanese and their statements.</span> <span id="s317">It was so well-known that the major banks, the Chase Bank, the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Chartered Bank, asked, in November of 1941, asked their depositors kindly to remove their deposits, because, they sent a note around saying, "In the event of hostilities, we cannot be responsible for the safety of the deposit."</span> <span id="s318">And, when banks ask you to withdraw your money, you know it is for real.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">MS: I see [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s320">WG: And, also it was known, we thought, by all the governments concerned.</span> <span id="s321">The U.S. pulled out their 4th Marines which had been stationed in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s322">The British pulled out their Seaport Highlanders, and the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.</span> <span id="s323">So that we--the 4th Marines--withdrew to the safety of Corregidor, the Seaport Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers to the safety of Singapore.</span> <span id="s324">Everybody knew war was coming.</span> <span id="s325">We all thought it would be over in about a week or two, because here were the Japanese--they couldn't even take out the Chinese Nationalist Army which was considered a joke and totally incompetent.</span> <span id="s326">They'd been fighting them for four years without winning, and we felt, "If they can't take out the Chinese Nationalists, my God, they're crazy, they're gonna attack the U.S. and Britain?</span> <span id="s327">And, they'll last just about a week."</span> <span id="s328">Well, came Pearl Harbor, and, of course, on our side of the date line in Shanghai it was December 8th, not December 7th.</span> <span id="s329">It was a Monday morning.</span> <span id="s330">And we heard on the radio what was happening.</span> <span id="s331">And Japanese troops occupied the rest of the Settlement.</span> <span id="s332">They had already occupied, of course, all the surrounding areas.</span> <span id="s333">They did this not at all the way it was shown in Empire of the Sun, which is a completely incorrect version.</span> <span id="s334">They did it by the simple expedient of making a phone call to the Shanghai Municipal Council and saying, "We are taking over."</span> <span id="s335">And the Municipal Council said, "Go ahead.</span> <span id="s336">What can we do about it?"</span> <span id="s337">So, they just walked in.</span> <span id="s338">I went to school.</span> <span id="s339">School was on as normal.</span> <span id="s340">And we had classes, and we all thought, "Well, it will be over in a day or in a week or so."</span> <span id="s341">Then the Japanese broadcast the results of their attack on Pearl Harbor and we said, "They are absolutely lying.</span> <span id="s342">There's no way in the world they could have sunk the entire U.S. fleet.</span> <span id="s343">There is no way in the world the U.S. fleet would have been there, because the U.S. knew, obviously, that war was coming.</span> <span id="s344">Why else did they withdraw their Marines from Shanghai?</span> <span id="s345">Obviously the British knew war was coming.</span> <span id="s346">Why else did they remove their troops and ask us to remove bank deposits?</span> <span id="s347">The Japanese are just lying.</span> <span id="s348">It'll be over in a week or two."</span> <span id="s349">Well, in a week or two, we found out that the Japanese had been telling the truth.</span> <span id="s350">They had sunk the U.S. fleet.</span> <span id="s351">They had sunk the British fleet.</span> <span id="s352">They had occupied all kinds of places and we thought, "My gosh!</span> <span id="s353">This is very odd."</span> <span id="s354">The Japanese, of course, also thought the war would be over very quickly.</span> <span id="s355">They had no intention of occupying the United States or Britain or Holland or anything like that.</span> <span id="s356">They thought it was just a colonial war, like all the other colonial wars, like World War I, where, at the end of the war the colonies changed hands.</span> <span id="s357">They thought they would take over British and American colonies in Asia.</span> <span id="s358">They'd take over the Philippines and Malaysia and Hong Kong, and the Dutch colonies, Indonesia, and then they'd sign a peace treaty and everything would be fine.</span> <span id="s359">They would have the colonies instead of the, eh, what they called the ABC power, ABCD powers--America, Britain, China, and the Dutch.</span> <span id="s360">They, because they felt the war would be over very shortly, they did absolutely nothing about the British and American nationals in Shanghai, or the Dutch or other so-called enemies.</span> <span id="s361">After a few weeks, they said, "Well, they had better turn in their short-wave radios."</span> <span id="s362">In fact, they collected short-wave radios from everyone.</span> <span id="s363">You were not allowed to listen to short-wave radio anymore.</span> <span id="s364">Then they had all the, what they called, major enemies, that is, the British, the Americans, and the Dutch, had to wear red armbands to show they were enemies.</span> <span id="s365">Their minor enemies, counter--nationals of countries that had declared war on Japan but that Japan didn't take seriously, some South American countries and various minor European countries, they had to wear pink armbands.</span> <span id="s366">But that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">MS: How were you affected, being a stateless person at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">WG: Totally unaffected, at that time.</span> <span id="s369">They did absolutely nothing about anybody, other than provide red and pink armbands.</span> <span id="s370">Life went on exactly as usual.</span> <span id="s371">The teachers in the school now wore red armbands, and some of the students wore red armbands, or pink armbands, and nobody paid much attention to any of it.</span> <span id="s372">In fact, it would take them almost a year before they realized that the war was not over, that America and Britain would continue to fight.</span> <span id="s373">And then they interned the British and the Americans.</span> <span id="s374">All the people with red armbands were interned, unless you had enough money to stay out, which some did.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">MS: You could buy your way out?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">WG: You could if you were very well to do.</span> <span id="s377">You bought your way out by becoming sick and being interned in a hospital.</span> <span id="s378">Like, one of the major Sephardic big wheels, Sir Ellis Kadoorie, spent the entire war wearing his arm in a sling at the Country Hospital in a private suite.</span> <span id="s379">But, nobody knew exactly how much that cost him, but it was assumed that it cost him plenty.</span> <span id="s380">The others, who were not that fortunate or wealthy, were interned.</span> <span id="s381">Americans were quickly exchanged for Japanese interned in the U.S., and very few Americans remained interned.</span> <span id="s382">They were exchanged at Lorenz Market as they were taken out on a Portuguese ship, shipped to Portuguese Africa, where they were exchanged for Japanese.</span> <span id="s383">The British had no one to trade.</span> <span id="s384">They had very few Japanese interned in England, so they stayed interned and suffered considerably over time.</span> <span id="s385">They were allowed to receive food packages, and my parents did send food packages to some of my teachers from high school who had been interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">MS: What did internment mean, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">WG: They were in a camp, under miserable conditions.</span> <span id="s388">It was basically a prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s389">It was not an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s390">It was not a hard labor camp.</span> <span id="s391">It was a prisoner of war camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">MS: Within the Shanghai area?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">WG: Within the Shanghai, well, on the outskirts of Shanghai, near the airport, not in the actual citified part, but just outside, in barracks, barrack-type environment.</span> <span id="s394">And miserable rations, miserable medical care.</span> <span id="s395">It was a standard prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s396">The food was usually no better or no worse than Japanese troops rations, which were not very good.</span> <span id="s397">Medical care was no better, and probably worse.</span> <span id="s398">And they stayed there.</span> <span id="s399">It was unpleasant and difficult, but not terribly life-threatening, unless you got sick, in which case medical care was minimal, and you, they did not have a high survival rate once you got sick.</span> <span id="s400">But, if you didn't get sick, you were O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">MS: Were they aided by any organizations, like Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">WG: They had, they got some supplies in from the Red Cross, through the Swiss Consulate, and they, I don't know the exact survival rate, but it was put very high, compared to--there were no death marches, there were no--it was just very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s403">Especially as most of the English and American citizens who were there had been used to a rather charmed life, with diplomatic immunity effectively, were well-to-do, lots of servants, and here they were reduced to a very miserable, mass existence.</span> <span id="s404">But there was not, it wasn't a matter of basic, you know, "Will we make it or not?"</span> <span id="s405">Everyone expected that they would make it, and most of them made it.</span> <span id="s406">It wasn't--now, as far as the Jews were concerned, the German government started to put pressure on the Japanese to do something about the roughly 20,000 Jews in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s407">And the Japanese were in a bind because of these different kinds of Jews that were there.</span> <span id="s408">The Jews that had Iraqi passports, they did not want to do anything to.</span> <span id="s409">The Iraqis had Swiss Consulate protection.</span> <span id="s410">They were enemies.</span> <span id="s411">Some of them were interned, some of them were not.</span> <span id="s412">But they received supplies through the Swiss Consulate, and the Japanese did not want to irritate the Swiss, because the Swiss were a source of hard currency for them, and so they did nothing about, they did not want to do anything about Iraqi Jews.</span> <span id="s413">The Russian Jews were a different problem.</span> <span id="s414">Many of them had Soviet papers, and the Japanese were scared to death of the Soviets, because they knew the Soviet army could march into Manchuria any time, Mannish--or, what they called Manchoukuo.</span> <span id="s415">And Manchoukuo was the main basis of their heavy industry--all their iron production, steel production, coal production came from Manchoukuo.</span> <span id="s416">So they bent over backwards being nice to the Soviets.</span> <span id="s417">So they certainly weren't going to do anything to Soviet Jews.</span> <span id="s418">Many of the Russian Jews had no papers, were stateless, but so were some 10,000 non-Jewish Russians, White Russians, in Shanghai, Czarist Russians who were avidly pro-Axis, because they were anti-Soviet, they were pro-German and pro-Japanese.</span> <span id="s419">In fact, the Japanese used the Russian regiment, a regiment of White Russians, that had been part of the Shanghai Volunteer Corp which were, had been part of the military force, so-called, of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</span> <span id="s420">And the Russian regiment was used by the Japanese as part of the police force to maintain order and discipline.</span> <span id="s421">And they certainly weren't going to do anything against stateless Russians, or, of Russian origin.</span> <span id="s422">So here they had stateless people who they were in cahoots with, the White Russians.</span> <span id="s423">They had Soviet Jews that they didn't want to irritate.</span> <span id="s424">Then they had a whole bunch of Jews living in Hongkew who were stateless, and who were primarily of German and Austrian origin, or of Polish origin.</span> <span id="s425">And they were fair game.</span> <span id="s426">Now, they did not, when they set--when the Japanese set up a ghetto in Hongkew, in a very small part of Hongkew actually, they did not set it up for Jews.</span> <span id="s427">They set it up for what they called, "stateless refugees."</span> <span id="s428">And the difference between being a stateless immigrant and a stateless refugee was the day you showed up, the date at which you showed up in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s429">If you showed up before 1937, that is, before the Japanese invasion of the outskirts of Shanghai, you were an immigrant.</span> <span id="s430">Thus, all the White Russians, all the Russian regiment, and all the Russian Jews who were stateless, and those ten families or so--of which my parents were one--who were stateless, they were stateless immigrants and they were not subject to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s431">Anyone who was stateless who arrived after 1937 had to move into the ghetto, whether you were Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s432">So there were quite a few non-Jewish stateless people, who had arrived in Shanghai after 1937, who had to move into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s433">So it, officially, it was not based on being Jewish, but being a stateless refugee.</span> <span id="s434">And, of course, 98 or 99% of the people who were forced to move into the ghetto were Jewish.</span> <span id="s435">Now my grandparents and my aunt and uncle had already lived in the area that was designated as a ghetto, so they didn't have to move.</span> <span id="s436">However, other Jewish refugees had to move in to this ghetto, which was a small, small area.</span> <span id="s437">And housing being what, was very tight, space was allocated by the JÃ¼dische Gemeinde, and they had to share facilities and have people move in with them, andâ€¦ Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s438">WG: Life in the ghetto was very difficult, especially from an economic point of view.</span> <span id="s439">Not only was it very crowded there, but you can't live by taking in each other's washing.</span> <span id="s440">You have to have some commercial activity.</span> <span id="s441">There was a lot of cultural activity, which is not very productive of export oriented goods, export from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s442">But, and it was very difficult to receive a pass to leave the ghetto, either for a few hours, or for a week or so.</span> <span id="s443">It could be done at the whim of the Japanese, who ran the ghetto, but it was difficult.</span> <span id="s444">So, in fact, in all of Shanghai, during the war, after Pearl Harbor, there was a major depression because Shanghai is a trading town.</span> <span id="s445">It depends on stuff coming in and going out, and there wasn't anything coming in or going out, because there was no shipping.</span> <span id="s446">U.S. submarines would torpedo shipping trying to get to Shanghai, and so there wasn't anything coming in, and of course if nothing came in, nothing went out.</span> <span id="s447">There was fighting in the interior, so there was nothing coming in or out of the hinterland.</span> <span id="s448">And it was a rather messy time economically, for everyone, but especially in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s449">And even outside the ghetto it was pretty bad economically.</span> <span id="s450">My father was very busy because people were sick, as always, but no one had any money to pay.</span> <span id="s451">So, it was sort of tough, but not that bad.</span> <span id="s452">Now, gradually, as the war went on, things got tougher and tougher economically.</span> <span id="s453">Food supplies got scarcer and scarcer.</span> <span id="s454">Meat supply effectively dried up, except for the day, or the week after the Japanese closed the Canadrome, which was a dog racing establishment, and suddenly hamburger was for sale, which very few people chose to buy, because one could figure why suddenly there was hamburger for sale.</span> <span id="s455">Chickens could be had on occasion.</span> <span id="s456">Eggs were available from surrounding farms.</span> <span id="s457">Beef, of course, was non-existent.</span> <span id="s458">What was passed for beef was usually water buffalo that had died of old age and hard work, and even that was hard to come by.</span> <span id="s459">Rice was usually available and bread was usually available.</span> <span id="s460">Prices were high, but you could live.</span> <span id="s461">Milk, nobody drank anyway, because the cows all had T.B. So, you were used to that anyway.</span> <span id="s462">So dairy foods were sort of out, and you lived basically on veggies and pasta of various kinds and you could make it, more or less.</span> <span id="s463">It was not the healthiest of diets, but people, very few whites, if any, died of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s464">The Chinese, of course, many of them died of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s465">There is no such thing, or was no such thing as any organized charity for the Chinese, other than what was known as the Blue Cross Society.</span> <span id="s466">The Blue Cross Society was the group that picked up dead bodies off the streets and buried them.</span> <span id="s467">And whether this was in honor of the dead or to protect the living, I think it was more of the latter.</span> <span id="s468">But certainly there were no such thing as social services for the Chinese community.</span> <span id="s469">The Chinese situation was that a family took care of its own, and if you didn't have any family, that was your tough luck.</span> <span id="s470">And of course as Shanghai was very crowded with refugees from the fighting in the countryside, a lot of them had no family, and that was their misfortune.</span> <span id="s471">The--so, depending on the weather, when it got cold more people died.</span> <span id="s472">When it got warm, fewer people died, until there was an outbreak of cholera or small pox and the like, and then more people died.</span> <span id="s473">But they would publish the Blue Cross number in the papers every day, and it usually was a three digit number, anywhere from 100 to 600, and when times got bad, really bad in an epidemic, it would go up to maybe 2,000 or so.</span> <span id="s474">And this was the number of corpses that the Blue Cross had picked up that day.</span> <span id="s475">Now, out of six million, you'll hardly miss them.</span> <span id="s476">If you walked along the street and there happened to be a corpse there, you just stepped over it and ignored it, and kept walking, trying, being very careful not to step on it, because not out of respect for the dead so much as fear of being infected.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">MS: I was going to ask, was there a probability or scare of epidemics?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">WG: Oh yeah, yeah, you were, you know, you took precautions, but you always did in China.</span> <span id="s479">I mean, no one in his right mind would eat anything that had not been washed in potassium permanganate solution.</span> <span id="s480">And you certainly didn't eat raw vegetables.</span> <span id="s481">You certainly peeled your tomatoes and peeled your apples.</span> <span id="s482">You boiled everything.</span> <span id="s483">You wouldn't drink the water.</span> <span id="s484">You boiled, I mean, that was just normal life there before the war, after the war, at all times in China.</span> <span id="s485">The water supply was contaminated.</span> <span id="s486">There were some 200,000 Chinese living on Sampans, on little boats in the river, using the river, which was also the water supply, as toilet...</span></p> <p><span id="s487">MS: Toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">WG: â€¦and bathroom, and laundry facilities, or, eh, but that was normal.</span> <span id="s489">That was China, and people--that didn't bother anybody.</span> <span id="s490">I mean, it might bother you the first week you were there, the first month, but it certainly never bothered me because I grew up with it.</span> <span id="s491">In fact, as an aside, my wife and I went to China on a visit in 1981, and she and I were, I think, the only ones on our tour who did not get the runs.</span> <span id="s492">But that's because I told my wife how one should eat in China, whether it's in 1938 or in 1981.</span> <span id="s493">One doesn't drink the water.</span> <span id="s494">One doesn't eat raw vegetables, even if the salads look inviting, because most of the fertilizer is night soil [human waste].</span> <span id="s495">And you don't do that.</span> <span id="s496">You boil and you disinfect everything in sight.</span> <span id="s497">So, if you took these precautions, you were O.K. Of course, the people living on the river, the people living in the streets--there were a large number of street people--they couldn't take these precautions and they got sick and a lot of them died.</span> <span id="s498">But again, nobody really gave a darn.</span> <span id="s499">It just was not anybody's concern.</span> <span id="s500">It was their family's concern.</span> <span id="s501">If their family didn't take care of them, tough.</span> <span id="s502">Communal responsibility simply did not exist as a concept amongst the Chinese in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s503">Whether it existed in a village somewhere in the interior, I don't know.</span> <span id="s504">But in the cities it did not exist, and there were no formal organizations to take care of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">MS: Itâ€™s almost unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">WG: It's free enterprise.</span> <span id="s507">Very low taxes that way.</span> <span id="s508">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s509">MS: Another way of looking at it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">WG: You know, that's what you want, that's what you get, you know.</span> <span id="s511">The, and life for us outside the ghetto got to be difficult economically until 1942.</span> <span id="s512">In 1942, the, after the ghetto was established, about three months thereafter, Japanese Vice Admiral decided he liked the apartment we lived in and gave us three days to get out--which was very nice of him, he could have given us three hours.</span> <span id="s513">But he told us in three days he would occupy the apartment.</span> <span id="s514">So we had to move.</span> <span id="s515">My father moved his practice in with another doctor in another apartment in a different building, and we looked for a place to live.</span> <span id="s516">Now, times were, there just were no places to live that one might want, so you had to take what you could get.</span> <span id="s517">What we got was a room in what was officially a licensed private hotel, which was a polite way of saying a brothel.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s519">WG: One of the girls hadn't paid her rent, and the landlord had her evicted, and we took over her room.</span> <span id="s520">So the four of us moved into this room in the Beverly House, and like all the rooms in the Beverly House, it had its own bathroom, which the girls wanted, but of course no kitchen.</span> <span id="s521">So you cooked on a little pot bellied stove, or on a hibachi.</span> <span id="s522">And we moved into that.</span> <span id="s523">And, it was a very strange private hotel, because most of these brothels were either full of white girls or Chinese girls.</span> <span id="s524">This one had both.</span> <span id="s525">It was segregated.</span> <span id="s526">It was a three-story building.</span> <span id="s527">The top floor, all the rooms were occupied by white girls, primarily White Russians.</span> <span id="s528">The bottom floor was all occupied by Chinese girls, and the middle floor turned out to become "the respectable floor", all occupied by people who'd been thrown out of their apartments by various Japanese officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">MS: So that was your status.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">WG: Our status.</span> <span id="s531">We lived on the middle floor, and along there there was a professor from the University, and a, an official Belgian, French official of the customs service, and people who had been thrown out of their apartments.</span> <span id="s532">And also living there was a semi-respectable couple, who was one of the Sephardic gals, who was also in the business, but she was a really good looker, so oddly enough she got married, and they lived there too.</span> <span id="s533">Her sisters were still in the business, but in different houses.</span> <span id="s534">The--and we lived in this one room till I left Shanghai many years later.</span> <span id="s535">During the war the Japanese collected all the radiators, all the hot water pipes for scrap metal, so nobody had any heat, except what you could burn, so we burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">MS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">WG: Well, we burned furniture.</span> <span id="s538">We burned whatever there was.</span> <span id="s539">You got coal balls.</span> <span id="s540">Coal balls were local inventions.</span> <span id="s541">Over the years coal had been shipped into Shanghai for the power plant and, in being shipped in, some of the coal dust and so on would settle on the bottom of the river, at the, there's a, where they unloaded the coal barges.</span> <span id="s542">And now divers would go down and dig up this mud, which had coal dust in it, and make brickettes out of it.</span> <span id="s543">And they were about 50% mud, 50% coal dust.</span> <span id="s544">And that's what you would burn and cook with and heat with.</span> <span id="s545">If you ran out of furniture or if you couldn't buy fuel, which, you could also buy rice straw, but that didn't burn very long.</span> <span id="s546">So, mostly what was done during the war--of course Shanghai doesn't get very cold, it's about like Savannah, Georgia--it gets down to freezing or a little below for maybe a week or so, but even 40 degrees can be very cold when you have no heat.</span> <span id="s547">So what was used a lot was what was known as internal heating, i.e., vodka.</span> <span id="s548">It was very popular, and you wore lots of clothes.</span> <span id="s549">You wore as much clothing as you could stand in the winter, and as little as you could stand in the summer.</span> <span id="s550">And you'd be surprised how well that system works.</span> <span id="s551">And we lived in the Beverly House and, during the war of course everywhere, including outside the ghetto, power was scarce, because the power company, which was owned by Sephardic Jews, which had been taken over by the Japanese, they didn't have much fuel, and so electricity was on for only a few hours a day and you were rationed to roughly ten kilowatt hours a month or less, which meant that you didn--even if the electricity was on, you couldn't run very much.</span> <span id="s552">The hot water was non-existent, because all the hot water pipes had been taken away, so you bought your hot water at a hot water shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">MS: Oh, dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">WG: And a coolie would bring up a bucket or two.</span> <span id="s555">It was usually, if you could afford it, four buckets at a time.</span> <span id="s556">And then, you would take a bath, all of you, one after the other, and there was, it's usually in the family some squabbling about who got the bath water first.</span> <span id="s557">And you were afforded this luxury once every two or three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">MS: Oh, dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">WG: Which, it turns out, is quite ample.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s561">WG: [laughing] Nobody died.</span> <span id="s562">Perfume was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">MS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s564">WG: And, it works.</span> <span id="s565">It works.</span> <span id="s566">And whether you did it every two or three weeks or every four weeks, and sometimes maybe every week if it was your birthday, but, you managed.</span> <span id="s567">And in general life went on, with constraints.</span> <span id="s568">I had graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s569">I had gone to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">MS: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">WG: In Shanghai.</span> <span id="s572">I first went to the Lester Institute of Technical Education, where, which was closed down when they interned all the British professors.</span> <span id="s573">I then went to East Asia Technical College, which was housed in the same building, and, but was officially run by the Japanese.</span> <span id="s574">But all the professors--the language of instruction was English--and all the professors were so-called neutral: Swiss, Swedish, Portuguese, Turkish, whatever they could, and also of course some Jewish refugees who were hired to teach there.</span> <span id="s575">It was located within the ghetto area, so there was no problem in that respect.</span> <span id="s576">That went on till 1942, in June, no, till 194--till 1944, till 19--in June of '44, the Japanese expelled all non-Asiatics from the East Asia Technical College and fired all the non-Asiatic staff.</span> <span id="s577">I then went to a French university, which was run by Jesuit fathers, Aurora University, and they were allowed to operate because, of course, all the French in Shanghai had become very pro-Vichy, and were pro-Axis and pro-Japanese.</span> <span id="s578">And so the Jesuit College, University, was allowed to operate.</span> <span id="s579">And I went to that from 1944 till I left Shanghai in '47.</span> <span id="s580">The French Vichy thing had an odd effect on us.</span> <span id="s581">When the war first broke out in Europe, in 1939, my father received a letter asking him not to appear at the French Club, saying Germans were unwelcome until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s582">My father wrote them a letter saying that he was not German.</span> <span id="s583">He had no German nationality.</span> <span id="s584">And he was certainly as opposed to the German government--the Nazi government--as any of the French.</span> <span id="s585">They then rescinded the letter and said, "Oh, we're sorry.</span> <span id="s586">Please be very welcome."</span> <span id="s587">Until the Vichy government took over in 1940 and they sent a letter asking all Jews to stay away.</span> <span id="s588">This one, we lived with, and no Jews went there--at least we didn't--until the war was over.</span> <span id="s589">When the war was over, we rejoined the French Club, and of course the administration changed from being pro-Vichy to being very pro-deGaullist.</span> <span id="s590">The French troops--which had not been withdrawn from Shanghai prior to Pearl Harbor because of course they had already become pro-Vichy--were now stuck, and it was very embarrassing.</span> <span id="s591">Because here they were all collaborationists.</span> <span id="s592">So the Colonel in charge, and the two Majors of the regiment--they had a French regiment there--all committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">MS: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s594">WG: But they did it the correct French military manner.</span> <span id="s595">That is, they shot them selves and missed slightly, so they lived long enough to get absolution, and so they could have full military funerals when they died half an hour later.</span> <span id="s596">The priests were, I under stand, were standing by while they shot themselves.</span> <span id="s597">And they all lived long enough to be granted absolution and thus could be buried in a Catholic cemetery with full military honors.</span> <span id="s598">They had a big parade and everything was very nice.</span> <span id="s599">And in the meantime they got a new Colonel and two Majors were sent over from France who had somewhat better credentials than being collaborationists.</span> <span id="s600">They did nothing about the other officers or men who had been part of the command, who had really very little choice in the matter of what they did or didn't do.</span> <span id="s601">They never really did anything during the war.</span> <span id="s602">They were perfectly happy to be sitting out the war in Shanghai doing nothing.</span> <span id="s603">The war itself had, the fighting, had relatively little effect.</span> <span id="s604">We were bombed by B-29's, who were pretty good in their aim.</span> <span id="s605">They aimed mainly for air fields, military installations, and the like.</span> <span id="s606">They did make an occasional mistake.</span> <span id="s607">They managed to send one bomb onto one of the Jewish refugee homes, killing quite a number of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">MS: This was in the Hongkew area?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">WG: In the Hongkew area, yes, it was a home that was right next to the Japanese naval radio station.</span> <span id="s610">They missed the radio station and hit the home.</span> <span id="s611">But in general, it was pretty good.</span> <span id="s612">As far as knowing what went on in the world at this time, or during this time, the Japanese had censored all news regarding fighting in Asia.</span> <span id="s613">No one was allowed to have a short-wave radio.</span> <span id="s614">The Japanese broadcast news about the fighting in Asia, which no one believed.</span> <span id="s615">And I'll get into why that was a little later.</span> <span id="s616">About Europe, militarily, we knew everything that was going on, because the Japanese did not dare censor the Russians, the Soviets.</span> <span id="s617">They had their own radio station, XRBN, that would broadcast there, but only allowed to broadcast in Russian.</span> <span id="s618">But everybody learned enough Russian to under stand it.</span> <span id="s619">They were allowed to publish a Soviet newspaper, which you quickly learned to read, to find out what was going on.</span> <span id="s620">And they were allowed to show newsreels at the Soviet Club.</span> <span id="s621">So, our first view of General Eisenhower and Marshall Tedder [Royal Air Force deputy to Eisenhower] and all the other commanders in Europe was at the Soviet Club.</span> <span id="s622">They would have open air movies, and--at a slight fee--and I would go, and watch the newsreels about fighting in Europe.</span> <span id="s623">We knew, every time of course they showed a B-17 being loaded up to bomb Germany, everybody would applaud furiously, and the Japanese would stalk out.</span> <span id="s624">They'd usually have somebody there at the invitation of the Soviet Consulate.</span> <span id="s625">And the Soviet Consulate liked to tweak their nose a little bit by showing Germans and the Japane--eh, German and Russian activity.</span> <span id="s626">And, so we knew all about the war, where the war was, what was happening in, on the ground.</span> <span id="s627">We heard rumors about Jews being moved around Europe.</span> <span id="s628">We, I don't think anyone heard of extermination camps as such.</span> <span id="s629">We did not know that.</span> <span id="s630">We knew that people were being evacuated, being sent here, being sent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">MS: You didn't know what was happening to Jews in, in...</span></p> <p><span id="s632">WG: In Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">MS: The European countries though.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">WG: We knew that they were being moved around, but that was it.</span> <span id="s635">We certainly had no news of my relatives.</span> <span id="s636">We had no, nobody had.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">MS: No correspondence, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">WG: There was no correspondence whatsoever and there was no knowledge of the death camps and the like, none.</span> <span id="s639">We knew things were bad.</span> <span id="s640">We knew what the situation was when the second front opened.</span> <span id="s641">We knew the fighting in Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s642">We knew all that from the Soviet news agency, but we did not know about the horrors of the Holocaust in detail at all, or in even in broad outline.</span> <span id="s643">We just didn't know.</span> <span id="s644">I don't know if anybody knew.</span> <span id="s645">Certainly I never heard it and none of my family ever heard it until the war was over.</span> <span id="s646">But we did know that the, what the Japanese were saying about the war in Asia made no sense, because the B-29's that would come and bomb us would fly higher than their Japanese aircraft could climb, or that their anti-aircraft could reach.</span> <span id="s647">So there was never any opposition to them.</span> <span id="s648">Yet every time that one or two or three B-29's came and bombed Shanghai, the Japanese would announce that 200 planes attempted to raid Shanghai, and 197 were shot down on the way, and three managed to get through and were shot down on the way out.</span> <span id="s649">And we knew this was a bunch of bull, and if you couldn't believe that, you couldn't believe anything.</span> <span id="s650">So we never really knew what was going on, except for the fact that we knew what had happened initially, and every now and again the Japanese would announce that they had trapped the American forces into landing on some island or other where they were then going to be annihilated.</span> <span id="s651">And they had carefully removed all atlases from the public libraries, and so unless you happened to have an atlas that showed these islands no one had ever heard of, you didn't have the faintest idea where or what.</span> <span id="s652">Until they trapped the Americans into landing on the Philippines, and we knew where the Philippines were.</span> <span id="s653">And we knew--some of us at least knew--where Okinawa was, so then we said, "Ah ha, it's getting close."</span> <span id="s654">And the closer it got, the nastier the Japanese got, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">MS: In their treatment to...</span></p> <p><span id="s656">WG: In their treatment of everybody.</span> <span id="s657">In general, they did not do anything to you if you obeyed their rules.</span> <span id="s658">That--rules included if you pass a Japanese sentry, you had to take your hat off and bow down.</span> <span id="s659">If you didn't, if he was in a good mood, he'd smack you with the butt end of his rifle.</span> <span id="s660">If he was in a bad mood, he'd use the bayonet end.</span> <span id="s661">So, you didn't disobey rules.</span> <span id="s662">A, one of the German Jewish doctors there, a dentist, Dr. Gandazi, made the mistake of questioning a Japanese sentry.</span> <span id="s663">He happened to have a patient in the hospital, and the hospital, it was announced, was closed.</span> <span id="s664">What that meant was that the Japanese had some casualties in there.</span> <span id="s665">And when they had ca--as they officially never had casualties, people always died in battle.</span> <span id="s666">There were no such thing as wounded not fighting to the death.</span> <span id="s667">They never admitted to having casualties.</span> <span id="s668">So whenever they did have casualties in the hospital, they just closed the hospital, and no non-Japanese doctor was allowed in.</span> <span id="s669">Well, this German Jewish dentist had a patient in there for oral surgery.</span> <span id="s670">He went to the gate and said, "I want in."</span> <span id="s671">And the sentry said, "No."</span> <span id="s672">And he says, "Oh yes, let me talk to your commanding officer," which of course was an insult to the Japanese sentry, so he smacked him with his rifle butt and took out an eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">MS: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s674">WG: But, everybody felt sorry for the dentist, but they said, "How could you be so stupid as to question a Japanese sentry?"</span> <span id="s675">A sentry represents the emperor, and it's like insulting the emperor.</span> <span id="s676">So you didn't do that.</span> <span id="s677">You stood at attention when a Japanese flag went by.</span> <span id="s678">You did thing--we had blackouts.</span> <span id="s679">You did not have any light showing.</span> <span id="s680">If you did, they would not knock on your door, they would just shoot it out.</span> <span id="s681">And if they missed the light and hit somebody, that was their bad luck.</span> <span id="s682">But, you didn't have light showing.</span> <span id="s683">You made sure you didn't.</span> <span id="s684">You didn't break any law.</span> <span id="s685">If you didn't break of any of their laws, or any of their rules, they would leave you alone.</span> <span id="s686">If they felt, in the slightest, that you were doing something you shouldn't, the punishment was usually very severe.</span> <span id="s687">And they got more and more rambunctious as time went on, and as, even with their lying reports, they themselves started to feel things weren't going all that well.</span> <span id="s688">So, they got meaner and nastier as time went on.</span> <span id="s689">But they were very disciplined, and what everyone was really scared of was, "What happens when the war is over, and the Japanese are no longer under, the Japanese military are no longer under control, and the population--a good deal of which were street people by now--Chinese, starving--what would they do when there was no law and order?"</span> <span id="s690">So we were worried about that.</span> <span id="s691">We were worried about anti-white feeling, which had always been there, present, and controlled by whatever government there was.</span> <span id="s692">Of course, there was no anti-white feeling from the Japanese initially, because the Germans were their allies.</span> <span id="s693">The Briti--the Italians were their allies.</span> <span id="s694">The Soviets they were scared of.</span> <span id="s695">The White Russians were their allies.</span> <span id="s696">So there wasn't any.</span> <span id="s697">But we said, "What if that changes?"</span> <span id="s698">The first scare we got was when Italy surrendered, and the Italians took the surrender seriously.</span> <span id="s699">They went and scuttled a, an Italian liner that ha- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s700">MS: ...We'll continue at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">WG: They, the Italians, scuttled an Italian liner in the harbor and blocked all traffic as a result.</span> <span id="s702">It took the Japanese about a month or so to right the ship up again and float it out.</span> <span id="s703">The anti--so, they then interned the Savoy Grenadiers, which was an Italian regiment that had been there, and treated them very badly as prisoners of war and traitors, and all that.</span> <span id="s704">But, after the Germans surrendered, after May, '45, we started to get worried, because now those were no longer there to protect us in the sense of being whites that were allies of the Germans.</span> <span id="s705">So, it was down to the Soviets, who they were scared of.</span> <span id="s706">When the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, we really got scared, because the Japanese put out an immediate edict saying, "All Soviet citizens have to register," and there was talk of interning them and we thought, "Now there's no one left to protect us."</span> <span id="s707">But, luckily, the war ended within a week.</span> <span id="s708">So, it didn't matter any more.</span> <span id="s709">And part of this agreement of the cease fire was that the Japanese military maintain control until Allied troops could take over.</span> <span id="s710">And the Japanese were very disciplined and they maintained control.</span> <span id="s711">But now that the Emperor had lost face, people would go up to a Japanese sentry and spit in his face, and he would just stand there and do nothing.</span> <span id="s712">They did maintain public order, but they did it in a very efficient manner, until U.S. and Chinese nationalist troops came in about three or four weeks after the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">MS: Weren't they afraid for their lives at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">WG: Ehhhh, they still had guns.</span> <span id="s715">You know, there's one thing about going and spitting in someone's face.</span> <span id="s716">There's another thing in going and attacking them, when they still were armed.</span> <span id="s717">And they had their arms with them, so, you know, you take it easy.</span> <span id="s718">The, some people, of course, particularly obnoxious ones, disappeared--voluntarily or otherwise, I don't know.</span> <span id="s719">They just were gone.</span> <span id="s720">One of those was a fellow who lived in the Beverly House where we lived, up on the top floor with a White Russian gal.</span> <span id="s721">He was a Korean, who had been very active in the Japanese Secret Police.</span> <span id="s722">Everybody knew.</span> <span id="s723">In fact, in the house he was known as "Our Savior."</span> <span id="s724">Because he lived there, we got more water pressure and a bigger electricity ration than other people did, because he wanted it that way.</span> <span id="s725">So, we always considered him...</span></p> <p><span id="s726">MS: So you benefited.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">WG: We benefited from having him there.</span> <span id="s728">We all knew who he was, and were very polite to him, but, it's an aside story.</span> <span id="s729">Way back when during the war, a child of the German Consul General got sick, the Nazi Consul General.</span> <span id="s730">And their local house doctor had a problem with it and he called my father in as a consultant.</span> <span id="s731">And my father treated the child and it got well, and the Consul General asked him for a bill, and my father said he wouldn't take any money--any Nazi money.</span> <span id="s732">So, the Consul General sent over two bottles of very good Rhine wine as payment.</span> <span id="s733">And my father took them, and he said, I remember distinctly when he got them, he said, "We'll drink the first bottle when the first Allied troops step on German soil.</span> <span id="s734">And we'll drink the second bottle when the war is over."</span> <span id="s735">And when the first troops landed on German soil--we knew about it from the Russian news agency--and we ceremoniously drank the bottle.</span> <span id="s736">And when the war was ending, my father was a pediatrician for the kids of the Swiss Consul, and so he would sometimes get some information that wasn't readily available because the Swiss Consul, of course, had a short-wave radio.</span> <span id="s737">And he came, my father came back and he says, "You know, the war is over.</span> <span id="s738">It's really over!"</span> <span id="s739">You know, rumors had been flying around, but we said, "Yes?"</span> <span id="s740">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s741">The Swiss Consul told him not to tell anyone.</span> <span id="s742">But, the war was over, so he got out the bottle of, the second bottle of Rhine wine, and we were sitting in our room in this brothel, drinking our bottle of Rhine wine, when there was a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s743">And who was there but "Our Savior," this Korean Secret Policeman.</span> <span id="s744">And he said, "Ah, you know, war is over."</span> <span id="s745">And we just said--you know, we were scared, because, is this a trap, or--so we said, "Oh, war is over?</span> <span id="s746">Ah, we know nothing."</span> <span id="s747">And he said, "Yes, the war is over.</span> <span id="s748">Japanese have lost."</span> <span id="s749">And we said, "Oh?</span> <span id="s750">Japanese have lost?"</span> <span id="s751">And he says, "Yes, please remember, I am Korean.</span> <span id="s752">I am very happy Japanese are lost.</span> <span id="s753">Are you happy Japanese are lost?"</span> <span id="s754">And we said, "Oh, eh, we are always, you know, we're, eh, eh--"What do you answer, you know.</span> <span id="s755">So we stood there, sat there rather, and he said, "Remember, I am Korean."</span> <span id="s756">We said, "Yes, yes, you are Korean.</span> <span id="s757">We know you are Korean.</span> <span id="s758">Yes."</span> <span id="s759">"Koreans do not like Japanese."</span> <span id="s760">We said, "Oh, we did not know that, but thank you for telling us."</span> <span id="s761">And he says, "Yes, you remember that."</span> <span id="s762">And he went away.</span> <span id="s763">And he was obviously building...</span></p> <p><span id="s764">MS: Good will.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">WG: Good will.</span> <span id="s766">We never saw him again.</span> <span id="s767">I don't know whether he moved out, whether somebody got to him.</span> <span id="s768">Because he certainly, being in the Kampatai [phonetic], in the Secret Police, nobody, he must have had plenty of enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">MS: Do you have any idea what happened to his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">WG: His wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">MS: Oh, oh, he...</span></p> <p><span id="s772">WG: It wasn't a wife, it was just a, he was shacked up with this Russian gal.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">MS: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s774">Oh, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">WG: And that was Verichke.</span> <span id="s776">And Verichke stayed in the business.</span> <span id="s777">Other people moved in, moved out.</span> <span id="s778">After the American forces came, she made out very well, and she had a side line.</span> <span id="s779">She would also roll the guys.</span> <span id="s780">You know, give them a Mickey Finn and roll them.</span> <span id="s781">And sometimes she overdid it, and we'd get a knock on the door, and Verichke would come and say, "Doctor, doctor, my friend, I think he is dead!"</span> <span id="s782">And my father would go upstairs and give him a shot of something and call the shore patrol and say, "Get this guy out," you know, all right.</span> <span id="s783">Because she'd overdid it a bit and she couldn't wake him.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">MS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s785">WG: [laughing] But that's part of the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">MS: Added a lot of color to your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">WG: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s788">And, actually, it was very helpful living in this place.</span> <span id="s789">I didn't know it until quite well after the war.</span> <span id="s790">After the war, my sister had gotten a job for the U.S. forces as a secretary, and before you know it she met a nice Jewish boy from Baltimore there, and they got engaged, and they got married, and she left as a war bride to the U.S. And once she was there, of course, she sent an affidavit for me to come over too.</span> <span id="s791">And I was going to go to the States.</span> <span id="s792">And, of course, I needed a passport of some kind.</span> <span id="s793">And I didn't, I had no nationality.</span> <span id="s794">I was stateless.</span> <span id="s795">So I had to have something to have a visa put in.</span> <span id="s796">So I went to the U.N. By this time, this was after the war, the U.N. office was open, and I went in to apply for document identification in lieu of passport--which usually took months to get because, the U.N. being a bureaucracy, you had to go through this and this and this and this.</span> <span id="s797">It so happened that I walked into this office and who sits there behind a desk but the fellow who is shacked up with Rachel Manasseh in the Beverly House?</span> <span id="s798">Now Rachel Manasseh was a Sephardic girl who had gotten married, lived on the polite floor--in the middle floor--with her husband, who was an Austrian Jew, Ernest J. Schwartz.</span> <span id="s799">But Ernest J. Schwartz was a little cuckoo and he decided to become a Buddhist monk.</span> <span id="s800">So he left her and became a Buddhist monk.</span> <span id="s801">And Rachel went back into the business.</span> <span id="s802">And she had friends who would come and stay for a month, or two, or three.</span> <span id="s803">And after the war this very nice looking English gentleman moved in with Rachel.</span> <span id="s804">And I didn't know who he was.</span> <span id="s805">I knew, you know, he was the one who is living with Rachel right now.</span> <span id="s806">And here I come to the U.N. office, and there is this guy who I found out was Thomas Pincope.</span> <span id="s807">And Thomas Pincope was in charge of issuing these identification documents that you needed in order to come.</span> <span id="s808">And behind his desk was his credenza, and on his credenza was a picture of his wife and his kiddies, in England.</span> <span id="s809">And so he looks at me.</span> <span id="s810">I look at him.</span> <span id="s811">We both look down at the floor.</span> <span id="s812">You know, I try very hard not to burst out laughing.</span> <span id="s813">He, God knows what he says.</span> <span id="s814">All I know is, he wanted me out of there so fast.</span> <span id="s815">[laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s816">MS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s817">WG: And he said, "Yes?</span> <span id="s818">The name?</span> <span id="s819">And what do you want?</span> <span id="s820">You want an, oh, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s821">Yeah, right here.</span> <span id="s822">We have the form.</span> <span id="s823">And your address?"</span> <span id="s824">And I felt like saying, "The address!</span> <span id="s825">You know the address!"</span> <span id="s826">But I told him the address, and he wrote the address down.</span> <span id="s827">And he stamped it, and he walked it through the thing, and I was out of there in about 20 minutes with my vis--with everything, well, not my visa, but, all the U.N. documents perfectly in order.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">MS: Fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">WG: And I was never so happy about Rachel Manasseh and her friends as I was at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">MS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s831">WG: But, it was nice.</span> <span id="s832">And that's how I found out what his name was, because, you know, I had ignored him.</span> <span id="s833">You know, he was just the guy shacked up with Rachel.</span> <span id="s834">What do I care?</span> <span id="s835">But it was Thomas Pincope, a name that I will never forget.</span> <span id="s836">And there he was, nice and proper with his wife and kiddies behind him, and Rachel waiting for him in the Beverly House.</span> <span id="s837">But, I got my papers, and I left, in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">MS: Well let me ask you...</span></p> <p><span id="s839">WG: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">MS: Two questions.</span> <span id="s841">How about your college education...</span></p> <p><span id="s842">WG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">MS: â€¦ when you went to Aurora?</span> <span id="s844">Did you complete a year, or two years, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">WG: Well, I started out, as I said, collegewise, at the Lester Institute--did one year there.</span> <span id="s846">And that was closed down, wiped out.</span> <span id="s847">And then I went to East Asia Tech.</span> <span id="s848">I went there for a year and got expelled.</span> <span id="s849">Now, officially, I had flunked out.</span> <span id="s850">Why did I flunk out?</span> <span id="s851">Well, there was a course in Japanese that was made compulsory when the Japanese took over and made it the East Asia Technical Institute.</span> <span id="s852">And all the students in the course decided to boycott learning Japanese, as a resistance measure.</span> <span id="s853">So we would sit there, never take a note, sit--the whole class--but sit with their arms folded, and whenever we were asked a question, we would say, "Mi no wi so ti mash ta" [phonetic], "I have forgotten everything."</span> <span id="s854">And the teacher, the professor, was irked, but didn't quite know what to do about it.</span> <span id="s855">And then he announced that we would have an exam at the end of the year, and the exam would be to write an essay, in Japanese, on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperities Field, which was the big Japanese dream of owning all of Eastern Asia.</span> <span id="s856">And we all sat around, all the students sat around and we said, "What do we do?</span> <span id="s857">If we refuse to write this, that's a political offense."</span> <span id="s858">And none of us had guts enough to do that, because a political offense, you were in deep trouble.</span> <span id="s859">So we decided we'd write the essay, but we wouldn't write it in Japanese.</span> <span id="s860">We'd write it in whatever, English, French, Chinese, whatever.</span> <span id="s861">But, three-quarters of the class were Chinese.</span> <span id="s862">They would write in Chinese and the rest of us would write in whatever language we felt most comfortable in.</span> <span id="s863">So we did.</span> <span id="s864">Well, the exam came, the blue books were handed out, we wrote our essays, we handed them in.</span> <span id="s865">As it turned out, every--all the Chinese got a passing grade.</span> <span id="s866">All the non-Chinese got a failing grade.</span> <span id="s867">And the school was such that if you failed a course, you were out.</span> <span id="s868">So all the whites were out.</span> <span id="s869">Of course simultaneously they also sacked all the white faculty.</span> <span id="s870">And here I got my report card and it said, you know, "Expelled, Academic Insufficiency," which does not look good on one's record.</span> <span id="s871">So we went to the Vice Principal, or Vice Dean or whatever you call him, a Portuguese, and we said--who had just gotten fired--"These look terrible.</span> <span id="s872">Can't you do something?"</span> <span id="s873">He said, "Sure.</span> <span id="s874">He gave us new report cards, with the official stamp, with the course "Japanese" just not on as a course.</span> <span id="s875">And of course all the other grades were O.K. And then, instead of "Expelled, Academic Insufficiency," he put down, "Withdrew."</span> <span id="s876">And that was a nicer looking record.</span> <span id="s877">So with that I went to Aurora University and wanted to transfer.</span> <span id="s878">And they said they don't accept transfer students, but I, if I could pass the entrance exam, they'd be happy to take me as a freshman again.</span> <span id="s879">Having had two years, I thought, eh, but, what else could you do?</span> <span id="s880">The only other university was one that had, was one that was run by missionaries--had been run by missionaries--was run along "American College Lines," which everyone felt was academically horrendously inferior.</span> <span id="s881">And you didn't go there unless you couldn't get into the Aurora.</span> <span id="s882">It was St. John's University, where people who couldn't get in, like W. Michael Blumenthal, he went to St. John's because he couldn't make it into Aurora.</span> <span id="s883">But--and other such people.</span> <span id="s884">Aurora was far superior academically--it was at least considered such.</span> <span id="s885">So, I thought, "Well, I'll try for the Aurora."</span> <span id="s886">I studied French like crazy for a summer, took the entrance exam, passed, and started in as a freshman again.</span> <span id="s887">That was in '44.</span> <span id="s888">I went through three years and then I had this opportunity because in '47, my sister had gotten married in '46, and I had the opportunity to get to the States, so I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s889">And I went to the Father Chancellor and I said I wanted a transcript, I wanted to transfer to--and he said, "Where are you going?</span> <span id="s890">Are you going to France?"</span> <span id="s891">And I said, "No, I'm going to the U.S." He said, "Oh, you'll never get into a college in the U.S. with these grades that you have here at the Aurora.</span> <span id="s892">Let me see what I can do, because," he said, "Americans like high grades."</span> <span id="s893">I thought I had pretty good grades.</span> <span id="s894">I was second in my class in the freshman year and first in the sophomore and junior years.</span> <span id="s895">You know, I thought I was pretty hot stuff.</span> <span id="s896">He says, "Yes, but the numbers look bad to Americans."</span> <span id="s897">And he took a blank report transcript form and he took my actual transcript form.</span> <span id="s898">He says, "Look at this here.</span> <span id="s899">Chemistry.</span> <span id="s900">You had a 73.</span> <span id="s901">Ooh, that's good.</span> <span id="s902">Let's make that a 93."</span></p> <p><span id="s903">MS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s904">WG: And here he said, "Here you had a 68.</span> <span id="s905">Oh, we'll make that an 86."</span> <span id="s906">You know, and he went through, and, because their grading system was very tough.</span> <span id="s907">And despite the fact that I had the highest grade in the class, my average was something like maybe 69 or 70.</span> <span id="s908">So, he changed all that.</span> <span id="s909">And he says, "Now, don't you dare apply to a French University with this!</span> <span id="s910">Because they would think you were a second Einstein."</span></p> <p><span id="s911">MS: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s912">WG: No one in a French University gets grades like that.</span> <span id="s913">He says, "But only for American colleges."</span> <span id="s914">I said, "Yes, only American colleges."</span> <span id="s915">"If you apply to French college, use this one," you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">MS: Use the original.</span> <span id="s917">[laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s918">WG: [laughing] So I have two transcripts, quite different.</span> <span id="s919">But, he knew what the score was, and he didn't see why I should be hamstrung because Americans like high numbers.</span> <span id="s920">So, I then applied to 27 universities in the U.S., and got admitted at two of them, because this was right when the G.I. Bill was in.</span> <span id="s921">And they all said, "Thank you very much, but, try again in three or four years."</span> <span id="s922">They just would not accept foreign students.</span> <span id="s923">The only two that were willing to accept were Syracuse and the University of Tennessee.</span> <span id="s924">And I'd read enough to know that Syracuse was a better choice.</span> <span id="s925">So I went to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s926">But, there I was shocked at the low standard of American university education relative to the Jesuit university.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">MS: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">WG: Very, very different.</span> <span id="s929">It, unfortunately, they looked at my transcript and said, "Oh yes, we can give you transfer credit.</span> <span id="s930">They'll give you credit for your courses in Philosophy and French Literature, in Metaphysics, in Ethics, in Mathematics, all this, yes.</span> <span id="s931">But, what is this Industrial Chemistry?</span> <span id="s932">Well, you'd better take Chemical Engineering from scratch."</span> <span id="s933">So, effectively, I got a lot of transfer credits and I had to take three more years at Syracuse before I got a Bachelors.</span> <span id="s934">So I ended up with a grand total of eight undergraduate years, which, if someone had told me that when I graduated high school, I probably would have committed suicide on the spot--that I'd have to go to undergraduate school for eight years.</span> <span id="s935">But, what the heck, you know.</span> <span id="s936">As it was, I was lucky, because very few people of my age got through the war without military service, without any real physical danger, certainly I'm tremendously lucky relative to my cohort that stayed in Europe, or, even in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">MS: Can I just ask you a few questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">WG: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">MS: About your relatives...</span></p> <p><span id="s940">WG: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">MS: That were living in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">WG: Yes.</span> <span id="s943">Well, aside from numerous cousins of my parents, more direct relatives, my mother's sister and her husband were sent to Auschwitz, where my uncle had been a linguist.</span> <span id="s944">He was a teacher of Slavic languages.</span> <span id="s945">And so the Germans put him in the office at Auschwitz to maintain records and the like and keep books--where he wrote himself and his wife off as dead.</span> <span id="s946">And he and his wife lived underground in Auschwitz, as illegal.</span> <span id="s947">They couldn't get out, but they officially weren't there.</span> <span id="s948">Until the Russians approached and the Germans evacuated everybody--put all the men on the train, my uncle was on a train going to Czechoslovakia; my aunt was put on the train to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s949">She went to Bergen-Belsen, was liberated by the British and sent to Sweden.</span> <span id="s950">And in fact still lives in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s951">And we're going over to visit her again this August for her 90th birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">MS: Ah!</span> <span id="s953">Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">WG: I just talked to her last week on the phone, and she said, "Yes, be sure you bring your wife and children."</span> <span id="s955">"Well, my children, I, you know, they're grown men.</span> <span id="s956">I don't know if they have vacation or if they can make it, but my wife and I will come."</span> <span id="s957">My uncle was sent to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s958">His train was stuck on a siding.</span> <span id="s959">It got stuck there.</span> <span id="s960">It was found by U.S. troops on the day after VE-Day.</span> <span id="s961">They opened it up.</span> <span id="s962">There were still some people alive in it, but my uncle was not among them, and he is buried in Czechoslovakia, where this train was stuck.</span> <span id="s963">My father's oldest brother and his wife were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s964">Their daughter got out on a children's transport to England, where the British naturally interned her as an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s965">But she got out and joined the British army and survived the war, and she has since passed away, but she survived.</span> <span id="s966">Her parents did not.</span> <span id="s967">My father's middle brother, he had, he had been married to a convert.</span> <span id="s968">He married a Christian gal that converted to Judaism, and when they were told that--she was told that she must file for divorce so that this marriage could be broken up, she refused.</span> <span id="s969">And both of them were arrested, but not sent to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s970">They were arrested before that, they had concentra--eh, an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s971">They were both sent to Organisation Todt, which was the labor bureau, forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">MS: What is that name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">WG: Organisation Todt.</span> <span id="s974">It was run by this gentleman by the name of Todt, and they were sent to separate labor camps.</span> <span id="s975">And all through the war, Himmler, who ran, through the S.S., ran the extermination camps, never had access to Jews who were in a forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s976">So, my uncle and my aunt both survived the war, and got together again after the war, in Berlin, where they have since both passed away.</span> <span id="s977">But, they, my uncle spent the war years building railroads and my aunt spent the war years loading artillery shells.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">MS: And they remained in Berlin after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">WG: They remained in Berlin after the war and they passed away in the late '50's.</span> <span id="s980">But, other than that, cousins, numerous cousins just disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">MS: Perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">WG: Perished.</span> <span id="s983">Some that had gotten out, some to Israel, some to Shanghai, they survived of course.</span> <span id="s984">Several that went to Holland did not.</span> <span id="s985">They did not get to Israel and they did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">MS: Tell me about your parents.</span> <span id="s987">How, what happened to them?</span> <span id="s988">Did they come to the United States as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s989">WG: They eventually came.</span> <span id="s990">See, I was born in Berlin, so I was German quota.</span> <span id="s991">And right after the war German quota was quite available because Germans were not admitted.</span> <span id="s992">If you had a German passport you could not come to the U.S. because you were still an enemy until the peace treaty was signed many years later.</span> <span id="s993">So that there was a window of opportunity, I came in as a German quota, non-German.</span> <span id="s994">The part of Germany where my father was born was given to Poland after WWI, and when the U.S. immigration laws were set, they were set so that he became Polish quota, because it depended on where, what nationality--not what nationality you were, but what country owned the place where you were born.</span> <span id="s995">And as, when the U.S. law came in, that was part of Poland, he was Polish quota.</span> <span id="s996">And Polish quota was not worked after WWII, because Poland was considered Communist.</span> <span id="s997">So no one from the Polish quota could come in.</span> <span id="s998">So my parents couldn't come to the U.S. when I came.</span> <span id="s999">However, my sister was a war bride, and when she became a citizen in 1949--it took just three years for a war bride to become a citizen--then, they could come as parents' preference, because they were parents of an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1000">And they came in '49, when my sister became a citizen.</span> <span id="s1001">My aunt and grandmother remained in Shanghai till after the Communists took over Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1002">Then they expelled all the whites--the Chinese Communists did--and they didn't have a visa to get to the States.</span> <span id="s1003">They couldn't come, so the U.N. sent them back to a refugee camp, a D.P. camp in Europe, until my father could bring them over and could send for them.</span> <span id="s1004">He got a job here in a hospital in Maryland.</span> <span id="s1005">He got a job and brought my aunt and my grandmother over.</span> <span id="s1006">My uncle and my grandfather both had died in Shanghai and were buried in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1007">When we went back, I tried to look up their graves, but during the cultural revolution all cemeteries were destroyed.</span> <span id="s1008">So there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">MS: No evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">WG: There is no evidence there at all.</span> <span id="s1011">They are now, I understand, trying to resurrect come of the cemeteries or, I don't know what they're doing.</span> <span id="s1012">But I went to the Sephardic cemetery and the British Christian cemetery.</span> <span id="s1013">They'd all disappeared during the cultural revolution and built over.</span> <span id="s1014">They're gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">MS: So how did your parents acclimate themselves to life in the United States?</span> <span id="s1016">I'm sure you did very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">WG: Well, I came here and went to school, you know, and finally got a degree, got another degree and another degree.</span> <span id="s1018">Went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">MS: What type of work do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">WG: I was a chemical engineer and, if they hadn't thrown me out, I would probably still be in school, because I enjoy the academic life a lot.</span> <span id="s1021">But when they took my fellowship away and said, you know, "You've had it long enough.</span> <span id="s1022">It's time you wrote up your thesis and got your degree and got out of here."</span> <span id="s1023">"No, you can't do that!"</span> <span id="s1024">They said, "Yes, we sure can."</span> <span id="s1025">So I left, and got, went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">MS: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">WG: But, yeah, you know what, the eight years of undergraduate life made me really enjoy academic life, so I added on six more in graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">MS: Perpetual student.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">WG: I, I would easily have been a perpetual student if it weren't for this eating business.</span> <span id="s1030">You like to [chuckling], also by that time I was married and had a kid, and, you know, so, you have to go to work some time.</span> <span id="s1031">So I went to work.</span> <span id="s1032">But, that wasn't till 1956.</span> <span id="s1033">But my father, he got a job.</span> <span id="s1034">See, the AMA, American Medical Association, has peculiar rules, that you can't practice medicine without a license, and they make it very difficult to get one, except for the fact that you, they find that no one who has a license wants to work in state hospitals, because they don't pay anything.</span> <span id="s1035">So there is, or was, I don't know if it still is--at least there was in the '50's when my parents came here--a rule that you didn't need a legal license to practice medicine in a state hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">MS: Well how would a pediatrician fit into this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">WG: My father got a job at the Cranswell State Hospital for the Colored Insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">MS: Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">WG: Which is not one of their prime appointments that AMA licensed physicians like to take.</span> <span id="s1040">In fact, the entire staff was made up of Jewish refugees who had come over at--my father, he came over in 1949.</span> <span id="s1041">He was 58 years old and going to med school was not what he had in mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">MS: This is tape three, side one of a continuing interview with Mr. Werner Glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">WG: And my father's first job then was for the Cranswell State Hospital for the Colored Insane, which was a segregated institution in Maryland.</span> <span id="s1045">It was also the most northernly segregated insane asylum and as such had won an award from the NAACP as the best colored insane asylum in the country, probably helped by the fact that the staff was all European Jews who did not share quite as many of the prejudices that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">MS: The American doctors did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">WG: The American doctors possessed at that time at least.</span> <span id="s1048">So, my father worked there for a few years and then he went on to another state hospital.</span> <span id="s1049">He ended up working at the federal hospital.</span> <span id="s1050">He got his federal license to practice medicine legally in federal territory.</span> <span id="s1051">So he went to work for what was known as the Children's Center, which is really the Children's Hospital for the District of Columbia, a public hospital, a mental hospital, but for children, mentally disturbed children and low IQ adults, child IQ adults.</span> <span id="s1052">It's like in Laurel, it is in Laurel, Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">MS: Yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">WG: It's called the District Training School officially, but it's a Children's Center.</span> <span id="s1055">He worked there till they forced him to retire.</span> <span id="s1056">When he was 70 they threw him out, much to his dismay, as he enjoyed his work tremendously.</span> <span id="s1057">In fact, the one thing my father would never do is do anything except do his medicine.</span> <span id="s1058">My mother used to be after him in Shanghai, "Take a day off!</span> <span id="s1059">Take a day off!"</span> <span id="s1060">And he finally said, "O.K. He'll take Sunday's off."</span> <span id="s1061">Sunday's he'd go work at the polyclinic, where he wasn't getting paid.</span> <span id="s1062">It was charity work, so it wasn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">MS: [Chuckling.]</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">WG: But, that was his life.</span> <span id="s1065">He just didn't want to do anything except treat sick children.</span> <span id="s1066">That was what he wanted to do and that's what he did.</span> <span id="s1067">But, he enjoyed it, and he was good at it.</span> <span id="s1068">He liked it.</span> <span id="s1069">He did it all his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">MS: Is he still...</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">WG: No, no, he passed away in '68.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">MS: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">WG: She passed away in '76.</span> <span id="s1074">Yeah, they, when they forced him to retire, they moved down to Florida like many people do.</span> <span id="s1075">And then he spent the rest of his time in the hospital--because he was proud of the fact that from the time he left high school till the time they forced him to retire, he'd never spent a day in bed, he'd never run a fever.</span> <span id="s1076">He had no time to get sick.</span> <span id="s1077">He was busy.</span> <span id="s1078">As soon as they retired him, he fell apart.</span> <span id="s1079">As he said, "It's one way I can stay in a hospital."</span> <span id="s1080">He spent a lot of time in the hospitals and eventually he passed away.</span> <span id="s1081">But, he got to know the hospital in Hollywood real well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">MS: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">WG: And sometimes he thought he was on the staff there rather than a patient I think.</span> <span id="s1084">[both laugh] And, he--he was a very cheerful person and a very easygoing guy.</span> <span id="s1085">My mother was not that way at all.</span> <span id="s1086">She was not that easy to get along with and not very easy to deal with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">MS: I would imagine that experience had to have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">WG: She, but she was hardheaded, and if it weren't for her, we would have been in Holland, and I would never be sitting here making tapes.</span> <span id="s1089">Because she...</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">MS: She had a lot of foresight.</span> <span id="s1091">She had tremendous foresight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">WG: If it hadn't been for her, my father would never have gotten his license here either.</span> <span id="s1093">Because back when, during the cold war, when the U.S. was trying to line up Germany and push Germany ahead, one of the things that the federal government gave as a sop to the German government was recognition of medical, German medical degrees.</span> <span id="s1094">Because it really rankled the German Federal Republic that someone who had an M.D. from the University of Berlin, or Heidelberg or what not, was not recognized as an M.D. in the U.S.</span> <span id="s1095">So the federal government made a treaty that on all federal territory, a German M.D. was recognized.</span> <span id="s1096">And when my father found out about this, he said, "Oh great."</span> <span id="s1097">And he got a form from the District of Columbia to apply for this from the federal government.</span> <span id="s1098">He filled out the form and he sent it in.</span> <span id="s1099">And he said, "O.K. where's my degree?"</span> <span id="s1100">You know, "Where's my license?"</span> <span id="s1101">And they said, "Oh well, we haven't gotten around to it.</span> <span id="s1102">We, you know, there are delays."</span> <span id="s1103">And my mother said, who was much more practical, "Somebody wants to get paid off."</span> <span id="s1104">He said, "How can you say a thing like this?</span> <span id="s1105">This is America."</span> <span id="s1106">Well, mother says, "A bureaucrat is a bureaucrat.</span> <span id="s1107">Find out what you're supposed to do."</span> <span id="s1108">So my father said, "Ah, I'm not gonna do that."</span> <span id="s1109">So she did.</span> <span id="s1110">She called up and says, "How can I expedite it?"</span> <span id="s1111">And they said, "Well, we have found that people who used such and such a law firm, they handle it very well.</span> <span id="s1112">Why don't you go there?"</span> <span id="s1113">So, my parents went there and the fellow says, "Oh yes, yes, we've handled cases like that.</span> <span id="s1114">It's $2,000."</span> <span id="s1115">My father says, "What for?</span> <span id="s1116">I filled out the form already."</span> <span id="s1117">My mother says, "Be quiet, George.</span> <span id="s1118">[laying his hand down on the table] It's $2,000."</span> <span id="s1119">So, they said, "O.K., here's the $2,000.</span> <span id="s1120">When do I get my license?"</span> <span id="s1121">"Well, it'll take a week or so."</span> <span id="s1122">Unfortunately, this was just before the election of '52, when the administration changed from the Democrat to Republican.</span> <span id="s1123">The lawyer calls up and says they can't handle the case.</span> <span id="s1124">Now there's a Republican administration.</span> <span id="s1125">But, they recommend this other law firm who can handle the case.</span> <span id="s1126">So my father says, "What about my $2,000?"</span> <span id="s1127">They said, "Don't worry, we'll transfer the fee."</span> <span id="s1128">They transferred the fee and in a few weeks my father had his license.</span> <span id="s1129">So,...</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">MS: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">WG: Which allowed him to practice and get a job with the District Training Commission, which was at the District Training School, which was a much better job than the ones he had with the State of Maryland and the State of New York.</span> <span id="s1132">And it was a, and it had some minor pension rights with it, and it had a legitimate, not a temporary assignment.</span> <span id="s1133">All the others in all the State hospitals were temporary assignments, so that you had no benefits, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">MS: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">WG: But this was a legitimate job.</span> <span id="s1136">And if it hadn't been for my mother, pushing, and saying, you know, being reasonable and practical, it would never have happened.</span> <span id="s1137">But it happened.</span> <span id="s1138">And at--I'm saying you know, if it hadn't been for her, although she was a difficult person, strong willed--as is my aunt, her sister--the two of them hated each other's guts.</span> <span id="s1139">Would you believe they did not speak to each other from 1933 on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">MS: Her sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">WG: Her own sister.</span> <span id="s1142">Neither of them would speak to each other.</span> <span id="s1143">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">MS: Until what happened?</span> <span id="s1145">What brought them together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">WG: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1147">Noth--in fact, my sister, who lives down in Florida, sent a picture to my aunt of herself and her husband, taken in their home.</span> <span id="s1148">And she wrote in the letter that if you notice the plate on the wall used to be my mother's.</span> <span id="s1149">That was one of those plates with some German saying on it.</span> <span id="s1150">My aunt sent the picture back, with the plate x'ed out, from Sweden, saying, "I don'tâ€¦"--my mother had been dead since 1976, this happened about two years ago--"I don't want to have anything about Anna in my house."</span> <span id="s1151">They hated each other's guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">MS: How sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">WG: You know?</span> <span id="s1154">I don't know what, you know, I know why.</span> <span id="s1155">They are very, very similar.</span> <span id="s1156">My wife made the mistake when my aunt came over here once to visit, and she laughed at something or other, and my wife says, "You know, when you laugh you sound just like my mother-in-law did."</span> <span id="s1157">Oh!</span> <span id="s1158">Did my aunt blow up!</span> <span id="s1159">"I am not at all like her!"</span> <span id="s1160">She's exactly like her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">MS: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">WG: They're both very hardheaded, very obnoxious, difficult to get along with people.</span> <span id="s1163">But, survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">MS: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s1165">Indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">WG: Great survivors.</span> <span id="s1167">But, this isn't exactly a Holocaust, but like, my mother was one of the first Women's Libbers in the world.</span> <span id="s1168">I'm convinced of it.</span> <span id="s1169">When she was growing up, like all nice upper middle class German girls, Jewish girls, she was sent to Switzerland, to finishing school.</span> <span id="s1170">So she got finished, and she came back, and she was not supposed to sit around and wait to get married.</span> <span id="s1171">And she said she wanted to get a job.</span> <span id="s1172">Her father said, "No daughter of mine is getting a job.</span> <span id="s1173">Why don't you go out and meet people?"</span> <span id="s1174">So she went out to meet people, and what she did was, she went to secretarial school.</span> <span id="s1175">She learned shorthand and typing, then when she got her certificate said now she's gonna get a job.</span> <span id="s1176">And my grandfather said, "No way!"</span> <span id="s1177">And she, finally, after much urging, he said, "O.K., you can come work for me."</span> <span id="s1178">He had an office, with people working.</span> <span id="s1179">And so she worked.</span> <span id="s1180">At the end of the first week everybody gets their pay envelopes.</span> <span id="s1181">My mother says, "Where is my pay envelope?"</span> <span id="s1182">"What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1183">You're my daughter.</span> <span id="s1184">I don't pay you."</span> <span id="s1185">She says, "Oh yes, you do.</span> <span id="s1186">I'm working here.</span> <span id="s1187">I want to get paid."</span> <span id="s1188">"No, don't be silly.</span> <span id="s1189">You're my daughter.</span> <span id="s1190">I don't have to pay you."</span> <span id="s1191">So she says, "O.K., I'll take the customer list and go to the competition."</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">MS: [both laugh]</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">WG: After that, "I'll pay you."</span> <span id="s1194">So she got paid.</span> <span id="s1195">But he was the same kind of person she was, obnoxious as they come.</span> <span id="s1196">In due course my mother got to be 65 down in Florida.</span> <span id="s1197">She realized she had worked for several years in Germany.</span> <span id="s1198">She's entitled to German Social Security.</span> <span id="s1199">Because they had Social Security back in those days.</span> <span id="s1200">So she wrote to the German Consulate, gave details, her father's name and company name and address and dates and all that.</span> <span id="s1201">The German government sent her a photostat of the records of the withholding tax, the Social Security tax, that my father-in-law, no, my grandfather, had sent in.</span> <span id="s1202">Her name wasn't on it.</span> <span id="s1203">He never sent, he never put her down on the rolls.</span> <span id="s1204">He kept the tax.</span> <span id="s1205">He withdrew it from her envelope, but he kept it.</span> <span id="s1206">He wouldn't admit on paper that his daughter was working for him.</span> <span id="s1207">So she--they said, "We have no records.</span> <span id="s1208">You don't get it."</span> <span id="s1209">So he was the same...</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">MS: [laughs] Strong-headed individual that she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">WG: Oh!</span> <span id="s1212">I tell you.</span> <span id="s1213">I knew him.</span> <span id="s1214">He was in, he came to Shanghai in '38, and he died in '44.</span> <span id="s1215">So I knew him quite a few years.</span> <span id="s1216">And he was a bullheaded man.</span> <span id="s1217">And I remember him.</span> <span id="s1218">He used to chain smoke cigars.</span> <span id="s1219">And I mean literally, light one from the butt of the other.</span> <span id="s1220">And in due course he developed larynx cancer.</span> <span id="s1221">And he was in the ghetto, and they had no x-ray tr--the only treatment they had was x-ray treatment--and they did not have the x-ray.</span> <span id="s1222">And my father tried to get him a pass to come out to the Settlement, out to the French Concession where they had adequate x-ray facilities, but he couldn't get it.</span> <span id="s1223">They wouldn't give him a pass for a medical treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">MS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">WG: Well he probably might have died of it anyway, but as a result he went very fast, because there was no treatment at all.</span> <span id="s1226">Yeah, he died in '44.</span> <span id="s1227">But, as I said, I wanted to go visit his grave, but it's gone.</span> <span id="s1228">Maybe they, they'll find what happened, or where it was or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">MS: Yeah, there is that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">WG: The Sino-Judaic...</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">MS: â€¦ chance yeah, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">WG: Institute is there, which they have established in Shanghai now, is trying--I get their

id="s1268">MS: What was that again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">WG: B'rith Trumpeldor.</span> <span id="s1270">The--Assembly of, named in honor of Trumpeldor, who was the founder of Betar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">MS: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">WG: They were reasonably active, but not overwhelm, most people did not belong to it.</span> <span id="s1273">In fact, there was considerable opposition to them, because they ran around in brown uniforms.</span> <span id="s1274">You know, they had the Trumpeldor uniforms.</span> <span id="s1275">And people referred to them in those times, they are just like fascists.</span> <span id="s1276">Well, they obviously weren't just like fascists, but the concept of these guys, running around being tough...</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">WG: Was something [he says "quote"] "un-Jewish", if you will.</span> <span id="s1279">That was not the case of the Jewish Company.</span> <span id="s1280">There was a company of Jewish volunteers, as part of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.</span> <span id="s1281">It was probably the only outfit in the world, officially under a Jewish flag, after World War I and before World War II.</span> <span id="s1282">During World War I there was the Jewish Zion Mule Corps in Palestine that General Allenby had [unclear], but, that was disbanded after World War I. And then the Haganah, of course, was illegal.</span> <span id="s1283">But the Shanghai Volunteer Corps had a Jewish Company that marched under the Magen David.</span> <span id="s1284">They never did anything except have parades, just like there was the Russian Regiment, which the Japanese then used for crowd control and light police duties.</span> <span id="s1285">There was the American Machine Gun Company, the Americans had machine guns.</span> <span id="s1286">These were not army people.</span> <span id="s1287">These were not U.S. forces.</span> <span id="s1288">They are, they were Shanghai residents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">MS: Civilian groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">WG: Civilian groups who played soldier.</span> <span id="s1291">[chuckles] As far as I know, all they did is have parades.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">MS: What else was there to do?</span> <span id="s1293">What else?</span> <span id="s1294">[chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">WG: What else were they gonna do, you know?</span> <span id="s1296">I mean, there were real soldiers there.</span> <span id="s1297">There were real U.S. Marines.</span> <span id="s1298">There were real Welsh Fusiliers.</span> <span id="s1299">There were real Savoy Grenadiers.</span> <span id="s1300">But the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the SVC, they had parades.</span> <span id="s1301">And one of the units was the Jewish Company.</span> <span id="s1302">They had a Jewish Company.</span> <span id="s1303">Actually I think it was Italian.</span> <span id="s1304">I think it was three companies.</span> <span id="s1305">I think it was the Jewish Battalion.</span> <span id="s1306">It was the Russian Regiment and it was the Jewish Battalion.</span> <span id="s1307">I was too young.</span> <span id="s1308">Of course, the Japanese disbanded all of, everything except the Russian Regiment.</span> <span id="s1309">The rest of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps disappeared into the night very quickly when the Japanese took over after Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s1310">I was only 14, but I was looking forward to the day when I would join the SVC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">WG: That was a big deal, you know, run around with a uniform, playing with a rifle and all this sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s1313">A young boy, well, they just think that's heaven.</span> <span id="s1314">But, I never made it.</span> <span id="s1315">And it was not resurrected after World War II, when I would have been old enough.</span> <span id="s1316">But 14-year-olds were not in demand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">MS: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">WG: But, we looked up to these guys, you know.</span> <span id="s1319">I was just in the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s1320">But these guys were real hot shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">WG: Jewish, yeah, it was the Jewish Battalion.</span> <span id="s1323">I think they had two companies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">MS: But no war to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">WG: Who they gonna fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">MS: [both laugh]</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">WG: They weren't gonna take on the Japanese army.</span> <span id="s1328">And they certainly weren't gonna take on, you know--but they were there.</span> <span id="s1329">And they had parades.</span> <span id="s1330">Yes, the big parade was always on May 24th, which was Empire Day.</span> <span id="s1331">The Boy Scouts got to march too.</span> <span id="s1332">We got to march.</span> <span id="s1333">It was fun.</span> <span id="s1334">A good start off, we'd go to the Anglican Cathedral for a worship service.</span> <span id="s1335">And the Jewish Troop would go.</span> <span id="s1336">The Catholic Troop would not go.</span> <span id="s1337">There was a Catholic Troop and they would not go into an Anglican Cathedral.</span> <span id="s1338">The Jewish Troop would go.</span> <span id="s1339">Eh, why not?</span> <span id="s1340">You know, what are they gonna do to us?</span> <span id="s1341">But the Catholic Troop would not go.</span> <span id="s1342">And, after the service, we'd march up and down the street, you know, on the parade ground, from the, we'd march from the church to the parade ground, the race track.</span> <span id="s1343">Shanghai was probably the only town in the world, major city in the world, that had a race track downtown.</span> <span id="s1344">The town had simply grown up around it.</span> <span id="s1345">And it had a horse racing track downtown.</span> <span id="s1346">And inside the track, they had cricket grounds, they had a baseball diamond, polo ground, tennis courts.</span> <span id="s1347">Of course no Chinese admitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">MS: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">WG: Except as servants.</span> <span id="s1350">And this last time we were, when we returned to Shanghai in '81, it turned out it is now The People's Park.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">MS: Isn't that interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">WG: No more baseball diamond.</span> <span id="s1353">No more polo ground.</span> <span id="s1354">No more cricket oval.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">MS: Could you, did you visit you former home location?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">WG: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1357">Yes, but I couldn't get into the Metost [phonetic] Apartment, which was the nice apartment house where the Japanese Vice Admiral kicked us out, because it is now a military communications headquarters.</span> <span id="s1358">Big radar things all over the roof, aerials.</span> <span id="s1359">The Chinese can't get in either.</span> <span id="s1360">They have guards all over the place.</span> <span id="s1361">The Beverly Houses, the fancy brothel, actually, I shouldn't call it a brothel, because it didn't have a madam or anything.</span> <span id="s1362">They were independent girls.</span> <span id="s1363">Each room had a girl and she would pick up what she could pick up.</span> <span id="s1364">And people would move in or out or sometimes by the hour, sometimes by the month, sometimes by the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">MS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">WG: We went back to that to look at it, and it's very crowded now, of course.</span> <span id="s1367">Because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">MS: It's still an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">WG: There's still people living in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">MS: Yes, mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">WG: They've added an additional floor on top, which is just cinder block.</span> <span id="s1372">And in the--it had a nice front yard, which was sort of a green space--they built a bamboo shack with more people living in it.</span> <span id="s1373">Tons of people living in it.</span> <span id="s1374">Yeah, we went in, and I showed my wife the room, room 26.</span> <span id="s1375">I won't forget that.</span> <span id="s1376">And they changed the name of the street.</span> <span id="s1377">It used to be Route Gustav du Bois Sasson.</span> <span id="s1378">I don't, I forget what it's called now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">MS: I won't even ask you to spell it.</span> <span id="s1380">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">WG: I can't.</span> <span id="s1382">Even Thomas Pincope didn't ask me to spell it.</span> <span id="s1383">He knew how to spell Gustav du Bois Sasson.</span> <span id="s1384">It was in the French part of town, so it had a nice French name.</span> <span id="s1385">I think it's Pu-shing-lu, Pu-shing-lu West.</span> <span id="s1386">It was a, I'm trying to remember it.</span> <span id="s1387">Because I saw it when I got there, that they've changed, you know, all these foreign devil names of course are gone, and they've got good Chinese names now.</span> <span id="s1388">So it's Pu-shing-lu, instead of Route Gustav du Bois Sasson.</span> <span id="s1389">But they, yeah, that, well, that's still there.</span> <span id="s1390">And we went back to the synagogue where I was Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1391">And my wife checked.</span> <span id="s1392">The women's toilet is still where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">WG: She managed to find it.</span> <span id="s1395">I showed her where it was.</span> <span id="s1396">The women's gallery is now full of books, and the main, the sanctuary itself is like a rabbit warren of little offices.</span> <span id="s1397">It is now the book deposit--eh, it's a book depository and text book agency for the school district.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">MS: Oh I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">WG: But, and they've taken off all the Magen Davids and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">MS: I'm sure there's no need for synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">WG: No, there's no need, and they've removed all signs that unless you knew it was a synagogue...</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">MS: You...</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">WG: You wouldn't know.</span> <span id="s1404">And, in fact, I went to several other places.</span> <span id="s1405">I went to the Russian Orthodox Basilica.</span> <span id="s1406">And they've removed the Russian Orthodox crosses off the top.</span> <span id="s1407">You know, it has a nice onion dome on top of it like.</span> <span id="s1408">The crosses are gone.</span> <span id="s1409">Inside, it's now a medical laboratory.</span> <span id="s1410">And, it had mosaics all the way around of saints and Cyrillic inscriptions.</span> <span id="s1411">They whitewashed the pictures of the saints.</span> <span id="s1412">But they left the Cyrillic inscriptions because I guess nobody can read them anyway, or they don't care.</span> <span id="s1413">But all the saints pictures of, so you weren't, you know, you can still tell that it was a Russian Orthodox cathedral, because it looks like one.</span> <span id="s1414">I mean it's still, as opposed to the synagogue which, you have to know it was a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1415">It was a very nice one.</span> <span id="s1416">It was donated by one man in the Sephardic community.</span> <span id="s1417">You know, they didn't bond building funds and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1418">The Ohel Rachel Synagogue, in honor of his mother, someone donated it.</span> <span id="s1419">Mr. Abraham in fact, donated it in honor of his mother, built the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1420">They had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1421">A lot of the Sephardim...</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">MS: That was a..</span> <span id="s1423">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">WG: Sephardim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">MS: Sephardim.</span> <span id="s1426">What, Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">WG: No, Sephardic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">MS: No, just...</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">WG: No, it was a Sephardic synagogue and it was Sephardic style.</span> <span id="s1430">And, a lot of the Sephardim, not a lot, some of them, had an awful lot of money.</span> <span id="s1431">Some of them had nothing, like Rachel Manasseh and her sisters and a lot of others.</span> <span id="s1432">But a lot of them were very, very well-to-do, like the Hardoons and Sassoons, the Abrahams.</span> <span id="s1433">These were all big names.</span> <span id="s1434">They owned the water company.</span> <span id="s1435">They owned the power company, the telephone company, half the real estate in town.</span> <span id="s1436">In fact, the Shanghai stock exchange would close on Jewish holidays because something like 80% of the brokers were Sephardic Jews.</span> <span id="s1437">And they were all very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1438">All right, so they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">MS: What happened to these families after the Communists came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">WG: Well, they left, of course.</span> <span id="s1441">And--around the world.</span> <span id="s1442">A lot of them, quite a few went to Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s1443">In fact, Hong Kong Power and Light is still owned by the Kadoories.</span> <span id="s1444">Half-owned.</span> <span id="s1445">Half owned by the Kadoories and half owned by Exxon.</span> <span id="s1446">They bought into it.</span> <span id="s1447">A lot went to Australia, came to the States, went to England.</span> <span id="s1448">They dispersed.</span> <span id="s1449">I don't know if any of them went back to Baghdad or Basra.</span> <span id="s1450">I doubt it very much.</span> <span id="s1451">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">MS: I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1453">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">WG: They had more sense than to do that.</span> <span id="s1455">But, they, no, some of them came to this country, and, in other diaspora.</span> <span id="s1456">They had been very well-established and originally they had been brought in by the British to handle the opium trade.</span> <span id="s1457">Because after the opium war in the 1840s, when the British forced the Chinese to admit opium, they needed someone to handle the trade.</span> <span id="s1458">And, the Iraqi Jews started out handling it for the British.</span> <span id="s1459">And then they branched out and settled there, because the British traders would come and they would go.</span> <span id="s1460">You know, they'd, most of them did not, very few of them ever decided to make it their home, whereas these Iraqis, and some from Lebanon--the Kadoories were from Lebanon--they stayed.</span> <span id="s1461">They stayed till the Communists came in.</span> <span id="s1462">And that was that.</span> <span id="s1463">They left for wherever.</span> <span id="s1464">Some here, some there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">MS: Did you have contact perhaps with any of the people that you lived with, the family knew, in Shanghai, once they came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">WG: Some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">MS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">WG: Not, yeah, some.</span> <span id="s1469">We had a reunion in Philadelphia recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">WG: And a lot of, that's where everything was set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">WG: And, of course, my cousin, one of my cousins, my father's cousins, moved to New York, and I see them.</span> <span id="s1474">And I do stay in touch occasionally with Tavi Levenspiel.</span> <span id="s1475">We went to high school together.</span> <span id="s1476">Not only Aurora but high school as well.</span> <span id="s1477">I mean when the [coughs] yeah, that's--well, he said he didn't know his father was a Communist spy.</span> <span id="s1478">Everybody knew Mr. Levenspiel, who was an architect, was a Communist spy.</span> <span id="s1479">Whether he really was or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1480">But it was just sort of, things one knew.</span> <span id="s1481">Oh yes, Mr. Levenspiel, the Communist spy, I mean, he couldn't have been very effective if everybody knew it.</span> <span id="s1482">But when the Japanese came in, they too knew he was a Communist spy, and they arrested him.</span> <span id="s1483">But then they let him out after a short time.</span> <span id="s1484">Yeah, Tavi had, I don't know if you taped Tavi or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">MS: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">WG: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1487">He had an interesting life anyways.</span> <span id="s1488">His mother, Marian Greenhaus, lived in Hawaii.</span> <span id="s1489">His parents were divorced.</span> <span id="s1490">She had a store in Shanghai, one in Honolulu, and he would commute during vacation time and got caught in the Philippines and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">MS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">WG: Yeah, Tavi had a time of it.</span> <span id="s1493">But, when he got to the States, he eventually got himself a Fulbright fellowship to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1494">His father had gone to Australia, but he had trouble getting a passport because somewhere in the States--this was during the McCarthy era--somewhere in the files was the fact that his father was a Communist spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">MS: My.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">WG: So, he had to wait till that McCarthy nonsense blew over before he could go visit his father in Australia.</span> <span id="s1497">But, he couldn't get a passport.</span> <span id="s1498">He had a fellowship.</span> <span id="s1499">A Fulbright fellowship to go.</span> <span id="s1500">Eh, it's a crazy world sometimes.</span> <span id="s1501">He convinced the Japanese that Poland was an ally of Japan.</span> <span id="s1502">That's how he got out of the Philippines.</span> <span id="s1503">Because, what did they know?</span> <span id="s1504">[both laugh] And I know Tavi very well.</span> <span id="s1505">In fact I'll probably see him this July.</span> <span id="s1506">We're gonna meet in Vancouver, along with some other people--not Jewish--Russian Orthodox who had moved to Australia, the Osipovs.</span> <span id="s1507">They're gonna be there.</span> <span id="s1508">Have another get together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">MS: That sounds very interesting.</span> <span id="s1510">Well let me thank you once again...</span></p>
