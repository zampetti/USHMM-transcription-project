Nancy Alper.</span> <span id="s13">Today is October 24, 1996.</span> <span id="s14">And Margie I’d like you start by telling me your name at birth, your date of birth and your place of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Margie Rosenthal: My name was Margit Meli Mijinski.</span> <span id="s16">I was born in the, in Germany, in Upper Silesia, in July 19, 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What was the name of the town that you were born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Gleiwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Why don’t you tell me about the town that is what you remember of it and when you were a small child.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: It was a rather small town.</span> <span id="s21">We had one synagogue and a small community.</span> <span id="s22">We went to the elementary school which was a Jewish school and I went there from first grade until fifth grade and that was in 1938.</span> <span id="s23">At, I was in the fifth grade.</span> <span id="s24">I had some very happy memories and let me start with saying I also had a sister.</span> <span id="s25">She’s born October 19 in 1932.</span> <span id="s26">That’s the only sibling that I have.</span> <span id="s27">My parents and my, rather my father was born in Germany, in Katowice which later on became Poland.</span> <span id="s28">So when he was about 14 years old he left Poland because he didn’t want to be under the Polish rule.</span> <span id="s29">His parents however remained there.</span> <span id="s30">My mother was born in a very small town and she had one sister and she lived with us in Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s31">Now my grandparents on my father’s, the parents of my father, they remained in Poland and they had 9 children but 2 of them died before and one was killed early.</span> <span id="s32">I don’t remember exactly when, when that child was killed.</span> <span id="s33">I do however know that they were very orthodox and very, very religious and my grandmother would not light any lights on Shabbos.</span> <span id="s34">She would carry a handkerchief pinned to her dress and had a head piece which was like sort of a lace bedekom which is something that they wore.</span> <span id="s35">And she wouldn’t even turn on the electricity or anything like that.</span> <span id="s36">And she had servants, but these servants were not even allowed to do that either.</span> <span id="s37">So they had to wait from sundown to sundown before they could eat warm food.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Why don’t you tell me the names of all the people that you just referred to.</span> <span id="s39">I don’t think we have that down yet.</span> <span id="s40">You could perhaps start with the parents of your parents and work forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: My grandmother’s name was Dirka Mijinski and my grandfather was Louis Mijinski.</span> <span id="s42">They had a lot of children but I only knew about a couple of them.</span> <span id="s43">I remember one aunt.</span> <span id="s44">She had twins.</span> <span id="s45">Her name was Erna and I don’t remember her last name.</span> <span id="s46">There were two boys, twins, boys.</span> <span id="s47">Then the other aunt was Anna and she had one child when I was in Germany and there was, this the one Anna lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s48">The one I just referred to with Erna, she lived in Poland, Katowice.</span> <span id="s49">Then there was a George, the brother of my dad who was a couple of years older.</span> <span id="s50">He also was in Germany.</span> <span id="s51">He had one son.</span> <span id="s52">So that boy now lives in New York.</span> <span id="s53">The other people that I barely know but my grandmother, my maternal grandmother was born in Germany as I said.</span> <span id="s54">And her name was Anna Zusman.</span> <span id="s55">Her maiden name was Hyman and my her husband was the first Jewish locomotive engineer.</span> <span id="s56">And he worked his way up from being a coal boy but shoveling coal into the engines.</span> <span id="s57">And he just went higher and higher until he became an engineer.</span> <span id="s58">He loved trains that much that whenever he was on vacation he would stand at the trestle and watch all the trains go by.</span> <span id="s59">He just loved it.</span> <span id="s60">And my earliest recollection was of him.</span> <span id="s61">He had a stroke.</span> <span id="s62">I was 5 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s63">And he was paralyzed completely.</span> <span id="s64">And he could speak but nobody could understand by myself.</span> <span id="s65">He talked to me about all the trains that he was running and all that information which he just loved.</span> <span id="s66">And I had a very close relationship with him.</span> <span id="s67">And being the very first grandchild, I’d say my grandmother Anna spoiled me.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: I don’t think you said the name of your maternal grandfather, the one who worked for the railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: His name was Beno Zusman.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Why don’t you tell me a little bit about your family life, what you remember because I know you were very young and how your parents lived their lives and what you and your sister were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: My father was out of town a lot.</span> <span id="s72">As a matter of fact he was gone sometimes for weeks at a time.</span> <span id="s73">And my mother and her sister and my grandmother were very close and they would take trips together with us children and by the way my aunt Ruth K, her name now was last name was Karliner but before that she was married to a Banger and they used to take us to the mountains and we had wonderful times.</span> <span id="s74">It was like a resort into the mountains which was resort was called Reinerts.</span> <span id="s75">And I don’t really know what kind of mountains they were, but I do remember having a wonderful time up there with everyone.</span> <span id="s76">Climbing and, and using sticks where you put metals on them telling you what city you were in which I thought fascinating.</span> <span id="s77">And it usually was around my birthday.</span> <span id="s78">So they would have to kind of sneak the gifts into a suitcase so that they could surprise me when I woke up on my birthday that they would have a present for me.</span> <span id="s79">I surely didn’t expect it because I mean we were so far away from home.</span> <span id="s80">But they did that for me.</span> <span id="s81">And going back again to, my sister she was born when I was five like I said.</span> <span id="s82">And she was born in our house.</span> <span id="s83">Our regular apartment.</span> <span id="s84">We didn’t have a house in this case.</span> <span id="s85">But she was born and my cousin is the same age and she was born about 14 days prior to my sister.</span> <span id="s86">And she didn’t tell her husband that she was going to have the baby that soon.</span> <span id="s87">So when he came home, that’s my uncle, uncle Herbert was his name.</span> <span id="s88">It was aunt Ruth’s husband.</span> <span id="s89">He came home and he said what are you doing in bed.</span> <span id="s90">And she said oh nothing.</span> <span id="s91">I didn’t feel that good.</span> <span id="s92">She says, go look at the carriage, the doll carriage that Margie has.</span> <span id="s93">And he said what.</span> <span id="s94">I’ve seen that carriage and the dolls a million times before.</span> <span id="s95">And she says go take a look and go look at it again.</span> <span id="s96">Well finally to get him to do that, I urged him on.</span> <span id="s97">So I said uncle come look, come look, look at my Suzy.</span> <span id="s98">And he looked in there and there was this child.</span> <span id="s99">My doll’s name was Suzy so he didn’t know that it was a real child.</span> <span id="s100">But it was so funny because he couldn’t get over it, that this little baby was in my carriage.</span> <span id="s101">And he had no idea what had happened.</span> <span id="s102">And then my sister came a few, exactly two weeks later.</span> <span id="s103">One was, my cousin was on the third of October, my sister was born on the 19th of October.</span> <span id="s104">But my dad was out of town as usual.</span> <span id="s105">And he did have an inkling that when he came back there would be a child there.</span> <span id="s106">And sure enough.</span> <span id="s107">In those days you didn’t go to a hospital.</span> <span id="s108">You had a midwife.</span> <span id="s109">And then I loved playing with the babies you might say because they were like my own doll.</span> <span id="s110">And I was able to hold them and play with them.</span> <span id="s111">So that kind of grew because when I was about six years old, my parents put me in charge, my mother put me in charge of taking care of my sister.</span> <span id="s112">And I would, I roll her up and down the streets.</span> <span id="s113">But then being a young kid, you know you kind of forget about what you’re supposed to be doing.</span> <span id="s114">And a girlfriend of mine would say hey let’s play hopscotch.</span> <span id="s115">So I did and the next thing I know my sister falls head over onto the cement, screaming, crying and I was so afraid to go back home.</span> <span id="s116">I thought oh my I’m going to really get it.</span> <span id="s117">I came home because my, they could hear.</span> <span id="s118">I guess the whole neighborhood could hear my sister.</span> <span id="s119">She was really upset and a little hurt but not really drastically.</span> <span id="s120">And I came home and she was still screaming and my mother says what happened what happened.</span> <span id="s121">And I said she fell kind of with the carriage on the cement.</span> <span id="s122">How could you.</span> <span id="s123">And my grandmother said what do you expect a child.</span> <span id="s124">She’s still a child herself.</span> <span id="s125">You shouldn’t punish her.</span> <span id="s126">So I got away with that one too.</span> <span id="s127">And later on we, where I was living they had always a fair once a year.</span> <span id="s128">And that was run by the gypsies and they were living in these house wagons lined up along the plaza there.</span> <span id="s129">It was like in the, on Fridays they would have a market there.</span> <span id="s130">and the rest of the time, at times they would have a fair.</span> <span id="s131">They would have carousels and big wheel and that was a big treat for us.</span> <span id="s132">And because my sister was too small, we couldn’t’ take her and neither could we take our my cousin because she was the same age.</span> <span id="s133">And this was maybe when they were about three or four years old.</span> <span id="s134">And one night I remember very well, my aunt goes home.</span> <span id="s135">Her daughter was missing and she got a shock of her life.</span> <span id="s136">Where could the child have gone to.</span> <span id="s137">She was gone.</span> <span id="s138">We combed the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s139">Everybody was running around and finally we located her oh maybe a half a block away.</span> <span id="s140">Somebody had seen her walking as a little kid in the middle of evening, dark already and they took her in and they said you wait til your mom will come.</span> <span id="s141">And sure enough she was sitting in the window looking out and when my aunt came by she said oh there’s my mommy.</span> <span id="s142">And that was one of the things I really remember.</span> <span id="s143">Very, very well.</span> <span id="s144">I went to the Jewish school and that, that was a wonderful place.</span> <span id="s145">When I first got there however, the very first year they asked us for a physical and they had this big hall and you went from one doctor to the next.</span> <span id="s146">One was a doctor for general.</span> <span id="s147">Then there was a doctor for looking in the eyes.</span> <span id="s148">There was a dentist that looked in your mouth.</span> <span id="s149">And of course they wanted us to be stripped to the waist because they wanted to take our I guess our vitals.</span> <span id="s150">Anyway, I wasn’t about to do that.</span> <span id="s151">I was too ashamed to show my body.</span> <span id="s152">And they said it’s ok, you can do that.</span> <span id="s153">And I said no.</span> <span id="s154">I took my clothes and ran down the stairs and I didn’t want to do it.</span> <span id="s155">So then the teacher came over to my mother and she said did you know that your daughter ran from school and my mother said no, why would she do that.</span> <span id="s156">And she said well she didn’t want to undress.</span> <span id="s157">And my mother said, well of course.</span> <span id="s158">She’s very shameful of showing her body you know.</span> <span id="s159">And I never lived that one down.</span> <span id="s160">Ever since then, everybody is always laughing about it.</span> <span id="s161">The kids used to kind of snicker when they saw me.</span> <span id="s162">What are you ashamed of.</span> <span id="s163">You’re not developed yet or anything like that.</span> <span id="s164">But it’s I was only about six years old.</span> <span id="s165">And I mean to me my body was kind of precious and I wasn’t about to show it off to anybody.</span> <span id="s166">And anyway, my sister, Eva, her name is Eva Renart.</span> <span id="s167">I don’t know if I mentioned it prior to this.</span> <span id="s168">She went to kindergarten, also a Jewish kindergarten and she had a wonderful time as well.</span> <span id="s169">And as I think back, we, my parents well that is my mother and father if he was in town, and my aunt and her husband, they went to the temple every Saturday faithfully.</span> <span id="s170">Of course in those days you didn’t hire any baby sitters, you used the older child.</span> <span id="s171">That was me.</span> <span id="s172">And I would have to play house and entertain the young ones.</span> <span id="s173">And that was kind of fun because we played house and I was always the mother and they were the children.</span> <span id="s174">And of course they had to behave.</span> <span id="s175">Otherwise I would punish them and put them in a corner or something like that.</span> <span id="s176">And those are really very, very good memories for me because I enjoyed what I was doing.</span> <span id="s177">And then in see we lived in upper Silesia, so we were protected by the Versailles contract or however you want to call it.</span> <span id="s178">I’m not sure exactly the wording.</span> <span id="s179">But until 1935 Hitler could not touch us.</span> <span id="s180">But in 1935 Hitler then said no more Jews to leave out of the country.</span> <span id="s181">So my dad couldn’t go anymore to the in his business to the Polish forests and to the Czechoslovakia Russia and so forth.</span> <span id="s182">So the Nazis took him for forced labor.</span> <span id="s183">And he was digging ditches and they were there was water accumulated over there.</span> <span id="s184">And he got quite ill.</span> <span id="s185">So in 1938 we did get, in the early part of 1938 we received an affidavit from our uncles.</span> <span id="s186">That is my grandmother’s brothers who lived in Battle Creek, Michigan.</span> <span id="s187">They posted an affidavit but when my dad heard that there, you know he had, I don’t know, he was very smart man.</span> <span id="s188">He had an inkling that things were going, not going to go so well for the Jews.</span> <span id="s189">So he decided rather than waiting in Germany we should go ahead and go to another country that’s affiliated with the United States, wait there and then as soon as our visa became valid that they would give it to us, then we could go to America.</span> <span id="s190">That was the plan.</span> <span id="s191">However, that wasn’t exactly what took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Before we get to the to your leaving Germany, I want to go back a little bit so I don’t forget.</span> <span id="s193">Why don’t we talk a little bit about what you remember about where you lived, what your parents were like, what it was like when your grandparents moved into the house with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Well my grandparents moved in once my grandfather got the stroke.</span> <span id="s195">They could not, my grandmother wasn’t able to take care of him.</span> <span id="s196">So we had moved into a place that had three bedrooms.</span> <span id="s197">And one was occupied by my parents.</span> <span id="s198">One was occupied by we rented out one and the other one was my grandparents.</span> <span id="s199">And my grandmother and my grandfather had a beautiful room and we enjoyed going in there and talking to them.</span> <span id="s200">Oh let me tell you something else that happened.</span> <span id="s201">When I was about six years old, I think it was something like that.</span> <span id="s202">We had Passover and my father always wore the white kitle and he was a very, he came from a very orthodox family.</span> <span id="s203">So he wore the white kitle like I said and my grandfather who had a stroke couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s204">So he sat there and asked the children.</span> <span id="s205">Of course it was us children, so they were still kind of tiny and they were just sitting and like in a little not a playpen exactly but something where they could contain them because they were just crawling around at that point.</span> <span id="s206">And all of a sudden I said you know dad, you look like a beggar.</span> <span id="s207">Oh, my dad got so upset at me.</span> <span id="s208">How dare I say you look like a beggar and my grandfather, my father was so upset at me, my grandfather being he couldn’t speak very well, start in his own way yelling.</span> <span id="s209">Well the women all were in the kitchen trying to bring the food out.</span> <span id="s210">When they heard my father yelling and my grandfather trying to yell and me crying they dumped all the dishes on the kitchen floor.</span> <span id="s211">That was my mother, my aunt and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s212">They came running.</span> <span id="s213">What in the world happened.</span> <span id="s214">And when we told them what happened, well it wasn’t a big deal.</span> <span id="s215">But to me it was horrible that my dad would get so upset that I said that.</span> <span id="s216">Our neighborhood where I lived was mostly Catholic or Protestant.</span> <span id="s217">I think it was more like Catholic.</span> <span id="s218">So the girlfriends that I had in our very immediate neighborhood were all Christian kids.</span> <span id="s219">So but they never made a difference between my being Jewish and themselves.</span> <span id="s220">And they would call us and say come on and play with me.</span> <span id="s221">And I would go out and play with them.</span> <span id="s222">And until they very day that we left, I never knew that they would even, have a difference.</span> <span id="s223">So to me I was accepted as their equal.</span> <span id="s224">There was no discrimination.</span> <span id="s225">The schooling had to be in, I had to go to a Jewish school because I guess maybe the others wouldn’t accept us.</span> <span id="s226">I really don’t know why.</span> <span id="s227">But I started the first grade and went all the way up to fifth.</span> <span id="s228">Like I said before.</span> <span id="s229">And that’s the only way there was.</span> <span id="s230">But one of the memories I have that also that I loved to dance.</span> <span id="s231">And do gymnastics.</span> <span id="s232">So at a very early age, my mother enrolled me into a school for gymnastics and I wanted to become a gymnastics teacher.</span> <span id="s233">Or a ballerina.</span> <span id="s234">Anything that had to do with dance or whatever.</span> <span id="s235">And I was pretty flexible and I enjoyed it very much.</span> <span id="s236">And then we would put on plays, like little dances and so forth and with that we would then entertain our congregation.</span> <span id="s237">Or we would go to the old age home and perform over there.</span> <span id="s238">It was really a lot of fun and my mother made sure I had the most beautiful costumes.</span> <span id="s239">One of the ones that I really remember is that I was a butterfly and my girlfriend was the flower.</span> <span id="s240">So I could dance around a lot.</span> <span id="s241">And we, these are just wonderful memories and I had also of course a lot of Jewish girlfriends, that is when school would let out.</span> <span id="s242">I would go over there and play with them and one of the girls had a bicycle.</span> <span id="s243">Well I didn’t have one.</span> <span id="s244">So she would let me ride the bicycle.</span> <span id="s245">Well the first time I got onto the bike, I headed right straight for the rose bushes.</span> <span id="s246">And I came out of there looking and a mess, scratched up from head to toe.</span> <span id="s247">You might say.</span> <span id="s248">But I didn’t care because I had fun.</span> <span id="s249">It didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s250">I was learning how to ride the bicycle.</span> <span id="s251">I did it the hard way perhaps but I got it.</span> <span id="s252">And let’s see what else.</span> <span id="s253">The, one of my girlfriends Hannah Weissenberg, she was my very best friend.</span> <span id="s254">And she didn’t live all that far away but not in our immediate area, so only time I could play with her was either right after school or when my mother would take me over there and pick me up because we just didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s255">And as I said before, there was another girl too that I only know now the last name, Richar, was her name.</span> <span id="s256">And they went to Israel as far as I know.</span> <span id="s257">But I couldn’t be very sure.</span> <span id="s258">People left you know, some had left already.</span> <span id="s259">The moment in 1935 they would leave and go.</span> <span id="s260">But my two girlfriends that I you know I had really close ties with they were in Germany as long as I was.</span> <span id="s261">Now there was another girlfriend that I had.</span> <span id="s262">Her father was very orthodox.</span> <span id="s263">Her name is Miana Shy.</span> <span id="s264">And she we found her again in the United States but that was a very strange situation.</span> <span id="s265">I didn’t even know she would be here.</span> <span id="s266">So but let me go, get back to that later.</span> <span id="s267">While I was in school I learned English.</span> <span id="s268">However it was not the English that people in America talk or in the Philippines.</span> <span id="s269">It was Oxford English.</span> <span id="s270">The eithers and the neithers and the looking glass and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s271">Well when I left Germany and I went to another school, the kids all made fun of me.</span> <span id="s272">Because I didn’t speak like any of them.</span> <span id="s273">And they would snicker and laugh and like ridicule me.</span> <span id="s274">And I felt really bad about that because that’s the only English I did know.</span> <span id="s275">But anyway so in like, we can go back to the time we went and got the visa.</span> <span id="s276">My dad like I said kind of saw the writing on the wall and he said we’re now leaving.</span> <span id="s277">So in Germany you hardly bought any dresses ready-made.</span> <span id="s278">Everything had to be made.</span> <span id="s279">By material and the dressmakers and the dressmakers were a few blocks away of course.</span> <span id="s280">And so my mother had started putting things into suitcase because she knew we had to leave in October and this was now around Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s281">And during Rosh Hashanah somebody came in and told my parents you’d better get out now.</span> <span id="s282">They’re going to be closing the border to France which is Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s283">So we rushed out of the temple, the middle of services, went home, started putting things into the suitcases and then we had to call the government official to put a seal on it.</span> <span id="s284">Once it was sealed you could not break the seal unless you were outside Germany.</span> <span id="s285">So I remember us rushing through and getting everything ready and which is what my parents did.</span> <span id="s286">Then the official came and then we had to leave with ten marks in our pocket.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Margie, why don’t we go back just a little bit and why don’t you tell me if there was anything that was particularly Jewish about this Jewish German school that you were required to attend for first grade on.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Well the only thing is they did not teach Sunday school or Hebrew.</span> <span id="s289">So we had to go to the temple for the lessons from the rabbi and the cantor.</span> <span id="s290">And we learned the different, we learned all about the holidays and how to keep a kosher household and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s291">But basically all they really went into the math which is actually German, math and a little bit of geography of Germany.</span> <span id="s292">But and the English lessons that I had over there because I knew that eventually people were going to be you know going to different countries and they felt that we should learn English.</span> <span id="s293">We did however, my Hebrew wasn’t all that great.</span> <span id="s294">So my dad said that I have to have private lessons and Mr. Kamm, K-A-M-M.</span> <span id="s295">I remember his name.</span> <span id="s296">He gave me private lessons in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s297">Well I became pretty good at it so when my dad would go out of town out of the country, I would have to do the Havdalah.</span> <span id="s298">And I must say it went very well because my mother said go ahead, do it, do it.</span> <span id="s299">And I enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s300">Because I was the focus point.</span> <span id="s301">I mean I was the head of the household at that point.</span> <span id="s302">And let’s see what else.</span> <span id="s303">It’s very hard to remember all the different things.</span> <span id="s304">But, oh yes.</span> <span id="s305">Hanukah.</span> <span id="s306">Was a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s307">And I had as I said before, a lot of Christian children around me and our house.</span> <span id="s308">Well I would go for Christmas always upstairs and see their tree and at midnight they would have all these candles and goodies on the tree.</span> <span id="s309">And I was like I said I was accepted and I would partake with their Christmas celebrations.</span> <span id="s310">Well I came down and talked to my mother and father and I said you know we don’t have anything like that.</span> <span id="s311">Why don’t we have a Hanukah bush or something like that.</span> <span id="s312">Well they didn’t quite go along with that idea.</span> <span id="s313">However, my father surprised us as playing Hanukah man.</span> <span id="s314">Instead of Santa Claus he was Hanukah man.</span> <span id="s315">And he would knock on the door and of course I didn’t know it was my father at that time.</span> <span id="s316">And this man would come in with a very stern voice and would say have you been good this time and of course both my sister and I said, trembling we said of course, yes, yes, we’ve been good children.</span> <span id="s317">And he said well ok in that case I guess you deserve a gift.</span> <span id="s318">And he would have this pillowcase over his shoulder and that’s how Santa Claus’ way and he’d imitate the Santa Claus cause I was impressed by that.</span> <span id="s319">And so he was a Hanukah man so he had to imitate more or less the Catholics how they, the Christians how they handled things which was kind of cute.</span> <span id="s320">And I only found out after I was a practically a teenager that was my father cause he never was there and I couldn’t figure out.</span> <span id="s321">I mean he was there a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s322">I’d go where did he go.</span> <span id="s323">And then the bell rings and I didn’t put two and two together.</span> <span id="s324">So it was really neat.</span> <span id="s325">I really enjoyed that.</span> <span id="s326">And I think that’s I’m trying to remember.</span> <span id="s327">It is so, so much happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Did you wonder why you had to go to a Jewish school and the other children, the Gentiles went to another school.</span> <span id="s329">Did your parents explain that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: The same teachers taught my mother.</span> <span id="s331">And so naturally where the mother was taught I had to go and that was how, I never questioned it.</span> <span id="s332">It just seemed a natural thing that Miss Stantur was my mother’s teacher and she was, became my teacher.</span> <span id="s333">And of course she always compared me to my mother.</span> <span id="s334">My mother must have been, I was very timid though.</span> <span id="s335">I really didn’t do things that most kids, I was very good.</span> <span id="s336">But sometimes you know maybe I was quite as good as my mother used to be.</span> <span id="s337">And she would tell my mother go to my mother and say, oh you know your daughter did this and this and this.</span> <span id="s338">And I mean really I was my own person.</span> <span id="s339">I couldn’t change me to my mother.</span> <span id="s340">My mother was very lenient.</span> <span id="s341">My father on the other hand, he was very strict.</span> <span id="s342">I mean if you didn’t throw the mark, I mean forget it.</span> <span id="s343">I mean he would, he was quick with the hand too.</span> <span id="s344">And my goodness whenever he hit, he had big hands.</span> <span id="s345">I mean the man was over 200 pounds and yeah, I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s346">You know and my mother would threaten us every time when he would be out and she’d say I’m making notes.</span> <span id="s347">He will know all about what you’re doing so when he comes you will get punishment.</span> <span id="s348">And that was about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: What was important to them?</span> <span id="s350">What do you think they wanted you to understand that their values were?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: To be a good Jew.</span> <span id="s352">I mean (no sound)</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: This is side two of the first tape of the interview with Margie Rosenthal.</span> <span id="s354">We were talking about your parents values.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: My mother was very lenient and she would get upset with us and she would warn me especially because I was the oldest that if I was not going to behave she was going to make notes and when dad would come back, then I would be punished.</span> <span id="s356">And that scared me enough that from then on and I was a pretty good girl and we had a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s357">I mean I can’t say that any of that was bad.</span> <span id="s358">But my grandmother spoiled me.</span> <span id="s359">I didn’t like, like for example on Friday afternoons for midday was our big meal.</span> <span id="s360">And of course Shabbos was a big, big, big thing in our house so during the noon hours we would have like maybe rice and cinnamon or something, a very light meal.</span> <span id="s361">Well I didn’t like that at all, so my grandmother would make me a soup, chicken soup and put some things in there so I would have something warm.</span> <span id="s362">And then came the evening.</span> <span id="s363">I didn’t like the beef because I don’t care for boiled beef.</span> <span id="s364">I never did, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s365">Well maybe nowadays I might but not really.</span> <span id="s366">So she would always have like a little squab or I should make a something that I would like, special vegetables, special this, special that and my parents didn’t really approve of that because this is just spoiling her.</span> <span id="s367">And she said well she’s my one and only and she, I love her.</span> <span id="s368">And my grandmother would, we were always doing things together.</span> <span id="s369">In fact our friends and relatives, everybody called us the bride and groom because we were always together.</span> <span id="s370">Like I said my grandma and I had a wonderful relationship and when I had to leave Germany and leave her behind, that was really one of the hardest things I had to do.</span> <span id="s371">I didn’t’ care so much about my aunt and uncle that were there who I loved dearly too but my grandmother and I had a wonderful relationship.</span> <span id="s372">As a matter of fact, when my grandfather died, I moved into the room with her.</span> <span id="s373">So the two of us shared a room.</span> <span id="s374">And at night she would have some chocolate and of course I had to have it.</span> <span id="s375">And none of the others did but I got it.</span> <span id="s376">So when I would go like during vacation, during say Easter vacation, Passover vacation, I would go to a girlfriend in Boyden, Germany.</span> <span id="s377">That was oh not that far away but it was far enough.</span> <span id="s378">For me every distance was far actually.</span> <span id="s379">And I would stay there for a few weeks and I would have to buy her always the same chocolates that she loved which was a coffee liquor filled chocolate.</span> <span id="s380">And she loved those so whenever I went to Boyden, I had a little money saved up.</span> <span id="s381">I would buy that for her so I could bring it back to her.</span> <span id="s382">And she appreciated it so much.</span> <span id="s383">Well, that’s the least I could do for her goodness to me all the time.</span> <span id="s384">And, and then my cousin oh she was a little, she would, she did things like let me tell you what she did.</span> <span id="s385">Like I told you, she ran away when we were always having a we didn’t have baby sitters in those days, so my auntie put her to bed.</span> <span id="s386">But now let me tell you what happened at Passover.</span> <span id="s387">Just prior to Passover she was naughty so my aunt locked her into a little room I mean off the kitchen.</span> <span id="s388">I mean not for long.</span> <span id="s389">But all of a sudden she hears this crash bang and oh she’s like what has she done now.</span> <span id="s390">So she opened up and my cousin Suzie had broken every egg that there was for Passover.</span> <span id="s391">She had just gotten so upset that just kind of stomped on them or threw them about.</span> <span id="s392">I don’t really know what she did.</span> <span id="s393">But she destroyed every egg.</span> <span id="s394">So my auntie had to start from scratch.</span> <span id="s395">And, oh go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You said something at the beginning of the interview about things changing in the area where you lived in 1935 I think.</span> <span id="s397">As a child what filtered into your impressions of the changes that were happening and how did you see your parents dealing with it and your, I don’t’ know if you grandfather was dead then, but your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: My well it didn’t really, really come to my attention.</span> <span id="s399">However, my mother and my sister and I would go to Katowice to visit my great, my grandparents in Poland.</span> <span id="s400">And one time when she went and then came back she got a letter that you have to come to the police station, that you were carrying contraband.</span> <span id="s401">And I said what in the world.</span> <span id="s402">I wouldn’t carry anything that wasn’t legal.</span> <span id="s403">And apparently they had found a sausage that my mother had brought from Poland to Germany and that too wasn’t allowed.</span> <span id="s404">And so they had a, I mean we were scared that they would take her to a concentration camp or something, that you know going to really punish her and thank the, thanks be to God.</span> <span id="s405">Nothing really happened.</span> <span id="s406">She was able to explain that it was a gift from my in-laws and that it was just a gift and that she hadn’t even bought it.</span> <span id="s407">With German money or whatever.</span> <span id="s408">And that she didn’t’ have any contraband.</span> <span id="s409">She had no money that belonged to Poland or anything.</span> <span id="s410">We knew better than that.</span> <span id="s411">So those are things that stuck in my mind that she was so upset and the whole family was upset when that happened.</span> <span id="s412">But my girlfriends, nobody we didn’t we didn’t really have that big a problem with the stores or anything like that.</span> <span id="s413">it was just the government took my father to work in the ditches and my dad was coming home very, feeling not well.</span> <span id="s414">He was having pains.</span> <span id="s415">I guess kidney, already then problems.</span> <span id="s416">And for me, really nothing really, really happened that I could remember that was a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Do you remember anything about Nazi propaganda on the radios for example.</span> <span id="s418">Anything about book burnings say or newspapers and your parents talking about what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No I think they tried to shield us from all that.</span> <span id="s420">No, I, I don’t’ ever remember them saying much of anything and we still had our Jewish doctor that we went to.</span> <span id="s421">And until the time we left there was really no major problems.</span> <span id="s422">In fact one of my Christian girlfriends wanted to come to the depot the railway station and my parents said better not.</span> <span id="s423">That’s how close we all were.</span> <span id="s424">Cause there was really, like I said, I myself did not feel it.</span> <span id="s425">And they kept it from us.</span> <span id="s426">They did not want to share because this was very disturbing and they didn’t want to put us into that.</span> <span id="s427">My sister Eva, she was a very timid person.</span> <span id="s428">She was shy and but she loved to eat.</span> <span id="s429">Oh boy did she love to eat.</span> <span id="s430">And whenever we would go, we would go visiting people like friends of ours and they would put out the coffee and the cake.</span> <span id="s431">For the children special little goodies.</span> <span id="s432">She would say oh, she wouldn’t ask right out you know.</span> <span id="s433">And before we left, my mother always gave us something to eat because she loved to eat.</span> <span id="s434">And I was a very poor eater as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s435">And my, my food was they had to put it on a chair with a little stool and they would put a lot of butter on it because I didn’t, I wasn’t eating enough as far as they were concerned.</span> <span id="s436">So I hate the butter.</span> <span id="s437">So they didn’t’, they didn’t give me a knife or anything So they always knew where I sat because I would take the butter off on the edge of the plate.</span> <span id="s438">And I would go around like that.</span> <span id="s439">so that’s why I guess maybe my grandmother was spoiling me a little bit With the squab and all that stuff, veal cutlets and because I was a very poor eater.</span> <span id="s440">Now not my sister.</span> <span id="s441">We would go to these people and she had the full tummy.</span> <span id="s442">And we would go there and she would just look at my mother and she said you know I haven’t had that in a long time.</span> <span id="s443">And of course the people would feel so sorry for her and they would say oh poor Eva.</span> <span id="s444">Sure, help yourself, take something.</span> <span id="s445">It was so embarrassing for my mother.</span> <span id="s446">She would get so red in the face.</span> <span id="s447">She would say like I don’t feed her anything, but it wasn’t true at all.</span> <span id="s448">She just had a very good appetite.</span> <span id="s449">And I was, going back to when I was saying, playing house with them you know.</span> <span id="s450">My little cousin I told you is this little devious person.</span> <span id="s451">I mean she was just, I mean she was always into things.</span> <span id="s452">And all of a sudden my sister would start crying.</span> <span id="s453">I said why are you crying, Eva, what happened.</span> <span id="s454">Suzie.</span> <span id="s455">And I didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s456">She said but she did and my cousin was so sneaky, Suzie.</span> <span id="s457">She was so sneaky, she would either drop something on the ground on the floor or pretend that she’s picking it up.</span> <span id="s458">At the same time she’s pinching my foot or leg or something on my sister or behind my back.</span> <span id="s459">I think it was really something.</span> <span id="s460">Keeping those two apart was a major, major problem.</span> <span id="s461">When I walked with them, I had to keep one on the left and one on the right, I mean at arm’s length.</span> <span id="s462">I couldn’t even bring them together.</span> <span id="s463">But like I said my sister followed me everywhere.</span> <span id="s464">Well one time we were a bunch of kids were playing.</span> <span id="s465">Down in the we had meadows, very pretty meadows near, nearby and oh like across the street and we lived in the newer portion of Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s466">It was a lovely place.</span> <span id="s467">And we stepped outside and then there was this big meadow on both sides.</span> <span id="s468">Beautiful.</span> <span id="s469">So kids are you know they take, I learned how to throw knife.</span> <span id="s470">Pocket knife.</span> <span id="s471">That’s a boys’ game but I played with everybody.</span> <span id="s472">Wasn’t just girls, it was boys too.</span> <span id="s473">I was only maybe ten years old at that time.</span> <span id="s474">So I said to Eva I said why don’t’ you run and get me a knife so I can play also.</span> <span id="s475">So she runs up the hill and she comes back.</span> <span id="s476">While she’s running down, she falls and she cuts herself.</span> <span id="s477">Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s478">Here she is bleeding.</span> <span id="s479">I think that she’s dying because she’s crying like you know there’s no tomorrow.</span> <span id="s480">And of course again I had to take her home and again my grandmother said not her.</span> <span id="s481">I mean we should have covered in something so she wouldn’t fall because she was carrying it and running.</span> <span id="s482">But she was trying to do me a favor, the, my little sister so like I said it was of her I was in trouble more than for my own sake.</span> <span id="s483">But hey, that’s all right.</span> <span id="s484">I mean she was five years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s485">I mean after all I was a big sister you know.</span> <span id="s486">I had to really do whatever I was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s487">But sometimes I’d forget it and did what I, what any young kid would do.</span> <span id="s488">But it matured me.</span> <span id="s489">I’d say that much it did.</span> <span id="s490">And where, I don’t know now where.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: I was going to ask you how your parents decided on where you were going to emigrate.</span> <span id="s492">You mentioned the family in Michigan in fact sponsoring you.</span> <span id="s493">But of course you didn’t end up in Michigan.</span> <span id="s494">So why don’t you tell me what you remember about the circumstances of the choice being made to go to the Philippines and how the other people around you, your family, the Jewish community reacted when you told them what you planned to do</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: My father as you know was in the lumber business.</span> <span id="s496">And when he asked, you know he asked around and nobody knew what to do.</span> <span id="s497">So when he went to the consulate, American Consulate he asked where could I go and practice my profession.</span> <span id="s498">They said well I don’t’ know but why don’t you try the Philippines.</span> <span id="s499">It’s not a bad place.</span> <span id="s500">Why don’t’ you go there and then from there you can come to the states.</span> <span id="s501">So with that in mind, jungles and all this when I heard jungles, oh boy my mind went wild.</span> <span id="s502">I thought oh boy I could play with the monkeys.</span> <span id="s503">I could play with the lions.</span> <span id="s504">I could play with all, I was animal lover from way back.</span> <span id="s505">As a matter of fact, I used to walk a dog just to, to be near a dog.</span> <span id="s506">I loved animals from way when I was a little girl.</span> <span id="s507">And the woman would be happy to give me her dog, the big German shepherd and I would play, but that was my protection and nobody could come near me.</span> <span id="s508">So when they said jungle I was all enthused.</span> <span id="s509">I thought jungle, great.</span> <span id="s510">You know I’ll be having the beach right there and then I walk a few feet and I’d be living on the outskirts of the jungle.</span> <span id="s511">And my dad would go into the jungle.</span> <span id="s512">Maybe he could bring me back a wild animal or something like that.</span> <span id="s513">Well it didn’t quite turn out that way, but I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s514">We didn’t even know where the Philippines was.</span> <span id="s515">All I knew was that you had to go over the ocean and that you had to take a ship and so my parents tried to I guess maybe make it nicer than it really would have been.</span> <span id="s516">And I don’t think they really had much of an idea either.</span> <span id="s517">All, All my dad knew he might have a good job over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Why don’t you tell me.</span> <span id="s519">I don’t think we discussed this.</span> <span id="s520">What kind of work exactly your father did.</span> <span id="s521">In the lumber industry.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: My dad would go into the woods, into the forest and estimate the footage of the trees to be cut.</span> <span id="s523">He had a wonderful mind.</span> <span id="s524">He never used to calculate it for anything.</span> <span id="s525">He could just but he didn’t need a calculator.</span> <span id="s526">His mind worked so well that all he looked at a tree and he estimated and my goodness and that was how it was.</span> <span id="s527">I mean he was, he had a fabulous mind.</span> <span id="s528">And he knew that if he went into the Philippines he would go into the jungle, would go in and cut some, tell them how to cut the trees and how much footage you’d get out of it.</span> <span id="s529">And with that in mind he decided we’ll go to the Philippines and so there we would wait for our visa to the States and that would be wonderful.</span> <span id="s530">Didn’t quite happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Do you remember anything or do you have a strong memory of what it was like when your father lost his job with the lumber company.</span> <span id="s532">What did you understand about why that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: My parents wouldn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s534">Didn’t tell me at all.</span> <span id="s535">All they said, I guess they were afraid that if I made a remark to one of my Christian friends, they all had to somehow belong to the Nazi party or you know things like that, because in those days, when a boy reached a certain age, or a girl for that matter, they had to join the Junge, Jungefrau and, and it was like a Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s536">However, you’ve seen them in the movies and they had to join.</span> <span id="s537">And it really could have been very, very hard on my parents if I said something so they really didn’t want to confide in us too much because if I, if any of us would have said something wrong that when we mentioned the fact that we were going to the Philippines, everybody said you’re crazy.</span> <span id="s538">Why the Philippines.</span> <span id="s539">Wait here til your visa comes.</span> <span id="s540">What’s your rush.</span> <span id="s541">And my father said well I don’t like the way things are going.</span> <span id="s542">Stores are already a little bit discriminating and I found that all out afterwards.</span> <span id="s543">Nothing was told to us at that point.</span> <span id="s544">But people all thought that he was out of his mind.</span> <span id="s545">So my aunt, my uncle, the whole family stayed behind.</span> <span id="s546">My grandmother didn’t want to leave because she had a pension from her husband being a locomotive engineer.</span> <span id="s547">So she said why should I give up everything to go into a country that we know nothing about.</span> <span id="s548">I mean if yeah, could I would say I go straight to the United States that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s549">But to go into a country.</span> <span id="s550">They did say tropics.</span> <span id="s551">They did say don’t bring any warm clothing.</span> <span id="s552">Just get light clothing.</span> <span id="s553">So the dresses and all that was what we had was just light clothing.</span> <span id="s554">And they said that we could take a bicycle.</span> <span id="s555">But then we didn’t know also what to pack.</span> <span id="s556">My mother had visions of maybe she couldn’t get any soap so she brought boxes of the, like you have here Tide and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s557">And she took that along.</span> <span id="s558">And my dad was in those days we had a very musical family.</span> <span id="s559">My dad played the violin.</span> <span id="s560">My mother played the piano and my aunt Ruth sang.</span> <span id="s561">So we always had a trio but I didn’t get to do any of that.</span> <span id="s562">So when we talked about leaving, it was oh why, why, what is your rush you know.</span> <span id="s563">Stay, a little longer.</span> <span id="s564">And so my dad said no.</span> <span id="s565">And he booked passage on a French steamer.</span> <span id="s566">That meant we had to go through France and but when they told us remember when we were in the temple and told us that we had to leave right then and there.</span> <span id="s567">We had the suitcases sealed and we said our goodbyes and we took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Was it the American embassy that suggested that you go to the Philippines as the sort of interim place to be on your way to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yes it was because we went, we had an affidavit.</span> <span id="s570">However before we could even get the visa to the Philippines we had to put down like $500.</span> <span id="s571">That was a lot of money in those days.</span> <span id="s572">And that should see us through whatever comes in the next year or so that we would not be a burden to anybody.</span> <span id="s573">No other government.</span> <span id="s574">And with that we were able to get the visa to go to the Philippines.</span> <span id="s575">And that was how we finally got that and then we left on a train and went over Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s576">And my mother started to cry and I thought you know that she’s just upset because she left her family there.</span> <span id="s577">And which was very traumatic for her.</span> <span id="s578">Because her sister and her were just very close.</span> <span id="s579">They were just a couple of years apart.</span> <span id="s580">And so and my grandmother of course.</span> <span id="s581">So then we got past the as we get to Strasbourg, the German government, the officials come up and they said let’s open your suitcases.</span> <span id="s582">We want to see what you have in there and so my mother opened up the suitcase.</span> <span id="s583">They broke the seal rather and then she opened up and they kind of went through it.</span> <span id="s584">And then they said everything is ok and close up again and go on.</span> <span id="s585">And this was the same train that left our home, town of Gleiwitz.</span> <span id="s586">It was going all the way to Paris.</span> <span id="s587">Well after we passed into France my mother was very hysterical by this time.</span> <span id="s588">So I asked her, I said if you’re missing your sister so much, I can be your sister.</span> <span id="s589">I’m old enough.</span> <span id="s590">I’m 11 years old.</span> <span id="s591">And that made her cry even more.</span> <span id="s592">But then she told me that while they were sealing and she had forgotten to take the money out for the dresses.</span> <span id="s593">And those German marks in the clothing.</span> <span id="s594">And if they had caught her, she would have been in jail and they would have thrown away the key.</span> <span id="s595">I mean that was going against every, everything so they just the customs was very strict in those days anyway.</span> <span id="s596">Especially the Germans.</span> <span id="s597">Only let you take ten marks.</span> <span id="s598">Well we’re supposed to live with ten marks, that’s 40 marks the four of us for this was in the early part of September and our ship didn’t leave until about, I think almost like three weeks later.</span> <span id="s599">So we went, the first time we came into Paris when we got to Paris, the cab driver took us, we said yes take us to a hotel.</span> <span id="s600">He drove around and around and around.</span> <span id="s601">That was number one.</span> <span id="s602">Charged an exorbitant amount.</span> <span id="s603">Then he took us to this hotel.</span> <span id="s604">It was $50, dollars, 50 marks, whatever the currency to francs a day.</span> <span id="s605">Well that depleted the money that we were able to take from Germany.</span> <span id="s606">Thank god for the few dollars.</span> <span id="s607">Well pretty soon that money ran out too.</span> <span id="s608">And we had to eat and of course we only stayed in the hotel one day.</span> <span id="s609">We went to another building that about 3 or 4 stories up.</span> <span id="s610">And they didn’t even have a toilet up there.</span> <span id="s611">All you had to do in France.</span> <span id="s612">On each floor they had one, one of those things where you kind of squat on a hole.</span> <span id="s613">And the only toilet we had was on the ground floor.</span> <span id="s614">Well we had never seen anything like this or had even been close to something like that.</span> <span id="s615">So it was, that part was really very traumatic for us.</span> <span id="s616">How, not to have a toilet.</span> <span id="s617">I mean that was unheard of in Germany.</span> <span id="s618">Anyway so here we were now without money.</span> <span id="s619">And we didn’t want to be burdened with the Jewish HIAS or whoever Joint, whoever was there.</span> <span id="s620">So my mother somehow made mention in a letter to my grandmother.</span> <span id="s621">So she said go to this insane asylum.</span> <span id="s622">There is the son of a friend of mine which, the mother always sends money to him.</span> <span id="s623">And he will give you the money and I in turn will give her the money in Germany.</span> <span id="s624">And that’s what we did but let me tell you.</span> <span id="s625">Going to the insane asylum was a horrible feeling.</span> <span id="s626">All these people that were either crying or singing and pretending to holding a baby and some came up to us and pulling us and didn’t’ want us to go and it was just that part was really very bothersome.</span> <span id="s627">Then we talked to the man.</span> <span id="s628">He sounded as normal as anybody else.</span> <span id="s629">As you and I. well the reason he was in the insane asylum was because he had taken a dip in the river Seine and he was naked.</span> <span id="s630">It was evening and he didn’t think anybody would see him.</span> <span id="s631">Well lo and behold, they got him and they said anybody that does that has to go to the insane asylum.</span> <span id="s632">So that was where we got our money.</span> <span id="s633">And then we were in Paris for about ten days I would say.</span> <span id="s634">And but we didn’t go and eat all the time.</span> <span id="s635">I mean there was no way for us to go and eat.</span> <span id="s636">We couldn’t afford it.</span> <span id="s637">so we’d buy the bread and get some cheese and we’d eat upstairs in the room or whatever we rented.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Were you around other people, other Jews who were in the process of leaving Europe and how did your family find this rooming house.</span> <span id="s639">And were there other people staying there who were doing something similar to what you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: No, these were French Jewish people that we met when we went to buy the bread.</span> <span id="s641">This happened to be a Jewish bakery or she just worked there.</span> <span id="s642">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s643">All I know is that my parents went to talk and she spoke German and so that kind of made a bond but the woman of course never offered us any money.</span> <span id="s644">And then we asked where could we have a good dinner or lunch or something but we’d like a kosher restaurant.</span> <span id="s645">So she told us where to go for a kosher restaurant.</span> <span id="s646">Other times we, it was a treat for us to go like a cafeteria type thing, where you helped yourself and you could take your milk or whatever and for us that was something new.</span> <span id="s647">We never had anything like that in Germany.</span> <span id="s648">SO we stood there like we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s649">So the French people came up to us and we didn’t speak French of course which was another hardship, so we had to find always somebody that might be able with motions and things like that and I do remember one time though we had gone on a subway.</span> <span id="s650">We were going to go someplace and my father said we’re getting off at the next stop.</span> <span id="s651">Well I was the first one at the door and I jumped out and I look around.</span> <span id="s652">As I’m looking the doors are closing and my parents are on the subway still.</span> <span id="s653">Well here’s this 11 year old kid, doesn’t know any word of French.</span> <span id="s654">Doesn’t know where she exactly is but I thought well if I go up the stairs and walk backwards, back over towards the other station but of course I didn’t know which was way but I kind of had a hunch.</span> <span id="s655">So I was pretty good with locations.</span> <span id="s656">So I started walking and I see my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s657">My mother was crying.</span> <span id="s658">Oh thank God we found you.</span> <span id="s659">Thank God we got you back.</span> <span id="s660">I said what’s the big deal.</span> <span id="s661">I knew I had to walk towards the station.</span> <span id="s662">Yeah but how did you know.</span> <span id="s663">I said what, I don’t know, I just knew it.</span> <span id="s664">But anyway so that was quite an ordeal for everybody because they thought they’d lost me and I thought I’d lost them.</span> <span id="s665">What would I do?</span> <span id="s666">but as it turned out it was fine.</span> <span id="s667">So you see, I’m a survivor.</span> <span id="s668">From way back.</span> <span id="s669">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Which if your parents do you think you learned your survival skills from or your grandparents too I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I think my dad.</span> <span id="s672">My dad had this he had really special qualities and whenever we would talk and we’d get a few times you know when he could sit down and talk to us, I think he was the most important influence on my maturing that quickly and also being having his ideas and things like that.</span> <span id="s673">But I don’t know whether it was really all of him.</span> <span id="s674">It might be my grandparents too I would say.</span> <span id="s675">My grandmother was a very self-sufficient woman.</span> <span id="s676">And she did all the how shall I say she did all the planning and everything else.</span> <span id="s677">She was the matron.</span> <span id="s678">And she whatever she said everybody did.</span> <span id="s679">She was a very wise woman also.</span> <span id="s680">But I’m sorry to say she wasn’t wise enough to leave with us.</span> <span id="s681">Which I had hoped she might do.</span> <span id="s682">But anyways so here we are now in France and the time has come for us to go to Marseilles where the ship is.</span> <span id="s683">Well while we were in France there were no other refugees like ourselves that we had met or seen or anything.</span> <span id="s684">We couldn’t’ even go like I said we, Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s685">We spent Yom Kippur in Paris.</span> <span id="s686">But we couldn’t’ even get to a temple for some reason.</span> <span id="s687">Then I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s688">That part I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s689">But anyway everything was kind of a new, new thing to me so we took the train and went to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s690">We checked into somebody must have told us which hotel to check into and we had to wait three days for our vessel, ship to come and was the President Dorme.</span> <span id="s691">While we were in Marseilles, we met this young, very young couple.</span> <span id="s692">They had just gotten married before they left Germany all by themselves.</span> <span id="s693">So this lady looked up to my mother as her mother.</span> <span id="s694">And she asked my mother a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s695">How do you do this and what do you do with this.</span> <span id="s696">So my mother has kind of reared her you might say because she was so lost the poor thing.</span> <span id="s697">She had, she didn’t know anything and her name was Margot Friedlander.</span> <span id="s698">And his name was Heinrich Friedlander.</span> <span id="s699">Well anyway so we get finally, the ship arrives.</span> <span id="s700">And it was a great big passenger ship.</span> <span id="s701">Of course to us kids who had never seen a steamer, never seen anything.</span> <span id="s702">We come from a very small town, as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s703">And oh in Paris, I saw my first black people.</span> <span id="s704">I had never seen anybody but white people because there were, we were too far away from everything.</span> <span id="s705">But in Marseilles there were a number of other nationalities .</span> <span id="s706">And when we finally got on board the ship, we realized oh there are more children.</span> <span id="s707">There was one was Margot Kassel and Biata Zuskind and Biata was a smaller child.</span> <span id="s708">And my sister was going to have a birthday on that trip.</span> <span id="s709">It would have been October the 19th.</span> <span id="s710">All right.</span> <span id="s711">so my mother bought a cake for her at one of the bakeries in Marseille and very, didn’t show it to my sister, cause it was only next port would be Port Said.</span> <span id="s712">And her birthday was on the day of Port Said.</span> <span id="s713">That we arrived in Port Said.</span> <span id="s714">Well I think that’s three days away, board the ship the 16th.</span> <span id="s715">And while going down the gangplank into Port Said, all these beggars</span></p> <p><span id="s716">(end file 1) (file 2 – RG-50.106.0052.02.03 – duration: 01:03:21)</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: This is the taped interview made for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s718">The interview is with Margie Rosenthal.</span> <span id="s719">I’m the interviewer Nancy Alper.</span> <span id="s720">It’s October 24th 1996.</span> <span id="s721">This is the second tape, side A.</span> <span id="s722">Now Margie we were talking about your mother’s attempts to have a birthday celebration on board the ship on the way to Hong Kong for your sister Eva.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Well my sister being very generous at all times, my mother presented her the cake on board and we were going to have it for dessert.</span> <span id="s724">Well we come across this beggar on the street.</span> <span id="s725">My sister turns around, runs back up onto board.</span> <span id="s726">We didn’t know why she was running back and we called her and she was already up the gangplank and already gone, comes back with the cake.</span> <span id="s727">She’s giving it to the beggar.</span> <span id="s728">And my mother just having fits.</span> <span id="s729">She just said this was your cake Eva, what are you giving away?</span> <span id="s730">That poor man has nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s731">So my mother, what did she do.</span> <span id="s732">She took some money.</span> <span id="s733">Gave the money to the beggar and took the cake back which we had after all.</span> <span id="s734">But that’s how Eva is.</span> <span id="s735">She will take off her shirt and give it to you.</span> <span id="s736">Very, very soft hearted person.</span> <span id="s737">Anyway so on board ship we met a lot of other refugees.</span> <span id="s738">Like I said Margot Kassel was my sister’s age and Bi, Biata Zuskind she was a younger, she was about maybe three years old at that time, two or three years old.</span> <span id="s739">And things were pretty good but I don’t like, I didn’t know any French food.</span> <span id="s740">And for me to start eating French food when I’m used to the regular kosher German kitchen, you know was quite a change.</span> <span id="s741">So I said and I did say something to my dad.</span> <span id="s742">I don’t remember exactly what, but he said my reply was well I’m going to write to my grandmother because she will have to know how I am treated on here.</span> <span id="s743">You are treating me not well at all.</span> <span id="s744">I told my dad.</span> <span id="s745">Uh oh.</span> <span id="s746">That was the wrong thing to say, of course.</span> <span id="s747">So he said you just dare do that.</span> <span id="s748">Make a heart more heavy than she already has.</span> <span id="s749">I mean the poor woman has just lost a daughter, her granddaughter, granddaughters and now you want to write a letter and tell her how miserable things are here.</span> <span id="s750">You better not.</span> <span id="s751">Well he was right.</span> <span id="s752">Of course, I didn’t but needless to say I would never have hurt my grandmother in any, any kind of a way.</span> <span id="s753">so I had to adjust to the food.</span> <span id="s754">But you know I missed my tomatoes.</span> <span id="s755">Oh I love tomatoes and pickles and things like that.</span> <span id="s756">So there was one gentleman that was in the, working in the kitchen and I mentioned it to him.</span> <span id="s757">They all spoke some German.</span> <span id="s758">And I told him that I really missed having a fresh tomato.</span> <span id="s759">Guess what.</span> <span id="s760">At dinner he brought me a fresh tomato.</span> <span id="s761">That was the best meal I can remember.</span> <span id="s762">And every meal we had wine as well but of course children never drank the wine but the food was so different than what I had known that it took quite an adjustment and then we went from Port Said, we went over to Porti.</span> <span id="s763">Oh, Suez Canal.</span> <span id="s764">Let me not forget the Suez Canal which was a very exciting experience.</span> <span id="s765">You could see across the bank and you could see buildings.</span> <span id="s766">I mean buildings, I would say more like pyramids.</span> <span id="s767">And you see the Arabs and I mean it was so close.</span> <span id="s768">It was just a very thrilling experience and dad said you’d better remember this very well.</span> <span id="s769">This may be your last time you’re going to go through Suez Canal.</span> <span id="s770">This is something that is very, very important for you to know.</span> <span id="s771">So we really stayed on board and looked at everything.</span> <span id="s772">And then we came to Djibouti and somebody wanted to buy my sister from my mother.</span> <span id="s773">They said oh she is so cute.</span> <span id="s774">My sister had blond hair, blue eyes and curly hair.</span> <span id="s775">I mean she was very adorable.</span> <span id="s776">And they, the woman wouldn’t give up.</span> <span id="s777">She wanted to buy my sister.</span> <span id="s778">My sister said no, she’s not for sale.</span> <span id="s779">And then so then we were afraid that she was going to take her so we were always around her.</span> <span id="s780">I mean it was like until we left, you know we had to watch her every second because we really thought that she might kidnap her or something.</span> <span id="s781">And then we went to Singapore.</span> <span id="s782">Singapore was just beautiful.</span> <span id="s783">It was absolutely lovely.</span> <span id="s784">But hot.</span> <span id="s785">It was so hot and we just came from Germany and we are in autumn already in Europe.</span> <span id="s786">And we come over there and it was, I mean we were not used to the heat.</span> <span id="s787">Of course.</span> <span id="s788">But anyway we did take a walk and strolled in a little bit on the pier and then it was too much.</span> <span id="s789">And we had to turn back to the ship.</span> <span id="s790">So we never really got to see Singapore.</span> <span id="s791">And then from there my next recollection was getting to Saigon.</span> <span id="s792">Now Saigon my dad bought himself a beautiful one of those tropical helmet type things and he looked really chic and he wore that on deck all the time.</span> <span id="s793">But in Saigon we stayed there two days.</span> <span id="s794">We had French legionnaires on board.</span> <span id="s795">And these poor guys didn’t have wine or anything so the men at our table took the wine from our table and took it over there to these guys.</span> <span id="s796">And they were so happy to have something that like wine for the French.</span> <span id="s797">You know how that, it is.</span> <span id="s798">So they were so happy.</span> <span id="s799">But before I even get that far.</span> <span id="s800">Let me say something else.</span> <span id="s801">For days, there were, the people, the officers on the ship said “Keep an eye on the back of the ship.</span> <span id="s802">We have a line out.</span> <span id="s803">We hope to catch a whale.”</span> <span id="s804">Oh boy.</span> <span id="s805">With us kids, we were always checking the line that was hanging out of the back of the ship.</span> <span id="s806">And we’d see it trailing you know.</span> <span id="s807">But nothing is happening, nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s808">One day finally there was a big thing, intercom and attention, attention.</span> <span id="s809">We caught whale.</span> <span id="s810">I want most, everybody on board, children first.</span> <span id="s811">Let them see the whale.</span> <span id="s812">Before we cut the whale open.</span> <span id="s813">So oh boy.</span> <span id="s814">I mean we were in the lounge as a matter of fact, in the ladies lounge, washing our hands and everything else.</span> <span id="s815">And we run upstairs to the deck where the line was.</span> <span id="s816">And there was this long fish, dripping water still, black fish, very impressive, big huge thing.</span> <span id="s817">And they said well now all the girls, all the kids are here.</span> <span id="s818">There weren’t that many children on board because this was a luxury liner really and was dropping off the legionnaires to Saigon.</span> <span id="s819">And so it was very, very exciting.</span> <span id="s820">So we all rushed up there and were standing with bated breath.</span> <span id="s821">Now they’re going to cut the fish open, going to see what’s inside the fish.</span> <span id="s822">And the captain come out and has this big knife and he cuts it open.</span> <span id="s823">And you know what falls out.</span> <span id="s824">Candies.</span> <span id="s825">Oh it was, we had crossed I guess the dateline.</span> <span id="s826">I am not sure what exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s827">But it was so thrilling.</span> <span id="s828">All these candies fell out and they were green and different colors, mainly green that represent the eggs I guess in the whale or whatever.</span> <span id="s829">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s830">But it was so funny.</span> <span id="s831">And, oh he said take all the candy you want.</span> <span id="s832">Of course, we kids, candy.</span> <span id="s833">We all grabbed hands full and then of course there were other passengers took it too.</span> <span id="s834">So this is one of my very memorable experiences we had on the ship.</span> <span id="s835">Other than that I mean that was really nothing much happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: I think you had told me that your parents had pre-paid for the entire trip while you were still in Germany.</span> <span id="s837">It was a kind of package.</span> <span id="s838">Why don’t you tell me a little bit about that and how if you know anything, how they knew how to go about doing that.</span> <span id="s839">And another question was how many immigrants and refugees there were on the ship.</span> <span id="s840">From other countries besides France and doing something similar to what you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: No the only people were from Germany and they were the only refugees.</span> <span id="s842">And like I said there was only this one young family.</span> <span id="s843">And this one family with the daughter Margot and the one with Zuskind.</span> <span id="s844">That was the other one.</span> <span id="s845">That I believe was all there was on the ship, as far as Jewish.</span> <span id="s846">And the other ones, I don’t, there were French people going to Singapore, Saigon, really not a whole lot of people but we only knew about ours.</span> <span id="s847">And I did not mention this but the men slept separately from the women.</span> <span id="s848">So we had in our cabin was this young woman that was just married, my mother and my sister and I, four of us.</span> <span id="s849">And in dad’s cabin there were also four men.</span> <span id="s850">So they had for some reason, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s851">I guess they didn’t have the facilities to accommodate us because we were the refugees but we did pay for the passage already in Germany.</span> <span id="s852">And I believe the HIAS was helping us.</span> <span id="s853">But I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s854">I never did question them how, when and where and what.</span> <span id="s855">All I know is that we had the money that we had to put down in Breslau to the American consulate and vouch that we would never be a burden to any government.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Also I wanted to ask you, did you have a German passport.</span> <span id="s857">Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s858">When you left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: We did and it all over Juden ok.</span> <span id="s860">And by that time we were stateless.</span> <span id="s861">We did not have any more a home, so we were considered stateless.</span> <span id="s862">And in Singapore, my sister and were always on deck looking around and you know kids, there was nothing more for us to do really.</span> <span id="s863">There were no movies.</span> <span id="s864">If there were, they would have been in French.</span> <span id="s865">We would never have understood anyways, so us children kind of had to devise our own games and talk and do things like that.</span> <span id="s866">So I was looking into the hold of the ship, I see that our box that we had our furniture in, our furniture.</span> <span id="s867">I would say like bicycle and soap that my mother was bringing along and things like that.</span> <span id="s868">Oh, the few goblets of crystal.</span> <span id="s869">I mean painstakingly wrapped.</span> <span id="s870">It was a big wooden box, they called them lifts in those days.</span> <span id="s871">And that had broken open.</span> <span id="s872">And with all of those natives there, I was so afraid they were going to take it all and we wouldn’t have anything left when we got to the Philippines.</span> <span id="s873">So I told my sister, I said you watch while I go run and find dad so he can get ahold of the captain to make sure that they get it covered up again.</span> <span id="s874">Or nail it together, whatever it takes.</span> <span id="s875">Cause I don’t’ want to lose all our stuff.</span> <span id="s876">So she was standing on top there looking down.</span> <span id="s877">And I found my father pretty soon.</span> <span id="s878">And I said come quick, come quick.</span> <span id="s879">Look what’s happened.</span> <span id="s880">So he ran and got the captain and they went down in the hold and they were able to get our stuff together.</span> <span id="s881">But that is how we reached the Philippines.</span> <span id="s882">The soap had spilled out onto the bicycle.</span> <span id="s883">The bicycle had rusted away.</span> <span id="s884">So by that time we really didn’t have a bicycle.</span> <span id="s885">We didn’t’ have much of soap.</span> <span id="s886">I mean a lot of stuff was ruined regardless you know.</span> <span id="s887">But anyways so that was in Saigon.</span> <span id="s888">And on the way from Saigon to Hong Kong came the typhoon.</span> <span id="s889">Everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s890">Everybody was sick.</span> <span id="s891">We couldn’t go to the dining room.</span> <span id="s892">And oh my dad’s hat flew away that he just so painstakingly bought in Saigon.</span> <span id="s893">Went overboard and it was gone.</span> <span id="s894">He was more upset about that than I think anything else because it was such a nice helmet type thing that they wore in the Orient you know.</span> <span id="s895">Anyway so we were too sick to eat.</span> <span id="s896">But my dad was at the table, eating.</span> <span id="s897">I mean we could never understand how could you eat.</span> <span id="s898">We were so sick that the doctor had to give us medications because we couldn’t hold food down and we couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s899">I mean it was horrible and I mean, all the passengers were sick.</span> <span id="s900">Except my dad and this young guy that had just gotten married.</span> <span id="s901">The two of them had the whole dining room to themselves.</span> <span id="s902">And they had all the food they wanted.</span> <span id="s903">And they had to put the plates into containers which were bolted to the tables.</span> <span id="s904">Otherwise they would be sliding this way and sliding that way.</span> <span id="s905">But we finally made it into Kowloon which is Hong Kong China.</span> <span id="s906">But we had to stay in Kowloon because that’s where the ship docked.</span> <span id="s907">Now we needed shots in Kowloon because we didn’t get the malaria and, and that, whatever the tropical diseases were.</span> <span id="s908">So we had to go to this Chinese doctor who had an office in this building.</span> <span id="s909">The staircase was so narrow and so dark that we could hardly see where we were going.</span> <span id="s910">Well my imagination was oh my god he’s going to abduct us and we’re not going to go get anywhere and we’re going to be sold as slaves or something like that.</span> <span id="s911">Like I said I had a very vivid imagination.</span> <span id="s912">And we made it up the stairs.</span> <span id="s913">Got our shots, came back down and we were all kind of (sniffs) like this you know.</span> <span id="s914">We were kind of crying cause it was hurting.</span> <span id="s915">And my dad said all right, I had a, I couldn’t take my big doll from Germany but I was able to take the smaller version.</span> <span id="s916">And I loved that doll.</span> <span id="s917">Of course I had to name her Suzie also, naturally because I left my Suzie one in Germany so this was also Suzie.</span> <span id="s918">So he said how about we buy Suzie a dress.</span> <span id="s919">Well that was a big deal so I went with him to, with my parents into this beautiful store that had all embroidered things.</span> <span id="s920">And I said I showed them the doll and they said we’ve got the thing for you.</span> <span id="s921">They gave me this beautiful dress for my doll.</span> <span id="s922">Oh it was absolutely gorgeous.</span> <span id="s923">All kinds of embroidery and all it was so pretty.</span> <span id="s924">So now I had a dress.</span> <span id="s925">And we stayed in a very pretty hotel in Hong Kong and the food, I guess I had gotten used to eating almost anything because if you’re hungry you’ll have to eat.</span> <span id="s926">And so I did eat French.</span> <span id="s927">Now I was going to experience Chinese food.</span> <span id="s928">Which was again something different, but noodles I liked so that was ok.</span> <span id="s929">We ate a lot of noodles.</span> <span id="s930">And we did take a trip also over to Hong Kong which is by ferry boat which was kind of exciting for us as well.</span> <span id="s931">So we were a few days in, I can’t remember exactly the how many days we were in Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s932">But then we were on our way to the Philippines on a not with a passenger ship which I thought we would have.</span> <span id="s933">No.</span> <span id="s934">We had to leave the ship and go on a freighter, a small freighter and there we were all in one cabin together.</span> <span id="s935">But my dad always liked to have the round window, the portholes opened because he liked it.</span> <span id="s936">So while dad was there and he had his mouth open one of us kids, I guess probably it was me, took a raisin and threw it in his mouth and he thought it was a fly.</span> <span id="s937">And he started coughing and screaming and yelling.</span> <span id="s938">I swallowed a fly, I swallowed a fly.</span> <span id="s939">But then we laughed and he says what happened.</span> <span id="s940">What did you guys do.</span> <span id="s941">And you know how kids do pranks like that.</span> <span id="s942">So we told him, it was only a raisin.</span> <span id="s943">Well the next day he was sleeping again, the window open again.</span> <span id="s944">This time a big wave came and he thought we’re drowning.</span> <span id="s945">He’s screaming we’re drowning, we’re drowning.</span> <span id="s946">Why don’t we all jump.</span> <span id="s947">You know he thought for sure we were drowning.</span> <span id="s948">As it was, a wave had come into the cabin on top of him.</span> <span id="s949">And all he could he was breathing.</span> <span id="s950">I mean he had been sleeping and all of a sudden he was like d, you know being drenched with this ocean water.</span> <span id="s951">And so that was another experience that we won’t forget, because he thought for sure we were drowning.</span> <span id="s952">Well anyway we make it finally to Manila and we</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: How long did the trip take all together?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Hmm.</span> <span id="s955">Mmm.</span> <span id="s956">Ok we left Marseilles around the, I would say the 16th yeah, 16th of October and we did not get the, between all that, we did not get to Manila til the 16th, no, 14th of November.</span> <span id="s957">I did forget to mention something and now it came at just now I had a loss of memory again but it’ll get back to me, ok.</span> <span id="s958">And we were met at the docks by the Jewish committee and they took us to a hotel in the walled city.</span> <span id="s959">The walled city is called Intramuros and that is a very old.</span> <span id="s960">That was because of the Spaniards and the Spanish were occupying Manila.</span> <span id="s961">That was a fortress and so this time you know it was very exciting to be living in something like that and, but they warned us don’t leave any food out.</span> <span id="s962">Because of the rats that go around these old buildings.</span> <span id="s963">Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s964">Now we are afraid of rats as well.</span> <span id="s965">I mean I love animals, but I don’t’ think I’d like rats.</span> <span id="s966">So we would take food upstairs but have to wrap it in linen napkin, very well.</span> <span id="s967">And they still got to it.</span> <span id="s968">So we still all the food we brought upstairs was eaten you know nibbled on during the night by these stupid rats.</span> <span id="s969">And we only stayed there like 3 days.</span> <span id="s970">And then the Jewish committee said we’ll give, tell you where you can go and rent something.</span> <span id="s971">So we rented the upstairs of a house.</span> <span id="s972">Downstairs was a Filipino dentist.</span> <span id="s973">And upstairs was for us refugees.</span> <span id="s974">My parents, other people I don’t even remember their names very well but every room was occupied by a different family.</span> <span id="s975">And one, then we had a single bachelor and he had to sleep outside on the sofa because we just ran out of room.</span> <span id="s976">And this man gets up the next morning and he says he yelled at us.</span> <span id="s977">He says you kids are playing tricks on me again.</span> <span id="s978">Apparently somebody played a trick on him on one of the ships where he came from.</span> <span id="s979">And we don’t know which ship he came on because there were quite a few refugees at that time, already.</span> <span id="s980">Anyhow so he accused us of taking his pants and hiding them.</span> <span id="s981">Well we didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s982">so everybody started looking for his pants because he said, how I can’t even get out of bed you know.</span> <span id="s983">So finally somebody looked down.</span> <span id="s984">All the windows in the Philippines had bars by the way because a lot of robberies took place.</span> <span id="s985">So we looked down and sure enough on the ground were his pants.</span> <span id="s986">And so we kids went and got them.</span> <span id="s987">And how in the world did they do that.</span> <span id="s988">We asked the dentist downstairs.</span> <span id="s989">Oh he said easy.</span> <span id="s990">They are on a tree, which is a ways away but same level as your upstairs, up, apartment is and he said they just take a fishhook, fish line, hook the pants bring them out, take the money and leave the pants.</span> <span id="s991">That’s exactly what they did.</span> <span id="s992">They took all of his money.</span> <span id="s993">They took his papers and everything else but they left his pants.</span> <span id="s994">So that was our one experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: You had mentioned being excited about going to the jungle.</span> <span id="s996">And I was wondering what your earliest impressions were of what the Philippines were like compared to what you had been thinking it was going to be like and how it compared to your experience in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: A far cry from Germany, a very far cry.</span> <span id="s998">There were palm trees, all right with coconuts on them.</span> <span id="s999">And the Filipinos would climb up the tree and throw down the coconuts for us.</span> <span id="s1000">And we could crack them open, but first they had a green hull around them which had to be stripped, but they all carried knives, bolos, you know.</span> <span id="s1001">And so like hatchet, big hatchet things.</span> <span id="s1002">Oh very vicious looking deals.</span> <span id="s1003">And that’s what they used to do.</span> <span id="s1004">But I could not see any jungle.</span> <span id="s1005">I mean these were paved streets.</span> <span id="s1006">These were houses.</span> <span id="s1007">And I thought well maybe when we move further in, you know away from the city area, I might find the jungle.</span> <span id="s1008">Well it didn’t quite happen that way.</span> <span id="s1009">We only stayed in there one month because that was no place for us, when they can hook something and take things out of there.</span> <span id="s1010">That was not for us.</span> <span id="s1011">So then again we have asked the Jewish committee, where we could go and where we could live.</span> <span id="s1012">So they said well there is a house.</span> <span id="s1013">I’ll show you but you have to share it with another family.</span> <span id="s1014">Well no problem, I mean, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s1015">So we met the Kostenits family, a husband, wife and one daughter.</span> <span id="s1016">The daughter was just a couple of years older than I was.</span> <span id="s1017">And so that was a beautiful complex.</span> <span id="s1018">It was, it belonged to I think a mayor, Resal.</span> <span id="s1019">His last name was Resal.</span> <span id="s1020">I don’t remember his first name.</span> <span id="s1021">But there are a lot of Resals over there.</span> <span id="s1022">There are lot, it’s a very popular name.</span> <span id="s1023">And this house was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1024">It had, downstairs was a hall.</span> <span id="s1025">Cause it was like a dance hall.</span> <span id="s1026">Oh it was huge.</span> <span id="s1027">And then you went up the stairs and upstairs were the living quarters – the kitchen, three bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1028">One was occupied by my parents.</span> <span id="s1029">One was occupied by the girl, Eva.</span> <span id="s1030">Kostenits parents.</span> <span id="s1031">And the other room was for us three girls.</span> <span id="s1032">And it also had a very long veranda out front.</span> <span id="s1033">The length of the house.</span> <span id="s1034">Of course, also it had bars.</span> <span id="s1035">Downstairs, upstairs and so forth.</span> <span id="s1036">The only bar that wasn’t on was in the kitchen because they felt I guess there wasn’t much to steal in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1037">So anyway so we moved in with what we had, not a whole lot because like I said the bicycle was already ruined from the ocean water and everything else so I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1038">My dad wasn’t able to clean it up.</span> <span id="s1039">There was just no way of rescuing it.</span> <span id="s1040">My mother’s soap became like soap suds.</span> <span id="s1041">There was hardly anything left of that.</span> <span id="s1042">But we did have a few clothes that we had brought along and we were able to use them.</span> <span id="s1043">But since we knew that this was going to be temporary because it was for two people, we wanted something for ourselves and they wanted something for themselves as well.</span> <span id="s1044">But what happened is which made us move even faster, was we were sleeping one night and I was awoken by a man putting his arms around my neck and putting his face next to me.</span> <span id="s1045">And I woke up and I yelled.</span> <span id="s1046">A boy wants to kiss me.</span> <span id="s1047">I like I said my imagination, I have very vivid imagination.</span> <span id="s1048">At this time, by that time I was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s1049">My birthday was in July and you know time passes on.</span> <span id="s1050">so this was July and I was 12.</span> <span id="s1051">And but back to this robber.</span> <span id="s1052">He was taking a check on what I was wearing and he had been already to somebody else.</span> <span id="s1053">I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s1054">It was my sister or the other gal.</span> <span id="s1055">both were named Eva so I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1056">And so this lady next door in the bedroom said oh go to sleep you had a, you had a dream.</span> <span id="s1057">You just, go back to sleep, go back to sleep.</span> <span id="s1058">I said no he’s creeping out now.</span> <span id="s1059">He’s leaving.</span> <span id="s1060">He’s leaving.</span> <span id="s1061">Catch him, somebody stop him.</span> <span id="s1062">You know.</span> <span id="s1063">And so my parents, by my voice could tell immediately that something was wrong.</span> <span id="s1064">So my mom got up and of course she saw the window to the kitchen wide open.</span> <span id="s1065">The door to the, from the kitchen going down was wide open, things scattered all over the place.</span> <span id="s1066">And my dad had a very bad habit, of taking his rings off at night.</span> <span id="s1067">Wedding ring and all.</span> <span id="s1068">Well that was gone.</span> <span id="s1069">The wedding ring was gone.</span> <span id="s1070">The watch was gone and that he was very upset about.</span> <span id="s1071">And then we had some eau de cologne that we had brought from Germany.</span> <span id="s1072">It had a gold cap on it, sort of gold metal thing.</span> <span id="s1073">They took that.</span> <span id="s1074">They thought that was the real thing.</span> <span id="s1075">So what over a period of time, I mean this is how we lost some things.</span> <span id="s1076">You know robberies.</span> <span id="s1077">So he took quite a few things with him.</span> <span id="s1078">He took we had brought coral necklaces, my sister and I. Those he took.</span> <span id="s1079">Oh a few odds and ends, I mean.</span> <span id="s1080">At this time I don’t’ even remember what all the man did take, but he was so deft at it that he had gone to this one, and nobody, he was in my parents’ room and they didn’t even feel his presence or hear him or that is so very quiet.</span> <span id="s1081">If he hadn’t touched me I might not have woke up.</span> <span id="s1082">But he made the mistake of touching me.</span> <span id="s1083">With that I woke up.</span> <span id="s1084">And they said had he had I worn earrings he would have probably been able to take them out.</span> <span id="s1085">I would not have felt it.</span> <span id="s1086">And the necklace the same thing.</span> <span id="s1087">He, they do it in one, one grab, feeling for necklace and earrings.</span> <span id="s1088">And being I’m a light sleeper, that he was able to take it.</span> <span id="s1089">Not, I mean not get to it.</span> <span id="s1090">Then we called, I guess I didn’t call, we didn’t call the police.</span> <span id="s1091">We had no phone of course.</span> <span id="s1092">Somebody heard us and commotion and so the people next door that lived there came over and asked what went on and we told them.</span> <span id="s1093">And so I see this Filipino man coming up the stairs and I’m yelling.</span> <span id="s1094">I said “that’s him, that’s him”.</span> <span id="s1095">At night it you know this is night time we’re talking about.</span> <span id="s1096">He had on white t-shirt and white shorts.</span> <span id="s1097">So did this man that was creeping out of the room that had touched me and he too had.</span> <span id="s1098">So I said “that’s him, that’s him”.</span> <span id="s1099">And they kept saying “no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1100">No, he’s our houseboy.”</span> <span id="s1101">I said “that’s the man, I saw him.”</span> <span id="s1102">But of course it wasn’t him.</span> <span id="s1103">But I was so hysterical at that point that, and then of course I was afraid to sleep.</span> <span id="s1104">They had to look under the beds, they had to look everywhere before I would even go to bed.</span> <span id="s1105">I mean I was just so afraid of everything.</span> <span id="s1106">By then and to this day, I am still.</span> <span id="s1107">I mean this wasn’t the only robbery.</span> <span id="s1108">I’ll get to that later.</span> <span id="s1109">But to this very day I don’t trust anybody.</span> <span id="s1110">When I had a dog in America, I was fine.</span> <span id="s1111">We lost our dog.</span> <span id="s1112">Now I have ADT which is a security system installed.</span> <span id="s1113">And my husband can’t understand it.</span> <span id="s1114">He’s from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1115">But me, I am from the Philippines.</span> <span id="s1116">And we had so many robberies that I am paranoid about things like that.</span> <span id="s1117">Anyway, so that was one of the experiences with the robbery.</span> <span id="s1118">The very first one.</span> <span id="s1119">Then these people moved out and they moved across to the next house.</span> <span id="s1120">And then we took another family in because nobody could afford to pay that kind of rent and my dad still didn’t have a job.</span> <span id="s1121">So they kept saying “you’ll find one.</span> <span id="s1122">Don’t worry, you’ll find one.”</span> <span id="s1123">But I went, enrolled as we had to go to school of course.</span> <span id="s1124">I mean we can’t do without school.</span> <span id="s1125">So my parents enrolled us into a parochial school run by the German nuns.</span> <span id="s1126">They figured because German nuns would be helpful in learning, then we could learn to speak English better than we did.</span> <span id="s1127">So they put me into fourth grade and my sister was very young so she went into first grade.</span> <span id="s1128">Well, after a while they realized that I’m not, I’m too far ahead because I you know I had already been in the fifth grade in Germany.</span> <span id="s1129">So they put me into fourth first and then they put me into fifth.</span> <span id="s1130">So that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1131">Into fourth grade first and then into the fifth.</span> <span id="s1132">Then before I knew it we were kicked out of school.</span> <span id="s1133">My mother was called.</span> <span id="s1134">Come to school.</span> <span id="s1135">We want to talk to all the parents were called one by one.</span> <span id="s1136">And the head, the Mother Superior said to my family, my mother, sorry you have to take your children out.</span> <span id="s1137">My mother said, why.</span> <span id="s1138">Well because you’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1139">My mother said because we’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1140">We just left Germany bruise we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1141">Well, we’re being persecuted here too.</span> <span id="s1142">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: This is side 2, Side B of the second tape, the interview with Margie Rosenthal for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, by Nancy Alper.</span> <span id="s1144">The date is October 24, 1996.</span> <span id="s1145">And Margie you and I before I turned the machine on were just talking about your hearing on board ship, on your way to Manila, about the happening of Kristallnacht in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: We heard that the temples had been burned and that there was a big closings of the stores of the Jewish merchants and that must have come in over the radio to the operator on board ship.</span> <span id="s1147">And he passed it along to the refugees that were on board.</span> <span id="s1148">So we knew how close my dad had gotten to not even getting us out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1149">And that was a very fortunate thing for us that we made it out before all this took place.</span> <span id="s1150">Oh, they were arresting all the Jewish people but the men especially the men.</span> <span id="s1151">And taking them to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1152">And my uncle, my aunt Ruth’s husband, Herbert Binger was one of the first that they took to the concentration camp, Dachau.</span> <span id="s1153">And he was there so that’s how we had heard only through letters, that were in Manila by the time we reached Manila.</span> <span id="s1154">And I also forgot to mention the fact that when we got off the ship in Manila, there was a girl that had a cousin waiting on her at the pier or the docks in Manila.</span> <span id="s1155">And she said to her cousin, she said “Hey” she said “who’s that Chinese lady that, that Chinese girl that’s there with you that came off the ship.</span> <span id="s1156">She is Chinese.”</span> <span id="s1157">And my girlfriend said “Oh no, she’s one of us.”</span> <span id="s1158">And I was so devastated when I heard that, I had never forgotten that ever since.</span> <span id="s1159">It’s been bothering me and I told her about that, the last day that we were here together at the reunion but I’m getting ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s1160">Now back to our moving around to the Santa Escolastica school and going to classes over there.</span> <span id="s1161">And the boy that had, we had to leave the school because this little boy that was in kindergarten, he apparently had either stomped on the picture of Jesus or spit on it or both.</span> <span id="s1162">I’m not exactly sure.</span> <span id="s1163">But the Mother Superior told my mother that she has to take us out of school because we cannot expect, she said “we cannot expect Jewish children to come and study at the Catholic school.</span> <span id="s1164">We wouldn’t go to your school.”</span> <span id="s1165">So my mother said “well we don’t have a school.</span> <span id="s1166">There are just a handful of Jewish children here.”</span> <span id="s1167">She said, “Well then it’s time you opened one up.”</span> <span id="s1168">And with that my mother was so upset that she said “yes, ok”.</span> <span id="s1169">So all of the kids that were in that school.</span> <span id="s1170">There weren’t all that many.</span> <span id="s1171">But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave.</span> <span id="s1172">But while I was in classes over there, the children all made fun of my English because my English was the Oxford English and if I said something like looking glass or either or neither, they just would laugh and that would really embarrass me.</span> <span id="s1173">And then another thing that happened is there are so many cats over there and somehow, I didn’t know yet.</span> <span id="s1174">I learned later on that you had to be very careful where you stepped because if you stepped into some cat do, you would get that horrible smell on you and the whole class would smell badly.</span> <span id="s1175">And somebody would say “hm, I smell something horrible.</span> <span id="s1176">Margie, did you step into something.”</span> <span id="s1177">And you know what, I really was the one that did it.</span> <span id="s1178">So they’d send me out of the class.</span> <span id="s1179">I had to clean my shoes off.</span> <span id="s1180">The bottom and wherever I stepped into it and then I could return to the class.</span> <span id="s1181">But I still had a few very ugly experiences over in Santa Escolastica.</span> <span id="s1182">So when they told us we had to leave I really wasn’t all that sorry.</span> <span id="s1183">To me, that was kind of a new page in my life.</span> <span id="s1184">I was going on from this bad experience with the German sisters.</span> <span id="s1185">So we moved, this was Pasay where we were living in that big house and that where we shared with so many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: You weren’t in Intramuros anymore.</span> <span id="s1187">Is Pasay a suburb of Manila.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yeah, by the way yeah, Pasay is a suburb of Manila.</span> <span id="s1189">And Pasay had also the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s1190">I think they were located either very close to it or I’m not sure exactly where.</span> <span id="s1191">But they told my dad that he should use his money up first and not to worry about a job.</span> <span id="s1192">It’ll come, it’ll come and my dad said “yeah but I don’t’ want to use everything up.</span> <span id="s1193">We’ll have nothing to live on anymore.”</span> <span id="s1194">And they said “oh, it’s all right.</span> <span id="s1195">You’ll find work.</span> <span id="s1196">You’ll find.”</span> <span id="s1197">So it was over a year later that my dad finally did.</span> <span id="s1198">But not until we moved to Ermita.</span> <span id="s1199">But I do want to say one more thing what happened to me while we were living in Pasay.</span> <span id="s1200">We had this one lady that had a baby and her husband, they were living with us at that time in the big house.</span> <span id="s1201">And she asked my mother if I could go and get her some sanitary napkins.</span> <span id="s1202">So my mother said yeah she should go.</span> <span id="s1203">So she gave me some one and she said “why don’t you go to the market, over” which was not all that far away.</span> <span id="s1204">And she said “go and get me a box of sanitary napkins”.</span> <span id="s1205">And I went ahead and I was about 12 years old at the time.</span> <span id="s1206">And I went over there and I said “I want a box of sanitary napkins”.</span> <span id="s1207">And this Chinese merchant said to me, he says do you know what they are.</span> <span id="s1208">And I says “Of course,” I said “it’s a napkin that you wipe your mouth with when you are done”.</span> <span id="s1209">Well they all were laughing like crazy and I couldn’t understand why they are laughing.</span> <span id="s1210">To me it was a very serious matter.</span> <span id="s1211">So when I went home I told my mother, I said “you know they were laughing but when I, they asked me if I knew what a sanitary napkin was and I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1212">All I said is well it’s something that you have to use when you eat your lunch or dinner and you wipe your mouth and to be you know.</span> <span id="s1213">Etiquette, it reminds you to have a napkin.</span> <span id="s1214">And they roared, they absolutely roared.”</span> <span id="s1215">And she said “oh my goodness”.</span> <span id="s1216">She said you don’t know really, do you?”</span> <span id="s1217">I said “what should I know”.</span> <span id="s1218">And she said “Well that’s when you get your period.”</span> <span id="s1219">Well I was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s1220">From that moment on, when I had to go to the market I went across the street.</span> <span id="s1221">I passed them so I wouldn’t have to look at them or go near them.</span> <span id="s1222">It was the most embarrassing moment of my life, I think at that point.</span> <span id="s1223">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1224">Anyway, from like I said from Pasay we did finally move to Ermita because first of all there were no jobs to be had over where we were living in Pasay and there was a nice school with American nuns and I think really that was the main reason that my parents moved to Ermita.</span> <span id="s1225">There were many other suburbs they could have gone to, suburbs of Manila that they could have gone to.</span> <span id="s1226">But that so we went over to meet the sisters of Maryknoll.</span> <span id="s1227">And they were so wonderful.</span> <span id="s1228">They opened their arms, took us in.</span> <span id="s1229">We had to pay which we did too at Santa Escolastica.</span> <span id="s1230">Nothing is for free.</span> <span id="s1231">We even had to buy uniforms at Santa Escolastica.</span> <span id="s1232">And now we had to buy uniforms again in Maryknoll, at or college.</span> <span id="s1233">But Maryknoll college uniform was very pretty.</span> <span id="s1234">It was a wine red full skirt with bib like.</span> <span id="s1235">And underneath you had a beige blouse, short sleeves and it had a wine red ribbon around the collar which was very pretty.</span> <span id="s1236">It was kind of a pleated top and down to the waist and then again pleat from the waist down.</span> <span id="s1237">And we really loved the sisters.</span> <span id="s1238">It was so wonderful.</span> <span id="s1239">And being we were Jewish we were not required to take religious lessons as we had to do in Santa Escolastica.</span> <span id="s1240">We had to attend all the lessons, but over there they gave me the freedom.</span> <span id="s1241">If I wanted to, I could sit in the back of the class and just listen.</span> <span id="s1242">Well I thought that was very interesting for me was the history so I just sat there and listened to all the teachings of Jesus Christ and the parables and all the things that happened and saints and what have.</span> <span id="s1243">And then it came.</span> <span id="s1244">Oh before I go on, I was put into the sixth grade right then and there because I was in fifth grade at Santa Escolastica.</span> <span id="s1245">And they thought that I would fit very well into the sixth grade.</span> <span id="s1246">So I was in the sixth grade.</span> <span id="s1247">And they had a test, an examination at the end of the school year and they said would you like to take the examination on, on the religious part of it.</span> <span id="s1248">I said sure.</span> <span id="s1249">What have I to lose.</span> <span id="s1250">I mean after all you know I’m not supposed to be here but I’ll take it.</span> <span id="s1251">And believe it or not I was on the honor roll, the second person on the honor, I did better than the Catholics did.</span> <span id="s1252">And the sisters told it all over the school.</span> <span id="s1253">Can you imagine.</span> <span id="s1254">We have a Jewish girl and she got a 98% whereas you kids don’t even get anything.</span> <span id="s1255">You are barely passing.</span> <span id="s1256">And so I was really thrilled.</span> <span id="s1257">And then came the seventh grade.</span> <span id="s1258">And again I was on the honor roll and again I was on the top in fact this time I was on the first on the honor roll.</span> <span id="s1259">I was number one which made me very happy.</span> <span id="s1260">And it pleased them immensely.</span> <span id="s1261">Then we graduated from the seventh grade.</span> <span id="s1262">Well that is a big deal.</span> <span id="s1263">The archbishop has to come in and he has to bless the children and you had to have special uniforms.</span> <span id="s1264">White dress and I, well my mother really couldn’t afford to buy a white dress so one of the classmates of mine said oh her sister already graduated and I could fit into her dress.</span> <span id="s1265">And that’s what happened and I had to go forward and kiss the ring.</span> <span id="s1266">I pretended to kiss it.</span> <span id="s1267">I didn’t really kiss, I didn’t think it was sanitary enough to kiss the ring, but I did and from then on I went to high school.</span> <span id="s1268">And in the first year of high school, I learned Latin and that was a very difficult language.</span> <span id="s1269">And then the war broke out.</span> <span id="s1270">And that was the end of it for my school of that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Where did you go to high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: The very same place.</span> <span id="s1273">Maryknoll College.</span> <span id="s1274">They also had a high school.</span> <span id="s1275">And at that point I was, let’s see 14 years old, 14 years old.</span> <span id="s1276">It was 1941 and I’m trying to get the figures in my head.</span> <span id="s1277">Anyhow, anyway I didn’t not even complete the high school, the first year of high school because the war did break out in December.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Before we get to that part of what you went through because it was so different and involving, what was your experience with the Jewish community or your association with the Jewish community in Manila between your arrival at the end of 1938 and say the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: We had by that time, we had joined the congregation.</span> <span id="s1280">The Temple Emil and we had a wonderful person that was I think he wasn’t really a rabbi.</span> <span id="s1281">He was the father of Rebecca Konigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s1282">And he knew all the customs so he was leading the congregation there for a number of years.</span> <span id="s1283">And we went to Sunday School.</span> <span id="s1284">We took Hebrew lessons.</span> <span id="s1285">We, we learned a lot in that time.</span> <span id="s1286">And even through all the war years, we still were going to that temple until the very end of the occupation.</span> <span id="s1287">But let me not get ahead of it.</span> <span id="s1288">We moved to Ermita and we had to share again a lower flat like.</span> <span id="s1289">It had several bedrooms and we rented it in the beginning, we rented it to American businessmen.</span> <span id="s1290">Then they left.</span> <span id="s1291">Then we rented it to an American woman with a child and the man was in the military.</span> <span id="s1292">And then they were evacuated because they knew that something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1293">People had an inkling that war was not far away but nobody really talked about it, that this was in 1940 I would say.</span> <span id="s1294">And then white Russians moved in.</span> <span id="s1295">After they all had left, so we had quite a turn over, over there, but we always were able to rent it.</span> <span id="s1296">And before all this, I do want to say something really cute.</span> <span id="s1297">We had a black cat.</span> <span id="s1298">And this cat was like a little dog.</span> <span id="s1299">It would know exactly when we would come from school, at lunch time and would sit at the gate waiting for us.</span> <span id="s1300">And it was adorable.</span> <span id="s1301">That cat was just like a, like a little, it was like, but like a cat, it wasn’t, wasn’t a cat.</span> <span id="s1302">It was like a dog I want to say.</span> <span id="s1303">And then my mother saw a black cat one day out while she was shopping for groceries.</span> <span id="s1304">And she said “my goodness, that looks like our cat Peter”.</span> <span id="s1305">So she was feeding this cat Peter all the way to the home and guess what.</span> <span id="s1306">There was our cat in the window sitting and looking.</span> <span id="s1307">So she had fed this strange black cat who was very happy to receive the food.</span> <span id="s1308">That was one of the funny experiences we had during that time.</span> <span id="s1309">Anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: I forgot to ask you.</span> <span id="s1311">Do you remember approximately when your father got the job with the Ford motor company and what that did to your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: My dad got the job after one year, which was 1939.</span> <span id="s1313">He did get a job with Ford Motors as a purchasing agent.</span> <span id="s1314">And he had to drive the car around and pick up parts and things like that and he really loved the job.</span> <span id="s1315">It was very nice and he really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1316">And we were very happy to finally have you know some extra money.</span> <span id="s1317">And in the meanwhile, we got a word that in Manila, in, I’m sorry in Shanghai an uncle who had been coming over Manila and we couldn’t keep him there, had gone on to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1318">Had pneumonia and passed away and left my aunt with a six year old daughter.</span> <span id="s1319">That was in 1939.</span> <span id="s1320">The same age as my sister.</span> <span id="s1321">So it was a very trying experience for her so we were able to send her money so she would have something to live on.</span> <span id="s1322">And then came the news that my grandmother was still in Germany and had to get out.</span> <span id="s1323">So again we had to send some money and to, into Shanghai and my grandmother got the very last train out of Germany, over Siberia to go to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: Now when you say your grandmother you’re talking about Anna Zusman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Yes, yes it was Anna Zusman that was my grandmother that was left behind.</span> <span id="s1326">The other ones I, like I said I don’t even know you know.</span> <span id="s1327">I knew they were in Katowice.</span> <span id="s1328">That’s the last, we had said our goodbyes over there.</span> <span id="s1329">And my grandmother in Germany, she by that time everybody had to wear the Star of David on their, the yellow star of David, or an arm band.</span> <span id="s1330">They had to be identified as Jews.</span> <span id="s1331">And when friends that she had before wouldn’t’ even talk to her.</span> <span id="s1332">That they ran across the street or just to get out of the way so they wouldn’t have to greet her.</span> <span id="s1333">And so</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: this is probably a good time for me to ask you.</span> <span id="s1335">You mentioned there were letters waiting for you when you got to Manila.</span> <span id="s1336">And although you knew about Kristallnacht from on board the ship, I assume you learned more things from the correspondence that you had waiting for you in Manila.</span> <span id="s1337">I wanted to ask you about that correspondence and whether you were able to continue receiving mail after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Yes we did letters, get letters from my aunt and my grandmothers stating the fact that my uncle now was in a concentration camp and he has to get out.</span> <span id="s1339">Out of Germany because that’s the only way he could get out of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1340">Now my uncle had already years ago had TV.</span> <span id="s1341">He was so he had weak lungs.</span> <span id="s1342">So when he went into we tried to keep him Manila by the way.</span> <span id="s1343">We tried everything.</span> <span id="s1344">We went to the HIAS, we went to the Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s1345">We tried every which way and there was absolutely no way they could, we could keep them over there which was very disturbing to us because we had hoped that they could stay with us.</span> <span id="s1346">And as fate would have it.</span> <span id="s1347">they went to Shanghai and that’s the only place my grandmother, Anna Zusman could go.</span> <span id="s1348">So perhaps this was the way fate played it on us, that she was saved that way.</span> <span id="s1349">And she died in Shanghai at, of old age but my aunt said that also she had stomach cancer and nobody wanted to really talk about it.</span> <span id="s1350">And thinking now about the going back to the beginning.</span> <span id="s1351">I’m trying to remember in sequence how things were going.</span> <span id="s1352">In Ermita, when we found out that the war was coming.</span> <span id="s1353">My dad of course was still working on the pier.</span> <span id="s1354">And then the Japanese started bombing us very, very heavily.</span> <span id="s1355">And there was no difference between military objects or private people.</span> <span id="s1356">It just didn’t’ matter.</span> <span id="s1357">And we could always tell when you saw them in morning, early high up above at around 8:00, that would mean they would bomb us.</span> <span id="s1358">If they weren’t there at 8:00 that day they would not bomb.</span> <span id="s1359">SO this was from December the eighth until oh, into I think it was like February when they finally decided to invade us.</span> <span id="s1360">And my dad was working like I say on the docks and they’re bombing all the time.</span> <span id="s1361">And then the Americans had to set fire to all of the ships’ cargo and everything that was on the docks.</span> <span id="s1362">They didn’t want to leave anything to the Japanese of course.</span> <span id="s1363">So the people were told, take whatever you can carry.</span> <span id="s1364">The ships are open to you.</span> <span id="s1365">The factories are open to you.</span> <span id="s1366">Grab whatever you can.</span> <span id="s1367">Make as many trips as you can and get all the food or whatever you feel like you’re going to grab and if you can make several trips go for it.</span> <span id="s1368">So people would pass our house with, carrying things like clothing and just materials so my mother bought a couple of materials from these people and we bought potatoes because potatoes did not grow in Manila.</span> <span id="s1369">They had to be imported.</span> <span id="s1370">So and we were used to eating potatoes.</span> <span id="s1371">So then my dad got a bicycle from the company and they said take whatever you can take.</span> <span id="s1372">So he just took the bicycle and a few odds and ends.</span> <span id="s1373">But no, not a whole lot.</span> <span id="s1374">We’re not, he wasn’t the kind of person to just take.</span> <span id="s1375">But we did get a few things from the people that were dragging it and then they could go back and get more.</span> <span id="s1376">This way they had money and at the same time were able to get some groceries or foods, I mean clothing and whatever else we could possibly use.</span> <span id="s1377">One thing we heard about and that was kind of a strange situation.</span> <span id="s1378">These people, there were four of them.</span> <span id="s1379">And they were carrying this, they saw this huge heavy box.</span> <span id="s1380">And they figured there must be something wonderful in that box.</span> <span id="s1381">So the four, four people are carrying it.</span> <span id="s1382">And they took it all the way down to, into our area and along the beach.</span> <span id="s1383">It was called Dewey Boulevard, it was a beautiful, it wasn’t a beach.</span> <span id="s1384">First it was a street and then there was a beach.</span> <span id="s1385">That this was Dewey Boulevard with a street that they were walking on and dragging things and pulling and whatever they could do.</span> <span id="s1386">And finally got far enough from the fire and opened it up and inside was a coffin with a dead person who was on his way to wherever they were going next to be buried.</span> <span id="s1387">Well needless to say that was the end of that, never got to go to his resting place.</span> <span id="s1388">And then the fire was going a lot.</span> <span id="s1389">I mean it was all around.</span> <span id="s1390">They were trying to burn as much as they could.</span> <span id="s1391">But they did not burn homes or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1392">it was just at the pier.</span> <span id="s1393">And then pretty soon the Japanese started marching in and the Americans had already left for Bataan and I think Corregidor and they went kind of away from Manila.</span> <span id="s1394">And only people left were the civilians.</span> <span id="s1395">Us.</span> <span id="s1396">And we were declared open city, a long time ago but the Japanese just didn’t’ care.</span> <span id="s1397">they bombed us anyway.</span> <span id="s1398">And that is how some people did get killed, injured et cetera.</span> <span id="s1399">We were safe.</span> <span id="s1400">We were very, very fortunate that we did not get killed.</span> <span id="s1401">And my dad being, working with the at the docks for so long, it was a miracle that he wasn’t hit by something or other.</span> <span id="s1402">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Before we go on to the Japanese occupation, I didn’t want to forget to ask you about whether the Filipinos treated you any differently because you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1404">Whether the Jewish community there was treated any worse than any other part of the white immigrant or refugee community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: No, they treated us very well.</span> <span id="s1406">I mean they to them Judaism didn’t’ mean anything different.</span> <span id="s1407">We believed in God.</span> <span id="s1408">They believed in God.</span> <span id="s1409">The majority of the people there were anyway Catholics and there was, they were very strict Catholics.</span> <span id="s1410">They would go to Mass and they really respected everybody.</span> <span id="s1411">And therefore they believed in the Ten Commandments.</span> <span id="s1412">Honor thy parents, love thy neighbors.</span> <span id="s1413">And they really believed in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Also during that period of time, before the Japanese occupation you were going to, you were still in school.</span> <span id="s1415">At the Maryknoll college.</span> <span id="s1416">And I assume you were still going to Sunday school at the temple.</span> <span id="s1417">So before the Japanese came, what was your life like within the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1418">A: We had a very life.</span> <span id="s1419">We had our get together.</span> <span id="s1420">We had, made a lot of friends with other Jewish refugees and we children enjoyed going to Sunday school.</span> <span id="s1421">We met our peers and we just enjoyed it and during the high holidays it was always a wonderful time for us because everybody was there, regardless of whether they were very religious or not and a lot of the people that, there were some, I shouldn’t say a lot.</span> <span id="s1422">There were some people that came from Shanghai that friends, I made friends with the Helmans.</span> <span id="s1423">There was Rosie Helman, Siggy Helman and Gloria Helman.</span> <span id="s1424">Those were the children.</span> <span id="s1425">And Mr. and Mrs. Helman.</span> <span id="s1426">I don’t’ remember their first names at this moment.</span> <span id="s1427">They had a boarding house right on Dewey Boulevard overlooking the ocean.</span> <span id="s1428">And that was a very favorite place for everybody and Rosie and I became very dear friends because she went to the Sunday school and we just all had a very pretty good life considering you know we weren’t’ rich or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1429">We couldn’t take things out of their country so we were, had to start fresh, completely fresh as I’ve said before.</span> <span id="s1430">There was not a whole lot left that we could rescue or salvage.</span> <span id="s1431">We did keep that wooden box that all our stuff came in.</span> <span id="s1432">And my mother had packed away a couple of things, including some crystal because we only lived in one room, the four of us were in one room and rented all out to the other people so we could pay for this flat.</span> <span id="s1433">Like I say we had a hard time because they had to give money for the visa for my grandmother and already mentioned for us to be able to buy a popsicle, ice cream.</span> <span id="s1434">I mean there, the food thing on a popsicle.</span> <span id="s1435">Oh that was quite a big deal.</span> <span id="s1436">We never were able to buy a Coke because those were expensive.</span> <span id="s1437">Even five centavos we couldn’t have.</span> <span id="s1438">We had to save every penny to send to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1439">And for the visa for my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1440">So we were really considered quite poor in those days.</span> <span id="s1441">So when the war, I mean when the Japanese came in, we had taken, we had gotten a few furnitures of course, and all the people, the Americans had left.</span> <span id="s1442">Now the Japanese were marching in.</span> <span id="s1443">We heard them coming in during the night.</span> <span id="s1444">And it was an awful feeling to hear marching.</span> <span id="s1445">It reminded us of the Nazis in Germany.</span> <span id="s1446">And we were so afraid that they were going to come into our homes.</span> <span id="s1447">And, and just kill us all.</span> <span id="s1448">We had heard horrible stories of what Japanese can do from people in different areas.</span> <span id="s1449">They were very sadistic.</span> <span id="s1450">And the first troops in were mostly Koreans.</span> <span id="s1451">They had taken them as the foot soldiers and the officers were Japanese and these people, the Koreans and the low, low Japanese their uniforms smelled so horrible that you could actually smell them through the windows into the house.</span> <span id="s1452">And had a terrible stench about them.</span> <span id="s1453">I don’t’ know whether they were able to wash it there or what you know.</span> <span id="s1454">Because they were in the war.</span> <span id="s1455">I mean they were just waiting and they had to land someplace.</span> <span id="s1456">But it was very, very hard for us to all of a sudden for the Americans to the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1457">We didn’t know what awaited us.</span> <span id="s1458">How they were going to treat us, being Jewish and of course our nuns were still at the Maryknoll college but we were not able to go to school because we were afraid to go out into the streets and so forth.</span> <span id="s1459">And of course they were, later we learned they were right away interned in Saint Thomas which as an internment camp for Americans, for white Russians and people that they suspected of being pro-American.</span> <span id="s1460">So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the Americans and so in a way that is also sort of what happened, but not right away.</span> <span id="s1461">Not, they were still gathering themselves together and trying to get all the forces that were left because they, a lot of them were in Bataan and they didn’t’ have a lot of communications with them because the Japanese intercepted everything that went out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: I had asked you what your diet and life style was (file 3 – RG-50.106.0052.03.03 – duration: 01:01:04)</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: This is continuation of an interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1464">I’m interviewing Margie Rosenthal and my name is Nancy Alper.</span> <span id="s1465">It’s the 24th of October 1996.</span> <span id="s1466">This is the third tape of this interview, the first side.</span> <span id="s1467">And Margie and I were just talking about their life style, the family’s life style before the Japanese took over and afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Before the Japanese took over, we could go to the market and buy beef and you know better things.</span> <span id="s1469">However no the potatoes before the war were still there because they were imported.</span> <span id="s1470">Once the Japanese moved in we did not have any fresh food.</span> <span id="s1471">We did not have any regular potatoes.</span> <span id="s1472">We ate yams or yellow potatoes, the sweet potatoes, I should say.</span> <span id="s1473">And we didn’t have much money.</span> <span id="s1474">In fact money was like going always up, up, up.</span> <span id="s1475">It was like inflation.</span> <span id="s1476">Money wasn’t worth a thing and so we ate rice.</span> <span id="s1477">One meal would be the rice soup.</span> <span id="s1478">Another meal would be the rice.</span> <span id="s1479">Another meal would be the potato peels , the sweet potato peel and another one would be the regular sweet potato.</span> <span id="s1480">But my mother became inventive.</span> <span id="s1481">She would take for example she would take the potato which was an awful sweet potato and she would put vinegar on it and would put salt on it and it kind of deadened the sweetness.</span> <span id="s1482">And it was a little bit like a potato salad, were trying to imitate that.</span> <span id="s1483">Then to make, in those days we still had electricity and so forth.</span> <span id="s1484">So my mother would get some coconuts and with (rust?)</span> <span id="s1485">with the coconut and then squeeze out the cream and from that she would make ice cream and put that into like cubes, into cube trays in the freezer.</span> <span id="s1486">And we would have ice cream.</span> <span id="s1487">I mean you had to be very inventive.</span> <span id="s1488">You could take flowers and make a jelly and jam out of it.</span> <span id="s1489">And later on in the things, I mean flour disappeared.</span> <span id="s1490">We had then we made, we bought bread made of rice flour.</span> <span id="s1491">We bought bread out of just about anything that you could imagine and the matzo.</span> <span id="s1492">We had no matzo of course so we used sour flour for matzo.</span> <span id="s1493">Things were really pretty rotten.</span> <span id="s1494">And the beef came to an end as well because the caribous were, you know there were more no more caribous and the Japanese confiscated a lot of the stuff.</span> <span id="s1495">So all of a sudden we were having horse meat.</span> <span id="s1496">But we didn’t know it was.</span> <span id="s1497">It tasted different.</span> <span id="s1498">Our Dad finally told us because he was in Russia before the war if you remember.</span> <span id="s1499">He would say it tastes sweet and that is horse meat.</span> <span id="s1500">Well then we didn’t want to eat that any more either.</span> <span id="s1501">So we stuck to a diet of fish and chicken but chicken was really a delicacy.</span> <span id="s1502">We couldn’t hardly afford to buy a chicken so we decided we’re going to raise our own and well where do you keep a chicken, right.</span> <span id="s1503">There was no, you can’t leave it outside.</span> <span id="s1504">It might get stolen so we put chickens in one of the little rooms like a closet and had a bar across it and they would roost right on top of the bars.</span> <span id="s1505">But then the rats would come and would like to eat those poor chickens.</span> <span id="s1506">You had, you know making a lot of fluttering and screaming and screeching.</span> <span id="s1507">And we would jump out of bed and we tried to chase the rats away from the where we had the chickens because like I said they liked to eat chickens too.</span> <span id="s1508">Then during the winter season we lived in a place where we were downstairs and across the street from us was the house of Japanese where they were torturing Filipinos.</span> <span id="s1509">Whoever they thought was a group that was against them.</span> <span id="s1510">And they would do the most horrible things to them.</span> <span id="s1511">And we would see walking by.</span> <span id="s1512">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s1513">They would have men hanging upside down and would make them smoke and they would have them close their nose and mouth and they would have to inhale the smoke.</span> <span id="s1514">And they would just absolutely and they’d blow up like they would swell up.</span> <span id="s1515">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s1516">Or they would pull fingernails out and toenails and the water torture.</span> <span id="s1517">They did everything and anything to get some information out of them.</span> <span id="s1518">And that they didn’t do, they couldn’t do.</span> <span id="s1519">And my dad at that time, there was no more.</span> <span id="s1520">In the beginning my dad and I were selling automobile parts, in the very beginning of the Japanese occupation because we needed to get some money.</span> <span id="s1521">So we would buy parts from one place and take it and sell it to another place.</span> <span id="s1522">One of our, my good customers was the cigar company.</span> <span id="s1523">Hamber, I think it was called cigar company.</span> <span id="s1524">And they would give me what they wanted.</span> <span id="s1525">They needed say X number of piston rings, X number of spark plugs.</span> <span id="s1526">X number of fan belts.</span> <span id="s1527">I mean things like that or even batteries.</span> <span id="s1528">So I would go and find where I could find some and then bring it to them and sell them.</span> <span id="s1529">Now I was having a better time of sales than my dad, I guess because I was a girl.</span> <span id="s1530">Anyway, and that way I was able to support my family some money somehow.</span> <span id="s1531">And in the meantime, of course the Americans were bombing us.</span> <span id="s1532">Q: Were you still Ermita then or had you moved to a different location and where did you get the auto parts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Well we still were in Ermita and the auto parts, people tipped us off who might be wanting to sell.</span> <span id="s1534">Well you had no gasoline.</span> <span id="s1535">You only had cars there so you dismantled them and sold part by part because nobody could drive a car at that point anyway.</span> <span id="s1536">Gasoline was out of the question so you had to do what you had to do and this is how I found out well these people had this and that and so I went and procured it and sold it to them.</span> <span id="s1537">And we’d separate, my dad and I. He’d go one direction and I’d go someplace else and sometimes we’d meet for lunch or whatever, downtown.</span> <span id="s1538">But between the bombings, the Americans were flying way up there.</span> <span id="s1539">And we wanted to say hooray, hooray, hooray but we didn’t dare show any kind of an emotion because that would have been the end.</span> <span id="s1540">But then that stopped too.</span> <span id="s1541">And so then my dad used to go to the market, get some linguises, they called them.</span> <span id="s1542">That’s a sausage and other things that he thought people would need and took it into the provinces, way into the interior of Manila, in that bundle into Philippines, interior of the suburbs and further out.</span> <span id="s1543">Well twice, my poor father was caught.</span> <span id="s1544">The first time they thought he was a guerrilla but he talked his way out of it.</span> <span id="s1545">The second time he wasn’t so lucky.</span> <span id="s1546">He, they had him, they hand bound him.</span> <span id="s1547">They were going to shoot him.</span> <span id="s1548">I mean they already had a position to sue.</span> <span id="s1549">And he said I can show you that I’m a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s1550">I had the bris, and they said that doesn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s1551">We do too.</span> <span id="s1552">We had the same operation.</span> <span id="s1553">Don’t work, that stuff.</span> <span id="s1554">So he said I can recite the Shema.</span> <span id="s1555">He said how do we know that that is your prayer.</span> <span id="s1556">We don’t’ know Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1557">So he was there for hours.</span> <span id="s1558">They were keep, questioning him.</span> <span id="s1559">And he kept saying I am not a, I am not a spy for the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1560">I am not.</span> <span id="s1561">I am pro-American.</span> <span id="s1562">We</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Now if I understand this they were rebel guerrillas.</span> <span id="s1564">These were not Japanese soldiers but these were the Filipinos who were fighting the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: That is correct.</span> <span id="s1566">They were in the outskirts hiding underground so to speak.</span> <span id="s1567">Yes, and they, when they see a white man or what’s he doing in the province, find out he’s German on top of that.</span> <span id="s1568">Well, that means enemy.</span> <span id="s1569">And so they really wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s1570">And so he said “look, if you’re going to kill me, do it now.</span> <span id="s1571">Don’t prolong this anymore.</span> <span id="s1572">I’ve had enough.”</span> <span id="s1573">He was saying the Shema over and over and over again.</span> <span id="s1574">And nothing they said, he said or did.</span> <span id="s1575">He says I have a family.</span> <span id="s1576">I have two children.</span> <span id="s1577">I have a, my wife is there.</span> <span id="s1578">He said please you know this was in the Pasay.</span> <span id="s1579">This, in the meanwhile we had to move Ermita, because Ermita was getting very expensive, so we went back to Pasay.</span> <span id="s1580">And we rented a downstairs.</span> <span id="s1581">It was like a basement type thing, level to the ground.</span> <span id="s1582">And that, from there we were making our trips into the city and you didn’t have much.</span> <span id="s1583">As transportation you mostly had to walk and it was pretty hard.</span> <span id="s1584">And anyway so my dad, this finally somebody else, the big, big macher came from the group.</span> <span id="s1585">And he said, “I believe this man.</span> <span id="s1586">Let him go.”</span> <span id="s1587">So they said ok, let him go.</span> <span id="s1588">He was so sure they were going to shoot him in the back.</span> <span id="s1589">And he took his bicycle and started walking.</span> <span id="s1590">He didn’t dare get on a bicycle because he was so weak by that time.</span> <span id="s1591">He was so exhausted from the interrogations and from the, the whole way they held him, hand cuffed behind his back and all that.</span> <span id="s1592">I mean he was just a broken man.</span> <span id="s1593">Well, they let him go.</span> <span id="s1594">But the man that told him you can go, said, “I will watch you.</span> <span id="s1595">I will make sure that you are telling the truth.</span> <span id="s1596">And if you’re not, you’re a dead man.”</span> <span id="s1597">So he told him where he, where we lived so he says “I’m going to come and check up on you.”</span> <span id="s1598">My dad came home walking.</span> <span id="s1599">He never rode the bicycle all the way, miles and miles and miles, kilometers over there.</span> <span id="s1600">And he came home and he always was an old man.</span> <span id="s1601">He was so broken up about this that we said you’re not going back into that again ever, ever.</span> <span id="s1602">You cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1603">And so my poor father, that night, sure enough we spied, we saw somebody outside our window.</span> <span id="s1604">We thought it was somebody going to break in again.</span> <span id="s1605">And no, it was one of the people that had said they’re going to check up on him were outside our window, looking in.</span> <span id="s1606">But barely.</span> <span id="s1607">You had to just kind of look in through the slats.</span> <span id="s1608">But they were there checking up on us.</span> <span id="s1609">That was the last time he went into the country.</span> <span id="s1610">We would not let him.</span> <span id="s1611">I said we’d rather starve.</span> <span id="s1612">Now we, like I said, we were at the floor level.</span> <span id="s1613">In the back was swamp.</span> <span id="s1614">And they had fish so we would go out there and try to catch some fish for food.</span> <span id="s1615">And we had those two chickens.</span> <span id="s1616">But you know we didn’t have heart.</span> <span id="s1617">We did not have the heart to kill them so we gave them to a neighbor and says here.</span> <span id="s1618">You take them.</span> <span id="s1619">We don’t want to eat them.</span> <span id="s1620">And they’re getting older.</span> <span id="s1621">You better just use them.</span> <span id="s1622">Of course they didn’t’ give us any share at all, but the Japanese kept up their atrocities something awful.</span> <span id="s1623">And many people didn’t make it back.</span> <span id="s1624">I mean even some of our Jewish people were taken .</span> <span id="s1625">They found a short wave radio or sometimes they didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s1626">They just didn’t’ like the way you answered them and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: With the Japanese patrolling on a daily basis around all the neighborhoods sort of like a police force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Not really patrolling.</span> <span id="s1629">They had houses.</span> <span id="s1630">Little like a, it was like you see in England.</span> <span id="s1631">You know those little guard houses.</span> <span id="s1632">They had that that set up all over and when you walked by you had to bend down as low as you could because if you didn’t they just slap you left and right.</span> <span id="s1633">And so we learned to do it.</span> <span id="s1634">But later on we get to the idea, hey wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1635">We are German.</span> <span id="s1636">They don’t’ know the difference so we said Allemande, Allemande.</span> <span id="s1637">German.</span> <span id="s1638">Deutsch, Deutsch.</span> <span id="s1639">And you know it worked.</span> <span id="s1640">We didn’t’ have to do it anymore.</span> <span id="s1641">They bowed to us.</span> <span id="s1642">But they were like I said pretty viscous.</span> <span id="s1643">And again things became, the water kept rising in that place.</span> <span id="s1644">Whenever it rained.</span> <span id="s1645">It was rainy season, the piles came loose.</span> <span id="s1646">And we, whenever we put our feet out or a hand out, it would touch water.</span> <span id="s1647">So we know the water had risen to our bed.</span> <span id="s1648">And the beds were way up there.</span> <span id="s1649">High up.</span> <span id="s1650">Everything was up high.</span> <span id="s1651">And that’s how so we could open the, we had window open.</span> <span id="s1652">The water was as high outside as it was inside.</span> <span id="s1653">So we saw fish floating by and we tried to catch those fish.</span> <span id="s1654">So once in a while we were lucky and we were able to catch the fish.</span> <span id="s1655">So between vegetables that were growing out back and fish we didn’t need a whole lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: I think you talked about the fact that the Japanese placed their munitions near some, in suburban neighborhoods.</span> <span id="s1657">And I’m wondering if that was true in Pasay as well as Ermita.</span> <span id="s1658">If that was just a general practice of the Japanese.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: It certainly was.</span> <span id="s1660">From Pasay, we moved back to Ermita.</span> <span id="s1661">We just things were getting pretty bad.</span> <span id="s1662">We couldn’t’ stay in that, in a place where the water was coming up all the time.</span> <span id="s1663">We lost a lot of things due to that.</span> <span id="s1664">The shoes molded away, the blankets and everything else.</span> <span id="s1665">So that didn’t last.</span> <span id="s1666">So then we went to Ermita now.</span> <span id="s1667">It was almost 1945, very close to 1945 when we moved back to Ermita.</span> <span id="s1668">I would say that was probably in the very beginning of 45.</span> <span id="s1669">And the bombings of the Americans increased.</span> <span id="s1670">Then came shelling.</span> <span id="s1671">They had, they dropped leaflets and were telling us that they had already come to the outskirts of Manila by dropping leaflets.</span> <span id="s1672">So we knew the end was near.</span> <span id="s1673">We could just hold out a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s1674">And we had ok, also we, up until that time we were able to go to the temple.</span> <span id="s1675">And we were able to go every week to services.</span> <span id="s1676">But when the shell, the bombings got worse and worse, it really was very dangerous to be outside.</span> <span id="s1677">And there was no place to really hide because there were no air raid shelters in Manila because it was too low.</span> <span id="s1678">It was water underneath, not far down, we had water.</span> <span id="s1679">So we couldn’t build any air shelters.</span> <span id="s1680">So you had to hope for the best.</span> <span id="s1681">That was about it.</span> <span id="s1682">So then we were again back in Ermita and then the Japanese had been storing ammunition in between the civilians because they knew that the, if the Americans knew civilians lived there, they would not bomb the civilians.</span> <span id="s1683">So they very smartly put gasoline, ammunition, anything that was flammable to put in-between the civilians, like maybe two houses of civilian.</span> <span id="s1684">The third one would have that.</span> <span id="s1685">Or five houses of civilians and a big bloc of Japanese.</span> <span id="s1686">So they were all over the place.</span> <span id="s1687">And we knew more or less where they were.</span> <span id="s1688">So we but we, where else can you run.</span> <span id="s1689">I mean you can’t keep running so we were at one place.</span> <span id="s1690">It used to be a dressmaker’s place.</span> <span id="s1691">That was our very last stand.</span> <span id="s1692">We were so tired of moving and running away and no matter where we went we were getting bombed or getting shelled.</span> <span id="s1693">It really didn’t’ make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: I know you told me that you also sold pies.</span> <span id="s1695">And I’m wondering where that fit in and in this time period we’re discussing and if you reached a point where there simply wasn’t anything you could do anymore to earn money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Well the pies came at a very late date also because like I said food was running out.</span> <span id="s1697">So this one lady was baking pies and I took it to the hospital where they still had some doctors and nurses.</span> <span id="s1698">And also the people that were discharged from the prisons were there.</span> <span id="s1699">And there was one Jewish man that I, basically that was the one I really, really remembered.</span> <span id="s1700">Because I had known him.</span> <span id="s1701">His name was Moser.</span> <span id="s1702">And he was laying on the bed, white.</span> <span id="s1703">His legs were saw raw that he couldn’t even put his legs together and he was so thin that there was nothing left and he looked almost like what you see nowadays with the concentration camp victims.</span> <span id="s1704">Exactly that’s what he looked like.</span> <span id="s1705">They starved him, they beat him.</span> <span id="s1706">They did everything you can possibly imagine.</span> <span id="s1707">He could barely talk to us.</span> <span id="s1708">And I brought a pie over to him and I fed him because I felt that was the only thing I could do.</span> <span id="s1709">I would explain what happened to that pie later on to the lady that made them, but he had to have some nourishment and I started feeding him small little pieces and he ate it and his eyes became big and cause he couldn’t really show much emotion at that point.</span> <span id="s1710">He was just too, too tired of living, too tired of everything.</span> <span id="s1711">And the pies like I said you know I sold as long as I could.</span> <span id="s1712">And that stopped as well because the bombing got more severe and more severe and by that time, the Americans were already in Intramuros, in that area we heard.</span> <span id="s1713">So it was time to just put an end to this.</span> <span id="s1714">And so we were in this building that we had taken over from the dressmaker.</span> <span id="s1715">And across the street from us were this red light house, the red light district house.</span> <span id="s1716">And I was standing in the doorway of our place where we were.</span> <span id="s1717">And all of a sudden this Japanese soldier comes in, grabs me and was trying to drag me up the stairs.</span> <span id="s1718">I am crying, I am yelling and my mother is holding me.</span> <span id="s1719">My sister is holding my mother and my father is holding my, my sister.</span> <span id="s1720">My mother.</span> <span id="s1721">Well anyway, one after the other.</span> <span id="s1722">And I am trying to hold onto the bannister and he’s pulling me, he’s much stronger than I am.</span> <span id="s1723">By this time I had amoebic dysentery.</span> <span id="s1724">And I was very weak and so this, finally dad let go and he says I’m running outside and see if I find a, an officer.</span> <span id="s1725">Lucky, he found an officer.</span> <span id="s1726">Do you speak English?</span> <span id="s1727">Do you speak German?</span> <span id="s1728">English.</span> <span id="s1729">Help us, help me.</span> <span id="s1730">My daughter.</span> <span id="s1731">She’s not one of those.</span> <span id="s1732">So he came in and he, I was already on the top of the stairs.</span> <span id="s1733">And all of a sudden the officer arrived.</span> <span id="s1734">And yelled something in Japanese and the, this soldier froze.</span> <span id="s1735">And I was, I was hysterical by this time.</span> <span id="s1736">I mean I was completely, I was so bad, I couldn’t even walk downstairs.</span> <span id="s1737">They carried me down the stairs.</span> <span id="s1738">And I was there and the officer called him to come down.</span> <span id="s1739">The guy came down, this soldier.</span> <span id="s1740">He took him and he beat him up.</span> <span id="s1741">I mean I, after a while I actually felt sorry for this guy.</span> <span id="s1742">Not only did he beat him.</span> <span id="s1743">He knocked him to the ground and then he kicked him.</span> <span id="s1744">And he was still apologizing.</span> <span id="s1745">This, this police, I mean this solider was apologizing to this, to this officer.</span> <span id="s1746">Anyway it was very lucky for me.</span> <span id="s1747">It was really it was very, one of the fortunate instances.</span> <span id="s1748">Well then this all was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s1749">The Japanese were making, going from house to house interrogating or taking people.</span> <span id="s1750">My dad said goodby already.</span> <span id="s1751">My mother said goodby to us too.</span> <span id="s1752">And said that your aunt is in Shanghai and I want you to go there after the war because if we are not around, you have to be the, you have to be in charge.</span> <span id="s1753">And he said, again he started saying the Shema and dad said this is it.</span> <span id="s1754">I’m sorry, you girls will have to fend for yourself.</span> <span id="s1755">The Americans are not far away.</span> <span id="s1756">So you know be calm and do what they say.</span> <span id="s1757">So guess what.</span> <span id="s1758">They were next door, avoided our house, went to the next one and you could her people screaming and crying.</span> <span id="s1759">And the truck was loading up all these people.</span> <span id="s1760">And we were scared and next day in the morning they brought some of the women back, not the men.</span> <span id="s1761">We never saw the men again.</span> <span id="s1762">And then that night, all of a sudden we hear bombing, shelling and fire starting in our immediate area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: These people who were the victims of the house to house search, were these Filipinos, Americans, refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Only Filipinos.</span> <span id="s1765">There were no more white people around.</span> <span id="s1766">We were just living among Filipinos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Do you think that they in these two instances helped you in the instance of the soldier who was dragging you up the steps and spared you in the instance you just described because you were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: We think that might have happened because how else I mean we had the same place.</span> <span id="s1769">I mean we were side by side we’d go from one to the next to the next.</span> <span id="s1770">I mean you know how, we assumed that maybe this officer when somehow word must have spread.</span> <span id="s1771">Say don’t go there, those are Germans.</span> <span id="s1772">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1773">Maybe the hand of God was over us.</span> <span id="s1774">What, we don’t’ know.</span> <span id="s1775">We just don’t’ know.</span> <span id="s1776">We only know that we were spared.</span> <span id="s1777">And then that night we had to leave that place and we thought we’ll never come back again.</span> <span id="s1778">And we hid in about a block away where still no flames.</span> <span id="s1779">And we went there.</span> <span id="s1780">In the morning we heard that that street had not burned yet so we cautiously made our way back there and sure it was not burned yet.</span> <span id="s1781">So my father said now I they next time the flames are going to get closer.</span> <span id="s1782">We better grab what we’re going to take if we can carry it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: When you say flames, you’re talking about flames from what the bombs had set on fire in the area, what was burning as a result of the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Shelling, the shelling, not the bombing at this point.</span> <span id="s1785">It was mainly the heavy, heavy shelling.</span> <span id="s1786">By the Americans.</span> <span id="s1787">And they just shot into it because the Japanese were intermingled with us and the ammunition and the gasoline and daddy, my father said we don’t want to go up in flames and be thrown to smithereens.</span> <span id="s1788">We just might as well leave while we still can.</span> <span id="s1789">So that morning we gathered all our meager, one photo album, the address for my aunt and the visa, affidavits for America.</span> <span id="s1790">I, my dad told me to take the electric plate over my neck and that was heavy.</span> <span id="s1791">And the dog and the leash.</span> <span id="s1792">We had a dog.</span> <span id="s1793">And my sister couldn’t’ carry anything.</span> <span id="s1794">She was too, I was 17 at the time.</span> <span id="s1795">and so my sister she was, what 12.</span> <span id="s1796">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1797">Maybe they gave her something to carry also.</span> <span id="s1798">And on top of that we had again bought some chickens.</span> <span id="s1799">Raw, live chickens.</span> <span id="s1800">And they were making such a racket.</span> <span id="s1801">So we gave it to somebody.</span> <span id="s1802">And said we don’t’ want to be, we can’t kill them anyway.</span> <span id="s1803">Just take them, just go.</span> <span id="s1804">So we gave them to somebody who I don’t even know who they were.</span> <span id="s1805">And we went to this apartment house that was down the street and in that apartment house we went to that apartment building that was standing.</span> <span id="s1806">That was a very high rise building for those days.</span> <span id="s1807">And in the bottom, or as you walked in from off the street were sandbags Well apparently a bomb, a shell had come into there and had not exploded.</span> <span id="s1808">A great big thing and one bomb was also in the shaft, elevator shaft.</span> <span id="s1809">And we figured well let’s lay down there.</span> <span id="s1810">I mean we’ve got to get out of the house.</span> <span id="s1811">At least it’s far enough, even though that explodes it’ll give us some protection with these bags around the building.</span> <span id="s1812">Well we didn’t expect a shell to come right, explode, come right into the, it was like a carport almost.</span> <span id="s1813">Open on all the sides you see.</span> <span id="s1814">And it came right in and exploded and it was phosphorous now.</span> <span id="s1815">And the explosion of it, threw me under a very low table.</span> <span id="s1816">It was like maybe 5 inches, 6 inches off the floor.</span> <span id="s1817">It pushed me underneath that and my mother got hit with shrapnel.</span> <span id="s1818">Our dog ran away at that time and we were looking for the dog afterwards but it was just as well because where we were before had taken our dog was barking at all the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1819">We didn’t know how to keep her quiet.</span> <span id="s1820">So when this explosion happened, she took off which was probably a blessing.</span> <span id="s1821">Anyway so we I thought I said I think I’m dying.</span> <span id="s1822">I couldn’t’ breathe because of the phosphor in my lungs, you know.</span> <span id="s1823">And my mother was bleeding from her shrapnel wounds.</span> <span id="s1824">So we got out of there and went to a maybe a block away to a garage that had burned I mean the garage.</span> <span id="s1825">A house that had already burned out.</span> <span id="s1826">All those left were the bottom with hot, hot coals like tiles and things.</span> <span id="s1827">But where else can we go.</span> <span id="s1828">We stayed there for just a little bit, maybe one night.</span> <span id="s1829">That didn’t work very well.</span> <span id="s1830">So then we went to the school which was Atenao, a parochial school for boys.</span> <span id="s1831">The building was already occupied by a lot of refugees so there was no more room in the building.</span> <span id="s1832">So the other people that were outside were sitting in ditches that had been placed around the whole parameter of the school.</span> <span id="s1833">Well that’s where we were when the shots kept coming over our heads.</span> <span id="s1834">And my mother still had that shrapnel in her but what could we do.</span> <span id="s1835">There were no doctors, medics, nothing.</span> <span id="s1836">So all we did was we put some bandage on her and that was all we could do.</span> <span id="s1837">And then we, shell, a big shrapnel fell between my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s1838">If we had been closer it would have killed one of us.</span> <span id="s1839">Well we figured out that wasn’t a place to stay again.</span> <span id="s1840">So again we started moving around.</span> <span id="s1841">So then we spied this, oh that was several blocks away because we knew that this was going to go up and sure enough that night, our house, our place, that whole block went up.</span> <span id="s1842">In explosion because a shell had hit there as well and it hit our apartment where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s1843">It also was hitting already close to that place where we were living before.</span> <span id="s1844">So we had to go further.</span> <span id="s1845">So we walked and we w</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Margie Rosenthal.</span> <span id="s1847">Nancy Alper, October the 26th 1996.</span> <span id="s1848">This is the second side of the third tape of the interview.</span> <span id="s1849">And we were talking about what I assume was part of the battle of Manila, at the very end of the war in the Pacific against the Japanese, or close to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: The, we had finally come upon this garage that had a roof like I said, three sides but the front was all open.</span> <span id="s1851">We were in like sardines.</span> <span id="s1852">We tried to get out of the outside as much as possible.</span> <span id="s1853">But we barely made it in because a lot of people there already.</span> <span id="s1854">And there was one Jewish lady.</span> <span id="s1855">She had her maid there.</span> <span id="s1856">She had her cushions there.</span> <span id="s1857">She had everything that it could possibly could think of.</span> <span id="s1858">She would not move an inch.</span> <span id="s1859">So we all were trying to help each other, trying to get in as many people as we could.</span> <span id="s1860">Well we couldn’t lie down.</span> <span id="s1861">I mean it was you just laid to the side of yourself.</span> <span id="s1862">Anyway, and then we were across the street was a whole contingent of Japanese.</span> <span id="s1863">The whole house was occupied by Japanese soldiers.</span> <span id="s1864">And pretty soon these Japanese came over, wanted the girls.</span> <span id="s1865">And being that I was very undernourished, underweight, didn’t have much on me, they didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s1866">They thought I was just a kid.</span> <span id="s1867">But there were some girls there that were well endowed.</span> <span id="s1868">They lined them all up and they said you, you, you, you.</span> <span id="s1869">Come.</span> <span id="s1870">Well one of them was the daughter of optometrist that we knew.</span> <span id="s1871">And he went up to this soldier who said you, you, you.</span> <span id="s1872">He said watch, my daughter.</span> <span id="s1873">And so he understood.</span> <span id="s1874">He let the girl go.</span> <span id="s1875">And he gave him his gold watch.</span> <span id="s1876">Then he asked for the men to come out.</span> <span id="s1877">So all the men including my father of course.</span> <span id="s1878">He was lining them up and we thought oh my god, he’s going to shoot them all now.</span> <span id="s1879">I mean what.</span> <span id="s1880">So my dad, said German, German.</span> <span id="s1881">That saved him.</span> <span id="s1882">So he sent him back to us.</span> <span id="s1883">But the other ones they took along.</span> <span id="s1884">They didn’t shoot them right in front of our faces.</span> <span id="s1885">They just took them.</span> <span id="s1886">So that gave us a little bit more room in the garage which is a sad thing to say you know.</span> <span id="s1887">But that’s when the moment you say German that was it.</span> <span id="s1888">So then we had no food, no water and at this time we were pretty worn out by running around from one area to another area and nothing to eat but we had had with us a little bit of drink.</span> <span id="s1889">My dad had saved some whiskey in a bottle.</span> <span id="s1890">And he said we were going to use this when we are liberated.</span> <span id="s1891">Well this was an emergency.</span> <span id="s1892">And we had no more water.</span> <span id="s1893">So when, they, I looked across the ruins and I saw a bunch of people.</span> <span id="s1894">I said looks to me like they’re going for water.</span> <span id="s1895">I saw them lowering a can on a string.</span> <span id="s1896">I said that looks to me like that might have been a house.</span> <span id="s1897">I’m going.</span> <span id="s1898">So my dad said, no I’m going.</span> <span id="s1899">I said no you’re not.</span> <span id="s1900">Because you are man.</span> <span id="s1901">You might get killed.</span> <span id="s1902">You are staying.</span> <span id="s1903">I said I’m going to take my sister, Eva.</span> <span id="s1904">So she and I had this flask that was used to probably wine in there.</span> <span id="s1905">It was kind of a maybe a five gallon jug, empty.</span> <span id="s1906">So I said I’m going to go because whatever, we had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1907">I mean we found it along the way somewhere.</span> <span id="s1908">I that’s not what we carried because we had nothing, except what we had on our body, the photo album and a stamp album and electric plate.</span> <span id="s1909">And when you throw yourself down, by that time I’d lost the electric plate also already.</span> <span id="s1910">I didn’t’ have that anymore because that was at least it was heavy and how could you fall on top of that.</span> <span id="s1911">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s1912">So I left it some time ago.</span> <span id="s1913">So then I said, let’s go Eva.</span> <span id="s1914">So we walked over there to the place where I saw those women and they were fighting over the water.</span> <span id="s1915">I mean there were so , maybe 60 and I had no way of even getting close to it.</span> <span id="s1916">So I just stood there and what next.</span> <span id="s1917">How am I going to obtain water.</span> <span id="s1918">We needed water.</span> <span id="s1919">All of a sudden shelling started, whizzing right over our heads.</span> <span id="s1920">Well the Filipinos, these were all Filipinos that we are talking about, all lay down flat on the ground.</span> <span id="s1921">So that they wouldn’t’ be hit.</span> <span id="s1922">And I said Eva lay down too.</span> <span id="s1923">And I said look.</span> <span id="s1924">She says come on lay down, lay down.</span> <span id="s1925">I said no I can’t.</span> <span id="s1926">I have got to get the water while I can.</span> <span id="s1927">I’m going to do that.</span> <span id="s1928">So that’s exactly what I did.</span> <span id="s1929">I took the can that was standing.</span> <span id="s1930">I lowered it, brought up this filthy looking water.</span> <span id="s1931">Threw it into the jug.</span> <span id="s1932">I got a few cans because the bombing, the shelling goes on for a while.</span> <span id="s1933">I mean once one hits, then there are several.</span> <span id="s1934">And I was standing up.</span> <span id="s1935">I said to my sister, I said if it hits me, you take the water and you carry it home, carry it to the garage.</span> <span id="s1936">So I was standing there.</span> <span id="s1937">And I, everything’s fate in my eyes.</span> <span id="s1938">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1939">I got the water.</span> <span id="s1940">The shelling stopped.</span> <span id="s1941">We didn’t get a whole lot but we got enough to tide us over.</span> <span id="s1942">So I said come on.</span> <span id="s1943">Grab the one end of it.</span> <span id="s1944">I grabbed the other end.</span> <span id="s1945">We stumbled over all the ruins and the burned out things and no, nothing was standing anymore.</span> <span id="s1946">Everything was just flattened.</span> <span id="s1947">But you know stones and, and glass whatever have you.</span> <span id="s1948">So we made it right back to the garage and my dad took the whiskey and put some into the, into the water we had and that we were survived and had water.</span> <span id="s1949">And then the next day we were, I had to go, we had no toilet.</span> <span id="s1950">I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1951">I’m outside and all of a sudden, this soldier comes up to me and I thought it was a Japanese and I’m already going like this with my head down and my hands over my head and, and just cowering down.</span> <span id="s1952">He said “get up, get up.</span> <span id="s1953">We are here, we are here.”</span> <span id="s1954">I jumped up.</span> <span id="s1955">I said “an Americans, you’re Americans.</span> <span id="s1956">And he said “yes” cause they were camouflaged with mud on their faces and they had things over their head.</span> <span id="s1957">The helmets and regular invasion forces.</span> <span id="s1958">And he said “where’s the rest of your people.”</span> <span id="s1959">And I said “over there in that garage”.</span> <span id="s1960">He says “ok, I didn’t know there were more civilians” he said.</span> <span id="s1961">I said “yes, but be careful.”</span> <span id="s1962">I said “There are sentries in the house over there.</span> <span id="s1963">They see you, they’re going to kill you.”</span> <span id="s1964">So he called over to where my parents were and other people.</span> <span id="s1965">Had them crawl out.</span> <span id="s1966">I never went back again.</span> <span id="s1967">I just showed him where they were.</span> <span id="s1968">I stayed, he said “don’t you go back.</span> <span id="s1969">Stay right here.</span> <span id="s1970">I’m coming for you.”</span> <span id="s1971">And that’s what happened and he brought the civilians out, calling and then running.</span> <span id="s1972">And he says “you run as fast as you can over all these dead people,” over the corpses that had already started to smell and I mean stink horrible and the ants and the worms.</span> <span id="s1973">Oh it’s just horrible and that’s what we saw.</span> <span id="s1974">And we passed that and by the time.</span> <span id="s1975">We reached, we reached the, the American lines, they put us on a truck and took us to Santa Ana cabaret where 2000 people were already there.</span> <span id="s1976">And anyway, 2000 people were there.</span> <span id="s1977">And we stayed there for that night and about two nights.</span> <span id="s1978">And we were famished.</span> <span id="s1979">And they had a soup kitchen is that what it was.</span> <span id="s1980">And we ate the soup that they served us and that was the best thing that we ever ate.</span> <span id="s1981">I mean we were so hungry that anything and everything would have been just wonderful.</span> <span id="s1982">Of course, I did not even have a period because all the excitement, no nourishment.</span> <span id="s1983">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1984">I mean so I didn’t have to worry about that at that point.</span> <span id="s1985">And so we were laying there with thousands.</span> <span id="s1986">Like I said it was a dancing hall before and they called it Santa Ana cabaret.</span> <span id="s1987">And we met some other people but they came, not all, too many of our people.</span> <span id="s1988">And then we went and said, we walked along someplace else to see if we could find shelter elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1989">And we came to this one man.</span> <span id="s1990">And he said come upstairs and you know it’ll be ok.</span> <span id="s1991">And I said “no, I have to get my parents”.</span> <span id="s1992">He said “bring your parents.</span> <span id="s1993">I don’t care”.</span> <span id="s1994">So I brought my parents and we stayed there for a night or so and I said, and then my mother and dad said “no we can’t take his hospitality.</span> <span id="s1995">He doesn’t have enough himself.”</span> <span id="s1996">So we started walking and we saw a house, a vacant house.</span> <span id="s1997">Oh maybe a couple or three blocks away and we went towards that and we took shelter in there.</span> <span id="s1998">Well that night it started again.</span> <span id="s1999">The shelling and the firing and a bullet came in through the window, hit the, the iron bars and then fell on top of me.</span> <span id="s2000">It burned me but did not penetrate.</span> <span id="s2001">And it was on my breast and I threw it off you know.</span> <span id="s2002">And I thought I was going to, I thought I was shot.</span> <span id="s2003">I mean very honestly I thought I was shot, but it was just a hot bullet that had expanded its force.</span> <span id="s2004">So the next morning, we knew we couldn’t stay there because there was a Japanese sen, a guy that used to be a sentry.</span> <span id="s2005">He had still hold out up there and he was shooting down at the Americans.</span> <span id="s2006">The Americans didn’t even know he was there until I showed them the bullet.</span> <span id="s2007">I said I got shot.</span> <span id="s2008">And they said let me see the bullet.</span> <span id="s2009">And they said that’s a Japanese bullet or German.</span> <span id="s2010">What do I know and they said I will, I’d like to have it.</span> <span id="s2011">I said if you give it back to me.</span> <span id="s2012">That’s got to be my souvenir.</span> <span id="s2013">I never saw it again.</span> <span id="s2014">So then where do we go from here.</span> <span id="s2015">Well we didn’t’ really know.</span> <span id="s2016">So then my sister and I walked.</span> <span id="s2017">I said well while we are still in that house because we had nowhere else to go.</span> <span id="s2018">They were trying to shoot him and we were in the, in the fire line ok.</span> <span id="s2019">But finally the, the shooting stopped.</span> <span id="s2020">I said Eva, you and I. Let’s go and I’ll get, I hear there’s a well not far away.</span> <span id="s2021">Let’s go wash our hair.</span> <span id="s2022">I can’t stand it anymore.</span> <span id="s2023">we are full of mud.</span> <span id="s2024">And everything else and dust and what have you.</span> <span id="s2025">So we walked to the shelter over there.</span> <span id="s2026">I mean to the well over there.</span> <span id="s2027">Got, washed our hair.</span> <span id="s2028">On the way back we run into a GI.</span> <span id="s2029">And he says “a white girl.</span> <span id="s2030">Out here, white kids.</span> <span id="s2031">What happened.</span> <span id="s2032">I didn’t think any white people were here.”</span> <span id="s2033">And I said “yeah, yeah we have white people here.</span> <span id="s2034">Well this is my sister and our name is Mijinski, Margot Mijinski.</span> <span id="s2035">He said you Jewish?</span> <span id="s2036">I said “yes”.</span> <span id="s2037">I said “yeah so are my parents.</span> <span id="s2038">I want you to meet them”.</span> <span id="s2039">So we went back where the house was you know.</span> <span id="s2040">And he said “you guys can’t stay here.</span> <span id="s2041">Come with me.”</span> <span id="s2042">And it turned out he was Jewish too.</span> <span id="s2043">He was 33 years old.</span> <span id="s2044">He was invasion forces, armed forces 37 Division.</span> <span id="s2045">And he was the one that gave me my very first book, reading material.</span> <span id="s2046">And then he somehow, he managed to take us and other people to Caisson City where they will put us into an old school house that we, they converted for refugees.</span> <span id="s2047">So I don’t know how many, again a hundred people or more were in this very small school house.</span> <span id="s2048">And we, they divided, the partitions were like sheets.</span> <span id="s2049">Families were like that.</span> <span id="s2050">And that’s then I got myself a job from my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2051">She saw me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Was this Ernest Benesch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">A: Yes it was.</span> <span id="s2054">That was Ernest Benesch.</span> <span id="s2055">Our savior.</span> <span id="s2056">He was, he brought us fruits, he brought us food, at, ever he could get from the commissary over there and from the mess hall.</span> <span id="s2057">And he gave us some food and K, K rations.</span> <span id="s2058">I mean he was the very first one to give us something like that.</span> <span id="s2059">And even some chocolate.</span> <span id="s2060">I mean he was just wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: How long did you stay in that shelter and how did either the army or some other organization help you to settle into a more livable situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: We were in that school house for a long time.</span> <span id="s2063">We then around the corner we found that somebody had an empty almost like a shack.</span> <span id="s2064">It was horrible, no rugs, we had cement floors.</span> <span id="s2065">But there were a couple of beds in there so we were there.</span> <span id="s2066">And from there we, we waited until our visa, then they con, everybody contacted us.</span> <span id="s2067">The Red Cross was around of course.</span> <span id="s2068">They gave us clothing.</span> <span id="s2069">We had nothing as you know They gave us clothing.</span> <span id="s2070">They even gave me my first sanitary napkin.</span> <span id="s2071">And they fed us.</span> <span id="s2072">I mean we just kind of survived and we couldn’t leave until 1948 and we were in that very, around the corner from that school house.</span> <span id="s2073">We were staying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: You were getting ready to tell me how you got a job and maybe you could tell me just the process of getting yourself in a position to get to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: Ok.</span> <span id="s2076">I had after liberation, when we are still in that school house I had to go downtown.</span> <span id="s2077">I wasn’t going to just wait for something to happen.</span> <span id="s2078">And I was walking and all of a sudden somebody said Margot, Margot.</span> <span id="s2079">And I’m looking around.</span> <span id="s2080">Who is, who is calling me and it was my girlfriend Rosie Helman.</span> <span id="s2081">And Siggy Helman.</span> <span id="s2082">Come up here, come up here.</span> <span id="s2083">I said my goodness.</span> <span id="s2084">I said you are alive.</span> <span id="s2085">Oh they were, we just hugged and kissed and cried.</span> <span id="s2086">I mean that was such a wonderful reunion.</span> <span id="s2087">You have no idea.</span> <span id="s2088">And, oh I went upstairs to the Helmans and they had food and they sent some food home with me to that place.</span> <span id="s2089">And I was able to give my parents, my sister, some sausage and a few other things.</span> <span id="s2090">And they told me that they are opening an officers billets and they’d like me to come work for them and that’s what exactly happened.</span> <span id="s2091">They opened the officers billets.</span> <span id="s2092">I went to work there as a receptionist.</span> <span id="s2093">And I was really so innocent and so ignorant of everything.</span> <span id="s2094">I saw balloons laying there.</span> <span id="s2095">I thought and I was asking the boy the houseboy to give me them for my sister.</span> <span id="s2096">And he says no, I’m not going to give you that.</span> <span id="s2097">I said why not.</span> <span id="s2098">My sister is only 12 years old.</span> <span id="s2099">I said I want to give her something that she hasn’t had in years.</span> <span id="s2100">And I said I don’t even know if she ever knows what a balloon looks like.</span> <span id="s2101">He says no I can’t give you that.</span> <span id="s2102">I was so upset.</span> <span id="s2103">When I went upstairs to see the Helmans.</span> <span id="s2104">I slept over there by the way.</span> <span id="s2105">I only went back home on weekends cause the distance was very far and I had to walk.</span> <span id="s2106">There was no transportation.</span> <span id="s2107">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s2108">And so I told the Helmans what had happened.</span> <span id="s2109">That these beautiful new balloons were laying there.</span> <span id="s2110">They wouldn’t even give me one for my sister.</span> <span id="s2111">And they said no you don’t want that.</span> <span id="s2112">That’s those rubbers that the officers use when they bring in girls and then it dawned on me what it actually was.</span> <span id="s2113">But that’s how, to show you how innocent and how ignorant I was.</span> <span id="s2114">And then, from then on in, I was able to bring food to my parents and I met a lot of officers up there, GIs and they took us to dances and Rosie and I and Siggy they took us to all these dances.</span> <span id="s2115">But you know every time there was backfire from a truck, I thought it was an explosion.</span> <span id="s2116">I dove under the under anything and everything I could find for protection.</span> <span id="s2117">And they would just stand there and laugh.</span> <span id="s2118">I said look it’s a very sad experience for me.</span> <span id="s2119">Don’t laugh.</span> <span id="s2120">Because to me I feel like I’m being shot at.</span> <span id="s2121">And it took me a long time to get over this backfire.</span> <span id="s2122">I always thought that I was being shot.</span> <span id="s2123">And so we went over there and then the rabbi, the chaplain, we had a Passover at one of the commissaries or whatever.</span> <span id="s2124">He was able to locate a place; that was our very first Passover.</span> <span id="s2125">And we, in fact I still have their Passover books, the Hagadah in a bound, what the GIs would carry with them.</span> <span id="s2126">And that rabbi Felden was the very first chaplain that was in 1946, we had our very first Passover.</span> <span id="s2127">And I was so nervous.</span> <span id="s2128">I was so upset about everything.</span> <span id="s2129">That I, well I was nervous to go to a dance.</span> <span id="s2130">I would break out in hives.</span> <span id="s2131">I mean completely from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s2132">And I was itching and I was, and then I found out I was allergic to the shellfish that I was eating at the Helmans.</span> <span id="s2133">I didn’t know what I was supposed to eat.</span> <span id="s2134">Besides that, I wanted to go back just one more time.</span> <span id="s2135">My mother had pleurisy before we were liberated.</span> <span id="s2136">And we talked to this a rabbi like person.</span> <span id="s2137">Maybe it was Mr. Konigsberg.</span> <span id="s2138">At this point I don’t’ even know who told us.</span> <span id="s2139">It’s ok to eat pork.</span> <span id="s2140">You got to get meat, you got to eat meat.</span> <span id="s2141">Otherwise, you’ll never get over this pleurisy.</span> <span id="s2142">And my mother didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s2143">He said look you’ll making, doing a sin more so by not eating than you would be by trying to survive.</span> <span id="s2144">The thing is now survival.</span> <span id="s2145">And that’s when finally she would eat.</span> <span id="s2146">We would try to buy some meat for her, not us, for her but she shared with us of course.</span> <span id="s2147">We’d buy just the, the like the hoofs or the head or something because we had to cook that up for her and it was the hardest thing for her to do, to eat that.</span> <span id="s2148">And then finally we got visas and it was in 1948, in February.</span> <span id="s2149">And we boarded upon an army transport and women in one section, men in another section lined up for the mess hall to eat.</span> <span id="s2150">We went over Shanghai because we didn’t have, we didn’t’ have any warm clothes so in Shanghai we got some clothes.</span> <span id="s2151">And then we made it to our San Francisco where our relatives and aunt Ruth.</span> <span id="s2152">She in the meantime after her husband had passed away, Mr. Binger, she married Ernest Karliner who also adopted my cousin.</span> <span id="s2153">And they were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s2154">They had an apartment just across from them.</span> <span id="s2155">And so we were, we were taken in over there.</span> <span id="s2156">And I met my husband in the Golden Gate Park.</span> <span id="s2157">He was seeing a friend of his.</span> <span id="s2158">We were walking very first week we arrived.</span> <span id="s2159">We were walking in the Golden Gate Park and my husband saw this friend of his that came from Shanghai.</span> <span id="s2160">And he came up to me, up to the where we were and he says oh how about you.</span> <span id="s2161">I haven’t seen you since Shanghai.</span> <span id="s2162">He’s telling his friend.</span> <span id="s2163">And the friend said oh let me introduce to you Ernie and Margie Mijinski and he said to my husband.</span> <span id="s2164">Now my husband said to me, you know you look like somebody I know.</span> <span id="s2165">You look somebody like, somebody I know.</span> <span id="s2166">I said “sure I’ve heard that line before.”</span> <span id="s2167">He said “no I mean it.</span> <span id="s2168">You look like a Mrs. Karliner.</span> <span id="s2169">I says Karliner, that’s my aunt.”</span> <span id="s2170">And he says my goodness, they’ve been telling me about you for years, that if you ever come to the states, I must meet you.</span> <span id="s2171">And slowly we got together and about, this was in 1948 when we came.</span> <span id="s2172">And in 1949 I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Margie, because you had people who could sponsor you in the United States, which I assume you still needed even though you had a visa that was supposed to get you to the United States from 1938.</span> <span id="s2174">Why did it take so long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Well because it took so long because my mother had German quota.</span> <span id="s2176">My dad was Polish quota.</span> <span id="s2177">Even though he never really lived in Poland but he was now Katowice, it was Polish.</span> <span id="s2178">And the Polish had a very small quota.</span> <span id="s2179">And so he said you guys go ahead and we would leave him.</span> <span id="s2180">In fact, in Germany they offered the children to be taken to England and we refused.</span> <span id="s2181">I said I’m not going without you mom and dad and my sister.</span> <span id="s2182">I’m not leaving.</span> <span id="s2183">Oh no you take your little sister with you.</span> <span id="s2184">I said no way, I’m not.</span> <span id="s2185">And that’s we stayed together and when we got to San Francisco, my dad got a job as a janitor.</span> <span id="s2186">I worked, I was trying to sell advertising which I had in my middle I was, after the war I was selling movie slides advertising.</span> <span id="s2187">And that’s how I was helping to support my parents.</span> <span id="s2188">And that’s, and then my husband, he had a bakery in Oakland.</span> <span id="s2189">So after we got married, I worked in the bakery.</span> <span id="s2190">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: What were the hardest things for you and your family to adjust to when you got to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: Well we had to get started.</span> <span id="s2193">We had nothing.</span> <span id="s2194">Just what the Red Cross had given us.</span> <span id="s2195">And so we had to get a life again.</span> <span id="s2196">But we stayed up in the, with furnished apartment where my aunt lived on side.</span> <span id="s2197">We lived on the other same floor.</span> <span id="s2198">It was very beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s2199">And like I said I went looking for a job right away.</span> <span id="s2200">I got a job through an agency in an insurance company.</span> <span id="s2201">I worked there.</span> <span id="s2202">They promised me they would promote me, promote me but every time three months were up they put me into another and wouldn’t give me a raise.</span> <span id="s2203">And after the second time I said forget it.</span> <span id="s2204">I’m out of here and I left and I had another job and then we got married and I moved to Oakland and we are now in the United States already since 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Was it important to you that Ernie had been through a similar experience.</span> <span id="s2206">Did that have anything to do with your choice of him as your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: It certainly did.</span> <span id="s2208">I wanted to marry another Jewish man of my background and he was somebody that I really liked.</span> <span id="s2209">A very gentle, generous caring person.</span> <span id="s2210">And we’ve been married 47 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Let me ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s2212">I know we need to stop.</span> <span id="s2213">How do you think all of this has affected the way that you view your life and the way you have lived your life since all of this happened to you and your family and it was such an unusual experience in so many ways.</span> <span id="s2214">And the last thing I was going to ask you is how did you find out about the fate of the rest of your family that had stayed in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Never really did.</span> <span id="s2216">We had to assume.</span> <span id="s2217">We tried to contact them then through the Aufbau, through all the different Jewish organizations and there was absolutely no trace of anybody alive, nobody.</span> <span id="s2218">So we had to assume that they all perished because there is nobody, nobody ever responded.</span> <span id="s2219">The Jewish committee, the HIAS, the Joint.</span> <span id="s2220">Nobody was able to locate anybody.</span> <span id="s2221">And as far as it having affected me personally.</span> <span id="s2222">As I have been getting older, it’s been harder and I’m now in therapy.</span> <span id="s2223">Under a psychologist because things are, they’re really getting to me.</span> <span id="s2224">And I’m a very nervous person and the therapist feels that this all dates back to my young days when I was growing up.</span> <span id="s2225">Not enough food.</span> <span id="s2226">Leaving my grandmother leaving that I think was the hardest part of my whole exodus of Germany, having to leave my grandmother, my aunt, my uncle, but my grandmother was the number one.</span> <span id="s2227">And then I never got to see her again.</span> <span id="s2228">So that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: This concludes the interview with Margie Rosenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">(End)</span></p></body></html>
