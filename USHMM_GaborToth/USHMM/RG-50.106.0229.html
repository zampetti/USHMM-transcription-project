don't know if you're familiar with that part of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: And that used to belong to Germany once and then the Poles took

young?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: I was young and young -- because life was so different, kids were treated so different at that time of my life than now.</span> <span id="s45">I think a five year old now knows everything what's going on already, practically, they play on the computers and all that good stuff; and of course I come from the olden days, like my son calls it.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: And you moved with to Katowice just with your mother.</span> <span id="s47">Correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Just with my mother.</span> <span id="s49">And we, and we

<span id="s52">I used to see my father once a year during vacation time.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: And he used to go to Breslau.</span> <span id="s55">He came from Berlin to Breslau and I came from Katowice on my vacation to Breslau too.</span> <span id="s56">I had an aunt in Breslau and that's when I saw him.</span> <span id="s57">And I didn't like to go with him because I didn't know the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: You know, I saw him once a year and somebody tells you this is your father.</span> <span id="s60">It didn't mean very much to me at that, you know, at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s62">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: You know, seven and now eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: So anyhow my mother remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: And I had a wonderful stepfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Kurt Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Can you spell that for me,

id="s74">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And you said he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s77">And did your mother remarry him shortly after you moved to Katowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well, I would say maybe two years, a year and a half later.</span> <span id="s79">I really can't tell you exactly because honestly I don't remember exactly what year it was that she remarried.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s81">But he was wonderful and you remember him?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: He was very good to me.</span> <span id="s83">And, yes, I do remember him.</span> <span id="s84">And he survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, I think I'm jumping ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Yes, you are.</span> <span id="s88">And did your -- did they have any other children together?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: No.</span> <span id="s90">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s92">So you're living in Katowice now with your mother and stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And what happens next?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Next -- what happens next -- we have our own apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: And I got enrolled into a private school in order to learn Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: And this school was -- you know, the classrooms were so much smaller, so I learned fast.</span> <span id="s100">My mother never learned Polish, only spoke German.</span> <span id="s101">And I went to school.</span> <span id="s102">I was a school -- like any other kids at my age.</span> <span id="s103">I went to school every day and I came home.</span> <span id="s104">I did my homework.</span> <span id="s105">And in summertime I went outside to play, and in wintertime I had skis.</span> <span id="s106">I went little bit of -- did a little bit of skiing, nothing much.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: And used to spend a lot of time at my grandmother's, my cousins, the only cousins that lived in Poland.</span> <span id="s109">I was very close to him, we were just a few months apart in age.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: And he was alone and I was alone, had no siblings either.</span> <span id="s112">And so that's how my life was in Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: And what did your mom and stepfather do?</span> <span id="s114">What was their life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: My stepfather managed a factory, a soap factory, which was in -- it was in the family so he was in charge of that soap factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: GotchA:</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: And my mother did nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s119">And what was your life like with them?</span> <span id="s120">I mean, were you -- did you -- you know, were you a happy child; did you spend a lot of time with them; did you go to any sort of Hebrew school?</span> <span id="s121">You had mentioned private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No.</span> <span id="s123">I really didn't -- it's so different.</span> <span id="s124">Do you know anything about Europe, how different it was -- well, you're too young to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Well, I have some sense from talking to my grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s127">It was -- you didn't spend as much time with your parents as the people -- as the kids do here because --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: We had, you know, everybody had either -- maid service was very cheap, and everybody had a maid, you didn't have to be rich, and middle class people all had maids.</span> <span id="s130">And the kids usually spent more time with the maids than with the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: And we did certain, you know, the holidays, of course, we were always together at my grandmother's and my aunt, my mother's sister from Breslau, came to Katowice and we were always a happy family.</span> <span id="s133">And I was a happy child, I think.</span> <span id="s134">I had nothing not to be why -- hard for me to explain but anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Now, you're doing fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Nothing -- just a normal childhood at that point when I lived in...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And what language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s140">And did you have any hobbies?</span> <span id="s141">I know you had mentioned skiing.</span> <span id="s142">Were there any like organizations that you were affiliated with at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s144">I was with Bacopa (sp).</span> <span id="s145">I don't know if you're familiar with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">Can you tell me a little bit about that and when you did that and did you meet any friends doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: You know, the school I went to I was the only Jewish girl in my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: And through that all my friends were actually non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s151">Did I make any friends at Bacopa, I really don't remember.</span> <span id="s152">I remember more the school friends than I remember the Bacopa friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: And I had another problem with the school when I went into fifth grade, which was my last grade I attended school, after that I had no more schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: They wouldn't put me through because I didn't have a grade for religion.</span> <span id="s157">Because until such time -- until the fourth grade nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s158">But when it came to in the fifth grade, they wouldn't put me through because I wasn't -- the grade for religion was missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: So I had to take a special course with the Rabbi to teach me all the highlights in order to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: To go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: To, yeah, to get a grade in Hebrew -- in religion to put me through.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s164">So did you, did you go to synagogue at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s166">I did.</span> <span id="s167">Not too much.</span> <span id="s168">My grandmother, I remember, used to go like for Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s169">She used to go, you know, all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Not my parents.</span> <span id="s172">My mother -- we were just very reformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: But my grandmother was more religious.</span> <span id="s175">But we were -- like I said, she spend all day in temple.</span> <span id="s176">I used to go and bring her an apple with stuff pushed into it so that she could smell it.</span> <span id="s177">I remember that, that made an impression on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: I don't know if you're familiar with something like that or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: I haven't heard that before but that's a nice memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Yes, that's what I remember.</span> <span id="s182">Oh, I remember a lot about my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Is there anything else you would like to share about her or do we come to it later in the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: We can -- no, I don't think later -- well, yeah, that will be later in the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s186">Do you remember anything about your mother or stepfather's political affiliations?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: No.</span> <span id="s188">No.</span> <span id="s189">I don't know anything.</span> <span id="s190">Because, like I said, we were treated as kids.</span> <span id="s191">We were not pulled in and didn't hear everything what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: What was going on, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: We were sent out of the room.</span> <span id="s194">If there was something being talked about, we were told to go and get a glass of water and let the water on so that it gets really very cold.</span> <span id="s195">In order to fill up the glass so we don't come back too quickly into the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s197">And is there anything specific that you remember about Katowice such as the relationship between the Jews and the non-Jews in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: I know that there was already anti-Semitism -- how do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Anti-Semitism because there was people who had said don't buy at the Jews, don't -- but my uncle had opened store and they used to say don't buy, that's a Jew, and that's a -- Jews to blame for Jesus' demise.</span> <span id="s201">And when we had matzah at Passover we used to say there's blood in there from Jesus and they're made with blood and things like that.</span> <span id="s202">So it started, it really started.</span> <span id="s203">And of course when somebody talked about it, to you about it, of course you were always different, you weren't like the other Jews you were a different Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Well, you had mentioned that you were the only Jew in your class at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did you feel any anti-Semitism from the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I really didn't.</span> <span id="s210">But, like I said, the kids were not as involved in everything like the kids here at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: We were much more -- so I don't know if the kids heard what the parents were saying.</span> <span id="s213">I doubt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: But you felt general anti-Semitism in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s216">It started in about '38, and before the war too.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s218">And as -- you were still young at this time, but did you know anything about Hitler or the Nazi party or what was going on, you know, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s220">I remember the Nazi party from Berlin because they were chased.</span> <span id="s221">When we were in Germany, my mother and I still, that stuck in my mind that people were chased and I found out later they were chasing the Nazis at that time because they were just coming up.</span> <span id="s222">And the government -- you know, they weren't, you know, they weren't in power yet, the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: So they were like chased.</span> <span id="s225">I remember the chasing of people but I didn't know at the time why they were chased but of course later I found out later in my life what it all was about.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: So that's the only things that I remember from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And when do you remember first seeing the Nazis or feeling their presence in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: When -- right when -- in 1939 when they invaded Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: So I felt it right away because my whole life changed.</span> <span id="s232">We left --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So can you tell me a little bit about that from the very beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: 1939 it was -- no.</span> <span id="s235">September the 1st, when the war broke out, and my parents thought that if we move from Katowice to Kraków -- you know Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: There was an apartment there for us.</span> <span id="s238">My aunt, who was in soap factory, she had a beautiful apartment in Kraków and she went to England and she said we can use it.</span> <span id="s239">And my parents thought that Hitler won't come that far, Katowice and Kraków is about two hours away but I don't know why we thought that we would be safe in Kraków.</span> <span id="s240">So we left everything behind, including our dog, and we went to Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: And how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: We went -- how did we get there?</span> <span id="s243">That I can't tell you, I don't know.</span> <span id="s244">I don't remember how we got there.</span> <span id="s245">But calm was -- ____+ --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: But you remember leaving everything behind and --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s248">That I know because we just went -- of course our personal things I'm sure we took.</span> <span id="s249">But we left the place the way -- we walked out because we wanted to avoid the Nazis taking over Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: So you left in a hurry?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: So we left in a hurry, and we had the apartment in Kraków and we settled down there.</span> <span id="s252">And that must have been thirty -- was it '39 or -- I think '39.</span> <span id="s253">Yeah.</span> <span id="s254">And of course the Nazis marched right in.</span> <span id="s255">After they had Katowice, they came to Kraków and took Poland over all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Except for part, I think, of Russia too.</span> <span id="s258">You know something, it is all -- it is an overload in my head, honestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Because so much happened and so much time elapsed that it's melting altogether right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s262">You're doing wonderfully.</span> <span id="s263">You know, whatever comes to mind and you tell me, just do your best.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: So, anyhow, we lived in that apartment and right away they came that we had to wear -- I don't know first the Jewish star or the band --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: The yellow star or the yellow band?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s267">We had a band on our arm and that was right away the first things that we had to do, and that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: And you remember the Nazis coming into Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s270">It didn't take long.</span> <span id="s271">They took Katowice and, like I said, they didn't take long and they were in Kraków.</span> <span id="s272">I mean, it didn't take them very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Where we thought, my parents thought at that time they would not come there but they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: And what else -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: They made you wear the bands.</span> <span id="s278">And what were your parents doing at this time?</span> <span id="s279">Like, had your stepfather started working in Kraków when you first moved there?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span> <span id="s281">No.</span> <span id="s282">No.</span> <span id="s283">No.</span> <span id="s284">My stepfather left with a lot of other men, they were walking towards RussiA:</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: They left the women alone so they can escape from the Germans because the Germans killed, I think, a lot of men.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And so the men were more scared than the women and the men took off.</span> <span id="s289">And so my mother and I were alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: In Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: In Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: And did your stepfather leave before the Nazis came to Kraków or when they came to Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I think they started leaving already.</span> <span id="s294">He said something where I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s296">That's okay.</span> <span id="s297">No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Like I said, I wasn't -- I was a very protected child to a certain, you know, to certain time when my parents could no longer protect me.</span> <span id="s299">And I really don't, don't remember.</span> <span id="s300">Certain things like you ask me, I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s301">I don't know we came there by car or by train or by truck.</span> <span id="s302">Like you said, you asked me how we got to Kraków, I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s303">And the same thing now, did my father leave before or after the Germans, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s304">I don't think my -- I don't remember my father even being in Kraków at all.</span> <span id="s305">I, I, I, I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s307">That's okay.</span> <span id="s308">If something comes to your mind, you can always tell me later.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: That's not the most important thing if he was there or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Don't worry, that's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s312">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So you're in Kraków with your mother now at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And the Germans come into Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: And you're forced to wear a yellow band or a star?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: And then what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Then what happened is that the apartment below us was -- belonged to Jews and the German -- what do you call that -- German mayor.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: German mayor, new mayor of Kraków was put into that apartment because the people were furriers and they went to AmericA: So the apartment was empty.</span> <span id="s323">And like I said, it was a beautiful home, oh, gorgeous, the one from the furrier and good enough for the mayor to take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: You said it had belonged to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s326">I don't know if the whole building belonged to Jews, that apartment I know belonged to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Were not living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: That were in AmericA:</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: The couple -- and like I said, they were furriers and I don't know what the name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: So that's unimportant too.</span> <span id="s333">We -- after awhile we were asked, not asked to move, but we were thrown out of the building because of the Germans moved into our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: You and your mother were thrown out?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Right.</span> <span id="s336">And we were moved in to our apartment in a different section of town.</span> <span id="s337">I can't even tell you what section that was because I wasn't that familiar with Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And we had a small apartment and we even got something on our door from the -- from one of the Germans whom we befriended from the building, he give us a piece of paper to hang on the door that we should be exempt from any ratia I don't know if you know what ratia is.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s341">Like actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s343">Any that they come in and, you know, throw you out again or take your belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: We were -- at that point we were -- we had that thing on the door.</span> <span id="s346">Of course later on it didn't mean nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: So you had some protection in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: We had some protection in the beginning and that didn't last, of course, and we had to move again.</span> <span id="s349">And this time we had to move outside the city of Kraków and my stepfather was back in the meantime, he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: He came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: He came back, yeah.</span> <span id="s352">He never made it to where we wanted to go and he came back.</span> <span id="s353">I mean, it wasn't just him alone, quite a few men tried to get away and it didn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s355">So he came back and was living in the other apartment in Kraków or to the place to the other town that you had moved to?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: No, it was like a suburb of Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Kraków.</span> <span id="s358">You don't happen to remember the name of it, do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No.</span> <span id="s360">But I have still a little book from my mother that she made with addresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: If I only would know what I did with it.</span> <span id="s363">Since I moved from my house here to this small apartment I don't know where anything is.</span> <span id="s364">But should I find it, I would be able -- I would think that it might be in there.</span> <span id="s365">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Anyhow we lived in one room, my father, my mother, and myself.</span> <span id="s368">Out, you know, like in the field someplace.</span> <span id="s369">We had no bathroom.</span> <span id="s370">We had to go outside to outdoor bath, and we lived with people who owned that -- oh, God, it's hard for me to explain all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: It was like a building?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: No, it was like a farmhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: A farmhouse.</span> <span id="s374">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: And we lived in one of the rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: And the farmer lived, you know, on the premises and we shared that room out there with them.</span> <span id="s378">And how long did we live there?</span> <span id="s379">I don't think too long.</span> <span id="s380">My mother got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: While you were living in the farmhouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">My mother got sick and she was taken to the hospital and she never came back from the hospital.</span> <span id="s384">She got blood poisoning.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Blood poisoning?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s387">And passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s389">And you were with your stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: And I'm with my stepfather.</span> <span id="s391">In the meantime, Kraków was opening up a ghetto and my stepfather did not want me to go into the ghetto because he had to go to work and I would be alone all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: It must have been hard for you at the time, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Oh, it was.</span> <span id="s394">That's why I don't really like to talk about it because it brings up, you know, it stirs everything up.</span> <span id="s395">Like one woman here tells me I'm like an ostrich, I like to put my head into the ground because I have -- because there are so many bad, bad things.</span> <span id="s396">I left some out too.</span> <span id="s397">We tried to get back to Katowice and how we were thrown out on the middle of the road, the Germans caught us, and all little details which would take forever to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Please share whatever you want to share because we have as much time as you need.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I know but...</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: I'd like to hear everything that you're willing to share with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: I know but, you know, as I talk new things come up again.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s403">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Then I interrupt myself and what I was saying and spit out the new things so I better forget some of the things because really it would take three years on the phone, as long as the war was, four years.</span> <span id="s405">Anyhow...</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s407">So you're having a hard time at this point because your mother had passed away and you're living in a farmhouse with your stepfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s409">And my stepfather had to register to move into the ghetto, which was being raised in Kraków for all the Jews to get in.</span> <span id="s410">And, like I said, he -- my grandmother, in the meantime, and my aunt and my cousin, they had to leave Katowice because Katowice was made Judenfrei.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Jewish free?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s413">No Jews in Katowice.</span> <span id="s414">That was a birthday present for Hitler from Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: That Katowice -- so my rest of my family, like I said, my grandmother, my aunt, my cousin, they had to go to Chrzanów or Krenau.</span> <span id="s417">I don't know if you heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q:How far is that from Katowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I think it would be just between, the middle between Katowice and Kraków.</span> <span id="s420">I think maybe the middle.</span> <span id="s421">I have no idea how many miles or anything.</span> <span id="s422">I never...</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Do you know how to spell the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">In German it is K, like in King, R, like in Robert, E like in Edward, N like in Nelly, A like in apple, and U like in united.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: And in Polish it is C like in Charles, H like in Harry, R like in Robert, Z like in Zebra, A like in apple, N like in Nelly, O like in orange -- Chrzanów -- I think W.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: And you believe that's somewhere in-between Katowice and Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s430">I can look it up for you.</span> <span id="s431">I have an iPad, I could check it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: We can try to find that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s434">Fine.</span> <span id="s435">So what my stepfather did, he spoke to my aunt over the phone, I assume, or sent me a letter that he doesn't want me to go into the ghetto and he wanted me to be with my family anyway.</span> <span id="s436">And so it was arranged that I am going to go live with my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: And that I did.</span> <span id="s439">And that I remember I was on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: A train.</span> <span id="s441">By yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: By myself, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And how old were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: In 1941, 1940, I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Thirteen.</span> <span id="s446">And do you know what happened to your stepfather when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s448">I know that my stepfather, since he came back, I was told, he ended up in a camp too.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s450">So first he was put in the ghetto in Kraków?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: He was, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: And then was sent to a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Now, you said you went to go live with your grandmother and your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s458">My aunt, yeah.</span> <span id="s459">My mother's sister and her son, my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: On a train.</span> <span id="s461">Do you remember how long you travelled by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: And had Nazis come to power in that town as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Oh, Nazis were all over.</span> <span id="s467">The Nazis took over Poland completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s469">So you remember the Nazis there when you went to go live with your grandmother and your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s471">Because more or less that was like a ghetto where we lived already.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, it was where all the Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: So you weren't in the ghetto in Kraków --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: -- but you ended up being in the ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Well, it wasn't open yet on that day.</span> <span id="s477">It was not -- the ghetto in Kraków was enclosed.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: You had to show identification papers and -- and -- in order to get in and out.</span> <span id="s480">Where in Kraków -- in Chrzanów you didn't need that, you just lived in a section where all the Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: But it was open.</span> <span id="s483">It was such a small -- it was a tiny town.</span> <span id="s484">I mean, really they couldn't even block it off if they wanted to.</span> <span id="s485">And from there we had a lot of _____ at night -- oh, yeah we had an apartment, okay, from some subletting from somebody, from another man and his son, there was no wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And he give us one room.</span> <span id="s488">So we were, by now we were my grandmother, my aunt, my cousin, and I, four of us in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: And at night, many a night we were woken up because we had these Germans soldiers they woke us up in order to search the rooms or wake us up and throw us out in the street for the time being and so on.</span> <span id="s491">And then we -- one night we were thrown out and we had to go on the marketplace and they hung somebody, and we had to watch it.</span> <span id="s492">Because the man was a baker and he baked -- he wasn't supposed to bake, only at certain hours, and he was caught baking like black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: And he was hung.</span> <span id="s495">And like I said, all the Jews had to go and watch that, and including me.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: And that is another thing I will never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: I'm all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: And then the next ratia we had we were all again on the market square and that time we were sorted out.</span> <span id="s504">We were sorted into three categories: One, we were sent to camps; one could stay behind in the same town; and the third category was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s505">My aunt and my grandma could still stay behind and --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And continue living in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: And continue living in the ghetto with my, with my cousin too.</span> <span id="s508">And I was the one who was taken into camp, sent into concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: And that was 1940, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: '41.</span> <span id="s514">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: And I was sent -- first we were in Auschwitz too, but not in Auschwitz in the, in the thing, but just in Auschwitz which used to be like a station where they again sorted you out where you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Anyhow I don't think I was alone, there were a few other girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: You were put on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: We were put on a -- not a train anymore, it was now a cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Cattle car.</span> <span id="s521">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: We were put into cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Were you allowed to bring anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: I think so because I know I took my party dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: One suitcase.</span> <span id="s527">And, of course, since I was a dumb kid, I took a party dress with me, of course other things too but that was very important, a party dress to take and --</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Did you know anything about where you were going at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: No.</span> <span id="s530">No.</span> <span id="s531">Nothing.</span> <span id="s532">Nothing.</span> <span id="s533">Didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s534">I had no -- I didn't know about camps or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So you were able to go back to where you were living and pack a suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span> <span id="s537">No.</span> <span id="s538">No.</span> <span id="s539">No.</span> <span id="s540">No.</span> <span id="s541">No.</span> <span id="s542">I wasn't able to go back.</span> <span id="s543">I don't know how I got the suitcase or how I got the clothes.</span> <span id="s544">If my aunt has to bring it someplace, I don't know.</span> <span id="s545">But I know that I wanted that dress, that I remember, because I had that dress with me.</span> <span id="s546">Or maybe I could go back?</span> <span id="s547">You know, those are the things I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s549">That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I don't know if I went back because I know I wanted the dress.</span> <span id="s551">If I told my aunt that I -- but I didn't see my aunt anymore, we were separated.</span> <span id="s552">So that wouldn't make any sense, would it?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: So you were with all other women around your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: No, I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: I used to be very tall and maybe looked older than I really am and that actually saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Because, like I later found out, my whole family I never heard from them again.</span> <span id="s561">I guess the next ratia they had my aunt and my cousin and my grandmother, I never heard from them again, they were gone.</span> <span id="s562">So I was the only one who survived from...</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: So you were put on a cattle car --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: -- with these other women?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s567">And we went to a place called -- I'll spell it for you -- it's H-A, N like in Nelly, S like in Sam, D like in David, O like in orange, R like in Robert, and F like in Frank, Hansdorf.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: And then there's a small A and a line and then put a line -- I don't know what you call these lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: And an A -- no.</span> <span id="s572">A-M, that is Hansdorf amdaire (sp) -- an A and a D.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: A and a D. Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s575">Hansdorf --</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: It was an A and a D. Hansdorf -- no, an A and an M, Hansdorf on the Marsh, the Marsh it's an M.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s579">Hansdorf am.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s581">On the marsh and that was in also Dayton Deutsch land that was in Czechoslovakia before the German called it Austo (ph) Dayton they took it over too.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s583">And how long did it take you to get there, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No.</span> <span id="s585">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: But do you remember it being a long trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: I don't remember that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I really don't.</span> <span id="s592">I only know that that's where we arrived.</span> <span id="s593">And we were 150 women and we had barracks, which were really not as bad as my next stop.</span> <span id="s594">We had barracks and bunk beds, there was even a stove in the middle which -- and there was a big factory right next to the barracks and we started working in the factory that was spinning, spinnery, but spinnery is not what people think, we were making thread.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Thread?</span> <span id="s596">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: From flax.</span> <span id="s598">Yeah.</span> <span id="s599">And I was servicing the machines about 150 -- oh, maybe not that many, I don't remember exactly how many spools on the machine.</span> <span id="s600">And if they needed -- once the spools filled up, you had to take them off and put empty spools on again, and that's what we used to do.</span> <span id="s601">And I must have been more ambitious because I wanted a machine, I wanted to run a machine.</span> <span id="s602">I didn't want to be running from machine to machine.</span> <span id="s603">So eventually I qualified to run my own machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: And I was very proud of myself so...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: So that was in a factory, like you were living in barracks at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: We were.</span> <span id="s608">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: And then you were taken to a factory in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No.</span> <span id="s611">It was right actually next door.</span> <span id="s612">The barracks were put up so that you really didn't have to, you just walked but of course you had guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: You had live-in guards so, and when we wanted to write a letter to our family, if we worked, for instance, after hours in the field -- we worked 12 hours, from 6:00 to 6:00.</span> <span id="s615">And then if you -- in summertime if you wanted to work in the fields, we would get to write a letter.</span> <span id="s616">And then the worst thing, which I do remember, is that they took us to a basement.</span> <span id="s617">People had potatoes in the basements, you know, by the bushel.</span> <span id="s618">I don't -- are you anything -- are you anything familiar with Germany at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Yes, a bit.</span> <span id="s620">A bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: But you don't know how people lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Not exactly, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: But describe it to me the best that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s626">Well, in the basement people used to stock up with potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: And the potatoes, many times, if the winter wasn't that cold, started rotting away.</span> <span id="s629">And from rotting away you had thousands and thousands of little flies.</span> <span id="s630">You know those food flies?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Food flies.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s633">And they needed those basements cleaned out and we had to do it.</span> <span id="s634">And the _____+ basement and I would never forget that was the worst stench and the worst thing because whatever you did you couldn't even breathe because those flies were all over you.</span> <span id="s635">And I hate, I hate little things that crawl or fly from that day on.</span> <span id="s636">I would always say I'd rather have an elephant coming towards me than anything that crawls or flies little because of those damn flies.</span> <span id="s637">I can still feel them and see them.</span> <span id="s638">So that's what you had to do too and --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: So that was -- sometimes they made you do other work besides the flax?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Right.</span> <span id="s641">If you wanted to have a privilege of writing.</span> <span id="s642">Well, with the potatoes there was no -- you had to do it.</span> <span id="s643">There was no asking you if you want to or don't want to.</span> <span id="s644">They never ask you if you want to or don't want to.</span> <span id="s645">They didn't.</span> <span id="s646">You did it.</span> <span id="s647">But sometimes you got, you know, you got curb (ph) for it, like a letter to write or sometimes you got nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: So that was not the worst camp really, that was really because the accommodations were horrible, I mean, they were bad enough but not horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the barracks that you stayed in with the other women?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s652">Well, the barracks were fairly -- they were new actually.</span> <span id="s653">They were a light wood.</span> <span id="s654">They were -- we had bunkers and we had -- we slept on wood and hay, like hay stuff, but at least it was clean in there and there was some heat.</span> <span id="s655">I don't remember the bathroom facilities anymore in that particular place, I do not remember them.</span> <span id="s656">But they couldn't have been too bad because it didn't make any impression on me.</span> <span id="s657">Where the other camp I was in, I remember those vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Now, all of the women that you had come with from your grandmother's town on the cattle cart, were you all together in the barracks and working in the factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Or was there some sort of selection process when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No.</span> <span id="s662">There was -- there was -- some might have gone further to another camp and some might have gone to another factory.</span> <span id="s663">Not everybody came to be -- were all together, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s665">I'm sorry to -- can I go back for one minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Can you just tell me a little bit about the conditions of the cattle car on your way to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: The cattle car, the cattle car is -- what conditions do you want?</span> <span id="s669">We were like cattle.</span> <span id="s670">We were -- we had no room to breathe because there were more people, it wasn't just the women from, from, from Chrzanów.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Chrzanów.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: There were other people too from other little cities.</span> <span id="s673">We were all -- that's what I said, we all met in Auschwitz in -- like I said, it wasn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: In the station?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes, where people got together like -- what did you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: You had called it I think before a station.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Well, like an assembly hall, let's say.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s679">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Like everybody was assembled in that spot and then we were put into, I guess, different categories.</span> <span id="s681">You know, they had other factories too, not only where I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Other factories were some people used to work in the fence and I don't know what else the Germans used you for.</span> <span id="s684">But like I said, I can't think now what everybody worked and I only know what we worked in.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s686">Right.</span> <span id="s687">And what kind of clothes did you wear while you were there?</span> <span id="s688">Did they give you like a uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: No.</span> <span id="s690">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s691">I, I really honestly don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s693">And did you still have your belongings at this point, like the little suitcase that you had with your party dress or had that been taken way from you by now?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, I think I still had it.</span> <span id="s695">Because I know when I came back in 1945 when I came back to Katowice, I wore my winter coat because I was so skinny.</span> <span id="s696">The kids used to call me that I looked like a herring.</span> <span id="s697">They used to call me herring, that was like an insult.</span> <span id="s698">So I didn't want to go without a coat.</span> <span id="s699">So I must have kept my clothes because I remember the winter coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s701">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I know I had jewelry, which I got my ring from my mother, and the first one to -- when they called you have to give things up, I was they used to say ukopods (ph) and _____+ they -- used to call me ukopods (ph) because I used to be the German and, you know, everybody else was Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: So I was the first one in line to return stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s706">And you had said that you were making thread out of spools of flax.</span> <span id="s707">What kind of hours did you work in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: From 12:00 to 12:00.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: 12:00 to 12:00?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Twelve hours.</span> <span id="s711">Not 12:00 to 12:00, from 6:00 to 6:00 for 12 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: 6:00 to 6:00?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s715">And what kind of meals did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I know we got black coffee in the morning.</span> <span id="s717">I know we were always hungry.</span> <span id="s718">We got -- I remember the soups that was if you knew the person who was dispensing the soup, you might have gotten a potato in the water that they called soup or you got just water with a little bit of potato flavor.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: And then you got -- I remember you got, you had one round loaf and at first it was cut into four so each one got a quarter of that round loaf.</span> <span id="s721">I think it must have been a two pound loaf.</span> <span id="s722">And then later on in the years, as supplies got more skimpy, we only got then it was cut into an eighth of a loaf.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: So if you were able to keep it and just have a bite, good, but I couldn't.</span> <span id="s725">So I ate it all up and then I had to wait for the next portion.</span> <span id="s726">And I think that was, in the last few years I think that was for three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: And you said that there were guards watching you in the factory all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s729">We had guards standing in the entrance in each entrance of the particular division where we were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s731">And what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: It was women.</span> <span id="s733">You know, women with women is not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Because these were girls who were nothing and now they were big shots because they had the face of, you know, what to do.</span> <span id="s736">But that camp wasn't as bad so I won't even say anything about this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: It was -- since I have a comparison between fair and terrible, I will leave it for the next camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s740">But you were still hungry often?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And there were guards.</span> <span id="s743">Were there any men at your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No.</span> <span id="s745">I worked in two women camps, only women.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: And were there any sort of like cultural or religious activities going on in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: No.</span> <span id="s748">No.</span> <span id="s749">No.</span> <span id="s750">No.</span> <span id="s751">Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s753">And were there other women in the camp from different countries who maybe spoke different languages also working with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: Not in this camp.</span> <span id="s755">This was a small, about like 150 women, which is considered very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: And one more thing, I was in -- they had rabbits in the outside, they had like a thing built for rabbits in them, like stalls, little stalls.</span> <span id="s758">And I became the rabbit mother to feed the rabbits.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s760">You were taking care of the rabbits?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s762">I had to feed them.</span> <span id="s763">And I used to pick up the food for them and there were a lot of potato peels.</span> <span id="s764">Those poor rabbits, they got thinner and thinner, because I ate up all the potato skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s766">And was that a job that you did besides the factory work?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s768">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s769">There was just added little things.</span> <span id="s770">Everybody had something to do there, either sweep the barracks or, you know, everybody had to do a little bit to participate in keeping the barracks fairly, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: In order?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Fairly in order, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And did you meet any friends while you were at this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I knew one girl that I remember her, she was from the same city but she was older than I.</span> <span id="s775">We were all -- most of the girls were all older, they were all 17, 18, and I wasn't even 14 yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And how did the other prisoners -- how did you all treat each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh, we treated each other good.</span> <span id="s778">I mean, we had no quarrels or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: We were -- in the same experience for everybody, you know, we were all in the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: So we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: And you were in this camp, you said, for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Around two years.</span> <span id="s785">Year and a half maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s787">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: You know, time is really -- you had no time.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: You didn't know what -- you didn't know what was happening on the outside, at least I didn't.</span> <span id="s791">We had no radios.</span> <span id="s792">We had nobody to bring us any news from the outside.</span> <span id="s793">So you were isolated.</span> <span id="s794">You had no watches --</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: -- no calendars, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: And is there anything else about this camp or the fact, you know, or the area where you worked, anything else that you want to share about it?</span> <span id="s798">Anything else you remember specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: It was a very pretty area, that's all I know.</span> <span id="s800">Because when we went out in the fields, very pretty.</span> <span id="s801">Very bright and it was like a countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: A country where we were.</span> <span id="s804">And I cannot think of the name of it.</span> <span id="s805">Well, I told you, that was Hansdorf on the Marsh.</span> <span id="s806">You asked me for another name, what was it, which I couldn't remember?</span> <span id="s807">Oh, yeah, the city where we were where they threw us out from Kraków, when we lived in -- that's the place that I have to check.</span> <span id="s808">I don't know if I --</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Where the farmhouse was.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s811">We lived in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Do you know, do you know the name -- I know you had said the name of the camp, do you know where, where that was?</span> <span id="s813">What was like the closest city?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No.</span> <span id="s815">That I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s817">But it was Hansdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Hansdorf on the Marsh.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: It must have been a river.</span> <span id="s821">Hansdorf and Marsh is river, so Hansdorf on the river.</span> <span id="s822">On certain -- on that river.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s824">And where were your guards from?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I have no ideA: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span

have any sort of contact with people outside of the camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: No.</span> <span id="s832">No.</span> <span id="s833">No.</span> <span id="s834">No.</span> <span id="s835">No.</span> <span id="s836">We were not -- they were not allowed to talk to us and we weren't allowed, certainly not, to talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: So, no, you don't have any, no contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: And then one night, again one evening, they told us to take our belongings, whatever we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: And we were put again on a cattle train and we were riding in the unknown again.</span> <span id="s843">We were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Everybody in the whole camp was taken away or just certain people?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: No.</span> <span id="s846">Everybody in the whole bunk, the camp was being dissolved and we are going someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: And we ended up in hell on earth.</span> <span id="s849">We ended up in Trautenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Can you spell that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s852">T like in Tom, R like in Robert, A like in apple -- I have to write it out because I don't think I can --</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: I should have done it before because I'm --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s856">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s857">Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s859">I need a piece of paper too.</span> <span id="s860">I don't know if I'm spelling it right.</span> <span id="s861">I should have -- T-R-A, T like in Tom -- I don't think I'm giving you the right spelling of that --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s863">We can come back to it if you'd like.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: In Polish -- in Czech I can give it to you, I think, better.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s866">You can do it that way if you'd like.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: It's T like in topple, R like in Robert, O like in orange, T like in Tom, U like in united, O like in orange, and V like in victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Trutnov.</span> <span id="s869">Okay.</span> <span id="s870">And how long -- actually, first of all, do you know when this was, like what month or year?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: No.</span> <span id="s872">The year I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s873">It must have been maybe 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s875">1942.</span> <span id="s876">And do you remember like what season it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: I think it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Maybe winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: It must have been November, yeah.</span> <span id="s880">It was very cold there anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: And you were taken by cattle cart there and do you remember how long the ride was?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: No, because, you know, you don't care how long the ride is, you just want to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Right, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: And everything seemed like forever, which I'm sure it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s888">So you were taken there to --</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Because I checked it out, that I have checked out, and the distances don't look tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s892">There we were put into an old factory that was not in use.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: What happened when you first -- I'm sorry to go back -- what happened when you first got off the cattle cart?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: We marched.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Were you separated into separate groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: We marched.</span> <span id="s897">No, we were all the same 150 girls that left from there, from Hansdorf, and we were marching towards our new quarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Which, like I said, was an old factory not in use with windows -- no windows in them, in some, not all, dilapidated, terrible, that was our new home.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s901">And do you have any idea -- was Trautenau the name of the camp or was it in a specific town or city?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: No, Trautenau is a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s904">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: And Trautenau is by -- by -- is Trautenau by -- oh, God, I'm trying to think -- no.</span> <span id="s906">Trautenau, actually we were not in Trautenau, Trautenau is a city.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: And we were in -- we were next to Trautenau and that is -- I can't think of the name now, of the place.</span> <span id="s909">You have to give me a little time, it slipped my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s911">No problem.</span> <span id="s912">We'll try to come back to it when it comes to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s915">So you got off the cattle cart and you were marched to this old abandoned factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Right.</span> <span id="s917">And that's where we had -- God, I can't -- there were -- the hall, place where we walked in, there were all -- not bunk -- not double beds, just single, single bunkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q:Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: The whole thing full of them.</span> <span id="s920">One after another.</span> <span id="s921">And again straw, straw things with like a sack filled with straw and I don't know with what we covered ourself.</span> <span id="s922">I don't remember if there was a cover on or not.</span> <span id="s923">I can't remember that.</span> <span id="s924">Parshnitz, that's the name of where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s926">Next to Trautenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yeah, Parshnitz by Trautenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: You know how to spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: No, I would love for you to spell it for me, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s932">It's P like in Peter, A like in apple, R like in Robert, S like in Sam, H like in Harry, N like in Nelly, I like in Ida, and T like in Tom, and Z, I think there's a Z at the end like in ZebrA:</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Parshnitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s936">So tell me more about the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s938">So, No. 1, we had no bathroom facilities except open stalls.</span> <span id="s939">And when you went to the bathroom, there was a line in front of you waiting to take the next seat but you had no privacy whatsoever.</span> <span id="s940">I mean really, so that was getting used -- I mean, you have people standing right on top of you waiting for you to get -- that was terribly dehumanizing.</span> <span id="s941">We had no hot water, only cold water.</span> <span id="s942">No toothbrushes, no nothing because --</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: So anything you had taken with you from the old camp you no longer had?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s945">We had the clothing, I think.</span> <span id="s946">Because, like I said, that coat was --</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: The winter coat, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s949">So I must have had some clothing with me.</span> <span id="s950">But I don't think we were wearing clothing there, our clothing.</span> <span id="s951">I think we wore a uniform in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s953">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: I can't remember.</span> <span id="s955">Don't forget it's 60 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s957">No.</span> <span id="s958">You're doing great.</span> <span id="s959">Whatever, whatever comes to mind you let me know.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s961">Well, that was -- like I said, that was a terrible place.</span> <span id="s962">I did the same thing like I did in the other, in the other factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Making the thread?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: And I did -- again I had my own machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Were you working in the same place that you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: No.</span> <span id="s969">No.</span> <span id="s970">We had --</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: So you were living in the old factory but they brought you somewhere else to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s973">They took us to a factory that was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Was it close by to where you were living?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: No, we had to march over there every morning through ice and snow or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: We were, we were -- now we were more people.</span> <span id="s978">This was a camp for 2,000 people.</span> <span id="s979">From 150 we were 2,000, and we had 500, I understand, Hungarian women from Auschwitz that came that were there too in our camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s981">And where were the other people from besides Auschwitz and --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Mostly from Poland, they're mostly Polish people.</span> <span id="s983">You see what they did too is that from Poland they sent the people to Czechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia they sent the people from Poland or Germany, because they didn't want you to run into anybody familiar.</span> <span id="s984">Like let's say you would know a guard or something, this way you didn't know anybody because you came from different parts of the country, of the countries.</span> <span id="s985">I think that was the main objective.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: So now we had guards that were standing in front inside the barracks -- not barracks, we weren't in a barracks -- inside our sleeping quarters and we were counted every morning, like when we went to work.</span> <span id="s988">And if it -- if somebody was missing, we would be standing in the cold in wintertime, of course, forever and the day until they found the person that was missing -- and I'm jumping again.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: But it's really -- where we lived was hell, that's what I told you.</span> <span id="s991">And the guards, when we wanted to go to the bathroom, we had to excuse ourselves.</span> <span id="s992">And if the guards said, no, you can't go right now, we couldn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: So we had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s996">Did you also have guards in your sleeping quarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Not in the sleeping quarters in the factory, in the entrance and exits in the factory.</span> <span id="s998">So if you wanted to leave your post and go to the bathroom, you just couldn't do it without asking the guard who was standing between you and the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1000">And the guards again spoke German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: The guards spoke German.</span> <span id="s1002">Maybe they spoke Polish too or Czech, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1003">I spoke fluently Germany so for me it was, you know, no -- I had no problem speaking German so I..</span> <span id="s1004">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And the factory that were working -- you were those 150 women and then more people from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: More people from different places that were sent there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1008">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: So it made -- like I said, we were 2,000 people among the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1011">And can you tell me about your meals at this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: My meals, what meals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: We used to say, "Too much to die from and too little to live on."</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: So it was a starvation diet.</span> <span id="s1017">It really was.</span> <span id="s1018">And I don't know how much longer, you know, we could have done it.</span> <span id="s1019">Because we were all losing our strength.</span> <span id="s1020">Because if you don't get enough nourishment and all you do is work....</span> <span id="s1021">Unfortunately I was in my growing stages and that's why I have so many hang ups right now, I think.</span> <span id="s1022">Maybe I would have had those anyway but I'm blaming everything on these years whatever I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1024">I understand.</span> <span id="s1025">Did you make any friends in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Friends, I made friends.</span> <span id="s1027">A girlfriend that I, to this day we are in touch, when I was in Chrzanów, in Krenau with my grandmother -- I'm going backwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I made friends with her and she's in Australia and we are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: But she wasn't sent to these camps with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1032">We met after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1034">And what else can you tell me about this camp Trautenau?</span> <span id="s1035">Was it very crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Well, yeah, it was crowded because all we had is bunk beds -- they're not bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1037">I always say bunk beds, they're not.</span> <span id="s1038">One bunk bed, single.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Right, single beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Yeah, and that was what the whole thing was, just beds.</span> <span id="s1041">And an entrance to that bathroom where they stood in line in front of you or I stood in line in front of them, whoever was on the potty.</span> <span id="s1042">And there was no, nothing else, except cold.</span> <span id="s1043">It was cold in there because I think the factory was cold anyway because of the flooring, stone flooring and no heat.</span> <span id="s1044">And, yeah, you know what I forget to tell you, that I was in England too.</span> <span id="s1045">But I can't -- you know something, it really -- my life is so, there is so much more.</span> <span id="s1046">I forgot to tell you after I came back in from the -- oh, that is really later.</span> <span id="s1047">What am I saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Later, we'll get to that.</span> <span id="s1049">We'll get to that.</span> <span id="s1050">That's after the war.</span> <span id="s1051">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1053">Are you going to be with me on the phone till tomorrow morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Don't worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Really it's too -- I talk too too much.</span> <span id="s1056">I maybe should cut it shorter a little bit because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: I think you're doing fine, but if you feel like you want to stop or take a break, that's okay.</span> <span id="s1058">Whatever works for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: What time is it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: It's 3:10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: 3:10.</span> <span id="s1062">Another half an hour but that's going to be it then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1064">Okay.</span> <span id="s1065">No problem.</span> <span id="s1066">Okay.</span> <span id="s1067">So we're still talking about this camp.</span> <span id="s1068">In this camp, where you said there were so many people, were there men in this camp or still only women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Only women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Only women.</span> <span id="s1071">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: We had men one time -- towards the end of the war, they were dissolving camps.</span> <span id="s1073">You know, we weren't that far from the Brzeznica, to get you an idea, you know what the Brzeznica?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: So we were not too far from the Brzeznica, that's a vicinity at least from Parshnitz and Trautenau is, and before the end of the war they were dissolving camps and we had the transport coming through with only men.</span> <span id="s1076">And we didn't want -- I don't know, the British -- I was liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1077">That camp, where they had the men coming through -- I don't know who would have liberated them -- but to tell you these men could hardly walk, they were dying.</span> <span id="s1078">They were dying by the hundreds.</span> <span id="s1079">And they came overnight to park their bodies in our camp.</span> <span id="s1080">And in the morning, when we woke up there was like a wagon full with corpses of men lying outside and on the wagon, and they pushed these men further and further to walk because they didn't want them to be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: And that was the only time we had men in the -- hardly men because they were more dead than alive.</span> <span id="s1083">It was incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: And so all your guards were also again women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Yes, except the guards on the outside.</span> <span id="s1086">Like we had like in prison they have these patrol things, they were normal looking, and those were men, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1088">And were those Nazi personnel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: That I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1090">I had no contact with anybody except for the women to ask them if I'm allowed to go to the bathroom or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1092">And the prisoners, the other women who were with you, did you treat each other well at that time as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Well, I think the Hungarian and the people from -- that were not from Hungary, I don't think they liked each other too much, why I could not tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1095">Okay.</span> <span id="s1096">But you sensed some tension between them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Then we had lice sections where we all were -- I mean, infections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: We were, a bunch of woman, we were disrobed.</span> <span id="s1102">Whatever we had on, we had to give up.</span> <span id="s1103">They shaved our heads and to check us for lice.</span> <span id="s1104">We were defumed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: -- of lice.</span> <span id="s1107">And we had no -- they took our hair off -- oh, that was wonderful too, that was another wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s1108">And there was another incident which was horrible when we were all sitting naked around, and just to think about it make me shudder.</span> <span id="s1109">And so that was -- what else would you like to know about that camp which was a horrible camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Was there ever a time there that you got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: You didn't want to get sick because if you got sick and you couldn't work, they had every months transported, transports that picked you up and you were gone and never heard of again.</span> <span id="s1112">So you really didn't want to get sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: So somehow you managed to get up and go to work every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1115">And like I said to you, we got too much to die from and too little to exist from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Did anyone ever escape from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1118">People had no energy.</span> <span id="s1119">They had no, no strength to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1120">Maybe that's why they kept us so -- and the guards all over, and lights, and they had these beamers going.</span> <span id="s1121">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1122">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1123">Don't forget, 2,000 women you can't know what everybody's doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1125">Of course.</span> <span id="s1126">Of course.</span> <span id="s1127">And you didn't have any contact with anyone outside of the camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Not from that camp, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1130">And did you know anything about what was going on, sort of in the outside world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: In the first camp we heard that the English or the Americans -- I don't think America was yet in the war when we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: We heard a little, but in the second camp we didn't hear nothing, we didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: And were there any sort of like executions or killings that went on while you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: No.</span> <span id="s1136">I didn't see anybody being executed.</span> <span id="s1137">No.</span> <span id="s1138">Like I said, we had these transports and they picked up the people who weren't productive anymore and I think those were sent to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: So whoever, whoever didn't make it it was because of hunger or, or they got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Or being sick, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1143">And they -- that's why people didn't want to get sick or didn't let themselves be sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: You know, you push and push till you really drop dead, practically, because otherwise you wouldn't dare.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1147">Is there anything else you remember that you want to share about this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No.</span> <span id="s1149">I was wishing for somebody to come and get us out of there not knowing who to wish for, or who was in the war or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1151">And you were in this camp for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: To the last day of war, the 8th of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s1153">The last of last days.</span> <span id="s1154">That is the official, I think the 8th of May is the official date when the war really ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: And that's the date when the Russians liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: So before you were liberated did you know that that time was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Did anything change in the camp in the days prior?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1161">They kept -- the guards were all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: All the guards, from outside and inside.</span> <span id="s1164">And we knew something was up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Because that was a -- that was the telltale that something was going on.</span> <span id="s1167">Who is coming or what is coming or why is it coming, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1168">But we knew, you know, that there is something better ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1170">So you said May 8, 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1172">Like I said, the last, the very, very last day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: So what happened on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: On that day the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: And of course we couldn't communicate with them because nobody spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s1177">And we were very happy.</span> <span id="s1178">I mean, you know, we were jubilant that we have -- that the Germans are gone.</span> <span id="s1179">That we are free, that much we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: And what some of the women did, they went to town -- they got their strength, they ate -- first of all, everybody ate and ate, whatever the Russians brought us.</span> <span id="s1182">And then of course a lot of people got sick because their stomach couldn't take what -- to digest all that food.</span> <span id="s1183">And then the women who had more strength, or some of them, they went to town, to Trautenau, and I understand they smash all the windows, the store fronts, and were -- what do you call that, taking merchandise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: Looting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes, they were looting the stores, which really wasn't very great, but that's what they did.</span> <span id="s1186">And the Russians, of course, helped them.</span> <span id="s1187">Maybe they went with the Russians on their Jeeps.</span> <span id="s1188">I don't know how they got downtown, but they did.</span> <span id="s1189">And I had to go to bed.</span> <span id="s1190">I went to bed because I was so weak that I just let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: So from May till I think August I didn't go back to my home town because I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s1193">I had to recuperate, but anyhow...</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: So where did you recuperate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: In, in -- over there, I stayed in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: To get some strength back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: And how did the Russians treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: They treated us right, I think.</span> <span id="s1200">I, you know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1201">I understand there were some rapes too.</span> <span id="s1202">Of course nobody, you know, I didn't have that problem because nobody would even look at me twice, never mind once.</span> <span id="s1203">And I was so dumb.</span> <span id="s1204">I was so naive.</span> <span id="s1205">I didn't even know what was going on in camp, women between women, I had no -- I swear to you I had no idea that something like this existed.</span> <span id="s1206">I was a very dumb, young woman -- young girl, I wasn't a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: You had said that you were also younger than most of the women who were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s1209">I was always the youngest because I was one of the youngest taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: So you stayed there until August with the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Yeah, and let them feed me and actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: You got your energy back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Got my energy back.</span> <span id="s1214">And then again cattle car because, you know, we had no other transportation but cattle cars, they wouldn't take us and we had no money to pay for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: So the Russians took you by cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: No.</span> <span id="s1217">We just took a cattle car.</span> <span id="s1218">They -- not the Russians didn't take us but we got a certificate from the camp who took over the director for the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: He give us a certificate that we spent, you know, so much time in the camp and to please give us, you know, more or less a courtesy, show us some courtesy and that same piece of paper we travelled with because we had no other identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: And you decided to go back to Katowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: And another two women, sisters who lived outside of Katowice, were with me on that particular trip back to Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: And why did you want to go back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Because I thought maybe somebody from my family is back.</span> <span id="s1227">You know, I didn't know that nobody is going to be back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1229">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: And that's the only place I knew, where I grew up.</span> <span id="s1231">I knew my mother wouldn't be there.</span> <span id="s1232">But, you know, my aunt, I thought somebody's going to, my cousin maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Of course nobody was back and I didn't know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s1235">And those two ladies were nice enough and they said they were going to take me home with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: The ladies that had travelled with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Yeah, they were travelling.</span> <span id="s1238">They came from camp too but they were more mature women than I was and they knew exactly where they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1240">And did you register when you got to Katowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1242">I went to the Jewish, to the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Registry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: -- registry and I registered.</span> <span id="s1245">And of course I was looking for somebody that I knew from my family, of course.</span> <span id="s1246">Like I said to you before, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1247">And I thought I'll go back to the train and I throw myself under the train, really because I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1248">Everybody -- Katowice was normal already because Katowice was liberated in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: So more time had gone by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Yeah, had gone by.</span> <span id="s1251">And they were back to normal, you know, what normal was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: And here I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1254">My grandmother had a house in Poland that she owned.</span> <span id="s1255">Not a house, an apartment building but there was strange people living in there, I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s1256">And like I said, if not for the two women that took me, I would have not known what to do with myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1258">So you went with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: So I went with them and maybe three weeks later, or something like that, my stepfather came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: He survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: And he went to the Jewish welfare, whatever that was where I registered, and found out where I was and came over there.</span> <span id="s1264">And of course I was very, very happy to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: And he then took me away from those ladies and we were together.</span> <span id="s1267">And we built -- and we lived in a, got a room together.</span> <span id="s1268">And I don't know if it was my grandma's home, but I don't think there was anything open, if he decided to evacuate, I don't know that.</span> <span id="s1269">I don't -- like I said, I don't know how but we were together and how long, not even a year, because there was a lady who lived in my grandmother's house and she -- and my stepfather and her became friendly, and then my stepfather had his sister living in London, England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: A sister, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: His sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: His sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: The one that was with the factory, with the soap factory, her husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: -- owned the soap factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Oh, the one that you had moved into their apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1278">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: There was a children transport going to London from Katowice, and my aunt in London arranged for me to come as a domestic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Why did you -- why did your stepfather want to send you to England as opposed to staying there with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Because he felt I had no future.</span> <span id="s1283">The Russians were there and he figured I will have no future in Poland.</span> <span id="s1284">He said if I go to England, it's going to be more of a future for me than in Poland.</span> <span id="s1285">And eventually he got married to that lady and I think maybe they wanted me out.</span> <span id="s1286">That I realized later on when I got a little wiser that maybe they felt it would be better for me not to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Do you know when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: When that was when I got to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: In 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1292">So you weren't in Katowice that long --</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: -- before going to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: No.</span> <span id="s1296">I went to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: So someone was arranging a transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1299">It came from London from a Dr. Schonfeld, I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Doctor who?</span> <span id="s1301">Can you spell that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: I hope that's the right name.</span> <span id="s1303">He was -- he worked for the -- for one of the organizations and he arranged the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: That was actually a children transport and for that transport I was already old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Because at that time I think I was already 18.</span> <span id="s1308">In 1945, I was 18.</span> <span id="s1309">Right.</span> <span id="s1310">And those were all smaller kids.</span> <span id="s1311">Like I said, it was a children transport but somehow I got on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: And what was the name of the doctor again?</span> <span id="s1313">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: I think Schonfeld, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Schonfeld.</span> <span id="s1316">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Something.</span> <span id="s1318">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1319">Don't hold me to exactly information --</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1321">No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Because I even have pictures from the boat where he is on because we docked right at the London Bridge in London.</span> <span id="s1323">London Tower, London Bridge.</span> <span id="s1324">London Tower.</span> <span id="s1325">I don't think there's a bridge called London Tower but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Tower of London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1328">We came right into London.</span> <span id="s1329">Docked right into London, in main London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1331">How was that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: It was another disappointment because here I was and I thought everybody is going to say, oh that poor girl, look at what she did -- had gone through in her young life.</span> <span id="s1333">And I be -- everybody going to feel sorry for me.</span> <span id="s1334">Aye-yi-yi did I get a rude awakening.</span> <span id="s1335">My aunt, I mean, my step-aunt actually, really she said as domestic and that's what I became.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: And I most normally didn't have the best of manners and she was a stickler for manners, which maybe was good because I learned quite a bit from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: But it was a hard life.</span> <span id="s1340">It really was a rude awakening.</span> <span id="s1341">And she had a friend, a young woman who lived in the same building, and I could hear complaining about me.</span> <span id="s1342">And I was so lonely and I was so unhappy but I grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1344">Did you stay in contact with your step-father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1346">I stayed in contact with my step-father and as a matter of fact, she was the one who wrote a lot, long, long letters because we didn't have iPhone or T-phones or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Like we have now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: And did you go to school while you were living with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: I went to the Northwest Polytechnic at night and guess what I took up?</span> <span id="s1351">Instead of learning how to speak English, I took up Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1353">Why did you decide to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Because I thought it so close to Polish that it's going to be easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: That was my thinking, very smart.</span> <span id="s1357">But I didn't take up English.</span> <span id="s1358">I learned English.</span> <span id="s1359">Maybe not a hundred -- I mean, I'm not really that fluent because I have words missing but my age has something to do with it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Now, your English, your English is very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1362">Well, I worked -- after a couple of years with my aunt, I learned enough English that I went and looked for a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Did she have other -- did she have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: She had one son who lived in Manchester, he was attending the University of Manchester.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: So he wasn't living in her house with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: No.</span> <span id="s1367">He came to visit sometimes and he was my first love too, really.</span> <span id="s1368">So that, that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: It must have been hard, you know, at first not speaking the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: You know, was there any sort of discrimination or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: -- other problems you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: No.</span> <span id="s1375">I had problems.</span> <span id="s1376">Like I joined a club too, I don't know which club I joined in.</span> <span id="s1377">I don't think it was BacopA: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1378">You know, the people went out at night and there were a lot of foreigners in that club, not all British people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: And everybody was jabbering away and I was sitting there, I didn't know one thing.</span> <span id="s1381">I didn't -- I couldn't participate.</span> <span id="s1382">And I loved to talk, as you have noticed.</span> <span id="s1383">I came back and I was again, you know, so frustrating to be out with people and not, not to be able to participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1385">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: But I did learn and I did make up for it and that is part of my life, that was part of growing up for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: So how long were you living with your aunt in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Until 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: '51?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: From _____+ --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1392">So like five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1394">And I came -- I was dating a young man there for about two and a half years and -- but now I have to tell you quickly how I came to AmericA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Yes, I would love to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Well, I had a distant relative in Cape Town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: And they came through New York -- not New York, through London --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: -- to come to AmericA: Especially came through London because they wanted to see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: Oh, wow.</span> <span id="s1402">How did they know you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Because my mother's sister -- oh, God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: My aunt lived in Shahigh (ph) -- I don't go into all this.</span> <span id="s1406">That would really -- no, no.</span> <span id="s1407">Forget it.</span> <span id="s1408">Just forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1410">But a relative of yours told them you were in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Too much.</span> <span id="s1412">Too much.</span> <span id="s1413">Anyhow, they found out through my stepfather that I -- you know what, I should write a book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: You should.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Anyhow, yeah, let's go to another subject.</span> <span id="s1416">What should we talk about, it's already time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: You were -- they were going from Cape Town to London on their way to America --</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: -- and they knew you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1421">And we met and they said you have no future here, we going to see that we can get an affidavit for you to come to AmericA: Of course they couldn't give me an affidavit because they themselves needed an affidavit to come to AmericA: But again I have a relative in Akron, Ohio -- or had, I don't think she's still alive -- Dr. Proscauer (sp) and him I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s1422">I know his wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: -- when I was a young kid.</span> <span id="s1425">And he put up an affidavit --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: -- for me.</span> <span id="s1428">A man I have never seen.</span> <span id="s1429">Anyhow, I waited, I think, two years for it to materialize to come to AmericA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: What happened to the man you were dating for those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Well, the man I was dating was a Vietnamese man.</span> <span id="s1432">He was a young man, he was same age I was.</span> <span id="s1433">And I thought when I -- my relatives said you coming to America, like I said, you have nothing here, there's nothing for you here and blah-blah-blah -- so I already told you about the affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: So I thought when I tell him that I am going to America, he's going to say, well, darling, don't leave, we going to get married, but instead he said bye bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: So that didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1438">And I left to go to America and I came to America on the 1st of January, 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: And the relatives that I met in London came to pick me up at the boat and I had -- they had a house in Theodore Park or Long Island -- I don't know which it is.</span> <span id="s1441">Are you familiar with New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Well, I live in New York but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Oh, you live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1445">But I live in New York City, but I'm not that familiar with the outer areA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1447">Well, it's, it's either Rego Park or Long Island, whatever you want to call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: And I lived with them, and my aunt at that time was practically 90 years old and the daughters were all spinsters, in other words, married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: And there was a son living in the house.</span> <span id="s1452">And like I said, I had a room there for me that they made up.</span> <span id="s1453">And I -- then after a couple of days I went and registered with the unemployment office, or whatever I had to do get my, I don't know, social security, if that was already, that I don't remember either.</span> <span id="s1454">Anyhow, I got a job in the garment center.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: And I worked in the garment center, which wasn't ideal either, and for a short time.</span> <span id="s1457">And where they let you go because they have no work, what is that called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: When you're on unemployment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1460">I don't ever got unemployment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Severance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: No.</span> <span id="s1463">No.</span> <span id="s1464">I just work there on -- layoff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: Layoff.</span> <span id="s1466">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1468">And I didn't like the job because I rather do office work instead of being in the garment center, didn't particularly like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: So I went to the unemployment office again and told them I was laid off and I'm looking for a job.</span> <span id="s1471">And I got called, I got called for an interview to -- do you know Chamber Street?</span> <span id="s1472">Of course you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1474">Yes.</span> <span id="s1475">Downtown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1477">I got called there was a G.L. Gailiff (sp), it was a gun wholesaler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: And they had a storefront too, but they were distributors for Berettas, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1480">And they needed an office girl, and I applied for the job and I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: And I loved it.</span> <span id="s1483">I had the best time in my life working for that company.</span> <span id="s1484">And after awhile I used to be girl Friday, like filing, and whatever, and at lunchtime I used to substitute the girls from the switchboard; and then she quit after awhile, and I got that job and became a switchboard operator.</span> <span id="s1485">And my boss loved it -- Jewish people who owned the company because people used to say, oh, is she French.</span> <span id="s1486">I don't know, I don't sound anything like French.</span> <span id="s1487">But, anyhow, he loved -- he liked me to be a switchboard operator.</span> <span id="s1488">So I did that for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: And at lunchtime again I helped my -- the office manager, who was the accountant too, I helped to type bills.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: And then I got that job to type, to be a billing clerk.</span> <span id="s1493">And that was so much fun.</span> <span id="s1494">I sat right next to him and he was the most wonderful person you would want to work for.</span> <span id="s1495">And there I stayed until the day I came to Toledo, Ohio.</span> <span id="s1496">So here I am now and got married.</span> <span id="s1497">I met my husband shortly after I came to Toledo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: How did you end up getting to Toledo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: How did I end up -- my husband -- I became pregnant.</span> <span id="s1500">After my doctor said I will never have any kids, because we were married five years and nothing, and the doctor said you just won't have any children.</span> <span id="s1501">Well, did I fool him.</span> <span id="s1502">I became pregnant and we didn't want to raise a family in New York.</span> <span id="s1503">So my husband looked for employment out of New York and he got a job in Toledo, and that's how we came to Toledo.</span> <span id="s1504">And it was hard.</span> <span id="s1505">It was really hard.</span> <span id="s1506">Our beginning here was very, very hard because we expected Toledo to be something what it wasn't.</span> <span id="s1507">You know, we are here now 55 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: And it changed, Toledo grew quite a bit in those 55 years.</span> <span id="s1510">And it's still a hick town, even 55 years later.</span> <span id="s1511">So it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s1512">But now, you know, now I'm at the end of the rope anyway so it doesn't matter anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: So you had children together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1515">I have a daughter that is 55 years old, she was born in Toledo; and I have a son who is 52, and he was born in Toledo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: I gotchA: Do they still live there now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1518">My daughter works for Dillard's.</span> <span id="s1519">I don't know if you're familiar with Dillard's.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1522">She is assistant manager at a brand new store here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: And my son owns a very nice jewelry store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: That's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1527">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: And did they -- are they married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: They are both married.</span> <span id="s1530">My daughter has two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Oh, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: One is -- one just got married in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1535">And my son has three little girls, I mean, not little he has twins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Twin girls, and then he has, the oldest is going on 14 next month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: And they are really very, very pretty little girls, they are.</span> <span id="s1540">Both my kids married out of faith, my daughter is married to a gentile man and my son is married to a gentile girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: But they both turned Jewish on the girl, the oldest just had the Bat Mitzpah last year and the twins are having a Bat Mitzpah or Bar Mitzpah next February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Oh, that's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: So this is my love story, my life story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: So when you moved to Toledo you were pregnant already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1547">We came in January and I delivered my daughter on March the 4th, highly pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: And how did you adjust to sort of, you know, normal life after what you had experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: I adjusted actually quite well, you know, because a lot of people couldn't adjust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Do you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1553">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1555">Because a lot of people couldn't handle it.</span> <span id="s1556">And I -- I am pretty much happy-go-lucky and I think that helped me.</span> <span id="s1557">Maybe, maybe not deep enough -- you know, you can call it anything you want to.</span> <span id="s1558">I'm not a deep thinker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: I mean, do you think that your experiences during the war sort of -- you know, how did it affect you raising your family and your children and, you know, just sort of the values that you live with now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Well, I felt to be -- really started out, you know, it was hard.</span> <span id="s1561">I didn't bring anything into the marriage.</span> <span id="s1562">I know my husband definitely didn't marry me for money because all I had was two turtles, so that wasn't very much.</span> <span id="s1563">And I gave my kids anything I could, whatever we could give.</span> <span id="s1564">Because I always said, you never know what can happen.</span> <span id="s1565">I always have that in front of me to this day, I have that in front of me as far as money is concerned now.</span> <span id="s1566">You know, do I have enough money?</span> <span id="s1567">Will I be able to make it to the day that I no longer will?</span> <span id="s1568">That's how I think now.</span> <span id="s1569">And I believe in giving too.</span> <span id="s1570">I like to give with warm hands and not with cold hands, so that is more or less how I changed.</span> <span id="s1571">But I always was a giver even when I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: So it might not be just the camp.</span> <span id="s1574">I don't know if it changed me.</span> <span id="s1575">I -- maybe I value things more than I would have any other time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: Maybe I value friendships too more.</span> <span id="s1578">I value human life more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: You must enjoy spending time with your grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Oh, very much so.</span> <span id="s1581">Unfortunately being that I -- I am so tied down with the machines I have and can't go out without carrying oxygen with me -- and yesterday I was -- I had to go to a rheumatology specialist and I have -- oh my God, what is it called, that sickness?</span> <span id="s1582">Fibromy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Fibromyalgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Yeah, that's what I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: So you had some health problems over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1587">I have, I have bad ears; I have bad eyes; I have bad body; I can't breathe.</span> <span id="s1588">But otherwise I'm doing wonderful, as long as my mouth can go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: And your husband's still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: No.</span> <span id="s1591">I lost my husband 11, it's going to be 11 years in February.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Oh, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: So, and I had to give up my house because I couldn't, I couldn't handle it anymore and I was so attached to my house and that bothers me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Right, I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1596">I live now in adult living place and of course after home I had a very nice, brand new -- when we moved in -- brand new ranch house.</span> <span id="s1597">And I loved my house.</span> <span id="s1598">And I had a dog and I had my kids and I had my husband.</span> <span id="s1599">And I had to give everything up.</span> <span id="s1600">And the kids are married, you know, they live their own life.</span> <span id="s1601">I mean, I talk to them daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Two and three times a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: And they live close by?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Well, in Toledo everything is close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: The furthest point is 15 minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: That's the furthest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Well, that's good then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1612">Okay.</span> <span id="s1613">You think we more or less, more or less we have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Yes, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: So now you can evaluate what you can use and what you can't use?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1619">I'm sure we'll use everything.</span> <span id="s1620">And if there's anything that you decide later that you want to still talk to me about or you want to add, you know, please let me know.</span> <span id="s1621">And if there's anything that you have from the war that you'd like to share with the museum, I'm sure that they would love to make copies of any documents you have or any pictures you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: I do.</span> <span id="s1623">I do but I don't -- my daughter has them because I have one room and a bedroom and it's really not the biggest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1625">Well, if you speak to her and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: -- you know, she has time to share some of it, I know that all of that is so helpful, you know, for historians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: And the museum is an amazing place that can sort of help you cherish those objects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: I even have some cards that I got when we're allowed to get mail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Uhu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: You know, I keep everything.</span> <span id="s1633">And even then already I kept it, and I brought it back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: -- you know, that I got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: Well, again if there's anything, you could always, you know, be in touch with the people at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1638">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Or with me.</span> <span id="s1640">And I'm sure that they would love to make copies of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1642">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Or even if you wanted to donate them to the museum, they could become part of the collection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1645">Because my kids, you know, they really, they're already another generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1647">No, I'm sure the museum would love that.</span> <span id="s1648">I know that we took a lot of my grandfather's things and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: -- and donated it to the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Because it's a great place for people to learn from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1654">Can I just ask you about your grandfather, where did they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: He was born in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Oh, he was.</span> <span id="s1657">So you -- no, you were too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: Yeah, he was born in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">Q: And he was actually one of the Schindlerjuden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: Oh, he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Oh, that's good.</span> <span id="s1664">It's good.</span> <span id="s1665">So he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: He survived.</span> <span id="s1667">And my grandmother was from Rusnadov, Poland and she was sent to Siberia during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Oh, and she didn't survive or did she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: She survived.</span> <span id="s1670">She and my grandfather met in a displaced person's camp after the war in AustriA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: Oh my God, that is a story too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: So we heard a lot of stories growing up and unfortunately -- my grandmother's still alive but my grandfather isn't.</span> <span id="s1675">But we got him to record his story, you know, a few years back before he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1677">Well, I'm going to talk to my daughter, if she can get -- I have a document from the Kraków ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1679">That would be amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: That's made out in my name but of course I never used it because I never went to ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: But my father had it and I have it.</span> <span id="s1683">Because we had a maid and everything went to our maid, she took everything out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: When -- I don't know, how did my -- yeah, Marie.</span> <span id="s1686">She used to take -- I have some pictures from the family too because of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1688">Yes, that would be wonderful.</span> <span id="s1689">So you have all of the contact information you need.</span> <span id="s1690">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1692">Thank you so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Thank you, Mrs. Mann.</span> <span id="s1694">It was a pleasure speaking with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1696">I hope you don't have a headache too bad.</span></p> <p><span
