They came here to interview us from the Holocaust Center in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s5">So I said: 'Who can they send that would understand anything about socialism, the Bund, things like that?'</span> <span id="s6">We're here all alone.</span> <span id="s7">In New York we have friends.</span> <span id="s8">Here they think the Bund and communism is the same thing.</span> <span id="s9">We don't have nobody here.</span> <span id="s10">To the other survivors, if it's not Zionism, that's it'.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">WH: What was your involvement with the Bund?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">AZ: I was working with the leather workers union.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">NZ: And I was born near Treblinka in a small town.</span> <span id="s14">I belonged as a 17 year old to the Zukunft.</span> <span id="s15">That was the stage for my age.</span> <span id="s16">The Bund started in 1897.</span> <span id="s17">We went to lectures and excursions sponsored by the Bund in Poland.</span> <span id="s18">Not like here, where they just play cards and watch television.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">WH: When the war started, did the Poles act differently towards Jews in the Bund?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">AZ: No.</span> <span id="s21">To them a Jew is a Jew though there were exceptions.</span> <span id="s22">But very few.</span> <span id="s23">But I ran to the Russian side during the war because I was afraid of the Poles.</span> <span id="s24">But I will tell you, if I could have what we had in Poland.</span> <span id="s25">I had such a life, such a culture, I would give up everything, every material possession that I own.</span> <span id="s26">In Europe I just had a roof over my head but I had culture.</span> <span id="s27">Here, it's all lost.</span> <span id="s28">I'm all alone and I can never get it back again.</span> <span id="s29">And that's a real tragedy.</span> <span id="s30">(It's interesting that he says someone like Mrs. X has no culture and Mrs. X says person B had no culture because she read Dickens and Uncle Tom's Cabin.</span> <span id="s31">One could only say that each person's version of what is culture can differ.</span> <span id="s32">To Zeder if you don't have socialism then you don't have culture.)</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: What year were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">NZ: 1912.</span> <span id="s35">We came to the U.S. with the Marine Flasher in 1948.</span> <span id="s36">I got an affidavit from the Jewish Labor Committee.</span> <span id="s37">The trip was free.</span> <span id="s38">UNRRA paid for it.</span> <span id="s39">At first we stayed in Lafayette Street where the HIAS was.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">WH: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">NZ: Two.</span> <span id="s42">A son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s43">My daughter is 44.</span> <span id="s44">Her husband is Jewish.</span> <span id="s45">But my son took a non-Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s46">But she converted like an Orthodox, she went to the mikveh and it was done with three rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">WH: How come you went to Atlanta?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">AZ: We had here a relative, a grand-uncle, and he sent us $100.00 to come.</span> <span id="s49">In New York we had the Bund, friends, everything.</span> <span id="s50">We was used to a different kind social life than they had here in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s51">In New York we had theaters, lectures, plays.</span> <span id="s52">Here everyone stays in the house, locks the doors, and watch TV or play cards.</span> <span id="s53">Is this a social life?</span> <span id="s54">When we came to Atlanta there was still a Yiddish school from the old-timers, the Americans.</span> <span id="s55">But the newcomers (refugees) they didn't want anything; they was a raw element; they didn't belong to any party or organization.</span> <span id="s56">So I considered myself a prisoner here.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">NZ: Twelve years we didn't know what it means to take a vacation.</span> <span id="s58">We worked seven days a week in the grocery store.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">AZ: Then I sold the store.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">WH: So why didn't you go back to New York then?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NZ: Because they wouldn't help us then.</span> <span id="s62">In the beginning they would help us.</span> <span id="s63">Since we left, they had no obligations to us.</span> <span id="s64">Here too, we came on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">AZ: When I came here my wife was still sick from the trip.</span> <span id="s66">So I begged the Federation for a doctor.</span> <span id="s67">So they said: 'We should get you a doctor?</span> <span id="s68">You have your own store.'</span> <span id="s69">So I went on my own to a doctor.</span> <span id="s70">But when I told the doctor the story, he refused to take the money, a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s71">I was insisting to pay but he said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NZ: When I came here and I was in the hospital, a non-Jewish woman in the bed next to me she heard I was a survivor, she felt so much for me, more than the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s73">The Jewish people, when we came here, they didn't want to know from us.</span> <span id="s74">We talked to the American Jews but they weren't interested.</span> <span id="s75">They said" 'The newcomers coming, they telling us tragic stories---leave us alone.'</span></p> <p><span id="s76">AZ: All they said was: 'The Greener; the Greener!'</span> <span id="s77">And when we start making a few dollars, they start open their eyes.</span> <span id="s78">'Look how much money they making.</span> <span id="s79">They probably got from overseas the money.'</span> <span id="s80">They was snobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: But you had opportunities here that you didn't have in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">AZ: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s83">It is a good country.</span> <span id="s84">We have to be thankful very much to this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AZ: Twice a year was coming here Jewish shows.</span> <span id="s86">From Arbeiter Ring.</span> <span id="s87">So we bought tickets.</span> <span id="s88">We love this.</span> <span id="s89">So another woman said she tried to sell tickets to a rich American couple and they said they couldn't buy tickets because they had to spend the money to support a survivor couple that they brought over.</span> <span id="s90">It's amazing, not to buy even a ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: Was there a difference between the Arbeiter Farband and the Ring?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">AZ: Yes, the Farband was a lot more Zionist.</span> <span id="s93">We were more with the Arbeiter Ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: What about this school that was here when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">NZ: The older people tried to get the newcomers to take it over, but we were the only family that was interested.</span> <span id="s96">They came from N.Y. to help us organize a branch of the Arbeiter Ring but no one was interested.</span> <span id="s97">They didn't know what it means.</span> <span id="s98">They don't read Jewish books, they don't read at all, just the TV.</span> <span id="s99">Even ________.</span> <span id="s100">She don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s101">In the first years we didn't want to look at her.</span> <span id="s102">Now, she's the leader of the group.</span> <span id="s103">So we stepped away.</span> <span id="s104">We don't wanna be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: Are you involved with the survivors' group here, Hemshech?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">AZ: Not at all.</span> <span id="s107">It's not my way, these people.</span> <span id="s108">First they ignore Yiddish.</span> <span id="s109">Everything they do in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">NZ: They do me a favor when they speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s111">My brother came over here for six weeks from Israel and he was wondering: 'Where these people lived in Europe that they don't know Yiddish.'</span></p> <p><span id="s112">AZ: I'll give you an idea what an element this is.</span> <span id="s113">Last week was here Abba Eban.</span> <span id="s114">So I went to hear him.</span> <span id="s115">I love to hear Abba Eban whenever he speaks.</span> <span id="s116">So I told a few newcomers.</span> <span id="s117">So they said" 'I hear from already.'</span> <span id="s118">One time and that's it!</span></p> <p><span id="s119">NZ: The same with Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s120">_____said: 'I heard him already.'</span></p> <p><span id="s121">WH: So how did you survive here?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">AZ: I was crying always.</span> <span id="s123">Now I'm telling youâ€¦.</span> <span id="s124">.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NZ: We gave up already.</span> <span id="s126">It's too late to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: Why didn't you return when you sold the grocery store?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">NZ: Because when we sold, we had $8,000 left.</span> <span id="s129">So we invested a little in real estate.</span> <span id="s130">We bought eight units.</span> <span id="s131">And we cleared $100.00 a month.</span> <span id="s132">That was then a lot of money.</span> <span id="s133">And we took in investors from N.Y., our friends.</span> <span id="s134">We helped them.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">WH: I spoke with your next door neighbor, Wind.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">NZ: Wind.</span> <span id="s137">Why you talk with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">WH: My friend Ben Hirsch said to talk with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">NZ: Oh, he's a millionaire.</span> <span id="s140">Works seven days a week in the grocery and they don't go nowhere.</span> <span id="s141">He was in the worst camps.</span> <span id="s142">He's nothing.</span> <span id="s143">Now he's crazy.</span> <span id="s144">They never go to a movie.</span> <span id="s145">They never go to a restaurant.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">AZ: He's the only newcomer that still stays in a grocery.</span> <span id="s147">Everyone else, they go rid of the grocery.</span> <span id="s148">They don't go to Israel.</span> <span id="s149">(In fact, they did.)</span></p> <p><span id="s150">WH: Do you subscribe to the Forwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">AZ: Of course.</span> <span id="s152">We got every Yiddish paper here, seven of them, everything.</span> <span id="s153">You name it.</span> <span id="s154">We got every Jewish publication.</span> <span id="s155">Come down to the basement here.</span> <span id="s156">I show you.</span> <span id="s157">I got here a thousand records.</span> <span id="s158">Every Jewish record I got.</span> <span id="s159">This is my only enjoyment.</span> <span id="s160">Every Saturday or Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s161">I hurry to do it.</span> <span id="s162">I put the records and I listen.</span> <span id="s163">My wife is mad at me.</span> <span id="s164">I live in the past, not in the future.</span> <span id="s165">(Not at all religious but goes on R.H. and Y.K.)</span></p> <p><span id="s166">WH: Tell me, are you sorry you didn't go to Israel?</span> <span id="s167">Do you think you would have been happier there?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NZ: Socially, yes.</span> <span id="s169">Much happier.</span> <span id="s170">I have friends there.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">WH: How do you vote here?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">AZ: Democrat.</span> <span id="s173">This time though, I vote for Bush because of Jackson.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">WH: Do you think the blacks are basically anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">NZ: Oh, and how.</span> <span id="s176">They are.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WH: Do you feel sorry for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">AZ: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s179">I do.</span> <span id="s180">They don't have it so good, a hard life here and the hatred is not for nothing, really.</span> <span id="s181">But the Jews tried to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">NZ: They came into the store, they buy beer and wine; the children without shoes- --this was years ago.</span> <span id="s183">They spend and Jews are saving the money.</span></p></body></html>
