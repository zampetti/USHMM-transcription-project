political?</span> <span id="s51">Were you interested in politics or involved in any way in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: My father was a Democrat.</span> <span id="s53">There is no doubt about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Was he a political man?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s56">Not at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you consider your family an assimilated German family?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Were you, at that time, a practicing orthodox Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span

would be at the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Was your family a particularly culturally oriented family?</span> <span id="s71">Were you interested in the arts?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes, my father was very much interested in the arts, in reading and especially Geography and History.</span> <span id="s73">These were his main interests.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Was he an educated man?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s76">Oh yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: In what way?</span> <span id="s78">To what extent?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: He naturally went through High School.</span> <span id="s80">He was what you would call an all-around man.</span> <span id="s81">He was not musically inclined, but still when we kids practiced the piano he could recognize the mistakes.</span> <span id="s82">However, he did not especially care to go to concerts or things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: She was more interested in the music.</span> <span id="s85">She was, in the main, a good housewife, that means mother and housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: She was not involved in any activity outside of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What type of neighborhood did you live in?</span> <span id="s89">Was it a primarily Jewish area?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: No!</span> <span id="s91">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Very much integrated with the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Can you remember, as a child, any incidents where being a Jewish boy was detrimental?</span> <span id="s95">In other words, did you have any problems as a child living in that type of environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: No!</span> <span id="s97">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Did you attend the regular public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: For how many years did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: You went up to the tenth grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No.</span> <span id="s104">Let me put it this way.</span> <span id="s105">Three years of grade school, then five years of high school, then two years of commercial High school.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Was that training in a particular area?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: It was just a general training.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Your brothers, were they also given the same educational background?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s112">My middle brother became a Diplomingenieur.</span> <span id="s113">(This corresponds to our Professional engineering, i.e., a state license beyond the undergraduate university learning).</span> <span id="s114">He graduated from the Technical High School.</span> <span id="s115">My older brother, he went to Commercial school in Neuchatel in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s116">He was trained in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: In the area where you lived, in Stuttgart, we now will get a little bit in the early history where it started to have problems in Germany; the depression and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s118">Was that a particularly industrial area, where you lived?</span> <span id="s119">Was it a hard hit area?</span> <span id="s120">Can you remember the circumstances of the economy as you grew up as a teenager, as you got through the 1920’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Not specifically.</span> <span id="s122">There was a big factory about one half block from us.</span> <span id="s123">The Busch Company which made blocks for cars.</span> <span id="s124">However I didn’t look so much at the economy because, after I graduated from Commercial school, I went into banking.</span> <span id="s125">I was an apprentice in a bank.</span> <span id="s126">Later I changed to be a salesman in a department store.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How long did you work in a bank?</span> <span id="s128">Was there a reason why you did not stay with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: You see I was working, during the inflation, for the bank.</span> <span id="s130">That was while there was the big inflation; every day you got a different kind of money.</span> <span id="s131">(Actually the value of the German Mark might be cut to ten percent of its value in a single day or even less).</span> <span id="s132">I don’t really remember what the reason was why I changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Do you remember the year, approximately, when you made this change?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes, that was about 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Were things getting a little rough then, or had they been rough for some time in the economy in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I think so, yes.</span> <span id="s137">I know that my father also died in 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Was your mother able to continue without financial aid?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s140">Yes, although my father lost quite a bit of money through WWI.</span> <span id="s141">The war bonds you know.</span> <span id="s142">However, we actually didn’t suffer.</span> <span id="s143">We kids didn’t suffer at all.</span> <span id="s144">We always had a clean, well kept household, in every way.</span> <span id="s145">We had peoples as guests, such as family.</span> <span id="s146">We had a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Your father invested in the German war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yes, when the war broke out, he signed up.</span> <span id="s149">He gave his gold watch and gold chain for the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s150">He got an iron one and an iron chain in exchange.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: He very much supported the German war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A; Absolutely!</span> <span id="s153">My oldest brother, he was only 16 (that would mean that he went into the army in 1913, i.e., as Europe was preparing for WWI whereas the shooting started only in August 1914), and was at that time in Berlin; when the war broke out he wrote my father that he wanted to enlist.</span> <span id="s154">He had to have my father’s permission.</span> <span id="s155">He enlisted in the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How long was he in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: The war ended in 1918.</span> <span id="s158">In November 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: He went through the whole war?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Was he injured in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes, he was gassed.</span> <span id="s163">I think that he was hit by shrapnel once.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q; Did your middle brother enlist also?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: No.</span> <span id="s166">He was drafted, but fortunately, when he was about ready to serve, the war was finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: You say that your family entertained.</span> <span id="s168">Were you a very social type of family?</span> <span id="s169">Did you entertain a great deal, or was it primarily family?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: It was primarily family.</span> <span id="s171">Now my mother had several ladies coming for coffee-clatch and things like that, but the entertainment was mostly of family.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: When your mother entertained, it apparently did not matter whether she was entertaining Jewish friends or German Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Mostly Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: The woman who worked for your family, was she Jewish or German?</span> <span id="s175">(Meaning Christian).</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did she work for you for quite a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s179">All the maids whom we had stayed a long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Do you remember any of their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: After your father died, in 1923, you were still in school at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I think that I was at the bank.</span> <span id="s184">I also took dancing lessons at that time.</span> <span id="s185">There were several Jewish couples taking such lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Ballroom type dancing?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yes, ballroom type.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you say that that was put on by the Jewish Community?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No, that was put on by a choreographer of the ballet, of the theater.</span> <span id="s190">He gave private lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Was there an active Jewish Community recreational center or anything of that type?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No!</span> <span id="s193">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: You had no involvement with the synagogue as far as recreation is concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s196">I belonged to a youth organization, but that was more for hiking and just such things.</span> <span id="s197">I would state that my father never went to the synagogue after he was married, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Was there a reason for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s200">When he was young his father forced him to go to synagogue at five o’clock in the morning, every morning, and he was opposed to the idea that his children should get the same kind of life.</span> <span id="s201">He also had the feeling that the rabbis were hypocrites; that, if you had money, they talked for an hour about you and, if you had no money, they were done with you in 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s202">He was a very good friend of his Rabbis outside of the synagogue, and he went out of his way to please them.</span> <span id="s203">I will give you an example: He was on a streetcar one day and the head Rabbi was on the same streetcar so he said: “would you like to have some strawberries?</span> <span id="s204">I have some in my garden.’</span> <span id="s205">So the Rabbi and his wife went with my father into the garden.</span> <span id="s206">My father picked them, they sat down at the table and they enjoyed them very, very much.</span> <span id="s207">Another time my father had to go on a trip and at the last minute the Rabbi came and he was out of breath and went into the car and could not find a seat.</span> <span id="s208">My father said: “Here is a seat for you!”</span> <span id="s209">The Rabbi said: “Here you can see the experienced traveler!”</span> <span id="s210">So, outside the synagogue it was OK.</span> <span id="s211">My father’s friends were all Jewish people.</span> <span id="s212">The biggest disappointment was that his best friend promised my mother that, if anything would happen to my father he would take me into his business, and when we tried to take him up on it, he turned “thumbs down.”</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: What kind of business was this man in?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: He was in silks.</span> <span id="s215">He worked with silks.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You mean textiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes, textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Thinking back on it now, do you wish that it would have worked out so that you could have gone into that business?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A; No!</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Why do you say that then?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Because he was a pretty stern fellow.</span> <span id="s222">I don’t really know what would have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: You say that you went to work in a department store?</span> <span id="s224">As a sales clerk?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: For about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Was that a German or a Jewish department store?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yes, yes, a Jewishly owned store.</span> <span id="s230">Afterwards I moved to Heidelberg, Germany, to a department store where I worked for three years.</span> <span id="s231">Then I worked in Nurnberg, also a Jewishly owned place called “Karper Schoppen.”</span> <span id="s232">Then I left from there to go to Kemnitz (the transcriber cannot locate this town, maybe the spelling is wrong or the name has been changed).</span> <span id="s233">I was there for about two weeks, then I came back.</span> <span id="s234">Then I started my own business.</span> <span id="s235">I did that because my middle brother was associated with his father-in-law in a big knitting company.</span> <span id="s236">I visited people, private people mostly, who needed extra large underwear and shirts.</span> <span id="s237">My clients consisted mostly of state or federal employees.</span> <span id="s238">In this way I was sure that I would get paid.</span> <span id="s239">That was also my downfall because as soon as Hitler came to power they were no longer allowed to buy from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Let’s backtrack a little bit now, I believe that we have gotten ahead of the story.</span> <span id="s241">Conditions back, in the early twenties were quite bad in Germany.</span> <span id="s242">Do you recall when things started to change?</span> <span id="s243">When Hitler began to have an influence in the situation in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s245">The so- called SA (these are the brown shirted storm troopers who made up the “Sturm Abteilung” which means the division which was going to attack) stood before Jewishly owned stores and told the people not to buy from Jews (this was the famous Boycott which Hitler organized shortly after assuming the office of German Chancellor in April, 1933).</span> <span id="s246">Naturally, as I pointed out once before, I lived right across the street from a big meeting hall.</span> <span id="s247">Hitler, in the beginning, when he came by taxi used that hall.</span> <span id="s248">He became very strong on the basis, not only that he accused the Jews but that he wanted revenge because the German people had been beaten in WWI.</span> <span id="s249">He wanted to put back the army (the treaty of Versailles, which ended WWI, severely limited the size of the German army and navy as well as removed some territories from Germany, some of them temporarily such as Upper Silesia and the Saar region, some of them permanently such as Alsace Loraine) into the cities which used to have soldiers (army garrisons were usual in Europe) and he naturally gained the applause of the merchants of these cities because it brought business in.</span> <span id="s250">He also appealed to the youth, which had been mostly unemployed.</span> <span id="s251">They were glad to get some uniforms and some brown belts, you know some of the heavy belts, it made them appear important.</span> <span id="s252">Anything which had to do with uniforms attracted people.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: I was just going to ask you, what year was that that Hitler had that meeting in Stuttgart, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Had you heard of him before?</span> <span id="s256">Were you familiar with him at all?</span> <span id="s257">With what he was doing in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes, because, as you may remember, there was a “Higler-Putch” (the attempted coup d’etat by Hitler and General Ludendorff in Munich in 1930, or something like that (actually it took place on November 8, 1923).</span> <span id="s259">They put him then in jail.</span> <span id="s260">He was known to be out to start a revolution (he had denounced the treaty of Versailles in a public meeting on January 27th, 1923).</span> <span id="s261">However, nobody thought that he would take it out on the Jews (Hitler had publicly stated on February 20th that his “German Worker’s Party” attacked Jews, large property owners and capitalists).</span> <span id="s262">We also had an organization called “Black-Red-Yellow” which were the colors of the Republic of Germany, as set up during the revolution of 1848.</span> <span id="s263">That was not the flag of the Kaiser.</span> <span id="s264">The Kaiser’s flag was black, white, red.</span> <span id="s265">This organization consisted mostly of liberal socialists.</span> <span id="s266">One of the leaders was the Minister of the Interior of Prussia whose name was Serbing.</span> <span id="s267">He was the first one to go over to Hitler, instead of leading us against Hitler.</span> <span id="s268">(Actually the Minister of the Interior’s name may be Goering, but it is difficult to hear on the tape, who became second in power to Hitler as Minister of the Interior of Prussia and President of the Reichstag).</span> <span id="s269">That was the end of the story (of our organization).</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: You were, at the time when Hitler came to Stuttgart, the owner of your own little business?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: No.</span> <span id="s272">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: You were still working either in the bank or in the department store?</span> <span id="s274">So you were able, despite his visiting to go ahead, it had no influence on you starting your own business.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What year did you start that business?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: In 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Were you very successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I would say “fair!”</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did you have employees working for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: You were out on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s284">In fact I worked indirectly for my brother.</span> <span id="s285">I got the merchandise from him.</span> <span id="s286">I put my orders in and they provided me with the material to sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You were like a sales person for the company then.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes, indirectly.</span> <span id="s289">I will tell you what concerned my own business.</span> <span id="s290">I had a very good relationship with my customers because, in contrast to how it is done in the U.S. where you rush with the customers, I took my time.</span> <span id="s291">I looked into the family life of the customer.</span> <span id="s292">I made notes to myself.</span> <span id="s293">When I came back, they were flabbergasted that somebody thinks about what happened to them.</span> <span id="s294">This makes me a bit angry, that it is not done here.</span> <span id="s295">I would say that wherever I came I was well received.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Did you work also within the community and had Jewish as well as German customers (CE utilizes poor terminology again since the Jews in the area were just about all German citizens having been subject to the military draft including fighting in WWI, having the full rights to vote and paying all the standard taxes and no special assessments, at least that was the case prior and during WWI as well as during the Weimar Republic.</span> <span id="s297">It is surprising that EH did not correct her on this item), or was it exclusively one or the other (meaning Christian or Jewish)?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: All of my customers were non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Non-Jewish?</span> <span id="s300">There was never any problem at all working with non-Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Not at all, except one time a lady was so enthused about the Nazi’s (members of Hitler’s party called the National Socialist Party after January 27, 1923).</span> <span id="s302">She went to a meeting and she was impressed by the snappy appearance of the youth and the flags and the trumpets and or everything else -- so she said: “You know, I was so interested in that, maybe we will get a better Germany from the Nazis.”</span> <span id="s303">I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s304">I went for lunch in a restaurant and came back after the lunch then her husband was there.</span> <span id="s305">While she was in the kitchen I said: “You know, I think that your wife was very much impressed by the appearances.”</span> <span id="s306">Do you know what he said?</span> <span id="s307">He said: “That is a woman for you.’</span> <span id="s308">He didn’t think that could happen.</span> <span id="s309">The majority of the people who voted for Hitler were youth and women, not men (probably statistics would not bear this out).</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: That is an interesting comment.</span> <span id="s311">Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: In the first place there was not enough to eat (in Germany in the late twentieth and thirties) and women are very emotional.</span> <span id="s313">He (meaning Hitler) had a way to enthuse people through his speeches, which were well prepared.</span> <span id="s314">There was Mr. Goebbels, his public relations man.</span> <span id="s315">(Joseph Goebbels served Hitler as Propaganda Minister) Goebbels was preparing the masses for Hitler’s appearances.</span> <span id="s316">All Hitler had to do was to come in and everybody screamed “Hurrah!”</span> <span id="s317">Goebbels incited them really.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: However, you said that the merchants welcomed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s320">You have to realize that, for example.</span> <span id="s321">A town near Stuttgart had two regiments of artillery, two regiments of cavalry, and one regiment of infantry before WWI, and through the treaty of Versailles that was terminated.</span> <span id="s322">All the army which Germany was allowed was 100,000 men.</span> <span id="s323">That included the navy, the army and the air force.</span> <span id="s324">Hitler promised them: “I will bring your soldiers back!”</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: He was going to defy the Treaty of Versailles?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Absolutely!</span> <span id="s327">He marched into the Rhineland, which he was not supposed to do.</span> <span id="s328">What happened afterwards; Czechoslovakia and Poland.</span> <span id="s329">He just went ahead.</span> <span id="s330">Nobody opposed him.</span> <span id="s331">He also had a friendship with Russia.</span> <span id="s332">What did he do?</span> <span id="s333">He invaded Russia too after a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: OK, we are getting a little bit ahead of our story.</span> <span id="s335">We will go into that a little more in depth later on.</span> <span id="s336">At the time when you owned your own business, do you remember what year it was?</span> <span id="s337">Also how old you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I started in 1931, and ended it in 1933 so I was, at that time, 25 until I was 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: I would like to ask you also what happened to your oldest brother after he had gotten out of the military service, after he had completed his service requirements.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: He worked for my cousin, in Germany.</span> <span id="s341">He even went to Spain for him.</span> <span id="s342">He spent quite a few years in Spain.</span> <span id="s343">He was working in import and export.</span> <span id="s344">He came back from Spain and worked then in Germany for this cousin.</span> <span id="s345">Actually, I don’t know whether, while he was in Spain my brother worked for my cousin or for another company, I am not certain anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: However, in the early thirties he was back in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So all of you boys and your mother were living in Stuttgart?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: No!</span> <span id="s350">My oldest brother was married in Ludwigshafen (Ludwigshafen am/Rhein) with a girl from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s351">They had three children, no, at that time, in Germany, they had only one.</span> <span id="s352">They had two more here in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Your middle brother was also married.</span> <span id="s354">Did he have children also?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: He also had children.</span> <span id="s356">He had two boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Did both of your brothers marry Jewish girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s359">No, all three kids, of my brother Frank, who lived in Ludwigshafen, were born in Germany.</span> <span id="s360">I know that because when they immigrated to the U.S., they came through Paris.</span> <span id="s361">The little boys and girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So they were just babies at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: I mean in the early 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, I would say that they were about five or six years old; seven or eight, at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: At the time when you started your business, you said that there really was no threat, that the Jewish community felt no threat from Hitler, at all, or were you getting leery of what he was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, really not (Hitler’s party’s strength snowballed beyond expectations in the elections of 1932 – but, even then, he could not form a government without including several other parties) because so many Germans believed that he would not do what he had said he would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: He had already threatened the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Oh yes, yes.</span> <span id="s370">When I was no longer able to sell to the German government employees, as I described, my two married brothers said: “Oh, why are you still here?</span> <span id="s371">Try to get out as fast as you can!”</span> <span id="s372">I must say that I was a very outspoken fellow and they feared that I might make trouble for them because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: That was in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: The two years that you were in business for yourself, did you see a manifestation of trouble brewing?</span> <span id="s376">Were there indications that things were not going well with the business or with your German Christian clients over that two -year span?</span> <span id="s377">Was there slackening in business?</span> <span id="s378">Or had it been fine until 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: It was pretty good.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Was there any speed up in activities with the German Nazi movement, within the Stuttgart area, or within Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s382">As I stated earlier there were some Nazis standing in front of the stores.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did that happen more than one time?</span> <span id="s384">Periodically?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s386">(Actually the official “Boycott” was the 24 hour period of April 1, 1933, and only then at least nationwide).</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: That is what I did not understand.</span> <span id="s388">It was a recurring incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: That is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Were you or your family harassed in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No.</span> <span id="s392">One time my oldest brother was on a train, while traveling in Germany.</span> <span id="s393">And some Nazis approached and said: “You are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s394">So he opened his jacket, pointed to his chest and said: “This is what I fought for Germany for!”</span> <span id="s395">and they let him go.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Did you have to have any particular kind of identification at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Did you have to register in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: OK, let’s move on to 1933, to the point where your friends, and family suggested that there really was no reason for you to continue living in Germany.</span> <span id="s401">You were single at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: In business, at that time, what had happened to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: I just couldn’t continue.</span> <span id="s405">Even the factory, where my brother worked, eventually had to be taken over by the Nazis (that, however did not occur right away in 1933 -- these anti-Jewish decrees became progressively harsher until they were total in 1938).</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: How did that work?</span> <span id="s407">Was an order sent down or were troops moved in?</span> <span id="s408">How was that bought about?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I was out of the country.</span> <span id="s410">My oldest brother came to this country in 1937 and my middle brother come in 1939.</span> <span id="s411">The factory was gone.</span> <span id="s412">Both came here with their families and had to start all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: But your middle brother, the one with the factory, the textile factory for which you worked.</span> <span id="s414">Was his factory closed down in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s416">I wouldn’t say which year.</span> <span id="s417">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s418">(Regulations were doled out by the Nazis which forced the Jews out of businesses.</span> <span id="s419">The businesses were targeted by size because Germany was still recovering from the depression.</span> <span id="s420">First sales were encouraged, including stock sales, but in 1937 and 1938 they became mandatory with sales occurring at prices selected by the authorities.</span> <span id="s421">The moneys which were paid out went into escrow accounts where they were first frozen, then confiscated.</span> <span id="s422">After WWII these forced sales were declared fraudulent and restitutions were negotiated).</span> <span id="s423">My brother Harry stayed as long as he could.</span> <span id="s424">His father-in-law, with whom he was associated, stayed even longer in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: But there were problems, obvious problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Can you explain a little more how these problems manifested themselves.</span> <span id="s428">Were orders given that Germans (again meaning non-Jewish Germans) were not allowed to but?</span> <span id="s429">Did troops come to the textile factory and order them not to buy?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I am sorry.</span> <span id="s431">I was out of the country.</span> <span id="s432">I left Germany on the 25th of April 1933 for Paris, France and that was all I know.</span> <span id="s433">There was not much communication.</span> <span id="s434">Furthermore my oldest brother who was still in Ludwigshafen after 1933, came sometimes to France and we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: I am sorry.</span> <span id="s436">I misunderstood.</span> <span id="s437">I thought that your brother’s textile factory was having problems before you left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s439">No!</span> <span id="s440">Not at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: OK, so it was suggested that you were to leave.</span> <span id="s442">How did your mother feel about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: My mother was very sick at that time and in a sanitarium.</span> <span id="s444">If she had known that I go to the U.S., she would probably have died right away, because she had a very bad impression of this country although she was never here.</span> <span id="s445">She had the feeling that people would take advantage of me; that if anybody would cry on the boat I would give them my last shirt.</span> <span id="s446">My uncle, who was her brother, received me at the dock and invited me for dinner and the next day, put me out on the street and told me “Look for your own business!”</span> <span id="s447">This was his attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So you went without her knowledge?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: That is right!</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: How did you leave the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: You were able to get papers without any problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: I got a paper, a visa from the French government to go to France, on my German passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: May I ask how many languages you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: At that time I spoke French and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Fluently?</span> <span id="s457">Fluently French?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Not fluently, but I had some inkling from school.</span> <span id="s459">When you have to, you learn fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: OK, you left your two brothers behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And went alone to France.</span> <span id="s463">Was someone going to meet you in France or were you totally on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Completely on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: How were your funds then?</span> <span id="s466">(Foreigners were not allowed to be gainfully employed in France without special permission).</span> <span id="s467">Were you able to take care of yourself financially?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No, I wouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s469">As a matter of fact I went to a Committee for the Refugees in Strasbourg (located just across the Rhine river from Germany) to which town I came first.</span> <span id="s470">They gave me a train ticket to Paris.</span> <span id="s471">Once in Paris I went to the Committee also.</span> <span id="s472">They put me up in a hotel and saw to it that I got to eat.</span> <span id="s473">Eventually I think that I got some money from my brother, from my oldest brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Your brothers were still able to work in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Were your brothers, at that time thinking also of immigrating from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Definitely!</span> <span id="s478">Definitely!</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Were there problems in them getting out of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s481">There were limitations.</span> <span id="s482">However my middle brother, especially, was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s483">The normal thing was that you could only take one spoon, one fork, and one knife with you as far as sterling silver is concerned.</span> <span id="s484">You could take no fur coats, no luxury like that.</span> <span id="s485">Still my brother, as a businessman was well known to the tax people and even to the guys who worked for the Gestapo (Geheime Staats Polizei or Secret State Police) and for the Nazis.</span> <span id="s486">Through his connections he was allowed to take more out than normal.</span> <span id="s487">When it came to his collection of stamps they said: “Stop!</span> <span id="s488">We have given you enough now!</span> <span id="s489">If you send us two hundred Swiss Franks and you give us the address of the man where you will be, we will let him take the stamps to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s490">My aunt was in Switzerland, that was my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s491">However, in general, they were very generous and helpful to him (in allowing him to take his private possessions with him).</span> <span id="s492">That was not the case in every city but it was in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: During these early years, you say that you had left the country at one point and your brother had worked in Spain, was that much of a problem with leaving the country and returning?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No!</span> <span id="s495">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You could travel without any difficulties?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: That (my brother working in Spain) was long before Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: However, your brother, during the 30th, between 1933 and he left in 1937 as you said, was able to come and go as he wanted (his brother came to France where he saw EH) into and out of the country?</span> <span id="s499">Or did he face restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: No!</span> <span id="s501">No.</span> <span id="s502">He went via Amsterdam and then by boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: But on business he was not allowed to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: No!</span> <span id="s505">No.</span> <span id="s506">(Actually it was possible to have valid passports and you could secure visas on this passport if you had a valid reason for a trip).</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: You kept up apparently with your family in Germany.</span> <span id="s508">You corresponded with them while you were out of the country.</span> <span id="s509">Did they tell you or keep you up-to-date on the condition about how the country was changing under Hitler’s influence, shall we say from 1933 through 1939?</span> <span id="s510">Were you aware of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s512">I listened to the radio.</span> <span id="s513">I mean that I was not completely cut off.</span> <span id="s514">I could understand the French radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: But I mean first hand information, with or through your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Oh, when my brother came for a visit he brought me up-to-date.</span> <span id="s517">He visited me several times.</span> <span id="s518">Even my mother visited me.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: So they were allowed to travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yes, my mother went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s521">Then she came over to see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: She did find out that you had left the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes, but she never knew that I went to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: That was the big thing then?</span> <span id="s525">Apparently she just didn’t want you to come to the U.S.</span> <span id="s526">You could go to France but not to the U.S.?</span> <span id="s527">In Switzerland, why was it that you picked France over Switzerland at the time?</span> <span id="s528">Particularly since you had relatives in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: In order to enter Switzerland you had to have money.</span> <span id="s530">You had to show that you had to have enough money to live.</span> <span id="s531">The Swiss were very strict about whom they let in.</span> <span id="s532">My aunt fortunately, through her husband, had the Swiss citizenship.</span> <span id="s533">She could go with her daughter into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s534">Then the daughter went to Israel (Palestine at that time).</span> <span id="s535">That was very interesting.</span> <span id="s536">She got sick with an ear inflammation and the doctors in Israel couldn’t treat her.</span> <span id="s537">She was allowed by Hitler to come back to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s538">She was in the Catholic hospital there.</span> <span id="s539">The nuns were praying at her bed.</span> <span id="s540">They cured her.</span> <span id="s541">Then she could go back to Switzerland again.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Here a section of the tape is missing and in spite of going back to the archives, this could not be reconstructed and since Mr. Heilbronner is no longer alive, this cannot be undone.</span> <span id="s543">The transcriber is sorry about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Note of May 1990.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: I got disturbed the next night and was given food.</span> <span id="s546">The lady who worked on me was an old, old lady.</span> <span id="s547">So, when I came out a fellow said to me: “Do you know who that lady was?”</span> <span id="s548">I said: “How should I know?”</span> <span id="s549">She was the widow of Dreyfus (Capt. Alfred Dreyfus born 10-9-1859, died 12-7-1935 was falsely accused of spying in the French Army for Germany, he was arrested in 1894, sentenced to life in the French Penal Colony in Guiana, pardoned in September 1900 and restored to army honor on July 21, 1906.</span> <span id="s550">This was the cause celebre of anti-Semitism in France at the end of the 19th century.</span> <span id="s551">It was at the Dreyfus trial that Hertzl became a Zionist).</span> <span id="s552">Remember, Capt. Dreyfus who was discriminated against.</span> <span id="s553">She knew what discrimination was.</span> <span id="s554">She worked for that committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: That is very interesting.</span> <span id="s556">Now you were in Paris; you had no funds; you had no job.</span> <span id="s557">What were the conditions like in France, in Paris, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: You could not get employment (foreigners needed a special work permit in France if they were to work legally) as a foreigner.</span> <span id="s559">The so called “Carte de Travail” (working permit) was only given to foreigners who knew something which the French did not know, where you could be of special use to the French.</span> <span id="s560">However, there was no prohibition to start your own business, at any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: So you started your own business?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes, I tried it with different things.</span> <span id="s563">First I sold an item like Drano, then I sold the type of fan, like I explained to you.</span> <span id="s564">I sold wrapping paper and string.</span> <span id="s565">Finally, I sold printed material.</span> <span id="s566">However, I must say that all my customers in Paris were German Jewish people.</span> <span id="s567">The Frenchman is very conservative.</span> <span id="s568">Once you are in (meaning accepted as doing business with individuals) you are in for the eternity.</span> <span id="s569">They are not interested in your price, they are not asking if they can get it cheaper but they all said: “Oh, Mr. So and So has been coming for years and we will continue to take from him!”</span> <span id="s570">Everywhere, on Christmas, there is a big bottle of wine or of things coming in, as present.</span> <span id="s571">They were very, very conservative.</span> <span id="s572">They were polite but you couldn’t deal with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: One thing I wonder about is, was there, at the time an established immigrant community in Paris at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Do you remember where it was located in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I don’t think that it was an organization of German refugees.</span> <span id="s577">However, I know that two refugees, for example, started a restaurant which I frequented quite a bit.</span> <span id="s578">Others also went into business for themselves.</span> <span id="s579">I cannot remember that we had an organization as such in Paris.</span> <span id="s580">We had one in Chicago, but not in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: When you said that you sold these items, did you go house to house or apartment to apartment, that type of selling, or did you have your own little stand or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: For the fans, I had a stand; but for the other items, I had to go quasi from house to house or by recommendation or something of that kind.</span> <span id="s583">I must say that my brother, through my cousin got a friend in Paris, a Frenchman, who helped me quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did you make a decent living that way?</span> <span id="s585">Were you able to get along quite well?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I got along, yes.</span> <span id="s587">I never had to suffer financially in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: This German-Jewish community that you lived within, had it blossomed into a full -fledged alliance with other stores which just serviced each other?</span> <span id="s589">Did it blossom in that way so that it was quite economically isolated from the rest of the French country?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Do you mean in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Yes, in Paris.</span> <span id="s592">Were you able to just service yourselves as part of your own business which each started?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Yes, in fact one business, if I didn’t tell them a joke, I could not get an order.</span> <span id="s594">They knew that I get around in the bistros (small establishments in France where one stopped to drink, usually wine or liquor, and spend time chatting).</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: How did you get along?</span> <span id="s596">You said that the French business people were very conservative and loyal to his customers.</span> <span id="s597">How did you get along with the average French citizen?</span> <span id="s598">Were they concerned about this influx of refugees from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s600">They were very happy about it.</span> <span id="s601">France was a country, I imagine, which opened its door to everyone.</span> <span id="s602">Certainly, England took some, Sweden and Denmark took some, but France took the largest number of refugees from Germany, there is no doubt about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Did you have any feelings, at that time, about this, about the country, that it would not take any more refugees, like the U.S. would not increase its quotas?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: How could I feel about it!</span> <span id="s607">You could not go into the U.S. without having an affidavit (promise of support from a private citizen or citizens).</span> <span id="s608">You were not allowed to come in.</span> <span id="s609">In as much as I had a place to be, there was not much for me to get worried about.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: You felt fairly safe and secure in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: I had two uncles in the U.S., one in New York and one in Memphis, in fact my middle brother was in the concentration camp in Dachau (that is located just outside of Munich).</span> <span id="s612">When my uncle from Memphis sent an affidavit he was released from Dachau and could get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Let’s talk about that a little bit.</span> <span id="s614">When was he incarcerated?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: I believe it was in 1939.</span> <span id="s616">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s617">Maybe it was 1938.</span> <span id="s618">I was out of the country.</span> <span id="s619">I didn’t know from many members of the family who disappeared, I heard about it only later, much later.</span> <span id="s620">However, when you had an affidavit (he probably means visa since an affidavit was only for U.S. internal use, it was not an official permission to enter the U.S.) from any kind of a country to go, the U.S. was a neutral country at that time, they would let you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Can I ask you what happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: My mother?</span> <span id="s623">I believe that she committed suicide by cutting herself right here.</span> <span id="s624">She wanted to do it and she died in the sanitarium in Germany, in 1939.</span> <span id="s625">I was not allowed to come back for the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Did this have anything to do with persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: No!</span> <span id="s628">Not at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: It was a personal thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: My mother was in a way a very weak person.</span> <span id="s631">My father was dominant.</span> <span id="s632">I wouldn’t say tyrant but the master.</span> <span id="s633">Her whole family, including her sister and her brothers were on the kind of weak side.</span> <span id="s634">My mother was quite often sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Did she have tuberculosis?</span> <span id="s636">(This was probably asked due to the death in a sanitarium versus as hospital).</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: No!</span> <span id="s638">No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: You apparently don’t know what happened to your brother; when he was picked up in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s640">Was his family interned?</span> <span id="s641">Do you know anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Which brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: The younger brother who was in Dachau.</span> <span id="s644">Was his family all taken at one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s646">It was only him who was in Dachau, as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: His family was not taken at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: No!</span> <span id="s649">No.</span> <span id="s650">(In 1938 generally only the men were put into camps).</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Your older brother, was he in Stuttgart or in Heilbron?</span> <span id="s652">Frank, the oldest brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: He was already in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: He had left already?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: He immigrated in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s657">Let’s return to Paris.</span> <span id="s658">You are in Paris and you are making a living, you are doing OK.</span> <span id="s659">Tell me please when things started to change for you in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Things changed naturally when the war broke out, between Germany and France (that was September 30, 1939) in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: We had to report to the (“we” meant all the adult males 17 through 55, then extended to the age of 60, within the week, who either were Germans or had been Germans before they were stripped of their citizenship by the Nuremberg laws) stadium in Paris.</span> <span id="s663">The Stadium de Colomb, all the Germans and all the Austrians (Austria had been annexed to Germany in 1938).</span> <span id="s664">There was no money to be brought with you.</span> <span id="s665">You were to come with just the suit you had, that was all.</span> <span id="s666">I had to give up my hotel room.</span> <span id="s667">My luggage was still in the hotel.</span> <span id="s668">As a matter of fact, I had a nice stamp collection.</span> <span id="s669">The Nazis stole everything.</span> <span id="s670">We bedded down on the steps of the grandstand, on straw.</span> <span id="s671">Fully clothed for about ten days.</span> <span id="s672">We received poor food, but enough to keep you going.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Now the Germans, at this time, had invaded France but they had not gotten to Paris as yet.</span> <span id="s674">(Actually the invasion of France occurred on May 10, 1940, after the “Phony War”).</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: So everything which happened up to that point happened under the French government?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: What happened after these ten days?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: We got moved to different camps.</span> <span id="s680">As I told you earlier; in one camp we had to dig trenches, in another camp we had to make charcoal and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q; Do you recall the sequence at all of the camps you went to?</span> <span id="s682">So you know how long you were in each camp and where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Do you recall their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No!</span> <span id="s686">I know that one camp was in Cipra, another one was near Orleans.</span> <span id="s687">I don’t remember the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Now you were sent to these camps because you were German, not because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did you at any time feel discriminated against because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: No, because we were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s692">The entire group was Jewish.</span> <span id="s693">I was not the only one.</span> <span id="s694">The gentiles were all sent down to the Cote d’Azure (the area which includes Cannes and Nice on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea) Nice and Marseilles.</span> <span id="s695">They took them away because they thought that they were more dangerous.</span> <span id="s696">They put us in the middle of France, not them.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: So you were in the middle of France.</span> <span id="s698">The Germans were on the Eastern border and France was on your Western border and you were in between.</span> <span id="s699">(EH was in the center of France with French troops deployed North and East on the border with Germany).</span> <span id="s700">Can you describe some of the conditions within these camps?</span> <span id="s701">Can you estimate how many people were there?</span> <span id="s702">Were they segregated according to sex.</span> <span id="s703">(The question doesn’t make much sense but it was recorded as is).</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, they were all males, in the first place.</span> <span id="s705">In the second place the only segregation was between Austrians and Germans, that is in the camps.</span> <span id="s706">We couldn’t get along with each other.</span> <span id="s707">In the last camp, I remember that the canteen was run by Austrians.</span> <span id="s708">(Here a phone call interfered).</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Can you tell how large these camps were?</span> <span id="s710">In the first camp, anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: About 500 people!</span> <span id="s712">No, the first camp was smaller.</span> <span id="s713">In the first camp there were between 80 and 100 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: You had apparently French army troops in command?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: How were you treated by them?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Fair!</span> <span id="s718">In fact, in one of the camps when it came to New Year’s Eve, the commanding officer put a bottle of wine on every table.</span> <span id="s719">That was the first time I heard that some people were singing on New Year’s Eve (EH attempts to reproduce a melody).</span> <span id="s720">As a matter of fact, we had two musicians with us, they were Austrians, one played the violin and the other played the accordion.</span> <span id="s721">It was a very nice party.</span> <span id="s722">No, they treated us fairly.</span> <span id="s723">I can’t complain that I was mistreated.</span> <span id="s724">(Except of course for the absolute deprivation of liberty because war existed with a country from which the prisoners had been expelled, the only way to obtain one’s freedom was to join the French Foreign Legion; then no questions were asked).</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Do you recall what job you had in that particular camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Do you remember how long you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: At the time when you were interned in this camp were you aware of what had taken place in Germany, what was going on with camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s731">The only time was when there was an alarm of an air attack.</span> <span id="s732">That, however, never happened.</span> <span id="s733">The last time I was with the French, I had the feeling that things were not going so well and that the British needed some help.</span> <span id="s734">As a matter of fact those who wanted to go to the British could go.</span> <span id="s735">Those who volunteered went by train through the valley of the Loire (the river which flows through Orleans).</span> <span id="s736">They finally found the British outfit.</span> <span id="s737">Although I have a paralyzed leg I marched as well as I could, because I know that the French are finished.</span> <span id="s738">I had that feeling.</span> <span id="s739">So we marched into that British camp.</span> <span id="s740">We had to get rid of our clothes and received some corduroy suits.</span> <span id="s741">Then we were shipped to another camp where we had to lay rails.</span> <span id="s742">Finally the British disappeared and we were left alone (that must have been in May-June 1940 when the French-British forces were defeated in Belgium and isolated in Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s743">France itself collapsed and the German army occupied the Atlantic coastline up to Biarritz and the North of France including Paris up to the Swiss border).</span> <span id="s744">We were about three thousand men.</span> <span id="s745">Everyone went south as well as he could.</span> <span id="s746">There was no transportation.</span> <span id="s747">As I pointed out to you (obviously out of range of the recorder) I got into an old Citroen car with two heavyset people, a man and his wife.</span> <span id="s748">The car was packed in the rear with their things, linen and such.</span> <span id="s749">They took me from one place to another because I told them that if “Hitler gets me he will cut my throat!”</span> <span id="s750">In one place where they brought me I found some of the other Germans who came from another company.</span> <span id="s751">That whole thing happened so long ago that it’s hard for me to remember everything.</span> <span id="s752">Who can remember everything which happened 42 years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s754">You have done extremely well with what you remembered, you really have.</span> <span id="s755">I have been prodding your mind a little with my questions and you have done very well.</span> <span id="s756">You mentioned that you hurt your leg.</span> <span id="s757">Can you tell me how that happened.</span> <span id="s758">You also had a paralyzed leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: That was from childhood on.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: How did it happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No one from the family really told me the truth.</span> <span id="s762">Somebody said that I fell from the table when I was a baby, and that from then on my foot was crooked as it is now.</span> <span id="s763">I do remember that I was at an orthopedic doctor who put a machine on me and that I was carried by the maid.</span> <span id="s764">It was what we call “Infantile Paralysis”, or “Polio.”</span> <span id="s765">I was then two or three years old, in 1908 or 1909.</span> <span id="s766">However, fortunately there were good shoemakers in Germany so I wore shoes which were all made by hand, including my supports and everything.</span> <span id="s767">I am getting along fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Were you not bothered by this affliction until you had to lay the rails?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: I really wasn’t afflicted so badly, but I just didn’t have the strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: You were about 25 or 26 at that time (EH was 34 on April 9, 1940).</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: When you were with the British you said that you marched into the British camp and were suited up into corduroy, do you recall how long you were with the British forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Maybe two or three months at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Was this an actual camp.</span> <span id="s775">Or was it a British club guard or something like that?</span> <span id="s776">Were they fighting forces, or were they others?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No, no, no!</span> <span id="s778">That was not a fighting force.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Was it a British camp for refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: It was a camp established for the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes, in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Can you compare the way you were treated by the French to the way you were treated by the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: I saw no big difference.</span> <span id="s785">I mean neither one was what you could call polite, however, they were fair.</span> <span id="s786">I would put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Now, were they treating you like Germans, or were they sympathetic to your cause because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: They knew naturally who we were, there was no doubt about that.</span> <span id="s789">They used us to work, as a work force.</span> <span id="s790">They didn’t say: “Come to us and we will hide you!”</span> <span id="s791">Or something like that.</span> <span id="s792">They had a purpose, that is why they took us.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Then, when things got bad, they pulled out?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: They pulled out!</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Do you recall how they told you that this was going to happen?</span> <span id="s796">Did they just up and leave?</span> <span id="s797">Were you given any warning, at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: In the morning the captain said: “Well, good-bye!</span> <span id="s799">The French will be here at 11 o’clock!</span> <span id="s800">They will take care of you for us.</span> <span id="s801">Good-bye and I hope to see you.”</span> <span id="s802">I wish that I would never see that guy anymore.</span> <span id="s803">The French never showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Was that a barbed wire enclosure?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: You were free to have left at any time, even otherwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Where would we go?</span> <span id="s808">We were dressed in a certain way.</span> <span id="s809">Not everybody spoke fluently French.</span> <span id="s810">We had no reason to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: You don’t think that you could have one better elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: OK, the British have left, the French did not come, now what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: As I pointed out to you; we had to walk, and walk, and walk.</span> <span id="s815">I threw my passport away.</span> <span id="s816">I threw everything which I had on me except my suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Now, why did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Because it was too burdensome, when you had to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: I mean your passport, why was it a special burden, why was it significant that you would throw that particular item away?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: I just didn’t want to be known anymore as a German.</span> <span id="s821">You see, it was a German passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: If you could have changed your clothes, would you have tried to blend in with the French?</span> <span id="s823">Were you concerned that much, that you wanted to escape your identity, your previous identity and blend in with the French citizenry?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: One time, in Paris, I went to the Police Commissioner and asked about naturalization.</span> <span id="s825">He wanted five thousand francs under the table.</span> <span id="s826">I am glad that I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s827">Everything in France, when you wanted to go to sell, the first thing was?</span> <span id="s828">“How much is in it for me?”</span> <span id="s829">That is why you couldn’t do any business in France.</span> <span id="s830">When you, as an American, came to Paris: Oh yes, they have an interpreter who speaks perfect English!</span> <span id="s831">But you paid more because the commission for the guy who got you the interpreter was included in the price.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: You moved down toward the South.</span> <span id="s833">You left the area and started marching.</span> <span id="s834">Did you stay as a group or did everyone just take off on his own?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Everybody took off on his own!</span> <span id="s836">That is right!</span> <span id="s837">First I went with a few, but they marched all much faster so I was left behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: At any time during this whole adventure in France, were you able to form any kind of friendships at all, or were you totally isolated as an individual?</span> <span id="s839">Did you meet anyone you wanted to stay with if you could have?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: We were in camps.</span> <span id="s841">Naturally you started friendships with many people, however, you lost contact immediately after separation.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: While you were in these camps, were you able to have any recreation of any kind?</span> <span id="s843">Were you able to play cards, or anything of the kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s845">In Orleans, we were once taken to the Jewish service by the guard.</span> <span id="s846">(The war in 1939 broke out just prior to the Jewish Holy Days).</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Do you remember what that corduroy suit looked like?</span> <span id="s848">Was this something which you will never forget?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s850">Corduroy is corduroy.</span> <span id="s851">It was usually a grey-greenish suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: You mean khaki colored corduroy?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: I have a coat right here.</span> <span id="s854">It is the same color corduroy even if it is not from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Did it look like a prisoner’s uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No, not at all!</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: It was a suit of some type?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yes it was a suit.</span> <span id="s859">It didn’t have any vest, but otherwise it was a suit, it had a jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: You didn’t stick out as a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Oh yes!</span> <span id="s862">In the streets oh yes!</span> <span id="s863">If I had wanted to escape, someone would have asked me what kind of clothes I had on.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: OK!</span> <span id="s865">You have left this camp.</span> <span id="s866">You have walked and walked.</span> <span id="s867">Where were you heading?</span> <span id="s868">Or did you know where you were heading?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: I was heading south, period!</span> <span id="s870">(The Germans were marching into France from the North, i.e., from Belgium in late May and in June 1940 so South, towards Spain, seemed the way to go.</span> <span id="s871">Rumors had it that the French would form a defensive line at the Somme river, then at the Seine in Paris, then at the Loire in Orleans, then anywhere north of Bordeaux, where it surrendered after debating whether to go to North Africa).</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Anywhere South?</span> <span id="s873">Now the country was divided at that time wasn’t it, between the Vichy government sector and the German controlled section?</span> <span id="s874">The Southern or free area did exist?</span> <span id="s875">(That only occurred after the French surrender on June 22, 1940.</span> <span id="s876">EH is not sure about dates).</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yes, yes!</span> <span id="s878">You mean the “Occupied Zone” and the “Unoccupied Zone.”</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Right!</span> <span id="s880">Were you aware that that was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: I was aware of that.</span> <span id="s882">I was definitely in the “Unoccupied Zone.”</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Where did you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: I ended up in Marseilles.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: How long did this journey we will call it, take from the time when you have left Paris, were interned by the French and later the British, then set loose and got to Marseilles, how many months had passed?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Let me think back about that.</span> <span id="s887">After I left the British, I would say about two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Were you ever close to the actual fighting?</span> <span id="s889">(There was no organized fighting in 1940.</span> <span id="s890">South of the Somme River other than some scattered air raids).</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: No!</span> <span id="s892">Never!</span> <span id="s893">Never.</span> <span id="s894">Before we left that British camp we heard bombs fall.</span> <span id="s895">We heard them!</span> <span id="s896">I found out that they had bombed an ammunition train in the city of Rennes, which was about fifty or one hundred miles away (that must be an error since no bombing can be heard at that kind of distance).</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Apparently you had nothing, no money, no finances of any way!</span> <span id="s898">How did you get the food with which you lived on while you traveled?</span> <span id="s899">What did you resort to to keep alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: You mean traveling to Marseilles?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: I don’t remember anything anymore.</span> <span id="s903">(There were enough refugees of all kinds wandering about that soup kitchens were organized and that dormitories were set up in otherwise closed school buildings by government units, if they were functioning, or by volunteer groups including Church and Jewish groups!</span> <span id="s904">No questions were asked by anyone of anyone since knowing too much might be dangerous).</span> <span id="s905">I know one thing, that is when I was in Toulouse at the railroad station, they gave me a loaf of bread and a can of corned beef.</span> <span id="s906">When I came to Marseilles to the Jewish refugee home I got food.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: The date is April 28, 1981, Tuesday morning.</span> <span id="s908">I am continuing my interview with Mr. Ernest Heilbronner.</span> <span id="s909">When we last left we were talking about your leaving the internment camp and heading towards Marseilles.</span> <span id="s910">When you arrived in Marseilles, what did you do?</span> <span id="s911">What was your initial act?</span> <span id="s912">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Before leaving Toulouse, I met a German refugee whose wife was in Marseilles at a refugee home.</span> <span id="s914">I continued my trip to Marseilles with him.</span> <span id="s915">I went in that home where I was welcomed.</span> <span id="s916">I don’t know if I told you that I met a man who did some bookbinding for me, when I was in Paris.</span> <span id="s917">He was an Armenian.</span> <span id="s918">When I told him that I had nothing on me except the suit which I was wearing, he took me to different Armenian businessmen in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s919">These businessmen provided me with shoes and socks and whatever.</span> <span id="s920">After a while, I was able to communicate with my brother in the United States.</span> <span id="s921">Because I was in the “Unoccupied Zone” of France he was able to see to it through a relative of my uncle’s in the United States, who lived in Cannes that she sent me money.</span> <span id="s922">I stayed in Marseilles in a hotel.</span> <span id="s923">Wait a minute, I think that I moved from this refugee home to another refugee home.</span> <span id="s924">This second refugee home was kind of a spiritualistic society.</span> <span id="s925">We, there, had people from Spain (many “Republicans” had escaped from Spain during the Civil war and had taken refuge in France, particularly after Generalissimo Franco and his Falangists triumphed in Spain in 1939) and refugees from all over.</span> <span id="s926">We had two Austrian musicians with us who entertained us.</span> <span id="s927">We got very good food.</span> <span id="s928">(During 1940-1941 food, in France, became more and more scarce.</span> <span id="s929">Everyone had rationing cards and you could not always purchase, on the legal market, whatever you were entitled to on your rationing cards, so food was very important).</span> <span id="s930">It so happened that I met some German people who had been very good to me in Paris, but they didn’t have much to eat in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s931">So I saw to it that the mother came to peel potatoes at the refugee home, and took food home for herself, her husband and her daughter.</span> <span id="s932">I think that then I moved to a hotel where I had to cook by myself.</span> <span id="s933">I had to stand in line to purchase one egg, for things to cook with, in short, I had to stand in line for everything.</span> <span id="s934">Then I contacted yellow jaundice by eating liver sausage which was infected because the French really had nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s935">I spent about 40 days in a hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: I would like to ask you about this German family which was very good to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Family Strauss, was their name.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: They were German, they were not German-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: They were German-Jewish, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q; They were a German-Jewish family, refugees also?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s942">As a matter of fact the daughter is now living in Oklahoma, near Tulsa.</span> <span id="s943">She is working for a big oil company, Philips 66.</span> <span id="s944">She is translating for them.</span> <span id="s945">She is a very capable girl.</span> <span id="s946">She is a college graduate from the University of Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s947">She speaks fluently Spanish, French and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Is this the only family whom you kept in touch with whom you met during your flight from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: In Paris, naturally, I met many people.</span> <span id="s950">I don’t know what happened to them!</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q; Were you aware, during all this time when you were moving about, in France, of the actions of the Vichy government (that would be the government led by Marshal Petain which was set up after the surrender to Germany) toward the French Jews and of their lack of help toward the foreign Jews (that government did not pass any anti-Jewish laws until after the British-United States Allies occupied North Africa in November 1942).</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No, I was not aware of this.</span> <span id="s953">As a matter of fact Marshal Petain, the fellow who had quasi-sold out to the Germans, came to Marseilles on a visit and I saw him there.</span> <span id="s954">You know that he was condemned afterwards to an island (on August 14, 1945, Petain was found guilty of intelligence with the enemy and sentenced to death.</span> <span id="s955">This was commuted to exile and he died July 23, 1951).</span> <span id="s956">He died on that island.</span> <span id="s957">He had been the victor of the battle of Verdun of the French over the Germans in World War I.</span> <span id="s958">He died a dishonored man’s death.</span> <span id="s959">He had been completely forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Did you happen to hear his speech in Marseilles?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: No.</span> <span id="s962">I just saw him driving through town.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: When we left you, you were in the hospital, for about 40 days.</span> <span id="s964">Can you tell us what happened after that?</span> <span id="s965">You were getting money from a relative in Cannes, or via a relative in Cannes.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s967">That was the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: At least, initially?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s970">In fact that was the case all the time, to keep going.</span> <span id="s971">You see I didn’t do any business there.</span> <span id="s972">I had to support myself.</span> <span id="s973">I did it with money coming from Cannes.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Then you were discharged from the hospital.</span> <span id="s975">Did you then go back to the hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: What was your next move, or what was the next move which was taken on your behalf to get you out of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: In the first place I got in contact with a United States ship company, however, as you know, nothing (no United States ships) came to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s979">The closest they came was Lisbon, Portugal.</span> <span id="s980">My brother said: “If you can go to Portugal, we send you the money so that you can stay there until you can get a boat.’</span> <span id="s981">However there was just no chance.</span> <span id="s982">You just couldn’t get a Spanish visa, if you didn’t have a Portuguese visa.</span> <span id="s983">You couldn’t get a Portuguese visa if you couldn’t tell with which boat and on which day you would leave.</span> <span id="s984">So, I had to contact another German refugee who said he is aware that there is a transport coming from Gurs.</span> <span id="s985">(That was a camp in Southeastern France, not far from Pau, where the French had interned all German women after May 1940 and to which the Germans had deported German Jews from Baden and other places.</span> <span id="s986">From the camp of Gurs, people were given the possibility to pursue their immigration process with permission to repeatedly travel to Marseilles where the consulates including the United States Consulate were located.</span> <span id="s987">If a United States visa was obtained, the United States provided a travel paper for a one way trip to the United States to take the place of German or Austrian passports which could no longer be obtained by Jews).</span> <span id="s988">The transport was made up of 600 people who are supposed to leave with the next boat which is called either the SS Winnipeg or the SS Martinique.</span> <span id="s989">I am not sure which (it was the SS Winnipeg on which transcriber also traveled and the destination was Fort de France, Martinique).</span> <span id="s990">He said that he could get a berth on it.</span> <span id="s991">By putting some money under the table (i.e., bribery) he was able to place me on that boat.</span> <span id="s992">Now, in order to get out of Marseilles, a distant relative, who was a French citizen, loaned me the money to buy a ticket to New York, by any route I could go.</span> <span id="s993">I left Marseilles on May 6, 1941, with about 600 people aboard (actually there were about 200 people in addition to those of the transport from Gurs).</span> <span id="s994">It was really not a passenger boat but a freighter (with, normally room for somewhat over 100 passengers for leisurely cruises around the Pacific Ocean) which had cabins for people who could afford it.</span> <span id="s995">The rest of the people were all accommodated in the holds on bunks.</span> <span id="s996">Before I could leave I had to get permission from the commander of the port.</span> <span id="s997">The Nazis checked everything (there were effectively a couple of German and a couple of Italian officers aboard the ship who checked the transportation papers with the photographs against the people coming on board).</span> <span id="s998">Even when I was aboard the boat, there were Italian and Nazi officers lined up at dockside.</span> <span id="s999">Although Marseilles was not in the “Occupied Zone.”</span> <span id="s1000">There was an armistice commission of the armistice between France and Germany and Italy there.</span> <span id="s1001">When we finally left, when we were half way out, we had to return back, because the engine of the accompanying torpedo boat did not work.</span> <span id="s1002">We thought, now we will be lost.</span> <span id="s1003">The plan was to take us to Morocco, they wanted to make a railroad through the Sahara and we should have worked on that one, but the Germany were much faster.</span> <span id="s1004">We went on to Casablanca.</span> <span id="s1005">From there we passed Gibraltar.</span> <span id="s1006">On June 9, 1941 I arrived in Miami.</span> <span id="s1007">(Actually the SS Winnipeg left Marseilles alone on its own power but by a rather circuitous course, while within the harbor.</span> <span id="s1008">Then it hugged the coast of France and Spain and made an overnight dash to the Mers el Kebir, the port of the City of Oran.</span> <span id="s1009">It was from there that the SS Winnipeg made two departures due to an Italian-British battle at sea, so the story was told, before stopping in Casablanca where its holds were filled with cork for the French West Indies.</span> <span id="s1010">From Casablanca the SS Winnipeg joined a troop transport convoy for the Far East until close to Dakar then crossed the Atlantic by itself with lights doused at night.</span> <span id="s1011">The SS Winnipeg was captured by a Dutch cruiser working for the British and escorted into the bay of Port of Spain, Trinidad.</span> <span id="s1012">In Trinidad it was the British’s turn to examine the papers of the passengers.</span> <span id="s1013">In Trinidad also the SS Winnipeg was declared as joining the commercial navy of the Free French who obeyed General De Gaulle).</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Can I ask you what you did about identification papers since you told us that you had thrown your passport away/</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: I got, what you may call, a “Nentin” passport.</span> <span id="s1016">These passports were issued to people without a country.</span> <span id="s1017">As a matter of fact, I have it here.</span> <span id="s1018">I was not aware that my brother had had an affidavit waiting for me at the American Embassy in Paris.</span> <span id="s1019">I was aware, after I finally got the passage, that he had deposited $150.00 for my immigration to the United States in Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: If you had gotten this money and the affidavit from your brother, would that have given you a different type of status?</span> <span id="s1021">I mean by that, the status which you had as a man without a country, so to speak, were you treated differently because you had that status than you would have been, if you had a proper affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No.</span> <span id="s1023">(An affidavit of support is an affidavit and stands on its own.</span> <span id="s1024">Either it is acceptable or it isn’t and it is the visa which must be granted).</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: It didn’t make any difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: It would only have made one difference.</span> <span id="s1027">That is that I went continuously to the American Consulate in Marseilles for other people.</span> <span id="s1028">I got threatened that I would not obtain my visa if I continued to come because he thought that I get money for that work, which I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: You mentioned, on the first tape, that you were going to the American Embassy (she does mean Consulate, since EH was not leaving Marseilles where there were no embassies) to get apparently passports or affidavits, that sort of thing, for other people who were in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: That is right, in Gurs!</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: At that time there was no connection apparently between the American Consulate in Marseilles and the American embassy in Paris which would have gotten you your papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1033">I was not aware that my brother had deposited an affidavit.</span> <span id="s1034">He didn’t want to influence me to come to the United States where maybe it wouldn’t have worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Did you actually make the decision to come to the United States, or did you just decide to leave France?</span> <span id="s1036">In other words, if you had had a choice to come to the United States or to Israel, or to South America, any place.</span> <span id="s1037">Would you have chosen otherwise, or were you just anxious to get out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: In the first place I was anxious to get out of the country, in the second place I was anxious to meet my family again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Where were your brothers living in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: My oldest brother was living in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1041">My middle brother was living in Perry in the State of New York (about 45 miles east of Buffalo).</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Now you apparently had no trouble, once you were able to leave on the freighter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: You said that you returned to port and that you were able to leave again when the escort ship was fixed.</span> <span id="s1045">You had no trouble in the crossing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: You went directly to Miami?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: No!</span> <span id="s1049">No, no.</span> <span id="s1050">We were supposed to go to Martinique but our boat was captured by the British.</span> <span id="s1051">They took us to Port-of-Spain, Trinidad.</span> <span id="s1052">We were interned there (officially the British did not “intern” the passengers of the SS Winnipeg, but just “Examined their papers.”</span> <span id="s1053">That was good since people whom the British interned in 1941 were denied entrance to the United States, as a matter of course), because we were still considered Germans.</span> <span id="s1054">My brother was able to send me an airplane ticket from Trinidad to Miami.</span> <span id="s1055">So, naturally, I was released by the British.</span> <span id="s1056">The British arrested us purely out of security reasons.</span> <span id="s1057">Eventually all the people who were on board came to the United States through the help of Jewish Refugee organizations.</span> <span id="s1058">(That was not so since several dozen passengers were French men returning to the French West Indies.</span> <span id="s1059">Some were landowners, other military and dependents of military, etc., there also was, of course the French crew, many of whom “opted” to joining the De Gaulle led Free French) by boat.</span> <span id="s1060">I had the privilege to fly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: You said Jewish Refugee Organization.</span> <span id="s1062">Was that the JOINT Distribution Committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Yes, it was the JOINT.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: You arrived in Miami, do you remember the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I arrived in the United States on June 9, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: In Miami?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: What happened next?</span> <span id="s1069">Did you go directly to New York or Chicago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: To Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: You were reunited with your brother then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Yes, my oldest brother.</span> <span id="s1073">I stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s1074">He got me a job with Sears Roebuck as a packer.</span> <span id="s1075">Because I didn’t know the English language so well it was probably the only possibility.</span> <span id="s1076">Everybody at Sears naturally tried to speak German.</span> <span id="s1077">It seemed ridiculous to me.</span> <span id="s1078">I got fired from that job.</span> <span id="s1079">Then he got me a job in a punchboard company where I was a shipping clerk.</span> <span id="s1080">When the war broke out (that is after Pearl Harbor when the United States got involved,) I reported for induction although I was much too old.</span> <span id="s1081">I got special permission from the Governor of Illinois, to enlist because I was not a United States citizen.</span> <span id="s1082">(Some confusion exists since no State Governor could give a permission involving the Federal enlistment procedure).</span> <span id="s1083">I was drafted into the limited service and assigned to the Military Police.</span> <span id="s1084">(The regular draft, rather than an enlistment, was the only way a non-United States citizen could get into the armed forces and then only into the army.</span> <span id="s1085">Limited service assignments were made available to people who had less than the required physical qualifications).</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Was that in the United States Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1088">In the army.</span> <span id="s1089">I was shipped out to camp Grant, near Rockford, Illinois.</span> <span id="s1090">From there we were moved out to California, near San Luis Obispo.</span> <span id="s1091">We received our basic training.</span> <span id="s1092">Later we moved closer to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1093">In Los Angeles, I contacted some German families.</span> <span id="s1094">There I was invited, but only when I had leave from the army.</span> <span id="s1095">After I got sick with an inflammation of my throat I was put in a hospital in Santa Monica.</span> <span id="s1096">I was discharged from there.</span> <span id="s1097">I must say that while I was in the army I was able to get my American Citizenship, because I was engaged to an American girl (EH was eligible for citizenship after serving three months on active duty.</span> <span id="s1098">Engagements did not influence citizenship requirements, only marriages did).</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">QL: Can I ask you a personal question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Go ahead!</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: When you tried to enlist originally, was it your intent to return to Europe to fight the Germans directly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1103">My brother who had made out the affidavit and had to take care of his wife and two daughters also said: “As long as I am responsible for you, and you don’t have the United States citizenship I don’t want you to get married, I don’t want you to get tied down, because I cannot support everybody in this world!”</span> <span id="s1104">So he, indirectly forced me into that.</span> <span id="s1105">It was better both ways, that I enlisted as you can see (actually EH was drafted) and that I got my citizenship in Los Angeles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: How old were you when you arrived here and enlisted?</span> <span id="s1107">You said that you were too old for the draft, were you about 28 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Oh, I was much older than that!</span> <span id="s1109">Let me see.</span> <span id="s1110">The war broke out when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: December 8, 1941, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: I was 36 years old.</span> <span id="s1113">That was unusual to be drafted at that age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: How long were you in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Seven months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: So you were able to get your citizenship quite rapidly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: In Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: You met her before you joined the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1122">She never believed that the army would take me because of my partially paralyzed legs.</span> <span id="s1123">That is why I was put in the “Limited Service!”</span> <span id="s1124">I still think today that if the army had been smart it would have taken advantage of my knowledge of Germany to put me in charge of German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1125">However it didn’t work out that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Do you suppose that they may have been concerned of retaliation on your part with revenge from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Yes, probably!</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: You were discharged in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s1129">Were you married at the time or shortly thereafter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Shortly thereafter.</span> <span id="s1131">My wife did not want me to stay in California.</span> <span id="s1132">She said: “If you are going to stay in California, forget about me.”</span> <span id="s1133">She said that because she had a good position as a social worker in Chicago with the armament industry, I could have gotten a job immediately in California.</span> <span id="s1134">But she said that Chicago is a place where you can always get a job; you don’t depend on the movie industry.</span> <span id="s1135">So then I returned to Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: I think that we better establish your wife’s name here, before we go any further.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: My wife’s name was Miriam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: What was her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A; Hotkins (spelled by EH)</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Was your wife Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Was she an orthodox Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: She was brought up Orthodox, but she went with me to the Reformed Synagogue.</span> <span id="s1144">In general she was opposed to any kind of formal religion where you always stand up and sit down, repeatedly, and where you are directed to do this and to do that.</span> <span id="s1145">She was very interested in the downtrodden people.</span> <span id="s1146">Her background was her interest in the poor people.</span> <span id="s1147">She was not an outgoing person, she was an introvert.</span> <span id="s1148">She was not a joiner.</span> <span id="s1149">She had few friends, very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: You said that she was a professional social worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Whom did she work for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: She worked for Cook County, Illinois, that is Chicago.</span> <span id="s1154">Then when we moved to Waukegan, Illinois, she did some social work also, for a while, but not for very long because the conditions were so stringent that when, for example, some poor people had a garden, and they sold some cherries, that got deducted from their welfare.</span> <span id="s1155">That was a state law.</span> <span id="s1156">Then she worked for the recreation department as a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: You returned from Los Angeles to Chicago when you were married.</span> <span id="s1158">What was your first job after you had gotten discharged from the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: My first job was with Republic Steel, on the Southside of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1160">I had to count the kegs of nails, and bails of wire which were loaded into the railroad cars on the outside docks.</span> <span id="s1161">It was a very tough job because it was wintertime.</span> <span id="s1162">I still had my army coat and army boots, fortunately, however, every time I came home about one or two o’clock in the morning, my wife had a warm bath ready for me.</span> <span id="s1163">Then I could relax.</span> <span id="s1164">Then after I lost that job, I went into the civil service (as a war veteran EH received a five point bonus, or a ten point bonus if he was discharged for “Service-connected-disability,” which may well have been the case, in hiring and an absolute preference in retaining his job, by law) for the United States Navy in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1165">That was at the Navy pier.</span> <span id="s1166">I was a storekeeper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: How long did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: We moved eventually from Chicago to Great Lakes, Illinois because in Chicago, the navy had to pay rent and in great Lakes, Illinois which was 45 miles outside Chicago, that was federal property, so no rent.</span> <span id="s1169">I did the same job of being storekeeper.</span> <span id="s1170">However that commuting trip to Great Lakes was too strenuous on me.</span> <span id="s1171">For that commute I had to get up at 5 a.m., had two hours of travel each way, and the same back.</span> <span id="s1172">So, finally my wife decided in 1951 that it was time to get out of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1173">Then we moved to Waukegan, Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: What did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: I still worked for the navy (The Great Lake, Naval Station is just south of the city limits of Waukegan).</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: It was a transfer, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1178">(EH possibly kept his job and just moved from one apartment to another).</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Did you have a family by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: No, we had no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: For the rest of your career, since that time, did you stay with the service ,that is the navy, and retired as such?</span> <span id="s1182">Was it that kind of a job, or have you worked at other jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: No!</span> <span id="s1184">I worked here in Dayton also for the Defense Electronics Supply Center.</span> <span id="s1185">(The Great Lakes Naval Station became part of the Defense Supply Agency, then it was absorbed by the Defense Electronic supply center, called DESC, in Dayton.</span> <span id="s1186">Both functions and people were transferred to Kettering just south of Dayton).</span> <span id="s1187">After a while, I had the feeling that the job in great Lakes would eventually be “phased out.”</span> <span id="s1188">That actually happened.</span> <span id="s1189">I then worked here until 1973.</span> <span id="s1190">Then I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: When did you retire from DESC?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: In 1973.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: You moved to Dayton when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: In 1963.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Did your wife work in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1197">She was working in social work, for a while.</span> <span id="s1198">Then she learned how to transcribe Braille all by herself.</span> <span id="s1199">Then she worked as a volunteer for the school system.</span> <span id="s1200">She had machines here and she kept herself busy in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: You apparently are active in your church here in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: What church is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Temple Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Did you have a very active social life then, in the Jewish Community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: Here in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: No!</span> <span id="s1209">No!</span> <span id="s1210">Not at all!</span> <span id="s1211">When you are a widower, if you are single, and you are at an advanced age you are disregarded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: That surprises me, within the Jewish Community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Yes, in the Jewish Community!</span> <span id="s1214">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: You sound bitter about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Very bitter!</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Tell me about that.</span> <span id="s1218">Why is it this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Because people are self-centered, self-interested.</span> <span id="s1220">Hooray for me, the heck with you!</span> <span id="s1221">That is why.</span> <span id="s1222">I bet that there are 50 couples in that congregation where only man and wife eat together.</span> <span id="s1223">There is nobody else.</span> <span id="s1224">How much would it cost to put a third plate on the table and to call me and say: “Would you like to have a bite with us?”</span> <span id="s1225">or “Just have a talk with us.”</span> <span id="s1226">“Drop dead!”</span> <span id="s1227">(Spelled by EH to emphasize).</span> <span id="s1228">It is very, very bitter.</span> <span id="s1229">I remember that, when we came to Dayton, we had no children and we were older people.</span> <span id="s1230">I was 57 and my wife was 56.</span> <span id="s1231">We had a very nice social life in Chicago, but not in Waukegan.</span> <span id="s1232">In Waukegan you were considered nobody.</span> <span id="s1233">If you didn’t have much money.</span> <span id="s1234">I mean in the Jewish circles.</span> <span id="s1235">My wife taught Sunday school at the synagogue in Waukegan but that didn’t help us.</span> <span id="s1236">People here, in Dayton are snobs, there are clicks and as one man said: “You know couples go out with couples.</span> <span id="s1237">Period!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: That may be the case with all of the elderly, Christians or whatever the denomination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: I agree with you, that might be, yet I have a strong feeling that the churches here are much more interested in their individual members, specially when you are active in the church and you try to do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: You did stay active though?</span> <span id="s1241">You mentioned that you were the chairman of something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: I am the Vice President of the Temple Senior Congregants.</span> <span id="s1243">I was on the Board of the Men’s Club for twelve years, then I got fed up.</span> <span id="s1244">Because they know that I don’t drive, they wouldn’t even offer to take me to the meetings.</span> <span id="s1245">Nobody calls you!</span> <span id="s1246">It is bitter!</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: That is a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: It is not that I don’t have the money.</span> <span id="s1249">Wherever I am invited, regardless of where it is, I bring a gift.</span> <span id="s1250">I learned that from home.</span> <span id="s1251">Even though people say: “Oh, that was not necessary!”</span> <span id="s1252">Still nobody can say that I ate for nothing!</span> <span id="s1253">No!</span> <span id="s1254">Not me.</span> <span id="s1255">I am too proud for that.</span> <span id="s1256">Naturally, I cannot invite people here since I am not a cook.</span> <span id="s1257">Of course I could have coffee and doughnuts.</span> <span id="s1258">However, which couples want to come to a single man?</span> <span id="s1259">Who wants to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Have you tried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: I have tried.</span> <span id="s1262">They tell me: “We are too busy!”</span> <span id="s1263">“We are with the family!”</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Is that the way it is with all of the churches?</span> <span id="s1265">There are other Temples in the area aren’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: It seems to be that at Beth Abraham Synagogue, which is right across from temple Israel, the people are more friendly to each other.</span> <span id="s1267">That they are more interested in each other, but I don’t like their service.</span> <span id="s1268">Beth Abraham is Conservative Judaism.</span> <span id="s1269">I like a service with organ (EH was musically quite knowledgeable and for many years of his widowhood was a subscription member of the Dayton Philharmonic Wednesday series.</span> <span id="s1270">After he stopped driving, people with whom he had served on the Board of the Men’s Club, or who otherwise knew him from temple gave him rides on these Wednesdays.</span> <span id="s1271">EH was also a longtime member of the DESC Toastmaster’s Club.</span> <span id="s1272">This Club honored EH with special awards for longtime service including a presentation while EH was hospitalized at Good Samaritan Hospital, one of several times).</span> <span id="s1273">That (lack of an organ) reminds me too much of Waukegan, where we went to a conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s1274">Oh, I know many people who belong to the congregation; but here, at Temple Israel the people, they say: “Oh yes, how are you, how do you do?”</span> <span id="s1275">And that is just about all.</span> <span id="s1276">Three people have said: “Oh, we will invite you for dinner!”</span> <span id="s1277">.</span> <span id="s1278">I should live so long!</span> <span id="s1279">Maybe next year at Christmas.</span> <span id="s1280">This is what gets me; when somebody doesn’t want to do anything; don’t talk about it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Along the same line I would like to ask your opinion as to how you feel about the overall world view.</span> <span id="s1282">Did you feel that, let’s say, your God let you down, under the circumstances of the Jewish Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1283">How did you feel about your religion and about what happened to the Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: I was never brought up in a religious home.</span> <span id="s1285">What happened to the Jews made me stronger in my attachment to the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s1286">Although, considering how the people treat me here, I often was debating: “Why should I pay two hundred dollars a year to a Temple where the people are not friends with me?”</span> <span id="s1287">Yet I feel that in America it is customary that you belong to either a church or to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1288">(In Germany at the time EH lived there you automatically belonged, although you paid no dues to a church or synagogue.</span> <span id="s1289">During the Weimar republic you paid taxes to the state from which taxes the state paid the expenses of the religious institution in proportion to the people who claimed to belong to that institution).</span> <span id="s1290">If you don’t belong, you are not socially accepted.</span> <span id="s1291">However, I must say that I enjoy the services.</span> <span id="s1292">Our Rabbi is very, very busy.</span> <span id="s1293">(Incidentally, it is customary at Temple Israel, as well as most other religious institutions to waive dues obligation for anyone with an insufficient income providing he or she requests such a waiver).</span> <span id="s1294">He knows that I am alone, but he doesn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1295">The rabbi wrote an article in the paper with the headline “Open your gates!”</span> <span id="s1296">You might just as well have talked to the radio over there.</span> <span id="s1297">You would have gotten the same response as he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Have you ever considered, or have you ever visited Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: No, and I am not interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: I would say that I never was a Zionist (Movement of modern Jews to establish a homeland in Palestine; this was activated under the leadership of the Austrian journalist Herzl after witnessing the virulent anti-Semitism existing in Europe which was brought to daylight at the end of the nineteenth century during the trial of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus) although I am presently a member of the Zionist organization in memory of my wife.</span> <span id="s1302">She had been working for an ardent Zionist here, in Dayton, and he got her involved.</span> <span id="s1303">So now, I continue to pay my dues but I am not active in any way.</span> <span id="s1304">The goals of the Zionist Organization of America to establish the State of Israel has been accomplished, and I see no need that this organization continues.</span> <span id="s1305">I also know that, if you go to Israel, you have to walk, walk, walk quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1306">Physically I wouldn’t be able to do it.</span> <span id="s1307">Even when I was younger, I never had a desire to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Did you ever have the desire to return to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: For a visit, yes!</span> <span id="s1310">I was in Germany in 1974, but I don‘t think that I could live there anymore.</span> <span id="s1311">In my hometown synagogue there are no longer any hometown people born in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1312">They are all people from Poland.</span> <span id="s1313">People who had to flee from the East (even after the defeat of the Nazis there were anti-Jewish Pogroms against Jews returning from Russia and living in the underground) who have no attachment to any of the people who used to live there.</span> <span id="s1314">I have a gentile friend in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1315">He sends me articles about the city and things like that.</span> <span id="s1316">He also sends me stamps.</span> <span id="s1317">However I have no special desire to go there.</span> <span id="s1318">I have a desire to go to see the Scandinavian countries.</span> <span id="s1319">It is not easy, as you saw my nurse here.</span> <span id="s1320">I pay her and if I go on a vacation I still have to pay her.</span> <span id="s1321">That comes right out of my money also.</span> <span id="s1322">I probably could afford it, but when you go on a cruise, or whatever it is, you have to walk, walk, walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: I think that we are just about at the end of this interview.</span> <span id="s1324">There are a few questions however, I would like to ask, perhaps I should have asked them earlier, two of them actually.</span> <span id="s1325">In regards to your religion, were you Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Was that in Germany, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: And secondly, were you ever forced to wear the Star of David?</span> <span id="s1330">(Jews in Germany after 1938 had to wear this identifying mark of specific size on their outer garment under pain of immediate imprisonment.</span> <span id="s1331">This later became the law through all of German occupied Europe).</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: No, no, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: The yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: No!</span> <span id="s1335">I know what you are talking about.</span> <span id="s1336">No!</span> <span id="s1337">That was specially the case in Denmark (there as an act of peaceful defiance, after the German surprise invasion of April 1940, the King put on the star to attempt to protect the Danish Jews), where the Jews were forced to wear the Star of David.</span> <span id="s1338">In Germany, the Jews were hiding (that was possible only in Berlin and, even there, the exception rather than the rule), I don’t believe that they wore the Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: When the Germans came in and made them put on the yellow star, you were never forced to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No.</span> <span id="s1341">I was not.</span> <span id="s1342">(He had left Germany before that law went into effect, and had left France before the law was extended to that country).</span> <span id="s1343">I escaped early enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: I understand that they did that in France also, but you were apparently gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: That could have been the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Is there anything which you would like to add to this interview that I may have neglected to ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: No.</span> <span id="s1348">I can only say that I thank God that I was able to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1349">However, I am sure that I wouldn’t be any happier in Germany than I am here in spite of the fact that I am neglected by my co-religionists.</span> <span id="s1350">I have two families, Jewish families here, they call and invite me from time to time.</span> <span id="s1351">One family does that, the other one there, the husband comes to see me twice a week to see me, just to talk with me.</span> <span id="s1352">He is the most wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1353">On Wednesdays he goes to Covenant House (the name given to the Jewish Home for the Aged of Greater Dayton) that is a Jewish home, he talks to the people there.</span> <span id="s1354">He helps them as a volunteer in the recreation department.</span> <span id="s1355">Saturdays he does it again.</span> <span id="s1356">He is a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1357">(There were several other people whom EH got together with in order to exchange stamps.</span> <span id="s1358">EH had replaced the collection which he had in Paris prior to his internment and had gathered an appreciable collection which he endeavored to improve through exchanges and/or purchases).</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: I have enjoyed this interview enormously.</span> <span id="s1360">I want to thank you for it.</span> <span id="s1361">You have been very kind to give us your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Oh certainly.</span> <span id="s1363">I can always say that if out of this interview the American kids learn something, I will be happy.</span> <span id="s1364">I hope that the American people never have to go through what I had to go through.</span> <span id="s1365">I hope that people come to their senses, that people vote when they are supposed to vote and that they elect people of honesty and integrity.</span> <span id="s1366">People who are interested in the welfare of their constituents and not in the party.</span> <span id="s1367">That is the most important wish I have, and that they think before they vote, that they inquire; where are we going in this country.</span> <span id="s1368">Hopefully the morals in this country, change.</span> <span id="s1369">Hopefully you have more employment for people.</span> <span id="s1370">Hopefully racial disorders stop and racial discrimination stops.</span> <span id="s1371">I can’t hate anybody because of his color, religion or anything else.</span> <span id="s1372">Because I was persecuted, my faith is even stronger, my faith in mankind.</span> <span id="s1373">I am also careful with whom I associate.</span> <span id="s1374">I know that there are bad people amongst the black ones, there are bad people amongst the white ones.</span> <span id="s1375">There are bad people amongst the Christians and there are bad people amongst the Jews.</span> <span id="s1376">The effects are the same.</span> <span id="s1377">That the Jews are the Chosen people does not mean that they are any better than anyone else!</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Very good!</span> <span id="s1379">Well thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
