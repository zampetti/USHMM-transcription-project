Tell me a little bit about your boyhood in Lida, what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A. I grew up in a normal family.</span> <span id="s17">My -- I was the only child.</span> <span id="s18">My father was an engineer who owned, together with my mother's uncle, a foundry which used to make agricultural equipment like plows, which were horse-pulled.</span> <span id="s19">Very primitive, to compare what's going on now.</span> <span id="s20">We lived next to the factory, and I used to visit it, and I guess that's what installed my love for engineering, because my father was an engineer.</span> <span id="s21">Unfortunately, he died in 1932.</span> <span id="s22">I was 10 and half years old at the time.</span> <span id="s23">Three years later, I think, my mother remarried.</span> <span id="s24">She remarried an American.</span> <span id="s25">She came, she and -- to the States.</span> <span id="s26">She was in the states until 1938.</span> <span id="s27">I was brought up by my grandparents.</span> <span id="s28">Lived together with my aunt and uncle and finished the gimnazjum -- that is the Polish high school -- with the last graduating class, in 1939.</span> <span id="s29">My mother never became an American citizen because of involvement in properties in Poland, but she came to visit h-- us in 1938, and when the war broke out, she got stuck.</span> <span id="s30">She had papers which would allow her to reenter the United States, but she was not a citizen.</span> <span id="s31">After graduating high school, my grandfather, who happened to be one of the wealthiest Jews in our little town of Lida -- was a town of approximately 30,000 people, out of which between 10 and 15,000 were Jewish.</span> <span id="s32">He was one of the wealthier men.</span> <span id="s33">He had, he had connections, of course.</span> <span id="s34">He knew a lot of other people, and he knew someone who was connected with -- to the creator of modern Poland in 19-- in 1918, Marshal Pilsudski.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">01:04:10 The reason why I'm mentioning it is because for Jews to enter a school of higher learning was extremely difficult.</span> <span id="s36">They were -- there were quotas, and you had to be extremely brilliant in order to be admitted within the quota.</span> <span id="s37">But he was told that if I pass the entrance exam for the Polytechnic Institute of Warsaw, I would be admitted, as long as I pass it.</span> <span id="s38">So, in 1939 in August, I went to Warsaw to study with the Union of Jewish Students of the Polytechnic Institute of Warsaw -- sort of preparatory course prior to the exam; and that's when I saw the posters of mobilization that -- and the war broke out at that time.</span> <span id="s39">That was when Hitler attacked Poland, on September 1st, 1939.</span> <span id="s40">That night of September 1st, I was on the last train from Warsaw traveling to Lida, after I had left all my possessions in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s41">I just -- I was glad to get out.</span> <span id="s42">The train, the train trip that normally took 12 hours, took pro-- about 24 hours.</span> <span id="s43">We were bombed along the way, but we did make Lida, and when I got home, I got scolded: Why did I leave all my possessions in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s44">I said, “I just couldn't carry it.”</span> <span id="s45">I mean, that's how people trivialized the war.</span> <span id="s46">They didn't think that things will happen.</span> <span id="s47">We didn't realize what actually is going to happen.</span> <span id="s48">We were at home watching -- listening to the radio, watching Poland, the Polish army collapse -- not from the broadcasts, the Polish broadcasts, but from broadcasts from abroad because the Poles didn't want to admit.</span> <span id="s49">They thought their cavalry, their horses, would actually overcome the German tanks.</span> <span id="s50">Fortunately for us, Stalin and the Russian Army -- and the Red Army, came in from the east, went towards the west and they divided Poland and that time.</span> <span id="s51">Hitler and Stalin, they divided Poland and fortunate for us, my town, Lida, was in the Russian territory, in the Russian area.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">01:07:10</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q. Ok, before you continue, I want to ask you a couple questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A. Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q.</span> <span id="s56">When you left Warsaw, you had the -- a sense that you had to get out and get back to your family?</span> <span id="s57">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A.</span> <span id="s59">They were mobilizing just about everybody, except not 18 year-olds.</span> <span id="s60">I was 18 at the time.</span> <span id="s61">I think anyone -- I, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s62">Anyone who was in the army prior to that: the reservists, plus anyone who was over 20, I think; they had to report to the nearest army post.</span> <span id="s63">I was not included, but -- I just didn't want to be separated from the family.</span> <span id="s64">I sort of realized that Poland had no chance against Germany, against Hitler after the way he showed -- after his show of force in Czechoslovakia and Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q.</span> <span id="s66">So you already had a fairly strong awareness of Hitler and Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A. Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s68">I did belong to the -- prior to the war, I did belong to a group, to the Zionist movement, and I was an admirer at that time of Ze’ev Jabotinsky, which is a -- I did belong to the Betar also.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: And then, just going back a little further to the town and the community in Lida, before we go on, I'd love it for you to tell me a little bit more about what life was like before the war, and whether you experienced antisemitism, whether you mingled with the Christian people in the town -- what, what, what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Jews usually did not mingle with the, with the Christians.</span> <span id="s71">In going to school -- there were two high schools in our town, one actually closed after that.</span> <span id="s72">There was a private high school and a high school which was run by the State.</span> <span id="s73">The State high school was the privileged school and there’s -- there was a quota with the, with the State High -- with the State gimnazjum.</span> <span id="s74">Not all the Jews that wanted were allowed to go there.</span> <span id="s75">By strange coincidence, the other high school was a private high school; however the majority of Jews, Jewish children, went to a school which was called the handlówka.</span> <span id="s76">That was a commerce school where you were prepared for accounting, for bookkeeping, so something like that.</span> <span id="s77">And that school was run by a order of, of Cath-- Catholic priests.</span> <span id="s78">But Jews were accepted there.</span> <span id="s79">There was no quota in that school.</span> <span id="s80">Because I was one of the few who was accepted to the high school, to the Catholic High -- to the State high school from the very beginning -- and in Poland we had eight years of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">01:10:46 Later, during my time, they changed it.</span> <span id="s82">It was six years of high school and two years of lyceum.</span> <span id="s83">It was like the last two years of high school, they changed it.</span> <span id="s84">They called it lyceum.</span> <span id="s85">The quota was sort of rescinded and many, many more Jews were allowed into this, into this high school.</span> <span id="s86">We formed a very close circle of friends, none of us were non-Jewish -- strictly by religion.</span> <span id="s87">If Jewish girls were out with a Christian boy, it happened -- the opposite happened very, very seldom.</span> <span id="s88">It more often that the Jewish girls were out with Christian boys, it was sort of like a black mark on their record.</span> <span id="s89">It was held against them.</span> <span id="s90">But we did make friends.</span> <span id="s91">In school we were quite friendly.</span> <span id="s92">However, like everywhere, the high school kids were -- the Christian high school kids -- were in, in the front of ideas.</span> <span id="s93">So when Marshal Pilsudski died in 1935, and the reactionary, the real chauvinistic -- I forgot the man, the man’s name, took over, there was one of the few pogroms in Lida.</span> <span id="s94">The pogrom consisted basically of not killing people, but destroying property.</span> <span id="s95">There were some broken windows.</span> <span id="s96">There were some broken stores, and maybe a few Jews were beat up, but no one got killed.</span> <span id="s97">No one was tortured.</span> <span id="s98">It was more or less you had to stay off the street because you knew if they catch you, you were going to get a beating.</span> <span id="s99">That lasted a day or two and then it was forgotten, and we were good friends all over again.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Did you personally --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">01:13:00</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: It was sort of, it was sort of directed by the government.</span> <span id="s103">They were told, “You have to do it.”</span> <span id="s104">Sorry.</span> <span id="s105">What was your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q. I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s107">Did you personally ever get beat up, or people say things to you, or experience any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A. Oh, I was told many things.</span> <span id="s109">I was told, but never physically.</span> <span id="s110">I never had any physical harm, but I saw them breaking windows and walking around with what you would describe now as a baseball bat.</span> <span id="s111">Actually we didn't play any baseball, they were just sticks.</span> <span id="s112">Hitting Jewish businesses, because most of the downtown Lida was Jewish businesses.</span> <span id="s113">I would say probably 95 percent or more of the businesses in town were Jewish, Jewish-owned.</span> <span id="s114">The Poles were mostly farmers.</span> <span id="s115">It's strange but many times on, on some occasions we were told by our friends, ”Watch out.</span> <span id="s116">Don't go out this evening because there will be like a rumble.”</span> <span id="s117">We were friendly with them.</span> <span id="s118">So, you stood home, and that's it.</span> <span id="s119">It’s -- the division was strictly on a religious basis, and in opposite to what you have in here as far as Jews, are concerned, you had the Hasidim, the real Orthodox, and the traditional, what you would describe here.</span> <span id="s120">But still men and women were separated, or they were on different -- they were usually on different floors in the, in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s121">The women were upstairs, the men were downstairs.</span> <span id="s122">But there was no such a thing as modern Judaism, the Reform Judaism.</span> <span id="s123">It didn't exist in, in our town at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q.</span> <span id="s125">What about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A. My grandfather, who basically raised me with my grandmother, they were I would say Orthodox, but not Hasidim.</span> <span id="s127">They observed all the holidays.</span> <span id="s128">They did everything according to the good book, but they were not what I would say in their dress and their behavior, they were modern.</span> <span id="s129">But I did have an uncle who married my grandfather's sister -- it’s not my uncle, my mother's uncle -- who was a hosed.</span> <span id="s130">In fact, I became quite acquainted with the, with the Hasidim, because I said Kaddish for my father for 11 months after he died, and the only one that would go to -- that went to temple three times a day was my mother's uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">01:16:15 So, I used to go to his temple, to his Hasidishe shtibl, to say Kaddish for my father.</span> <span id="s132">And that’s what I, more or less, I got acquainted with the Hasidim.</span> <span id="s133">It’s not that I -- I did admire them for their staunch behavior, for their staunch belief, for the way they behaved in spite of all the adversity, because the town was -- didn't exactly admire them, because they, they were different.</span> <span id="s134">See, the Jews in Poland from what I -- at least in my town, tried to more or less assimilate.</span> <span id="s135">They didn't try to separate themselves.</span> <span id="s136">They tried to live like the other people.</span> <span id="s137">In fact, they lived better than the other people.</span> <span id="s138">They were more Polish than the Poles themselves.</span> <span id="s139">Now, I remember that in my parent's home -- because my father came from Russia; my mother met him when my -- her parents, my grandparents, ran away from Lida.</span> <span id="s140">They were in Lida for several generations, but they ran away from Lida in the first World War.</span> <span id="s141">Lida was a battlefield, so they ended up in a town called Tsarizin in the -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s142">Tsarizin was known by another name, Stalingrad, during the second World War.</span> <span id="s143">They lived there for a few years, and they met my father, who was from Khar’kov in the Ukraine, which is now Ukraine.</span> <span id="s144">At that time it was all Russia.</span> <span id="s145">My father married my mother.</span> <span id="s146">He was 10 or 11 years older than her, but she was a beautiful girl, and they -- he came together with his in-laws to Lida.</span> <span id="s147">They built that factory I have mentioned.</span> <span id="s148">I used to go there with him, watch them pour molten iron into forms, and they liked me, I think, the people that worked for him, they liked me because – they, they, they liked me even later.</span> <span id="s149">But after he died, and my mother remarried, the factory sort of reverted to the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s150">It was my uncle that was running it, and, and my mother's uncle actually paid my mother off, and he had that factory.</span> <span id="s151">He took it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">[Technical conversation] Ok…so when the Russians took over your town in 1939, what did that mean?</span> <span id="s153">What sort of changes took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">01:19:25 When the Russians came in 1939, the change-- the changes were major.</span> <span id="s155">First of all, the Russian classified everybody in many ways.</span> <span id="s156">The first classification was: were you a working man, or were you a capitalist, or so-called “bourgeois.”</span> <span id="s157">Second, they also, on your passport which they gave you, besides your social status, if you were a working man or not, they listed your religion.</span> <span id="s158">I had a friend whose father was the chief engineer of a rubber factory in our town.</span> <span id="s159">Our -- the town of Lida was quite industrial.</span> <span id="s160">It had two foundries.</span> <span id="s161">It had a factory that produced nails used for construction, and a factory that produced rubber; usually they produced -- what’s the English?</span> <span id="s162">Galoshe-- Galoshen (ph).</span> <span id="s163">What’s that?</span> <span id="s164">Rubber, rubber boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Galoshes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Galoshes.</span> <span id="s167">The chief engineer of that factory, his son, we went to school together, we were the best of friends.</span> <span id="s168">So when the Russians came in, and they na-- of course immediately they nationalized all the factories, but they left the chief engineer in charge, because, after all, he was a working man.</span> <span id="s169">He gave me a job.</span> <span id="s170">He gave my mother a job.</span> <span id="s171">So, I was able to get a passport which stated that I was a student working, but the Jew, the “Evrei,” remained on the passport.</span> <span id="s172">My mother was able to get a passport that she was working -- “Rabochiy,” but still Jew.</span> <span id="s173">All the, the rest of the family got passports that they were capitalists, and they were banned from Lida, because Lida was too close to the border.</span> <span id="s174">You had to be at least a hundred kilometers from the border.</span> <span id="s175">Lida was closer than a hundred kilometers, so they were banned and my grandparents had to move into a small -- very, very small town.</span> <span id="s176">It's not even a town, it's -- was a settlement, whatever you want to call it.</span> <span id="s177">More inland, more father away from the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">01:22:05 In the meantime, my mother's younger sister -- she had two sisters.</span> <span id="s179">That would have been the middle sister.</span> <span id="s180">She was married to an engineer, a chemical engineer, whose brother was an electrical engineer.</span> <span id="s181">They built in Lida a little factory which made rubber heals.</span> <span id="s182">Prior to that, he gained these experience by building factories.</span> <span id="s183">He built -- he was -- he built a factory in Spain.</span> <span id="s184">He built a factory in Greece, and my aunt was traveling with him.</span> <span id="s185">He spent, spent a few years in each place because he could not find work in Lida -- or in Poland, actually.</span> <span id="s186">Then he decided he and his brother build a factory where -- that was making rubber heals.</span> <span id="s187">When the Russians came in, they of course nationalized the factory, and they had to run away.</span> <span id="s188">So him and his brother and the brother's family went to Vilna.</span> <span id="s189">When the Russians came in, they gave Lithuania a short-lived independence.</span> <span id="s190">The border was not closed immediately, so you could travel actually to Vilna.</span> <span id="s191">My aunt, my mother's sister, remained in Lida to liquidate her possessions.</span> <span id="s192">She was selling everything off.</span> <span id="s193">She sold everything, and she decided to cross the border illegally with some other people that I knew, and they got caught by the, by the Russians.</span> <span id="s194">The trial was immediate.</span> <span id="s195">The sentence was immediate.</span> <span id="s196">They were sent to Siberia to Kazakhstan, banished there.</span> <span id="s197">We knew all that.</span> <span id="s198">There is a reason why I am mentioning that.</span> <span id="s199">That’s part of my general experience.</span> <span id="s200">Also, we had a cousin.</span> <span id="s201">It's not, not my cousin, it's my mother's cousin.</span> <span id="s202">It’s all -- but I still call him a cousin, who was a doctor, and being, being a doctor, being of draft age, he and his brother, both of them were drafted into the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s203">The brother, being just an accountant, was a private.</span> <span id="s204">The doctor, because he was a doctor, became an officer.</span> <span id="s205">They were -- they became pri-- Russian prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s206">The private escaped, and he survived in a different way.</span> <span id="s207">But the doctor, eventually he perished in Katyn, in the mass graves when 10,000 Polish officers were killed by the Russians on Stalin's orders.</span> <span id="s208">But his wife and daughter were arrested, sentenced immediately, and sent to Si-- to Siberia, also, also to Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s209">That's where my aunt met both of them.</span> <span id="s210">The reason why I am mentioning it is when we decided -- when we ended up in Lvov -- I'm jumping again.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">01:25:42 When we -- when my mother and I got the good passports, I still wanted to go to Polytechnic Institute, but the nearest Polytechnic was in Lvov, which was 600 kilometers south of Lida, approximately.</span> <span id="s212">That was too far to leave the family, so my compromise was to study physics at the University of Vilna.</span> <span id="s213">I went to Vilna, and I tried to enroll there.</span> <span id="s214">However, they closed the border between Lida and -- between Russia -- between the Soviet Union and Lithuania, and travel would have been impossible.</span> <span id="s215">So, I came back to Lida, and I think it was already March of 1940, we decided with my mother to go and settle in Lvov.</span> <span id="s216">Now the -- when the Russians came into Lida, beside nationalizing the factories, they requisitioned all the homes.</span> <span id="s217">They requisitioned all the living quarters.</span> <span id="s218">I lived with my grandparents and with my mother.</span> <span id="s219">They had a big house and they had a sort of an apartment in the back, and we lived in that apartment with my mother.</span> <span id="s220">They chased everybody out.</span> <span id="s221">They limit -- gave us, I think, two or three rooms, and that was for seven people.</span> <span id="s222">In the beginning, we had a Russian colonel -- a Russian general -- living with us.</span> <span id="s223">But that was sort of, more or less -- I became friendly with, with some Russian, with some Russian airmen.</span> <span id="s224">We used to indulge in vodka together, Have gefilte fish on a Friday with vodka.</span> <span id="s225">We became friends.</span> <span id="s226">I was doing nothing at the time, except working occasionally in the rubber factory to maintain my status that I am still a working man, but my goal was to get out and go to Lvov.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s228">01:28:20 When we left -- and this is rather important -- when we left Lida and went for Lvov, we didn't realize how crowded Lvov was.</span> <span id="s229">All the refugees, mostly Jews that escaped Hitler from Warsaw and Kraków, came to Lvov.</span> <span id="s230">Lvov at that time had a Jewish community of over 150,000.</span> <span id="s231">The population of Lvov actually more than doubled with the refugees because of the war.</span> <span id="s232">Finding living quarters was absolutely impossible.</span> <span id="s233">So, when we came, we started to look and look, and eventually we found an apartment with a Polish family.</span> <span id="s234">It was an older Pole.</span> <span id="s235">He was at that time in his 60s.</span> <span id="s236">He had a -- with his wife.</span> <span id="s237">They lived on the outskirts of Lvov.</span> <span id="s238">He was like a general contractor.</span> <span id="s239">He was, I'd would say, about a kilometer from the last stop of the streetcar, and that Pole actually played a major part, an extremely major part in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">02:01:12</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q. Ok, you’ve arrived in Lvov, and I want you to tell me something about the life there in the community, and, and I know it was an important city, so what was your life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A.</span> <span id="s244">It was a big city.</span> <span id="s245">We found an apartment, which was an extremely important thing with the -- this Polish family: Czachor; his name was Jan, her name was Marja.</span> <span id="s246">They were both elder Poles.</span> <span id="s247">I had a lot of conversations with him because on the beginning my main aim was to enroll into the Polytechnic institute of Lvov, which actually didn't -- that was April, and school wouldn't start for at least five months or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q.</span> <span id="s249">This is in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A. 1940.</span> <span id="s251">So, I was actually doing -- I was doing nothing.</span> <span id="s252">My mother found a job.</span> <span id="s253">She was working.</span> <span id="s254">Every job with the Russians was for the government.</span> <span id="s255">There was no such a thing as private employment.</span> <span id="s256">We had to -- we had some saved up money, of course, because they could have -- they confiscated the property, but they did not take away, the Russians didn't take away the tangible goods: the monies, the gold, the, the, the silver, the jewelry, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s257">So that was still negotiable.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q. Your mother's husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A. My mother's husband was in the United States.</span> <span id="s260">She didn't know at the time, because she could not get in touch with him, but he died.</span> <span id="s261">He died while she was in -- I don't recall exactly, he died in '40 or '41, or something like it.</span> <span id="s262">But there was no, no possibility of getting in touch.</span> <span id="s263">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s264">We were, we were still looking for another apartment, and we found a place because we were so far out of town.</span> <span id="s265">We found a place on Wulecka street with a Polish family given to us by the Russian government.</span> <span id="s266">They sort of requisitioned two rooms from them, and they gave it to us.</span> <span id="s267">They had a very big apartment.</span> <span id="s268">If it weren't us, it would have been somebody else.</span> <span id="s269">But the Poles, that family -- I don't recall their name -- they hated us because of it.</span> <span id="s270">First of all, they hated us because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s271">Second, because we took away their apartment.</span> <span id="s272">We took away part of their apartment.</span> <span id="s273">But throughout all of that I still remained friendly and used to go visit occasionally this contractor, this Po-- Pole.</span> <span id="s274">We used to have chats.</span> <span id="s275">He had things that I wanted.</span> <span id="s276">He had a radio transmitter and radio receiver, which at that time was not illegal.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">02:04:34 There was a Polish government in exile, and he used to work or be connected with the Polish -- with the AK, the Armia Krajowa, which was the Polish underground, which was basically antisemitic.</span> <span id="s278">I was able to enter the Polytechnic Institute of Lvov, and I became what you would call one of the top students there.</span> <span id="s279">I had received a scholarship from the Russians, and I was making more with my scholarship and the side benefits than actually than my mother was making on her job.</span> <span id="s280">So, we lived pretty good.</span> <span id="s281">I had the freedom of movement, and that winter I decided that -- we were in touch with my grandparents and they were getting letters from my aunt and that cousin that I have mentioned that was deported to Si-- Siberia, to Kazakhstan, with the little girl, how miserable, how bad off they are there.</span> <span id="s282">So we went to -- I went to Lida.</span> <span id="s283">I visited whoever was in Lida.</span> <span id="s284">I went to the little town where my grandparents were.</span> <span id="s285">I visited them, and the thing that I remember -- it was so primitive.</span> <span id="s286">They had a big sto-- big oven in the middle of the house with rooms all around it.</span> <span id="s287">They used to cook and heat the walls of the, of the oven they -- to supply heat, and I had to sleep on top of the oven to keep warm.</span> <span id="s288">I spent a few days there.</span> <span id="s289">Then I tried to go to Vilna, because Vilna being, being independent Lithuania, had plenty of food.</span> <span id="s290">Unbelievable how much food was in Vilna.</span> <span id="s291">I went with my student papers without any Visa, and I was told that if you are smart and you can bribe your way through, you’ll get by, you'll get there.</span> <span id="s292">After all, being cocky, being -- what was I then?</span> <span id="s293">21?</span> <span id="s294">20?</span> <span id="s295">I got on the train.</span> <span id="s296">When it came to the border and they were checking the papers, I was told if you give the guy 40 rubles, which is four 10-ruble pieces, he'll let you through.</span> <span id="s297">So, I was smart: I took four one-ruble paper, paper notes, which were the same size as the 10-ruble notes.</span> <span id="s298">I met him in the dark passage-- passageway.</span> <span id="s299">I snuck them in, and they let me through.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">02:07:30 I went to Vilna.</span> <span id="s301">I came back loaded but -- absolutely loaded with food.</span> <span id="s302">And we were able -- they were able to ship cheese, butter, crackers, cigarettes; because y-- cigarettes, not that they smoked, but that you could trade cigarettes for anything…to my aunt and my cousin, so they could use it to help them survive.</span> <span id="s303">I didn't need it.</span> <span id="s304">I -- we had enough of food and everything.</span> <span id="s305">And I came back to Lvov.</span> <span id="s306">That was on my winter recess, from '40 to '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q.</span> <span id="s308">These are huge distances you traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A. I, I did.</span> <span id="s310">I took a train.</span> <span id="s311">It was a train, an overnight train ride, or maybe even longer, from Lvov to Lida.</span> <span id="s312">From Lida to Vilna we took the train.</span> <span id="s313">From Lida to Vilna was a short ride.</span> <span id="s314">It's only about an hour and a half by train.</span> <span id="s315">A lot of my friends that I went to school together with from Lida alone and from other towns.</span> <span id="s316">There was a little -- not far from Lida there was a, a summer resort, what you would call, in pine woods called Novoyelnya.</span> <span id="s317">Novoyelnya was in a triangle between Berezhnitsa, Novogrudok, Slonim, and Lida.</span> <span id="s318">It’s actually not a triangle; it’s a little more, where better-off-to-do families used to pack up their belongings for the summer, put it on a horse-drawn cart; used to take it about a day for the horse to pull the things into Novoyelnya, spend three months or two months in Novoyelnya, and then go back.</span> <span id="s319">There were two rivers there.</span> <span id="s320">There was the pine woods.</span> <span id="s321">It was a -- you could spend a summer.</span> <span id="s322">And we used to spend summers there and I met -- made a lot of friends, which I still have, which I met in that summer -- summers.</span> <span id="s323">Some, some of them survived.</span> <span id="s324">Many of them, in fact, survived.</span> <span id="s325">We used to meet there every year, and when my family decided one or two -- twice -- that they wanted to go to another place for the summer, I was upset.</span> <span id="s326">I said, “I don’t-- I want to go there.</span> <span id="s327">I'll miss my friends.”</span> <span id="s328">These young peo-- kids; we had a ball in Lvov.</span> <span id="s329">They were engineering students.</span> <span id="s330">They were art students.</span> <span id="s331">They were medical school students.</span> <span id="s332">There was a lot of them that came to Lvov because that was the only school of higher learning open to the public which was open to them, which had higher standards than schools in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s333">Because they could go to Minsk, they could go to Kiev, for example, but they were much lower standards.</span> <span id="s334">After all, they had all Polish professors teaching there.</span> <span id="s335">And not just from Lvov, but professors from Warsaw and professors from Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">02:10:50 We have developed a group of friends where we were -- we stuck together always.</span> <span id="s337">We had little to do with people of -- with the Christian, with the Christians, in a way.</span> <span id="s338">That was more or less a group of Jewish kids that was together.</span> <span id="s339">We had fun.</span> <span id="s340">We played together, and we studied together.</span> <span id="s341">In June 22nd, 1941, the night before we went to a concert, to an open-air concert -- if I don’t remember, I think it was David Oistrakh that played in open-air -- gave an open-air concert, and somebody's comment was, “Where else in the world can people get together, be -- and listen to a world class artist, and be in peace?”</span> <span id="s342">A few hours later, bo-- we were woken up by bombs.</span> <span id="s343">Hitler attacked the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s344">A week later -- or eight days later -- Hitler was in Lvov.</span> <span id="s345">And I don't know.</span> <span id="s346">I watched the German troops come in; sunburned boys, you know, they, they were -- they looked so good you could never suspect that they were capable of atrocities the way that they perpetrated later, or they, they were perpetrating now, on the Jews or other people any pa-- in other places.</span> <span id="s347">They looked careless.</span> <span id="s348">They looked like they were -- like they owned the world.</span> <span id="s349">As soon as Hitler came in, I think a week later, he imposed a ransom, that you have to -- all the wedding rings, all the gold, and I don't know how many millions of Polish zloty the Jews had to collect.</span> <span id="s350">And everybody in good faith, they just gave up the jewelry, gave up the gold.</span> <span id="s351">The Germans collected it, and the people that they held for ransom never came back anyway.</span> <span id="s352">Because they grabbed immediately a number of Jews and a hundred or 120 Polish intellectuals, college professors that survived the Russians.</span> <span id="s353">The Russians didn't touch them in spite what their ideas were, what they were -- Russians didn't bother them, but the Germans killed them.</span> <span id="s354">Now, there was a go-- good question I was asked: “Why didn't you run away with the Russians?”</span> <span id="s355">The advance of the German army was so swift with their method where they actually went in straight on one side, straight on the other side, and then they closed in.</span> <span id="s356">The army proceeded and another army came from the back to sort of -- to, to, to liquidate the prisoners of wars.</span> <span id="s357">Not to liqui-- to kill them, but to disarm, to disarm the, the, the ones that were encircled.</span> <span id="s358">There was no time to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">02:14:32 However, many of my friends that went to school together, because the trains were still running, decided that instead of staying in Lvov, no matter what, they're going to go home.</span> <span id="s360">And some of them went back to Lida, some went back to Berezhnitsa, Novogrudok, and so on.</span> <span id="s361">And they did make it.</span> <span id="s362">They did get home, because I, I found out later that they did get home.</span> <span id="s363">They perished -- some of them per-- in fact, the majority of them perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q. Can you describe for me the first few days of German occupation: what was going on in the streets; what you were doing; what you were thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A.</span> <span id="s366">We were -- our apartment where we lived was not in the Jewish area of Lvov.</span> <span id="s367">We lived with a aristocratic Polish family.</span> <span id="s368">They hated us, but they, sort of, they were more or less restrained, except for their son.</span> <span id="s369">In the beginning, there was no such a thi-- Jews moved normally throughout the city.</span> <span id="s370">Having 150,000 Jews in Lvov, part of Lvov became like a Jewish district.</span> <span id="s371">There were nobody -- there was nothing but Jews in there.</span> <span id="s372">So, that was easy for them to find where the Jews were.</span> <span id="s373">So, if they needed Jews for work, to clean up something, they used to grab them, go -- take the trucks, go into that area, and grab them.</span> <span id="s374">I had an experience that must have been about a week after the Germans came.</span> <span id="s375">We still -- there was still no order that we had to wear armbands with the Star of, Star of David, so basically I was dressed like anybody else.</span> <span id="s376">I didn't look typically Jewish.</span> <span id="s377">The only one that would know that I was Jewish were my immediate neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">02:17:04 I was coming up the steps, going home, and the Ukrainian militia was coming down the steps, said, “Are you this and this?”</span> <span id="s379">I said, “Yes, that's my name.”</span> <span id="s380">“You're Jewish.”</span> <span id="s381">I say so -- I denied on the beginning.</span> <span id="s382">“Give us your passport.”</span> <span id="s383">I said, “I don’t have it with me.”</span> <span id="s384">“Let's go home.”</span> <span id="s385">I asked him, “How do you know?”</span> <span id="s386">Oh, he says, “We were told by somebody reliable how you look and that you were Jewish.”</span> <span id="s387">And that was the son of that family.</span> <span id="s388">They grabbed me to go to work.</span> <span id="s389">One of the places that we worked was the general jail in Lvov, where the Russians have killed all the political prisoners.</span> <span id="s390">They sort of massacred them.</span> <span id="s391">We moved bodies from one place onto, onto trucks.</span> <span id="s392">Those bodies were decaying already, and everybody knew the Russians did it; not the Germans, that one -- that massacre.</span> <span id="s393">After that they grabbed me again to go to work, and we went to work on the de-- on the railroad depot of Janowska street.</span> <span id="s394">Janowska street was a place where the-- later was developed into a notorious concentration camp.</span> <span id="s395">I worked on Janowska street for a while.</span> <span id="s396">In fact, what happened to me, the first time they got me, they took my passport.</span> <span id="s397">I was able to get the passport back.</span> <span id="s398">I looked at the passport and the passport was written on parchment with India ink.</span> <span id="s399">India ink does not sink into the parchment.</span> <span id="s400">It lays on top of it.</span> <span id="s401">And being an engineering student, I used to do some drafting with the India ink.</span> <span id="s402">I knew if you took a very sharp razor blade you can sort of peel off the India ink from the parchment without leaving a sign.</span> <span id="s403">You can scrape it off.</span> <span id="s404">So, I scraped the word , “Evrei,” -- Jew, and I wrote in the word “Belarus,” -- white Russian, with India ink, the same color India ink.</span> <span id="s405">So, the next time they got me I showed it to them -- “I'm not Jewish.</span> <span id="s406">I am -- what do you want from me?</span> <span id="s407">I'm a white Russian.”</span> <span id="s408">I couldn't fool them.</span> <span id="s409">The guy grabbed my passport.</span> <span id="s410">He says, “Go there, go to work; when you come back we'll examine it more care-- more, more carefully.”</span> <span id="s411">When we got back, I saw that passport was laying on the side, and there was a girl that was watching it with a, with a number of other papers.</span> <span id="s412">I, sort of, got back and I sweet-talked her, and I swiped that passport.</span> <span id="s413">I stole it from -- .</span> <span id="s414">I got back home and I -- my mother burned it.</span> <span id="s415">She says, “If they're going to catch you with that thing, and they know who you are, all they have to do is say one word: ‘Put your pants down.</span> <span id="s416">’” And because it’s -- the point of circumcision was strict-- was restricted to Jews only in Poland and in Russia.</span> <span id="s417">Not like in the United States where, let’s say, most of the males are circumcised.</span> <span id="s418">So, she burned the passport, and I was without a passport and I went to work.</span> <span id="s419">I worked for a while on Janowska street.</span> <span id="s420">We were carrying bales of hay from railroad cars onto trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">02:21:33 The pay was good.</span> <span id="s422">After a day’s work, if they were pleased, we used to get a loaf of bread, a loaf of black bread, pumpernickel bread, which was more than you can imagine because, who could consume a big loaf of bread that must have been, if you really -- if you look at it, that would be probably a four, five pound loaf of bread?</span> <span id="s423">You could trade bread for anything.</span> <span id="s424">And that was still before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s425">My mother used to do the trading.</span> <span id="s426">I used to -- sometimes I used to come home with two loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s427">The Germans -- the German officer was good to us.</span> <span id="s428">We did a good job.</span> <span id="s429">We were young and strong.</span> <span id="s430">There was no such a thing as beating at the time, but I have noticed that they was star-- they started to put up a fence around certain area on Janowska.</span> <span id="s431">I said, “As long as they put up a fence,” -- a barbed wire fence, not just a fence -- I says, “I don't like it.”</span> <span id="s432">And I -- one day I told them I am sick.</span> <span id="s433">Another day I told them I don't feel so good.</span> <span id="s434">I sort of talked myself out of there.</span> <span id="s435">And by the time they closed in and they made a ghetto in Lvov, I was no longer on Janowska Street.</span> <span id="s436">I have mentioned to you, I think, that my -- or maybe I did not.</span> <span id="s437">My grandfather had a brother who was also in that found-- partner in the foundry with my father.</span> <span id="s438">They had a daughter -- in fact, two daughters and a son.</span> <span id="s439">One daughter married, and she married a guy who was a -- he likes to be, he liked to be a bigshot, sort of was a makher.</span> <span id="s440">He was a -- had a hand in everything.</span> <span id="s441">When the German -- and they moved as well, they moved to Lvov also from Lida.</span> <span id="s442">He was able to get out.</span> <span id="s443">In the ghetto, when just be-- while the ghetto was being formed, or just before the ghetto, he knew a family from Lvov who were socially or politically active in Lvov before the war, and through them you could get a lot of things.</span> <span id="s444">I didn't know them.</span> <span id="s445">We didn't need them, but with the Germans, the place where you worked was of the utmost importance.</span> <span id="s446">Work papers, you had to have a document showing where you are employed, where you are working.</span> <span id="s447">And the things that you were doing there were rated according to certain priorities.</span> <span id="s448">We didn't know it on the beginning, but a different colored card meant life or death.</span> <span id="s449">I'm jumping the gun a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">02:25:00 In the fall of '41 -- I don't remember if it was September, I think, or October -- it was the first announcement that the Germans made of creating a Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s451">They didn't call it a ghetto immediately.</span> <span id="s452">They called it “Jewish living quarters.”</span> <span id="s453">If you were caught outside of it, you were severely punished.</span> <span id="s454">Severe punishment meant beating, meant being sent to a concentration camp, or even sent to Janowska street, to the conce-- if you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q.</span> <span id="s456">So there was a camp there at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A.</span> <span id="s458">There was already a camp.</span> <span id="s459">We moved in, into an apartment.</span> <span id="s460">There was a Judenrat, a board of prominent Jewish citizens who were willing to take the responsibility of organizing the whole thing.</span> <span id="s461">They have created a Jewish police.</span> <span id="s462">Eventually, the Jewish police was uniformed.</span> <span id="s463">They had a some sort of a uniform and a uniform hat.</span> <span id="s464">To maintain order, because after all 150,000 people -- that's a lot of people, and there were a lot of conflicts.</span> <span id="s465">When you move into an apartment occupied normally by two people and they say now you have to make room for 20 or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">[Technical Conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s467">02:26:50</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: We happened to live across the street from the famous Polish candy factory which was still open and producing candy for the Germans.</span> <span id="s469">Later they closed it.</span> <span id="s470">They liquidated it.</span> <span id="s471">But that's, that’s incidental.</span> <span id="s472">We had to sort of -- it was easier for us because after all we already made one move.</span> <span id="s473">We made a move from Lida to Lvov, so to move into the ghetto we were sort of condensed already.</span> <span id="s474">We didn't have all the earthly possessions that normal people have in a home.</span> <span id="s475">We left it with my -- the rest of the family, with my grandparents, that by this time they already got rid of it.</span> <span id="s476">When we moved there, my, my uncle, my mother's younger brother, the second younger brother, moved in also -- moved also to Lvov.</span> <span id="s477">He was -- in the meantime, he was able to get papers that he was a working man.</span> <span id="s478">He moved into Lvov, and he lived with us in that apartment; in that, you call it apartment -- in the room with, I think, two or three other families.</span> <span id="s479">It was just beds and beds and bunks, and whatever you had you put it under the bunk or under the bed.</span> <span id="s480">You couldn't move around.</span> <span id="s481">Bathrooms you had to wait in line.</span> <span id="s482">There was one, one kitchen where everybody cooked.</span> <span id="s483">Life was very difficult, but on the beginning we were not in the category of the very old or the very young.</span> <span id="s484">Those were the first ones to be captured by the so-called Aktions.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: We need to change

On the beginning, we were living, prior to the gh-- prior to ghetto, we were living in a mostly Christian area, area, which wasn't too far from the Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s490">It was on Wulecka Street, a very classy area with few Jews.</span> <span id="s491">Prior to the wa-- prior to '39, it was -- you would call it a restricted area; no Jews were allowed in there.</span> <span id="s492">That's why when the Ukrainians went on the rampage, and they were killing and beating and massacring Je-- Jews, they didn't come into that area.</span> <span id="s493">They were doing it in areas where predominately Jewish.</span> <span id="s494">There was no sense for them to going after one or two or three or 10 that lived in the area where they could go in places where there were Jews only, and distinct Jews.</span> <span id="s495">Because -- I never in my life had pe’ahsin (ph) or, or, or, or, or was dressed different in a, in a way that would distinguish me from the other people.</span> <span id="s496">The rampage by the u-- the worst part about it, I knew some of the Ukrainians from the Polytechnic Institute, and many of the leaders of this -- not many, but some of them, actually -- I knew them personally, from school.</span> <span id="s497">In fact, later I'll tell you I had an experience with one of them, but that will come -- that’s -- chronologically, it came so much later that I'll tell it to you when I came, when I come to this.</span> <span id="s498">But if I don't tell you remind me.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q. Wasn't it surprising that these people that you went to school with were capable of such atrocity?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A.</span> <span id="s501">The fact that they went to school didn't make them human.</span> <span id="s502">They were sort of like a split personality.</span> <span id="s503">Did anyone -- would anyone believe that civilized Germans that gave us big ph-- such great philosophers and mu-- musicians and you name it, were capable of the atrocities they committed?</span> <span id="s504">That was a complete split of per-- personality.</span> <span id="s505">The same people that were admiring -- going to museums during the day or -- the next hour they were capable of killing, massacring, maiming people because they considered the Jews being subhuman, being not of the same class, not the same -- they were not human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">03:04:10 I was very disappointed with that Polish family because they were the ones that pointed out me to a German officer.</span> <span id="s507">We were home -- I was home with my mother, a knock on the door, German officer comes in.</span> <span id="s508">You leap to, sort of, “Attention!”</span> <span id="s509">You d-- you don't know what's going to happen; an SS officer dressed in full uniform, and so on.</span> <span id="s510">I didn’t -- I never spoke German.</span> <span id="s511">I could speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s512">But -- in, in high school I took French as a foreign language.</span> <span id="s513">We were told by the teacher that was teaching German that “If you think that if you are Jewish, and you think that you're going to be using Jewish for German as a substitute, I'll fail you.</span> <span id="s514">German is German, and Yiddish is Yiddish.”</span> <span id="s515">So, I said, “Why should I argue with him?”</span> <span id="s516">I went and I took French.</span> <span id="s517">Anyway this German officer came in and made himself understood.</span> <span id="s518">I mean, he says, “I heard that you have a camera.”</span> <span id="s519">And I had a beautiful Kodak camera that my mother brought me from the United States.</span> <span id="s520">And I knew that it was a good and original Kodak.</span> <span id="s521">Said, “No, I don't have it.</span> <span id="s522">I sold it.”</span> <span id="s523">He says, “You want me to search the place?”</span> <span id="s524">So my mother says, “You better -- what, are you going to start up?</span> <span id="s525">Give it to him.”</span> <span id="s526">So I said, “I forgot.</span> <span id="s527">I thought my mother sold it.</span> <span id="s528">I thought that she nee-- sold it because she needed -- she wanted -- needed it for bread.”</span> <span id="s529">I took the camera out, and I gave it to the German officer.</span> <span id="s530">He says, “No.</span> <span id="s531">I am not going to take it from you.</span> <span id="s532">Here is a receipt.</span> <span id="s533">I'll give you a receipt for five German marks that you sold it to me voluntarily.</span> <span id="s534">No one will accuse an SS officer of st-- taking a camera from a Jew.”</span> <span id="s535">I had that receipt for quite a while.</span> <span id="s536">Wish -- I wish I had it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q. Was there a, a -- an atmosphere of fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">03:06:35 Yes.</span> <span id="s539">There was a time already at, of -- where Jews had to wear armbands, and they were prior to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s540">If a German approached you, a Jew was not supposed to be on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s541">You had to walk in the gutter.</span> <span id="s542">Rain, mud -- you had to get off and let the German pass.</span> <span id="s543">You had to salute.</span> <span id="s544">Salute, by that time, meant take off your -- bow, and take off your hat to a German officer or a German soldier that walked, if you passed one.</span> <span id="s545">If there was any way how they could humiliate you, they found a way how to do it.</span> <span id="s546">Again, I didn't live in the Jewish -- in the real Jewish area, but the things that I have heard -- and I saw it myself -- where they used to grab the real religious one and cut the pe’ahsin, cut the beard, make them lick their boots to a shine, beat them to a, to a, to a point where they were unconscious.</span> <span id="s547">They wouldn't bother -- maybe they wouldn’t bother young people like myself, because after all, we di-- didn't look different.</span> <span id="s548">We still had the armband.</span> <span id="s549">But it during -- while this was going on, I still kept in touch with that Polish family.</span> <span id="s550">The only way how I could do it is you used -- we -- I used to get dressed a little better, not report to work, slip the armband off into my pocket, grab the streetcar, take the streetcar to the end of its run, and then walk that kilometer and go over to his house for a talk -- just to maintain a friendship.</span> <span id="s551">We were talking to each other.</span> <span id="s552">He told me he was working with the Polish underground resistance.</span> <span id="s553">He gave me some names of the contacts -- “In case you need it, you can rely on some people.”</span> <span id="s554">I knew that he had a radio transmitter, and radio receiver, and a cache of arms.</span> <span id="s555">The reason why he was able to have all that; he had a big house.</span> <span id="s556">The front of it was like a shop, like a carpenter's shop, and he was able to hide all these things between the stacks of lumber and stacks of other things, between his tools, and they never bothered him.</span> <span id="s557">As the ghetto was tightening, and the Aktions became prevalent every couple of weeks, we were lined up.</span> <span id="s558">We had to line -- first of all they built a fence around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s559">You had to enter through a main gate.</span> <span id="s560">And I remember one time that was in the -- late in the fall of '41, we were coming from work, because my job for most of the time through that cousin that I have mentioned that was a, a makher in the ghetto with the other family.</span> <span id="s561">Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the other family, and they didn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">03:10:20 This cousin and himself and his wife -- rather, no, his wife was the cousin -- they didn't survive; but their daughter and her sister, they survived.</span> <span id="s563">I was able to get the right documents for work.</span> <span id="s564">My job was what you call “Rohstuffverfassung” -- “gathering raw materials.”</span> <span id="s565">We used to go to demolish places, to demolished houses, to places where they used to gather all kinds of raw material and put copper to copper, steel to steel, brass to brass, gold to gold, silver to silver.</span> <span id="s566">God forbid if anyone took a piece of gold or a piece of silver.</span> <span id="s567">That meant, if they caught you, that one meant immediate execution on the spot, right on the spot.</span> <span id="s568">Because you were searched at their whim.</span> <span id="s569">But the documents were excellent.</span> <span id="s570">There were many times where the group, when we were lined up to go to work, and there were thousands of people on the main square of the ghetto, thousands and thousands, and the Germans used to come in and say, “This group, go to the left; and this group, go to the right.”</span> <span id="s571">We used to show them our papers and, “This group, go.”</span> <span id="s572">And we always happened to go in the right direction where we, we were able to survive.</span> <span id="s573">The document saved -- definitely saved our lives by being in the right group with the right -- the beatings during the, during the work, while we were working, were rather rare.</span> <span id="s574">We didn't get paid.</span> <span id="s575">Occasionally they gave us some food; you had to sort of maneuver yourself.</span> <span id="s576">But being on the outside, we were able to be in touch with the outside world and talk to people and do a lot of finagling where we were able to smuggle in things into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s577">They didn't check us as well as they checked the other people.</span> <span id="s578">We were, sort of call it, the Rohstuffverfassung was the elite, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">03:13:10 We survived -- I survived that way the Aktions where they went after the old.</span> <span id="s580">They went after the young.</span> <span id="s581">They went after the sick.</span> <span id="s582">They went after just about anybody.</span> <span id="s583">I have witnessed atrocities beyond anybody's belief, belief and description.</span> <span id="s584">Because when they used to put us aside to wait what's the whim of the ghetto commander, or whoever he was, I -- one was Wilhelm (ph), I think.</span> <span id="s585">Another one -- I don't recall their names.</span> <span id="s586">Gr-- Gruber (ph), I think; I don’t recall.</span> <span id="s587">We were -- I saw them beat to pulp, execute, kill, shoot.</span> <span id="s588">I saw them take a little baby and tear it in half.</span> <span id="s589">That's one image I'll never forget in my life.</span> <span id="s590">It, it, it just -- how subhuman.</span> <span id="s591">Germans did it.</span> <span id="s592">The Ukrainians did it.</span> <span id="s593">Now, how would you -- Germans were in German uniforms.</span> <span id="s594">The Ukrainians, they had their own uniform.</span> <span id="s595">Poles were not there, but there were -- they had a group of Russian prisoners of war which turned on the Russians.</span> <span id="s596">They gave them a name which I don't recall -- which co-- collaborated with the Germans that, that, that did the dirty work.</span> <span id="s597">The ghetto was practically reduced to, to nothing, because from 150,000, when 1943 came there was 20,000 left through de-- through killings, deportations to concentration camps, local executions.</span> <span id="s598">They used to kill and bury them.</span> <span id="s599">They had, outside of Janowska, there were places where they used to -- with mass graves where they were just killing one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s600">And all this time they were shrinking and reducing the ghetto, moving the fence and making it smaller and smaller until -- it was right after New Years of 1943.</span> <span id="s601">We had a place where this Gajkowski, that's my cousin’s husband, my uncle.</span> <span id="s602">There was another man by the name of Pupko that was from my hometown, and I was, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">03:16:33 My mother wasn't there already.</span> <span id="s604">Came to us and told us that “The next three nights are going to be absolutely awful.</span> <span id="s605">You better try to get out.</span> <span id="s606">If you survive, you-- you'll be able to come back, but it's going to be absolutely awful.”</span> <span id="s607">Now, the reason why my mother wasn't there is sometimes that summer toward fall she was in touch with a Polish woman, a peasant Polish -- Polish peasant woman that used to come to the ghetto wall, and she used to sort of give her items of clothing, items of jewelry, and exchange it for bread for, for food with her.</span> <span id="s608">You could do it in certain spots in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s609">So the woman said to her, "Why don't you come and stay with me?"</span> <span id="s610">My mother was very skeptical.</span> <span id="s611">Can I trust her?</span> <span id="s612">Because many people -- there were many, many things known where people used to let in Jews, then chase them out or call the Germans and take away all their belongings, all their property, all their jewelry -- whatever they had.</span> <span id="s613">So, my mother said, "I'll try.</span> <span id="s614">After all, I still have you.</span> <span id="s615">I'll leave some things with you, and I'll go there."</span> <span id="s616">So, she went there.</span> <span id="s617">It was about 35 kilometers out of Lvov, in the direction of Ternopol.</span> <span id="s618">She went there, and she stood there for several weeks until -- and I know it because she told me that.</span> <span id="s619">My mother told me.</span> <span id="s620">The woman came to her that someone said to me --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">[Technical interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s622">03:18:40 So the Polish woman said that she was told by someone that, “You must have someone.</span> <span id="s623">You're hiding someone because we saw strange shadows moving in the middle of the night.”</span> <span id="s624">See, my mother was hidden in a barn on top but she had to take out all her body waste in the middle of the night and dump it somewhere.</span> <span id="s625">So someone noticed someone running around in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s626">So she says, “You can't stay here and you have to come back to -- you, you have to get out of here.”</span> <span id="s627">She left -- so she left the woman and started to go back to Lvov to come back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s628">As they were coming -- she met -- as she was coming, she met another woman, and you know two Jews -- two Jewish women, they sort of, you recognize each other, even if you are dressed like a Polish peasant with a babushka and all that, but you sort of you know, you recognize each other.</span> <span id="s629">They recognized that they were both Jewish women, and they both proceeded to Lvov, and not far from Lvov, they were caught by a patrol, by a German patrol, who was out searching for escaped Jewish boys from, from, from Janowska street, from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s630">The guy, they beat him up and they gave my mother and the other woman shovels.</span> <span id="s631">He says, “Dig yourself a grave.</span> <span id="s632">You're going to be shot right here.”</span> <span id="s633">What are you going to do?</span> <span id="s634">They started to dig.</span> <span id="s635">In the meantime, the patrol came out of the woods with a couple of other women, and the, the SS guy said to the other women, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s636">“Oh,” she says, “will you save us.</span> <span id="s637">We came to see our boys who are on Janowska street.</span> <span id="s638">We wanted to see them.</span> <span id="s639">We know that they are in Janowska.”</span> <span id="s640">“You verfluchte Juden!”</span> <span id="s641">He shot the other two women.</span> <span id="s642">He put them in the graves, in the holes that my mother and the other woman dug.</span> <span id="s643">He made them cover them up, and he said, “I had enough killing today.</span> <span id="s644">Verschwinden” -- “get lost,” to my mother and the other woman.</span> <span id="s645">They made their way back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s646">When I came that day from work, I didn't recognized my mother, because after all I never saw her with black eyes, with a swollen face.</span> <span id="s647">I never saw her like that in my life.</span> <span id="s648">But I said to her, “That's not the place for you.</span> <span id="s649">Let me try,” because I go outside the ghetto, “let me try to talk to Czachor,” to this Pole.</span> <span id="s650">And I went to work.</span> <span id="s651">I slipped the armband.</span> <span id="s652">I went to -- and I went to visit that gu-- that Po-- that Polish guy.</span> <span id="s653">He says to me, “I can't give you an answer.”</span> <span id="s654">He said, “Let me think about it.”</span> <span id="s655">I said, “Please, I mean, things are very bad.</span> <span id="s656">You -- try to help me.”</span> <span id="s657">I appealed to his patriotism.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">03:22:13 To his -- more than his Polish patriotism is to him -- I said, “You are a human being.</span> <span id="s659">You are trying to save another human being which is not guilty of anything.</span> <span id="s660">The only guilt is that she was born a Jew, but what did she do?</span> <span id="s661">She didn't do anything to you.</span> <span id="s662">She didn't do anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s663">Take my mother and let her stay with you.”</span> <span id="s664">I was able to get back in time to come back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s665">A few days later I went there again, and he said, “Ok, let her come, but I must get paid for it.”</span> <span id="s666">I said, “How do you want to get paid?”</span> <span id="s667">He says, “I don't want your money.</span> <span id="s668">I'm not going to take your money and all that.”</span> <span id="s669">He says, “I want an equivalent of a pound of butter, the value of a pound of butter” -- of a kilogram of butter, actually; that's two pounds -- “per week, per week of stay.</span> <span id="s670">Whatever -- and you give it to me in any denomination, any currency that you want -- that you can give me.”</span> <span id="s671">So, we had some dollars.</span> <span id="s672">Fortunately, we had singles.</span> <span id="s673">So my mother took a lot of singles, and we exchanged some dollars.</span> <span id="s674">You could exchange the money in, in ghetto for singles.</span> <span id="s675">You could do all these things.</span> <span id="s676">And this man that I have mentioned, Pupka, was one of the guys that used to deal with gold, with currency, and all that.</span> <span id="s677">He was from Lida as well.</span> <span id="s678">My mo-- I got my mother there.</span> <span id="s679">In fact, she went there by herself.</span> <span id="s680">I didn't go with her because two people would have been much easier to detect.</span> <span id="s681">One was easier to get, to get through.</span> <span id="s682">I mean, after all, it was easier for one pu-- she, she wa-- she got dressed like a peasant woman.</span> <span id="s683">I smuggled her out of the, out of ghetto and put her on the streetcar and she -- I got word that she's there.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q.</span> <span id="s685">How do you smuggle someone out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A. Through the gate together with the people that go to work.</span> <span id="s687">See, the person -- there was always, there was -- there were groups, and the group -- the men in charge had to present the papers, and he was responsible with his life for anything that was going on.</span> <span id="s688">So he, he was checked, and if you were a group of 30 for example, and one had papers which were not in order, two of them would have been shot: the man in charge and the guy who had the papers in -- not in order.</span> <span id="s689">I don't recall -- I don't think that I even told the guy that my mother is, is, is co-- coming out with us, because I didn't want -- it wouldn't have been reasonable for him to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">03:25:30 It was better if he didn't know because, after all, all you have to do is pass the ghetto and get out, go not too far, and then she would disappear and they would load us on, on trucks, on -- who knows, wherever we have to go at the time.</span> <span id="s691">Usually we worked in a, in a, in a -- not in, in a gym… in an armory where they used to bring in carloads of materials, raw materials, and we had to separate them.</span> <span id="s692">So she was already there.</span> <span id="s693">That -- the -- that January 2nd, when they told us about this big Aktion that is going to happen, I decided I'm going to get out of there.</span> <span id="s694">I put my best clothes, of course my winter coat.</span> <span id="s695">I wrapped myself in a white sheet, went across rail -- one -- it was in the middle of the winter; there was snow.</span> <span id="s696">I got out of the ghetto across the railroad tracks and hid for three days and three nights.</span> <span id="s697">I had some dried bread with me, and I used to melt snow for water on the Jewish cemetery in the mausoleum.</span> <span id="s698">Because the Jewish cemetery was being destroyed already, the stones, but not all of it.</span> <span id="s699">After the shooting st-- subsided, I got out of the cemetery, hid somewhere, because there was always a curfew.</span> <span id="s700">You could not walk in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s701">There was always a curfew.</span> <span id="s702">You couldn't walk around freely.</span> <span id="s703">I went and I got in touch with the man that this Czachor gave me as a contact for the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s704">He said to me “Dispose of all the-- your Jewish things.”</span> <span id="s705">He was the only one that knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s706">And he told me to go out of Lvov into a certain area.</span> <span id="s707">I was there for about 10 days or so, trying to get on my feet.</span> <span id="s708">It was in-- on a farm in a home, sort of.</span> <span id="s709">They used to se-- they used to go there.</span> <span id="s710">We were still in hiding, but in hiding with a Polish farmer as a Pole.</span> <span id="s711">Fortunately they never asked me questions about a catechism, and they never made me put my pants down.</span> <span id="s712">They sort of accepted it because my Polish was fl-- was flawless.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">03:28:30 After a week, a week or 10 days, we started going into action where we went and we -- I had a, a rifle.</span> <span id="s714">I had some -- a gun, a six-shooter.</span> <span id="s715">And we went.</span> <span id="s716">We -- once we attacked the German -- it wasn't a German, it was a Ukrainian police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s718">04:01:00 We have destroyed this Ukrainian station, police station.</span> <span id="s719">They actually -- they, they burned it down.</span> <span id="s720">They wanted the records burned.</span> <span id="s721">They claimed that there were some, some records, some incriminating records.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q.</span> <span id="s723">How many people were you operating with?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A.</span> <span id="s725">There were seven of us at the-- that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q. All men?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A. All men.</span> <span id="s728">I didn't know any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q. And this was part of --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Then we came --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: This was a part of the AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A.</span> <span id="s733">That was part of the AK.</span> <span id="s734">Then we went back to the same hiding place where we were, on a Polish farm, and someone came there -- people came there and there was one man, to me he didn't look familiar, but he says to me, “Didn't you go the Lvov Polytechnic Institute?”</span> <span id="s735">I says yes, I mean… “Weren't you always in a group together with…” And he mentioned a few names.</span> <span id="s736">I said, “Yeah, they were my acquaintances.”</span> <span id="s737">He said, “Yeah, but they were all Jews.”</span> <span id="s738">I said, “So what?</span> <span id="s739">I can have friends everywhere.</span> <span id="s740">I am very liberal.”</span> <span id="s741">But that gave me food for thought.</span> <span id="s742">I mean, if he starts to associate me with Jews… The next time we went on a similar thing, similar action, we had to lay some mines on a, on -- at a railroad crossing.</span> <span id="s743">They were trying to blow up a railroad crossing.</span> <span id="s744">And there was a counterattack of a Germ-- of a Ukrainian police, also Ukrainians, also.</span> <span id="s745">They sort of discovered that something is going on, and I happen to be in front and they started to shoot from the back, my guys, and I had a str-- sneaky suspicion that they were shooting not at them, they were shooting at me.</span> <span id="s746">I said, “This thing does not smell kosher.</span> <span id="s747">I, I, I don't want anymore.”</span> <span id="s748">So when we came back I gave them an excuse that I had to go back to Lvov, that I had to see someone, some family business, and so on.</span> <span id="s749">I came to Lvov, and I went directly this Polish man, Czachor, and I said to him that “Your Armia Krajowa is trying to kill me.</span> <span id="s750">I don't like them.</span> <span id="s751">They are -- they don't like Jews.”</span> <span id="s752">He said, “I know they don't like Jews, but you didn't have to tell them who you are.”</span> <span id="s753">I said, “Someone seems to recognize me or -- from the Polytechnic Institute.”</span> <span id="s754">So he says, “So what do you want me to do?”</span> <span id="s755">I said, “You must take me here.”</span> <span id="s756">First, he hesitated but I stood there, and I talked and I talked and I talked, and sort of I gave him no choice.</span> <span id="s757">I says, “I'm not going from here.</span> <span id="s758">I'm not leaving the place.”</span> <span id="s759">He accepted me, and I was there with my mother.</span> <span id="s760">That was, I say, just about beginning -- the end of January of 1943.</span> <span id="s761">The, the, the -- late in the second half of January.</span> <span id="s762">We were there fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">04:04:55 He had a basement and he had a big shop, which was closed, where he rented one room with an outside entrance to the post office.</span> <span id="s764">And people that used to work for the post office used to congregate there twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, and they used to talk to each other and we could hear; they were all Poles.</span> <span id="s765">They used to talk to each other and we could hear the, the war news.</span> <span id="s766">On top of it, I built myself a little crystal radio set with an earphone and a crystal that didn't need any power so I listened to the local radio station, to the Lvov radio station, of course, operated by the Germans.</span> <span id="s767">It had, I thi-- very little Polish.</span> <span id="s768">It’s mostly German and mostly German news about the U-boats sinking, about the American convoys, and so on; the big successes of the German army.</span> <span id="s769">Remember that was the time that they were in their full glory, in 1941.</span> <span id="s770">There was a newspaper published by the Germans in Polish that the Pole, he used to get it, and then we had it so I was fully aware of what was going on in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q.</span> <span id="s772">Did you know about -- did you know much about the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s774">We knew about the camps in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s775">We knew a lot about the camps in ghetto.</span> <span id="s776">More -- we knew more than the wor-- world wants to give us credit.</span> <span id="s777">We knew exactly about the incineration, about the gas chambers -- everything that was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Somebody told, and there was no reason why not to believe.</span> <span id="s780">Somebody had to tell.</span> <span id="s781">I mean those were rumors.</span> <span id="s782">No one who survived could tell us, but there were rumors that things like that were going on, that that was not resettlement.</span> <span id="s783">That they were not going -- being sent to another, like the Hungarian or some other Jews were, were -- they believed that they were being resettled into agricultural settlements.</span> <span id="s784">We knew that they were not.</span> <span id="s785">It's quite possible, maybe the Germans themselves told to some people in concentra-- in -- on Janowska.</span> <span id="s786">Janowska was our main source of information.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q.</span> <span id="s788">So you were listening to the news and…?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">04:07:45</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A.</span> <span id="s791">We were li-- we were -- we knew what is going on, what is the status of the war.</span> <span id="s792">And the, of course, the German successes, they were quite exaggerated, but they were true.</span> <span id="s793">It was -- they didn't lie that there was -- they put siege to Leningrad.</span> <span id="s794">They didn't lie that they were on the -- right next to Moscow, that they took millions and millions of Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s795">Remember, America was not at war yet.</span> <span id="s796">The United States was not at war at that time.</span> <span id="s797">They were sending convoys to England, but we heard about the German successes when they were sinking the American merchant ships going to England in the North Sea, or wherever, wherever the boats used to meet them.</span> <span id="s798">A few months later, while I was there with my mother, being in the basement, we used to sleep most of the time in the, in the basement.</span> <span id="s799">The basement was not under the full house, which is important.</span> <span id="s800">There was part of the house, the, the porch, which was not excavated, so actually the basement looked like an “L” shape.</span> <span id="s801">That will be of importance a little later.</span> <span id="s802">I started to see some shadows running around, in the -- in his work room, in his shop, and we looked and looked, and I could swear that there were people going there.</span> <span id="s803">So we confronted him.</span> <span id="s804">First he denied, then he admitted.</span> <span id="s805">He had, beside us, he had: a Hasidishe family of seven; a woman, alone; and the man, Pupka, who was his contact for exchanging money for my -- that my mother used to give him.</span> <span id="s806">He was -- he had -- he hid them upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">04:10:08 He didn't want to tell us.</span> <span id="s808">I said, “Why didn't you want to tell us?”</span> <span id="s809">It turned out he didn't want to tell us because he, he said my mother would fa-- wouldn't pay him anymore; the love of money.</span> <span id="s810">He would say, “Look, after all, the, the, the, the fami-- the Ha-- the religious family of seven, they have so much money.</span> <span id="s811">Why should we be paying you?”</span> <span id="s812">He wanted to get more money than -- this way.</span> <span id="s813">But after we con-- he confronted -- we confronted him, he got all us together in the basement.</span> <span id="s814">We -- across the L section, we built a wall.</span> <span id="s815">So we shortened the basement.</span> <span id="s816">We made a room next to the unexcavated part of the building.</span> <span id="s817">We built a wall in there with a trap door that you had to get on the floor, crawl -- and crawl into the basement, crawl into that room.</span> <span id="s818">That was about four bricks high and about four bricks wide, because that was a brick wall to, to match it the rest.</span> <span id="s819">We made a little box, wooden box, and we painted the wooden box to look like bricks.</span> <span id="s820">We put that corner -- we made it in a dark corner.</span> <span id="s821">We put a bench over it, put a lot garbage out there and sort of -- like that spot, let it be not noticeable, so you can't notice it when you come into the basement.</span> <span id="s822">And whenever there was anything dangerous going on, all of us had to go and hide there.</span> <span id="s823">Because it was on the outside wall, we dug a hole in the outside wall and we hid in the sewer.</span> <span id="s824">So, we made a, a hole going to go to the, to the sewer so we could -- we, we used to separate -- we had to separate the body waste so we could flush the feces with the urine because otherwise it wouldn't go down.</span> <span id="s825">Close it as air-tight as we could.</span> <span id="s826">Water we didn't have, however, he didn't have water -- central, central water system.</span> <span id="s827">There was a sewer line, but no central water system.</span> <span id="s828">He had a deep well in his basement with a old-fashioned one-arm pump where you could pump, pump very good water, in fact.</span> <span id="s829">Well water.</span> <span id="s830">So we had, we had the crystal radio in there because there was an electric powerline going through there.</span> <span id="s831">We didn't use the electricity.</span> <span id="s832">I used the wire that was disconnected as an antenna, because being underground, I wouldn't pick up anything with the crystal set.</span> <span id="s833">The signal wouldn't go through.</span> <span id="s834">But we used -- I used the electric wire as an antenna, and I was able to lis-- still listen to the German radio.</span> <span id="s835">I heard about the siege of Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s836">We heard all of it.</span> <span id="s837">The Germans, of course, didn't say that they were losing at Stalingrad, but we, we had a map and once they started to say where they were, all of a sudden they were a hundred kilometers west of Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s838">What happened in Stalingrad?</span> <span id="s839">So we knew, actually, what was going on, on the, on the, on, on front.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">04:14:05</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q.</span> <span id="s842">Did that give you hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A.</span> <span id="s844">That gave us a lot of hope.</span> <span id="s845">That, sort of -- in the meantime -- I don't recall chronologically -- the Germans discovered the mass graves -- that was way before, in Katyn.</span> <span id="s846">Those were the mass graves of the Polish -- 10,000 Polish officers that were shot on Stalin's orders.</span> <span id="s847">They brought in representatives from the neutral countries, Sweden, Switzerland.</span> <span id="s848">They brought in the people -- representative, and they started to dig those gr-- mass graves -- those graves.</span> <span id="s849">And because the Russians, when they shot those prisoners of war, they didn't do it like the Germans did where they made them undress, shoes went to shoes, pants went to pants, jackets went to jackets, hair were shaved.</span> <span id="s850">They removed jewelry.</span> <span id="s851">I mean, the Germans were quite methodical in their killing.</span> <span id="s852">The Russians shot, shot them right on the spot.</span> <span id="s853">So most of them -- or all of them, actually -- had their documents on them so they could identify them.</span> <span id="s854">I saw the name of my mother's cousin on the list, the doctor, whose wife and daughter were sent to Kazakhstan.</span> <span id="s855">The wife lives now in Toronto, and the daughter, and the daughter is a psychiatrist in Toronto.</span> <span id="s856">In fact, I speak to his wife.</span> <span id="s857">She’s -- she just told me she was 86.</span> <span id="s858">She survived, and we -- I visit her in, in Florida occasionally.</span> <span id="s859">That was because I was able to get, because Germans were so methodical in publishing the lists.</span> <span id="s860">They did say that they didn't commit the crime; of course, the Russians accused them of doing it, but I think they admitted that they did it, that Stalin -- on Stalin’s orders.</span> <span id="s861">Anyway, it came 1944, approximately March, April, end of March, beginning of April of 1944.</span> <span id="s862">We were -- all the time we were in that basement running back and forth, up and down.</span> <span id="s863">The ghetto was completely liquidated already, but Janowska Street, the camp, had a hundred or less Jewish boys there whose job was digging up mass graves and burning the bodies, destroying the evidence.</span> <span id="s864">But they were still there.</span> <span id="s865">All of a sudden, we were downstairs in the basement because the situation was sort of tight.</span> <span id="s866">We hear knocking on the door and heavy German steps, heavy steps -- boots.</span> <span id="s867">We ran into our hiding, and we didn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s868">We discovered later that the Gestapo and the Ukrainian police --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s870">04:17:38</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: We were talking about you heard the German boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: The German boots.</span> <span id="s873">We didn't know it in the beginning what actually happened.</span> <span id="s874">We found out later that someone has squealed on our -- the man that was hiding us.</span> <span id="s875">And they came, the German Gestapo, and the -- came to arrest him, not because he was hiding Jews, be-- but because he was a member, an active member, of the AK, the Armia Krajowa, the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s876">They searched thoroughly the place.</span> <span id="s877">They found the rifles, the grenades, the, the ammunition, the guns, the radio transmitter, the radio receiver.</span> <span id="s878">They arrested him.</span> <span id="s879">They arrested his wife.</span> <span id="s880">She denied the knowledge of everything.</span> <span id="s881">She called neighbors as witnesses.</span> <span id="s882">They came, they testified that she -- that he never listened to her, that she didn’t know -- anyway, that she was completely innocent.</span> <span id="s883">The verdict was, after a month, to liquidate his property, take away everything that belonged to him, give her back the house with one bed, one table, one chair, one dresser -- and that's it.</span> <span id="s884">That's hers.</span> <span id="s885">Otherwise, remove everything else from the house.</span> <span id="s886">Now, in the meantime, we were there for a whole month in the basement being -- not knowing what is happening.</span> <span id="s887">Fortunately, right after they -- we heard the heavy steps, and right after we heard that, that the German police was there, we had suspected something, that something is going on.</span> <span id="s888">What we actually did, we went upstairs, and she had a lot of stuff prepared: dried bread, marmalade made with real sugar.</span> <span id="s889">We took it all down, and we had it in the basement.</span> <span id="s890">We filled our containers with water.</span> <span id="s891">During the day, we were sitting there without moving, but at night we were able to get out to the -- to flush the body waste without making any noise.</span> <span id="s892">We had, between us, there was a man out there, the father of the Hasidishe family, who was deaf, half deaf.</span> <span id="s893">His children used to actually have a pillow so they could put it -- because a deaf person can’t hear himself; he didn’t -- they, they didn't know if he was going to scream out or say anything.</span> <span id="s894">They had a pillow just to put over his head and, if necessary, quiet him down.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">04:21:15 Fortunately, we went through that thing until they decided that it is time to liquidate the house.</span> <span id="s896">We're living on stale bread, which was not already stale, it was full of fungus, but when you have nothing to eat, fungus won't kill you, the green stuff.</span> <span id="s897">It might give you a little indigestion, but it won't kill you.</span> <span id="s898">And, surprisingly enough, in spite all these conditions, nobody got sick.</span> <span id="s899">We slept on a wooden board covered with straw with a piece of cloth on top of it.</span> <span id="s900">The fleas that developed were so big that you could hear them jump when they were jumping.</span> <span id="s901">You became immune to it.</span> <span id="s902">It sort of didn't bother you anymore.</span> <span id="s903">But, the -- to fulfill the verdict, they had to remove all of his property from the house, with us being in the basement in hiding.</span> <span id="s904">Who came to remove it, but the Jewish boys from Janowska street, from the concentration camp, being supervised by Germans and Ukrainians -- being beaten there, cussed, yelled, and you name it.</span> <span id="s905">We heard them move everything.</span> <span id="s906">The -- we were afraid that somebody is going to spot our box, the painted box, and go after us.</span> <span id="s907">Because whenever we went th-- there, before you moved the box in, you sort of made a mess on the ground, because otherwise you would see that that part was smooth.</span> <span id="s908">After all, somebody -- when, when you slide over cement, you sort of smooth it out.</span> <span id="s909">They did it on -- the, the actual removal of property took, took place four times.</span> <span id="s910">After the third time, this man Pupka said, “I can't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s911">If they're going to discover us, all they have to do is throw a grenade in and we're all good as dead without even resistance.”</span> <span id="s912">And we had two guns.</span> <span id="s913">He had a, a, a gun, a six-shooter, and I have a five-shooter.</span> <span id="s914">I had a five-shooter with a five -- with five cylinders and an extra bullet, and I had six, six bullets.</span> <span id="s915">He took his gun, he says, “I'm going to get out of here.”</span> <span id="s916">We let him out in the middle of the night, and I was able to trace his steps until the middle of July of 1944, which was approximately two weeks before the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s917">I, I knew with who he was in touch with, and after that he disappeared and he did not survive.</span> <span id="s918">At that time, I wasn't positive, but now I definitely know that he didn't survive.</span> <span id="s919">We were there, they came again.</span> <span id="s920">They emptied out the place.</span> <span id="s921">They were -- maybe those Jewish boys, they saw that thing, but nobody ever said anything.</span> <span id="s922">We'll never know.</span> <span id="s923">All of us survived; 10 survived in a hole.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">04:25:15 But this Polish man, he was -- his sentence was to be sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s925">He was sent there, and he perished there.</span> <span id="s926">His wife came back, and that was already May.</span> <span id="s927">Prior to that, because there were two of them, and because he had money, he could buy food on the black market to feed us.</span> <span id="s928">It was all a matter of getting one meal a day, which was basically a -- some sort of a soup with some bread on the side.</span> <span id="s929">See, it's easy to buy some extra bread, and soup she cooked, so she made soup.</span> <span id="s930">I mean, what was in the soup, who cared?</span> <span id="s931">When she came back, she said, “How am I going to feed you?</span> <span id="s932">I'm alone, and you are 10.”</span> <span id="s933">She says, “You better get out of here.”</span> <span id="s934">We said to her, “How can we get out?”</span> <span id="s935">I says, says, “If we get out of here, it's like good -- like you're signing your own death sentence, because no matter how much we'll deny, once they start torture you, somebody is going to say where they -- where, where they were.</span> <span id="s936">It's impossible to deny completely.”</span> <span id="s937">Says, “You have a garden, see what you can do.”</span> <span id="s938">She, she -- we sort of convinced her.</span> <span id="s939">We had a bowl of watery, watery soup every day.</span> <span id="s940">I don't know how many calories a day it was.</span> <span id="s941">Who knew -- first of all, I didn't know what calories were at the time.</span> <span id="s942">But we sort of survived.</span> <span id="s943">The big disappointment was -- I still had the crystal set.</span> <span id="s944">I still was able to listen to the radio station, to the local radio station, what didn't tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s945">There were still local newspapers.</span> <span id="s946">There were rumors.</span> <span id="s947">The Russians stopped by the Polish town of Ternopol, which was only about 60 kilometers, that will be…east of Lvov, and they stood there for a month because they tried to straighten out the front.</span> <span id="s948">And they stood and they stood, and we were suffering and praying that they should come, every day.</span> <span id="s949">Finally, the Russians came in and liberated us on the day after my birthday, July 27, of ‘44.</span> <span id="s950">We wanted to come out of the hole.</span> <span id="s951">Says, “I can't let you out,” said the woman.</span> <span id="s952">“I don't my neighbors to know that I was hiding Jews.</span> <span id="s953">They will say that I am a Jew-lover.</span> <span id="s954">They will say that my husband perished because he had Jews, which I know it isn't true.”</span> <span id="s955">We stood there an extra day, and one by one we got out in the middle of the night, the following night where we were immediately arrested by the, by the Soviets because there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s956">We slept in city hall on a table, and the first question of the Russians is, “So why weren't you fighting actively?</span> <span id="s957">Why -- what did you do in hiding?</span> <span id="s958">You -- you are nothing but a bunch of cowards.</span> <span id="s959">Go and tell them that there was nobody to fight with.”</span> <span id="s960">Because the first thing was to save our lives because if I went with the Ar-- with the Armia Krajowa, I would have been dead, and the other 10, they were all -- they didn't know one end from a rifle -- of a rifle -- to another -- from the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Beginning Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s963">05:01:05</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A. I had an interesting incident while I was in, in hiding.</span> <span id="s965">I did go out from that hiding on one or two occasions, actually, to do some -- to do certain things which I had to do.</span> <span id="s966">On one occasion, I was walking in a very non-Jewish area of Lvov, and all of a sudden -- dressed properly -- without the -- the ghetto was already practically already liquidated.</span> <span id="s967">There was no ghetto any more.</span> <span id="s968">I -- all of a sudden, I feel a heavy arm on my shoulder.</span> <span id="s969">I turn around -- and I had a gun in my pocket.</span> <span id="s970">I see a Ukrainian policeman put an arm on my shoulder, and he says to me, “Isn't your name Jasza?”</span> <span id="s971">And that was my nickname, my Russian nickname.</span> <span id="s972">I say “Yes,” and I put my hand in my pocket.</span> <span id="s973">He says to me, “Don't be scared of me.</span> <span id="s974">I know who you are.</span> <span id="s975">I know what you are.</span> <span id="s976">I'll let you go.</span> <span id="s977">I will not do anything.</span> <span id="s978">I know you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s979">I know you are living on Aryan papers, probably.”</span> <span id="s980">He didn't suspect that I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s981">“Just be careful.</span> <span id="s982">I won't do anything to you because I rec-- I recall that one of the tests what we had at the Polytechnic Institute together you sort of helped me a little bit.”</span> <span id="s983">So, he repaid, that was -- he repaid a debt of honor, or dishonor because I shouldn't have been helping him.</span> <span id="s984">The cousin that I was mentioning, before the makher in ghetto, he and his wife, they went into hiding and they had a little girl at the time.</span> <span id="s985">That little girl at the time was about four, five years old.</span> <span id="s986">They didn't want to have a little child with them in hiding, so they gave the child to a Christian family in a different town, but very close nearby.</span> <span id="s987">The mother's that -- her sister was blond.</span> <span id="s988">She's about two years younger than I am.</span> <span id="s989">She lives in Israel now.</span> <span id="s990">She was able to procure for herself Aryan papers.</span> <span id="s991">All of a sudden, she became a school teacher, went into Silesia, into Slonsk, into western part of Poland, and became a governess, working for somebody who had money out there.</span> <span id="s992">And later she be-- she was, she was teaching with all, all forged documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">05:04:15 When -- after we were liberated, my mother and myself, we were in Lvov, we didn't know what happened to them because we left the ghetto before they did.</span> <span id="s994">They left after us, and one didn't know where the other one is going.</span> <span id="s995">But the one from the -- the, the, the cousin that was in hiding, that was on Aryan papers, came back.</span> <span id="s996">She knew where all of them were, but she didn't know where we were.</span> <span id="s997">But she came back to Lvov.</span> <span id="s998">She found us in Lvov, and she started to ask questions: Do we know what happened to them?</span> <span id="s999">I said, “No, I don't even know where they were.”</span> <span id="s1000">So, she went into those two little towns.</span> <span id="s1001">First, she was afraid but we went there, and she found that the cousin and his wife, someone squealed on them, they got them, and they were shot right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1002">The little girl remained with that Polish family.</span> <span id="s1003">So, when she went back to the -- when she went to that Polish family to get that girl, they refused to give her to her.</span> <span id="s1004">But the girl, being at that time she was already five, five and a half, she recognized her, of course, and they had to use the authorities.</span> <span id="s1005">She got her.</span> <span id="s1006">She's a grandmother now in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q. Let me ask you: you were in hiding a long time…</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A. Yes, about a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q. And you just said that you only came out of hiding to do some business once or twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q. What, what did it feel like when you were liberated and you came out into the daylight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A.</span> <span id="s1013">It was a very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s1014">It's like newly -- being newly born.</span> <span id="s1015">First of all, it was hard to believe that just about everybody you knew, that everybody that you were with, perished in spite of the fact that people that I went together to high school in Lida many years ago, many, many of them survived because they went and they were with a group of partisans.</span> <span id="s1016">But they were in a different area.</span> <span id="s1017">The area where we were was maybe much more antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1018">We had our Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1019">They had their Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s1020">They had their -- the Poles were just as bad in both places.</span> <span id="s1021">But the territories, the area itself, was there were many more jungles.</span> <span id="s1022">There were many more rivers.</span> <span id="s1023">There were many more inhabited areas.</span> <span id="s1024">We were in more civilized area, which was more cultivated, and because of it, it was much harder to hide.</span> <span id="s1025">My feelings was that I hope that I will survive, and my first steps were to go back to the Polytechnic Institute, where I have attended, prior to that in -- from 1940 to 1941, I put a full year of school.</span> <span id="s1026">The Germans might have destroyed the faculty by killing them, by deporting them, but they did not destroy the records.</span> <span id="s1027">So, all the records were there.</span> <span id="s1028">They were preserved, and it was a matter of getting the people, people to dig them up and within a month, they had all the records out and I was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">05:08:32</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q.</span> <span id="s1031">Who was teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A. People who came from Kiev, and some were le-- some professors were left over, not 100 percent.</span> <span id="s1033">But people to -- from Kiev, from Khar’kov, from the Ukraine, even from Moscow.</span> <span id="s1034">To teach in Lvov, it was a big honor because the life in the occupied territories, that -- and that was an occupied territory, that was not the original Soviet Union -- was still better than within the Soviet Union, and Lvov was not as destroyed as the major cities in Russia, in the, in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1035">So I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q. Do you remember the first, the first few days of liberation, what that was like, what, what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A.</span> <span id="s1038">The first day -- few days of liberation we were trying to find a place where to live and we were given, by the, by the Russian authorities -- I don't know how to call them, occupation or, or liberated -- in apartment which was occupied by a German general, who ran away leaving a lot of things in tact; a lot of food, some beer, some -- a bunch of other things, which normally we wouldn’t ex-- normal people wouldn't expect to find.</span> <span id="s1039">He ran away real fast.</span> <span id="s1040">Later, they took it away from us.</span> <span id="s1041">They said it's too good for you, but at least we had it on the beginning.</span> <span id="s1042">Then, it was a matter when, when we left our hiding, I had on me nothing but rags.</span> <span id="s1043">From sliding on the basement floor into -- in and out of that hiding hole, all the clothes were just in, in, in shambles.</span> <span id="s1044">There was nothing but holes.</span> <span id="s1045">You couldn't keep anything inside because everything was moldy there.</span> <span id="s1046">You had to delouse yourself because the fleas were as -- they were the size of flies.</span> <span id="s1047">When they jumped you could hear them jump on top of, on top of straw.</span> <span id="s1048">It was a matter of finding some clothes.</span> <span id="s1049">It was a matter of going on to the market.</span> <span id="s1050">They had a Russian name for it called tolkuchka.</span> <span id="s1051">Tolkuchka, it means “one was pushing the other,” where you sort of, whatever you had for sale, someone would buy it from you.</span> <span id="s1052">I remember on the very beginning, because I spoke fluent Russian -- after all I, and a good Russian, too.</span> <span id="s1053">After all, I went to school; most of my subjects were taught in Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">05:11:24 Interesting, one of the courses that I tried to use, get credit for it, as Economics in here, when I came to the United States, was the basis -- the basic study of Leninism and Stalinism.</span> <span id="s1055">They didn't give me any credit for it.</span> <span id="s1056">They said, “That's not our economics,” but I tried.</span> <span id="s1057">That was taught in Russian.</span> <span id="s1058">A Russian soldier stopped me, and he says, “Can you buy from me something?</span> <span id="s1059">I say, “I can't buy from you; I have no money, but if you hang around here for a few hours, I'll sell it for you.”</span> <span id="s1060">And those were can, cans of American ham and beans, like C-rations, but big cans that the American, that the Americans supplied the Russian army with.</span> <span id="s1061">They were being sold on the black market, and I sold some of them at a very, very good profit because it didn't cost me anything.</span> <span id="s1062">And whatever the Russian soldier got, I mean, he was happy to get something for it.</span> <span id="s1063">That was my first black market experience.</span> <span id="s1064">From -- after that I -- that’s the only way I could survive and, and do something.</span> <span id="s1065">I used to buy paper.</span> <span id="s1066">I found a printing shop that used to print lines on the paper, then I found someone who that a bound, a bound-- a bindery, and used to make notebooks, with a couple of staples and a notebook with a cover, and we used to sell notebooks to the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1067">That was like over a thousand percent profit.</span> <span id="s1068">Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1069">They used to go like hotcakes.</span> <span id="s1070">And, like everything else, it lasted for a while and then, then -- someone -- then, then the Russian government started to print it.</span> <span id="s1071">But until then -- so we made some money that way, and then I started to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q.</span> <span id="s1073">Did you feel safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A. Yes, I did feel safe, in spite of the fact that at one time my mother worked for a supply depot, and her boss said to her, “You know, I'd like to sell a few big cans of imitation honey butter.”</span> <span id="s1075">It's like a honey butter spread which was strictly Ger-- which was German.</span> <span id="s1076">So, she says, “Ok, I'll try,” and she got me.</span> <span id="s1077">I took some of it, and I went to sell it on the market and the cops, the Russian police, grabbed me, arrested me.</span> <span id="s1078">They locked me up.</span> <span id="s1079">“Where did you get it?”</span> <span id="s1080">First I didn't tell them, then I got in touch with this man who supplied it, and I asked him, “What should I do?”</span> <span id="s1081">He says, “Don't worry, you can tell that you got it from me.”</span> <span id="s1082">I told him I got it through them.</span> <span id="s1083">He says, “And I thought we cracked a major, a major thing, a major --“ And they let me out.</span> <span id="s1084">That was the only time I was in jail, in a Russian jail for 24 hours, interrogated.</span> <span id="s1085">It's not on my record.</span> <span id="s1086">They never kept the records of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">05:15:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q.</span> <span id="s1089">What about the local population?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A. That's why I didn't feel, I didn’t feel threatened.</span> <span id="s1091">The Russian po-- the local population, the Ukrainians, they ran away.</span> <span id="s1092">The ones that did the Ukrainian militia, and so on, they ran way from there.</span> <span id="s1093">The Poles, they didn't want to stay.</span> <span id="s1094">They tried to move to the western part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1095">So who were -- I think -- the people that remained were the Jews, the liberated Jews that were there, that weren't too many at all, and the ethnic Russians, that came there because the life there was much better than in Russia itself.</span> <span id="s1096">So I felt fairly safe, especially -- I would call myself that I was within -- between the intellectual elite.</span> <span id="s1097">After all, I was a college student.</span> <span id="s1098">I was in second year of Polytechnic Institute with a, with a scholarship from the government.</span> <span id="s1099">It's not that I believed in their system, but I could get all the benefits from it without putting anything into it.</span> <span id="s1100">So, when the Russians gave Poland the eastern part of Germany, or the we-- they extended Poland west, so that they could keep the part of Poland that they have occupied in '39, like Belarus, like Lida, Lvov.</span> <span id="s1101">They announced that Poles, or anyone who is willing to repatriate himself into Poland, is free to do so.</span> <span id="s1102">You can take with you anything you can carry.</span> <span id="s1103">Of course, you can't move furniture, but you can take anything you can carry, with you.</span> <span id="s1104">So, in -- I think it was in '45 in August, I think, -- yeah, around August -- we decided that there's no future in there and we're going to repatriate.</span> <span id="s1105">We got on a train and we went to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q. Let me just ask you a couple questions here.</span> <span id="s1107">When you said th-- that in Lvov most of the people were ethnic Russians or the few remaining Jews, what size of a Jewish community are we talking about?</span> <span id="s1108">Were they able to kind of reclaim the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">05:18:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A. No.</span> <span id="s1111">The Jewish community may be from all -- because whoever was liberated, they sort of came to Lvov, because there is a safety in numbers and safety in a big town.</span> <span id="s1112">When I say there were Jews, there were still Poles in Lvov.</span> <span id="s1113">A lot of Poles, the community was several thousand, but not even in 10 thousand, several thousand.</span> <span id="s1114">The small towns around Lvov, after the liberation, they had pogroms, believe it not, where the local population -- you see, Jews, when they came back, they try -- tried to claim their property.</span> <span id="s1115">Of course, the locals didn't want to give it to them, so how -- what's better than try to get rid of them?</span> <span id="s1116">The, the, the expression was always, there were -- “Why didn't they kill you?</span> <span id="s1117">You are too many of you left.”</span> <span id="s1118">The local populous was al-- they were always Jew haters.</span> <span id="s1119">They always despised the Jews, if it was before the war or after the war.</span> <span id="s1120">There were very, very few that were sympathetic.</span> <span id="s1121">My -- our friend Czachor, the one that saved our life, when we confronted him in conversations: “Why are you doing it -- ?</span> <span id="s1122">“</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">[Technical interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">05:19:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A. Czachor, when you -- when we confronted him on many occasions, we had a lot of discussions with him; after all, we were doing nothing.</span> <span id="s1126">We were the intellectuals, and he was a carpenter who became a contractor, whose children were educated.</span> <span id="s1127">They were both -- both his daughters were in Kraków.</span> <span id="s1128">In fact, I used to send them packages later when we ended up in, in Italy.</span> <span id="s1129">He says, “I didn't do it for money.”</span> <span id="s1130">He says, “I had to have the money because I am not a rich man.</span> <span id="s1131">I couldn't feed and sustain, and what was the harm if I made a couple of bucks?”</span> <span id="s1132">he was saying.</span> <span id="s1133">He didn't live to enjoy it, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1134">He said, “I'm doing it strictly for, for humanitarian reasons.</span> <span id="s1135">I can't see people being slaughtered and exterminated for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1136">The only reason is because they were born to the wrong parents or to certain type of parents.”</span> <span id="s1137">I mean, the fact that he supported, he was with the Jews and the army of Armia Krajowa at the same time, was a contradiction in itself because the Armia Krajowa, they never said they were antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1138">But in their actions, they never supported the Jewish resistance.</span> <span id="s1139">In Lvov itself, the Jewish police, which was -- whose basic job was to maintain order having 150,000 people living in one small area, and selecting people for extermination; like they say, “I li-- you live and he dies or what?”</span> <span id="s1140">They -- somebody had to, somebody had to do it.</span> <span id="s1141">Now, was it more humane that the Jewish police did it?</span> <span id="s1142">Was the -- were the Jewish police traitors to the-- to their fellow Jewish brothers?</span> <span id="s1143">I wouldn't call them traitors.</span> <span id="s1144">I think it was their way how to survive maybe a little longer, hoping that that they can save their families, when frankly they did it.</span> <span id="s1145">If they didn't do it somebody else would have done it.</span> <span id="s1146">It's not that they -- if they didn’t do it, it wouldn't have been done.</span> <span id="s1147">It would have been done maybe in a more, more cruel wa-- cruel way.</span> <span id="s1148">The end result would have been the same; it's just a matter of how you, how you slaughter somebody.</span> <span id="s1149">The Jewish police warned many people, like they warned me, about the forthcoming Aktions; and if not for them maybe I wouldn't have been alive now with that January '43 incident.</span> <span id="s1150">Then again, there was a time when they couldn't meet their quotas given to them by the Germans -- and for a fact, I know it, I can really -- I can testify to it -- that they were sort of exchanging: “You, you tell where my grandparents are hidden and I'll tell where your grandparents are hidden.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">05:23:46 When you had to -- when, when they couldn't meet the quotas, says, “After all, they'll go sooner or later,” for the -- when the, when the, when the Aktion was to get, get the older, the disabled, the sick.</span> <span id="s1152">One would sort of tell not where his relatives were hidden, but would point out where the other ones, and the other one would point to the other fellow's relatives.</span> <span id="s1153">Now, I didn't know if I cou-- I don’t know if -- I didn’t want to be a Jewish cop.</span> <span id="s1154">I could have been but I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s1155">I was approached.</span> <span id="s1156">I didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1157">I, I felt that this is just cruel and inhuman.</span> <span id="s1158">I'd rather get killed myself than, than point to someone else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q.</span> <span id="s1160">How did people get chosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A. Appearance, age, state of health, and luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q. Connections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A. Just -- it was a matter of luck, that you were in the right place at the right time, because I know there were times when someone escaped from Janowska, and we knew about it.</span> <span id="s1164">Every 10th guy they gave the, the, the commander, the ch-- head, used to give for him -- for, for, for the escapees to come back.</span> <span id="s1165">If th-- if they didn't come back, every 10th guy was shot.</span> <span id="s1166">They just walked and counted: “10.”</span> <span id="s1167">[Makes shooting sound] Bullet to the head, and that's it.</span> <span id="s1168">And no one was allowed to move or anything else.</span> <span id="s1169">Now, how did they pick the 10?</span> <span id="s1170">It was nothing but luck.</span> <span id="s1171">And if the men didn’t -- if the men did come back, it were -- there were, there were cases if the men did come back, they still did the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">05:26:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q. Actually, what I was asking was, you were talking about the police and how people got selected to, to be a member of the Jewish police or of the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A.</span> <span id="s1175">The Judenrat is the activists.</span> <span id="s1176">The first Judenrat was hung.</span> <span id="s1177">The first Judenrat of Lvov -- I remember going out to work, coming back, and there were 12 people hanging right across the main gate so everybody could look and see.</span> <span id="s1178">Not shot, but hanging.</span> <span id="s1179">So you didn't look, so what?</span> <span id="s1180">But they were still there.</span> <span id="s1181">Why?</span> <span id="s1182">Because of the whimsy of the, of the German occupation, whoever he was that ordered them.</span> <span id="s1183">There was no consensus.</span> <span id="s1184">There was no such a thing as a discussion or due process or law or anything.</span> <span id="s1185">The German, the command-- the commandant, he was the law.</span> <span id="s1186">He was the absolute king over life and death, the absolute power if you live or you die.</span> <span id="s1187">There was no, no discussion.</span> <span id="s1188">In fact, if you said anything, that was -- if you talk against, it was enough to be shot or be beaten.</span> <span id="s1189">The tortures were unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1190">The kind of tortures they thought of were beyond description.</span> <span id="s1191">There is -- you think of a way, and they did it worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">06:00:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">[Brief technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q. Ok, so I don’t know; we were talking about the ghetto, maybe you want to continue there.</span> <span id="s1195">Give me a few -- maybe some more details of, of what life was like in the Lvov ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A. Life in Lvov ghetto was very, very I gu-- it’s difficult.</span> <span id="s1197">It's difficult to describe because one day was just like another.</span> <span id="s1198">When there was no Aktion, we did our job.</span> <span id="s1199">Nobody bothered us.</span> <span id="s1200">When there were Aktions, it was just like, like hell opened up.</span> <span id="s1201">I remember at one time we were -- one Aktion, which was completely by surprise.</span> <span id="s1202">We went to work.</span> <span id="s1203">While we were at work, they made an Aktion in the ghetto itself.</span> <span id="s1204">It -- an Aktion, I mean when they, when they took a thousand people, that meant no-- nothing.</span> <span id="s1205">I think, when I describe an Aktion is five, 10,000 people had to, had to be exported, liquidated, or killed.</span> <span id="s1206">They -- we got stuck in a place where they were growing -- where a, a family was growing nothing but beets, white -- not red beets for borscht -- but white beets, because you can make sugar out of white beets.</span> <span id="s1207">And for three days we had nothing but white beets.</span> <span id="s1208">We ate white beets.</span> <span id="s1209">We cooked them.</span> <span id="s1210">We, we, we, we simmered them.</span> <span id="s1211">We did all kinds of possi-- all kinds of things because we were afraid to get out.</span> <span id="s1212">That was the only thing that sustained us.</span> <span id="s1213">We weren’t able -- because if you were, if you were caught during the Aktion, sometimes even the best favors wouldn't save you.</span> <span id="s1214">They numbered the quota, the order of to liquidate, to, to, to solve the Jewish problem, was higher than the, the papers that would save you, the documents that would save you.</span> <span id="s1215">That had priority over everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">06:03:38</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q. Were these Aktions regular?</span> <span id="s1218">Were they often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A.</span> <span id="s1220">They were quite often.</span> <span id="s1221">They were quite often.</span> <span id="s1222">They were usually, or many times, they were preceded by a Goebbels speech, especially an inflammatory Goebbels speech, which you could listen to on a, on a, on, on radio, on crystal radio.</span> <span id="s1223">I could listen to him.</span> <span id="s1224">It's not I that understood; to me, it sounded like a dog barking.</span> <span id="s1225">I couldn't understand everything, but that Hasidishe family, they were quite fluent in German.</span> <span id="s1226">That was in, in -- otherwise, I had -- we -- in, in the ghetto, many people had crystal sets.</span> <span id="s1227">We listened to that, to that, to those things and we sort of told each other.</span> <span id="s1228">Then there were local newspapers that used to print Goebbels speech -- speeches, and so on.</span> <span id="s1229">There was Polish papers; of course, they printed what they wanted to be printed.</span> <span id="s1230">But that was one -- oh, Hitler's speech.</span> <span id="s1231">That was usually at the time when all -- we knew, we knew to expect something right after it.</span> <span id="s1232">Many times we were told by the, by the police, by the Jewish police, “Expect something.”</span> <span id="s1233">They were quite regular, because to get from 150 to 20 or 15 when I left the ghetto, that's a lot -- 135, 130,000 people.</span> <span id="s1234">That's a lot of people to move.</span> <span id="s1235">And they were able to do it without actually exterminating, killing too many of them locally.</span> <span id="s1236">There were all trains going out.</span> <span id="s1237">The -- Janowska was more or less -- more of a labor camp than an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1238">It had no ovens.</span> <span id="s1239">It had no, no, no way how to dispose of bodies except for burying them, because the major problem of the, of Germans was -- is how to dispose of so many bodies, so they were actually burning them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q. Were there any semblances of normal life in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1241">Were -- was there any cultural activities, any political, any religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A.</span> <span id="s1243">If there were religious activities, they would have been strictly self-contained.</span> <span id="s1244">They were not condoned, and they were not -- whatever you did, you could do whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s1245">While there was no Aktion, you could do anything you wanted.</span> <span id="s1246">You could live -- it's not a normal life, but you could live a life basically without fear.</span> <span id="s1247">Germans -- the Germans had free access to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1248">If they needed to unload something or do something, they could come in with a truck and say, “You, you, you and you -- raus!</span> <span id="s1249">Come on with us.”</span> <span id="s1250">That's it.</span> <span id="s1251">Sometimes people used to come back, and sometimes they didn't.</span> <span id="s1252">It was an everyday occurrence.</span> <span id="s1253">But as far as family life, there was no such a thing as a family provider.</span> <span id="s1254">Every -- everybody had to do something.</span> <span id="s1255">The basic elements of family life didn't exist.</span> <span id="s1256">There were no schools.</span> <span id="s1257">There was no religious life as such.</span> <span id="s1258">There was no breadwinner.</span> <span id="s1259">Whatever you co-- whatever every member of any family could get, it was assembled together.</span> <span id="s1260">And if you were nice enough, you would take in some strangers maybe to make a larger group out of it, if the stranger was willing to share his findings with you.</span> <span id="s1261">It wasn't communal because what was mine was mine, was not yours.</span> <span id="s1262">Don't touch my things.</span> <span id="s1263">It was sort of a code of honor, because when you went to work and you left your things there, other people could take it and disappear with it.</span> <span id="s1264">They did not, not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">06:08:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q. Was your mother working in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A. No, my mother was in the ghetto very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q.</span> <span id="s1269">What about clan-- clandestine activities?</span> <span id="s1270">I know that they wouldn’t -- the authorities wouldn't condone religious or, or cultural activities, but did people form groups?</span> <span id="s1271">Did young people date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A. I was a young person, and I didn't date anybody.</span> <span id="s1273">I was just trying to survive, trying to survive.</span> <span id="s1274">And how quickly you learn how to sa-- save your energy, how quickly you learn not to volunteer for anything.</span> <span id="s1275">If you have to do it, you do it.</span> <span id="s1276">Don't volunteer, because you never know, you never know what -- let, let it be your fate.</span> <span id="s1277">If you volunteer, you sort of supersede your fate.</span> <span id="s1278">Try not to get hurt because if you get hurt, your chances for survival are much, much smaller.</span> <span id="s1279">Don't get injured.</span> <span id="s1280">I had a time where a big piece of cast iron fell on my big toe and crushed the cartilage, the joint cartilage.</span> <span id="s1281">I, I had troubles until it healed because I -- it had to heal properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q. Were there doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A.</span> <span id="s1284">What doctors?</span> <span id="s1285">If there were doctors, there were no medications.</span> <span id="s1286">Maybe there were doctors, I didn't know of any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q. Were there secret schools or publications?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A. Not that I -- not that I know of.</span> <span id="s1289">Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s1290">Some public -- I saw some publications which basically disseminated news.</span> <span id="s1291">They were more or less publications which were printed outside the ghetto and smuggled into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1292">Like the Armia Krajowa used to have publications which you could find in the ghetto, but they were not for the Jews and they were not by the Jews, and they didn't tell the truth about the Jews, either.</span> <span id="s1293">They were there; it was mostly but mostly word of mouth.</span> <span id="s1294">Cultural life; I haven’t see any.</span> <span id="s1295">Maybe there was; I didn't see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q.</span> <span id="s1297">What about welfare organizations?</span> <span id="s1298">Did the Judenrat set up any feeding centers, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">06:11:12</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A.</span> <span id="s1301">There were some.</span> <span id="s1302">There were some because I know.</span> <span id="s1303">remember.</span> <span id="s1304">The Germans: first, they went after the old; they went after the sick; and they went after the young.</span> <span id="s1305">Now, the old you cannot hide.</span> <span id="s1306">The young you cannot hide.</span> <span id="s1307">But the sick, you can, because if you're younger and sick, or you don't look so good or you don't feel so well, you can try to cure yourself and hide.</span> <span id="s1308">I remember seeing Aktions where people were carried out on stretchers and then they were made, sort of, get up and stand up and they couldn't.</span> <span id="s1309">They were shot right on the spot, right there, and bodies were left.</span> <span id="s1310">But if you came two or three days after it, the -- with the help of the police and with the help of the younger ones, they used to -- those bodies used to had to be removed because otherwise there would have been major epidemics.</span> <span id="s1311">Typhoid was a major sickness because typhoid is spread by, by lice, ha-- hair lice.</span> <span id="s1312">I didn’t have, I didn’t -- I never had typhoid, but my uncle did.</span> <span id="s1313">He survived it.</span> <span id="s1314">But it's not that anyone went to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1315">I think he spoke to some doctor that he told him what to do and not what to do.</span> <span id="s1316">But what's the difference?</span> <span id="s1317">You couldn't do -- you had to do what you could do.</span> <span id="s1318">I mean, if he told him, “You have a 105 fever, don't go to work.”</span> <span id="s1319">He couldn't do it anyway because he couldn't go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q. Was there a lot of sickness?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A.</span> <span id="s1322">There was.</span> <span id="s1323">Typhoid was prevalent.</span> <span id="s1324">There was a lot of it.</span> <span id="s1325">But then again, you sort of develop resistance toward things that normally affect you.</span> <span id="s1326">I, honestly, I don't remember having a cold.</span> <span id="s1327">I don't remember having a stomach ache or, or, or, or things that are -- that normal grip -- normal sicknesses that you get.</span> <span id="s1328">You ju-- I don't remember having it.</span> <span id="s1329">Or maybe I had it and I ignored it, because I couldn't afford to show that I had it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q. I have images of other ghettos where they said people were falling on the street, it was -- was Lvov like this?</span> <span id="s1331">People were dying everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">06:14:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A. People were dying everywhere, but you didn't look at it.</span> <span id="s1334">You got used to it and you paid no attention to it.</span> <span id="s1335">First of all, in what I was doing, I was working.</span> <span id="s1336">I was out of the ghetto most of the day, and when I was inside the ghetto, I was in my living quarters trying to do things, help something.</span> <span id="s1337">I didn't walk around the ghetto looking for things or visiting people or even talking to people.</span> <span id="s1338">They wanted me, they, they knew where to find me.</span> <span id="s1339">I tried to live and be sort of independent.</span> <span id="s1340">I was friendly with these people that provided me with these -- with the documents that -- but we all lived together.</span> <span id="s1341">We lived in the same general area.</span> <span id="s1342">All of us sort of being young -- and young, when I say young, I don't think anyone at that, at that time was over 40 or 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q.</span> <span id="s1344">You said that when the Germans came in, they immediately disposed of the Polish intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s1345">Did they do that with the Jews also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A.</span> <span id="s1347">There was -- what do you mean by Jewish intelligentsia?</span> <span id="s1348">.</span> <span id="s1349">Jewish intelligentsia, they didn’t have to wh-- Jewish intelligentsia, as such, didn't exist to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1350">They knew the Jews.</span> <span id="s1351">The Poles, they were not going to kill.</span> <span id="s1352">They were going to make them sort of like what you would call second class citizens or second class -- citizens is the wrong word.</span> <span id="s1353">Second class inhabitants of the land.</span> <span id="s1354">That's why they took their leaders, the intelligentsia, and they tried to kill them.</span> <span id="s1355">They killed the majority of them.</span> <span id="s1356">They killed a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1357">The Jews were destined to be killed anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q.</span> <span id="s1359">But you said that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: They did the same to Je-- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: They took the sick, and they took the old, and they took the young first.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A.</span> <span id="s1363">They took the intelligentsia also.</span> <span id="s1364">They came with lists.</span> <span id="s1365">They had names of Jews.</span> <span id="s1366">They had names of Jews who had to be taken.</span> <span id="s1367">First they took them -- first they took, on the very beginning, a very large group as hostages, and I remember members of the Judenrat or members of the Jewish government, what you would call, walking around from place to place trying to collect gold coins, gold rings, and so on, because there was a quota how much they had to, to give the Germans to save the lives of the group of what you would call the intelligentsia, the intellectuals; people that were worth taking hostage because they would take hostages from the street.</span> <span id="s1368">Who would care to pay for their liberation?</span> <span id="s1369">But they were all known people, leaders.</span> <span id="s1370">They collected the things, and, and those people never came back.</span> <span id="s1371">They were, they were -- in fact, because they were the intelligentsia, they were killed earlier than the other people.</span> <span id="s1372">And when I say the old and the young, the age criterium was not necessarily the determining point, because they didn't ask you how old you are, it was how old you look that counted.</span> <span id="s1373">Because you could have been old and looked young and you got away with it.</span> <span id="s1374">But if you were young, younger, and physically decrepit and looked old and so on, that was enough to ge-- to -- for, for them to arrest you or, or, or send you for extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">06:18:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q.</span> <span id="s1377">What about the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A. I had nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s1379">I saw one Judenrat hung.</span> <span id="s1380">I know that they were there.</span> <span id="s1381">I know that they were the necessary evil.</span> <span id="s1382">I know that they have sort of transmitted the German orders, and they were a, a, a pawn or -- in, in Germans’ hands.</span> <span id="s1383">If they didn't do it, they would have been killed and somebody else would have been in their -- put in their place.</span> <span id="s1384">That was the, the, the German policy of sort of having clean hands.</span> <span id="s1385">“I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s1386">I just, I just sa-- I just ” They didn't dirty their white gloves.</span> <span id="s1387">They just gave the orders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q. Was there a lot of industry in Lvov?</span> <span id="s1389">Were there -- I know the work that you did, but were there a number of other factories or did they take people out to places to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A.</span> <span id="s1391">There wasn't much in the -- Lvov was not an industrial town.</span> <span id="s1392">Lvov was more of an intellectual town prior to the war.</span> <span id="s1393">Remember, Lvov during the Austria -- Austra-Hungarian empire, where King Franz Joseph was in existence, was the capital of Galicia.</span> <span id="s1394">It was the second, I would call “main city,” after Vienna, Vienna and Prague.</span> <span id="s1395">It was an, intellectual -- town of intellectuals where you had a medical college, medical school; a university, full university, a Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s1396">I mean, in one town of 150,000, 200,000 -- that's a lot.</span> <span id="s1397">The industry, the -- it was not the main point of Lvov.</span> <span id="s1398">So when they went after the intellectuals, they wanted to destroy the, the, the Polish spirit as well, prior to getting to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1399">Germans were quite methodical, and they knew they were going to get the Jews anyway, and it was easier for the Poles to go underground than for, than for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1400">Because after all, the 30 million population of Poles, it was more difficult to control than the few Jews that were -- or the Jews that were scattered in towns only, because Poles were mostly agricultural.</span> <span id="s1401">Jews were living in towns.</span> <span id="s1402">They would be the, the, the money changing -- the money makers, the, the, the storekeepers and controlling quite a bit of industry in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">06:21:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q.</span> <span id="s1405">So after liberation, I th-- you went back to school, and then you -- I think you said you went on to Lodz, or you wanted to.</span> <span id="s1406">But meanwhile, had you talked to anybody from Lida?</span> <span id="s1407">Did you know about the family you had left there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A.</span> <span id="s1409">When -- two weeks after liberation -- really, two weeks after liberation -- I bumped in the -- on the free market, where you were selling and buying things, I bumped into a guy my age from Lida who he and his father -- Lida had a big cafe called “The Amerikanka” -- the American cafe.</span> <span id="s1410">He and his father used to provide the entertainment.</span> <span id="s1411">He played the piano and the accordion and -- in that cafe.</span> <span id="s1412">I met him.</span> <span id="s1413">He was in a Russian uniform.</span> <span id="s1414">He was like the -- in the Russian US-- USO.</span> <span id="s1415">He was entertaining the troops, and I had a long talk with him.</span> <span id="s1416">He said he just came from the Bela-- Belarussian front.</span> <span id="s1417">He was in Lida.</span> <span id="s1418">He said, “There's absolutely nobody left.”</span> <span id="s1419">Downtown Lida was completely destroyed and it doesn't exist.</span> <span id="s1420">There was a main artill-- artillery duel between the Russians and the Germans, and the area where we lived was wiped out completely.</span> <span id="s1421">It absolutely doesn't exist.</span> <span id="s1422">Some of my old friends survived.</span> <span id="s1423">They were with the Russian partisans, and they were with the Bielski’s Brigade.</span> <span id="s1424">I don't know if you heard of the Bielski’s Brigade.</span> <span id="s1425">I met the Bielskis here.</span> <span id="s1426">I was quite friendly with Tev-- Tuvia and his brother and all that.</span> <span id="s1427">They survived through them and with them, but there is absolutely nothing in Lida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: What about your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: My grandparents perished, he told me that.</span> <span id="s1430">My uncle died in Lvov, but my aunt who married the lawyer-accountant that worked for my grandfather, that had this six year old granddaughter -- they encountered a major tragedy, because during the ghetto liquidation, in May of '43, him being an accountant and a lawyer and all that, and he spoke German, he sort of spoke to a German guy and he trusted him that he will sort of allow them to survive that particular Aktion that was to liquidate the Lida ghetto.</span> <span id="s1431">And he would show this German where my family hid their money and their treasures.</span> <span id="s1432">They buried it in a certain spot, which I knew where it was.</span> <span id="s1433">My mother told me and my mother knew about it because her parents, my grandparents, told her.</span> <span id="s1434">It wouldn't have made any sense now because that building is no-- not in existence any more.</span> <span id="s1435">It's destroyed.</span> <span id="s1436">But anyway, he took the German guy there.</span> <span id="s1437">The German was going to let him and my aunt and the little girl go.</span> <span id="s1438">Instead of it, the Nazis shot both of them right on the spot, dead.</span> <span id="s1439">The little girl, Gila, she was wounded, and she ran away.</span> <span id="s1440">And by -- on by the account of eye witness, she was killed a few days later.</span> <span id="s1441">But they were killed right on the spot, and the German got a medal for getting the, the, the -- that thing and for killing the two Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">06:26:35 There was no sense for me to go to Lida then, and in fact, friends of mine -- I have videos, video tapes, from visits to Lida by my friends that went.</span> <span id="s1443">They put up monuments there in memory.</span> <span id="s1444">But again, my grandparents were not killed in Lida.</span> <span id="s1445">They were killed in a little town outside of Lida.</span> <span id="s1446">I chose not to go because there was nothing that I would recognize in there.</span> <span id="s1447">There was nothing that I will see that will remind me.</span> <span id="s1448">In fact, where the cemetery used to be there are now apartment houses.</span> <span id="s1449">People live on top of graves without knowing it.</span> <span id="s1450">The Russians pu-- decided to put up apartment houses in there because the Germans have removed all the tombstones.</span> <span id="s1451">And it's quite possible that the, the, the, the Russians didn't even know it was a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1452">There were three Jewish families left in Lida, which probably don't exist now.</span> <span id="s1453">They probably pa-- they probably died by now because the first contact with Lida was through another cousin who survived with the French resistance in France.</span> <span id="s1454">He was a doctor in Paris.</span> <span id="s1455">He was one of the Gold’s assistants.</span> <span id="s1456">He was a psy-- psychiatrist invited on a -- to visit a scientific conference in Moscow.</span> <span id="s1457">From Moscow, he went to Vilna, and then he was able to, to talk someone in -- into allowing him -- getting a car to go to Lida.</span> <span id="s1458">That was in '78, and he wrote his sister -- who survived the war also; and she died in Bo-- Boston -- a letter describing Lida.</span> <span id="s1459">And seeing that -- and reading that and seeing that, I said there was no sense in going to Lida, so I never went there, and I'm not sorry.</span> <span id="s1460">We ended up in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q.</span> <span id="s1462">You and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A. My mother with -- I met some people in there.</span> <span id="s1464">And from Lodz we decided to get out from Poland altogether.</span> <span id="s1465">There was a choice to go to, to displaced person camps in Italy or in Germany.</span> <span id="s1466">The Italian displaced persons camps -- I chose to go to Italy because I had a better chance to pursue my education.</span> <span id="s1467">See, I went -- I already had two years of engineering behind me, documented with documents.</span> <span id="s1468">The only problem -- the only thing I didn't realize, I didn't have the original of my high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1469">I didn't realize how important that document is in Italy.</span> <span id="s1470">We, we traveled using the underground railroad.</span> <span id="s1471">From Lodz, we ended up in Cremona.</span> <span id="s1472">We crossed several borders, in fact, I remember one -- crossing on border to -- from Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1473">We had to be somebody, so we were documented as Greek Jews returning to go -- from German concentration camps returning to Greece.</span> <span id="s1474">So the Czech guards said to us, “Why don't you say something to us in Greek?”</span> <span id="s1475">Nobody knew Greek so we started to talk, “’ma neeshtanah ha-laylah ha-zeh…” We were asking the four questions.</span> <span id="s1476">To them, Hebrew was Greek.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: That’s a good story.</span> <span id="s1478">We need to put in another tape.</span> <span id="s1479">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">07:01:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A.</span> <span id="s1483">You are rolling now?</span> <span id="s1484">My uncle, my mother's younger brother, who is 90 now, he went -- he was one of the original Halutzim that believed in Palestine in 1926.</span> <span id="s1485">He left Poland in 1926.</span> <span id="s1486">He was barely 20 years old, 21, and my grandmother got a stroke at that time because of it.</span> <span id="s1487">He came back, stood for a, for a couple of months, and he went back in '28.</span> <span id="s1488">He married my aunt.</span> <span id="s1489">She came on a visit to Palestine in 1936, and in order to go on a visit you had to buy a round-trip ticket to assure that you're coming back, but when she married him, she was able to remain there.</span> <span id="s1490">So, they still have their return part of the trip.</span> <span id="s1491">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q. Tell me, tell me about your passage to Italy.</span> <span id="s1493">What, what was the underground railroad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A. No.</span> <span id="s1495">I want to tell you about the uncle.</span> <span id="s1496">He told us he was in the British Brigade, and while we were in Lvov, he sent us a letter which came to us from Marseilles: to be ready to go to Odessa because his job is to repatriate Russian prisoners of war, to repatriate the…prisoners of war, so if we can make Odessa he'll smuggle us on a ship for us to go with him back, get out of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1497">That part didn't work out.</span> <span id="s1498">But when we left, when in -- when we were in Lodz, the Zionist organizations, the -- it didn't make basically any difference if you were the left side of the Zionist, which were the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, or the right side which was the Betar the --; all of them worked together, I think, when it came to smuggling Jews out of Poland with this underground railroad.</span> <span id="s1499">The, the underground railroad used to put Jews into small groups, provided them with false papers, documents -- forged documents, telling them where they were going.</span> <span id="s1500">Like we were the Greek Jews leaving Po-- leaving a concentration camp from somewhere, going to Greece because we were basically traveling south.</span> <span id="s1501">But as soon as we crossed into Cz-- Czechoslovakia, we got different papers, and part of us went in the direction of Austria, into Munich, that had a number of displaced persons; or through Austria, across the Alps into Verona -- Cremona and Verona, into Italy.</span> <span id="s1502">That's where we went.</span> <span id="s1503">We ended up in Cremona in a displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s1504">My mother got lost because she spoke English, so she got off the train and she went to talk to a, to an American convoy coming and she ended up in Munich, and I had to go to find her in Munich.</span> <span id="s1505">I found her.</span> <span id="s1506">So I spent a nice weekend in Innsbruck and Salzbrook (ph) -- Salzburg, not Salz--!</span> <span id="s1507">And came back to my group in, in Italy, and we ended up in a displaced persons camp in Cremona.</span> <span id="s1508">And then, from there, through other difficulties, we ended up actually in a displacement camp -- displaced persons camp in Rome, in Cinecitta.</span> <span id="s1509">Cinecitta is the Hollywood of Italy, where they made movies, but the UNRRA requisitioned it and we were, we were there for a while and then we left them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">07:05:35 My mother got herself some sort of a job, and I tried to enroll at the U-- University of Rome, because Rome has no Polytechnic Institute, and they wouldn't accept me because in spite of the fact that I had papers showing them that I have actually completed two years of Polytechnic Institute, in order to start college in Italy, you have to have the original of the high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1511">I didn't have it, and there was not way for me how to get it.</span> <span id="s1512">L-- I couldn't get it from Lvov because I left there.</span> <span id="s1513">So, I found someone from my hometown in Lida, who prior to -- before the war, because he was a Jew, he could not enter any university in Poland, he started in Pisa, in Italy.</span> <span id="s1514">He needed transcripts from Pisa, so I, I sort of got a second thought and I said, “I'll get you your Pisa transcripts,” I was in Italy at the time, “it’s no problem, but help me.</span> <span id="s1515">Try, try for me, try -- how can I get something that resem-- resembles the matura.”</span> <span id="s1516">That’s high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1517">I got him his papers, and he found my last high school sp -- high school principal.</span> <span id="s1518">So I didn't know if he’ll would remember me.</span> <span id="s1519">I took a po-- I took a picture, I took a picture of myself, and I sent it to him.</span> <span id="s1520">The last graduating high school class was only 35 or 39; It was a relatively small class.</span> <span id="s1521">He did remember me.</span> <span id="s1522">He gave me a sworn statement from Ministry of Education with grades on it, which looked more official th-- than the actual high school diploma.</span> <span id="s1523">I took it back to the University of Rome, but by that time, they were going to accept me -- but by that time the American Joint Distribution Committee organized a student home in Turin, Italy.</span> <span id="s1524">The student home meant that they hired -- they rented a big villa, they hired an administrator, and Jewish, Jewish young men and women who were willing to attend college, enroll -- and in Turin they had the University of Turin, which had liberal arts, had a medical school, and had a Polytechnic Institute -- not like Rome.</span> <span id="s1525">Could live in that student home.</span> <span id="s1526">They would get a subsidy from the AJDC.</span> <span id="s1527">They would get their UNRRA packages into a central pool, tuition would be paid by the AJDC as long as you went to school and passed a minimum of grades.</span> <span id="s1528">They -- that home was existence for, oh, I was there from '46 to '48.</span> <span id="s1529">I was there a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">07:09:10</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q.</span> <span id="s1532">Did you mother go to Turin with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A. No, my mother ha-- my mother used her papers to go back to the United States.</span> <span id="s1534">Then she found out that her husband passed away, in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1535">And the government would not honor the reentry permit, but she had some friends in here -- because it had an expiration date.</span> <span id="s1536">The expiration date was just before the war started, so they said, “Why didn't you come before the war started?”</span> <span id="s1537">But the difference was like something like one or two weeks.</span> <span id="s1538">She says, “I didn't have time to get in touch with the American counsel in Warsaw.”</span> <span id="s1539">I mean, there was already tension and friction going -- things were going on.</span> <span id="s1540">Anyway, she found friends in here that sent her an affidavit, and she used the affidavit, plus those papers, and she came to the States.</span> <span id="s1541">My mother went to the States in '46, early in 1946.</span> <span id="s1542">And I lived in Rome for a while yet.</span> <span id="s1543">I must have lived in Rome three or four months after she left.</span> <span id="s1544">And then I -- when this Jewish home, this student home, was formed, I was one of the first ones to move in there.</span> <span id="s1545">And there were Jewish boys from Yugoslavia, from Hungary, from Poland, from many, many -- from Czechoslovakia, from many countries.</span> <span id="s1546">They are -- in fact, we met once, oh, about 10 years ago, made a reunion.</span> <span id="s1547">You wi-- you will find several doctors, engineers, and architects with the Italian degrees which lived in that Case dello Studente in Turin.</span> <span id="s1548">I had a friend -- I still have him.</span> <span id="s1549">I have a friend who was very aggressive, and he said, “Let me get in touch with the B’nai B’rith Hillel foundation.</span> <span id="s1550">Maybe they'll sponsor me on -- to an American University.”</span> <span id="s1551">And he kept writing to Chicago, to the Hillel foundation in Chicago, and they found for him -- they found a place for him at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s1552">He came here in -- late in '47, to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</span> <span id="s1553">Once he started, I thought, all right, why shouldn't I try the same thing?</span> <span id="s1554">So, I started with -- the young lady's name was Marilyn Applebaum, a very nice young lady.</span> <span id="s1555">I wrote her several letters with my very, very poor English, using a voca -- a dictionary.</span> <span id="s1556">She found a place for me at the University of Illinois, and I got a scholarship from the Hillel foundation at the University, at the University of Illinois.</span> <span id="s1557">A Jewish fraternity, Tau Delta Phi, was going to sponsor me, give me room and board.</span> <span id="s1558">They were paying tuition.</span> <span id="s1559">My mother lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1560">She had a job.</span> <span id="s1561">She was working.</span> <span id="s1562">I was able to get a visa in February of 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">07:08:10 But then again, in order to come here on a scholarship, you have to have a place where you go after you finish school.</span> <span id="s1564">You ca-- you don't come here to stay.</span> <span id="s1565">I didn't have a place where to go.</span> <span id="s1566">Italy wouldn't accept me.</span> <span id="s1567">I was there, but they wouldn't accept me back once I left.</span> <span id="s1568">I certainly wouldn't go back to Poland because that was behind the Iron Curtain.</span> <span id="s1569">I had no place where to go, so AJDC got me a visa to Uruguay or Paraguay, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1570">One of the -- these countries, one of these South American countries.</span> <span id="s1571">So I promised them that I’m going to go back after I finished engineering.</span> <span id="s1572">I came here, I was a upper junior, after the first year -- after I finished my junior year, I had nothing but top grades.</span> <span id="s1573">The university gave me a scholarship for foreign students.</span> <span id="s1574">I gave back Hillel their scholarship.</span> <span id="s1575">I said, “Give it to someone else.”</span> <span id="s1576">I do-- I said, “I can't use two.</span> <span id="s1577">I don't need it.”</span> <span id="s1578">I was still living in the same frat house, living in the frat-house.</span> <span id="s1579">I had my room and board, they were free.</span> <span id="s1580">But I didn't need the tuition thing.</span> <span id="s1581">When I finished my -- I got my bachelor's degree.</span> <span id="s1582">The dean of foreign students calls me and says, “You know that Chicago sent me a letter; they are going to deport you.</span> <span id="s1583">You're finished.</span> <span id="s1584">You finished your schooling, they want to deport you.”</span> <span id="s1585">I said to him, “Supposed I go for graduate work?”</span> <span id="s1586">See, engineers in '49 were a dime a dozen, because all the G.I.s were coming out of school on -- under the G.I. bill.</span> <span id="s1587">So, I, I went for a, for a masters, and in the meantime, the Truman's law they passed that anyone who is in the States can stay here.</span> <span id="s1588">I think it was 1949 that they passed the Truman, Truman im-- immigration act, and I had no more problems.</span> <span id="s1589">That's how was I -- I was, I was able to remain here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">07:15:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q.</span> <span id="s1592">What year did you go -- I mean, when exactly did you go from Lodz to Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A. From Lodz to Italy, that was 1945.</span> <span id="s1594">It took us about, close to -- it took us several weeks to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q. Do you remember what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A.</span> <span id="s1597">It was between August -- between August and September, because it still nice and warm.</span> <span id="s1598">We have traveled from one place to another.</span> <span id="s1599">We traveled from -- we stopped in Kraków for a day, for example, and I saw that Hasidishe family.</span> <span id="s1600">They were from -- they were in Kraków that we saved together at that time.</span> <span id="s1601">Then we were in Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1602">We were in Prague.</span> <span id="s1603">We were in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1604">We were in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1605">I was in Munich for a short time.</span> <span id="s1606">And so the whole travel probably took 10 days, two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q.</span> <span id="s1608">How long were you in this DP camp in northern Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A. Just a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Was that ok?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Because -- not that long because we went to, we went to Rome.</span> <span id="s1612">We decided that instead of being in Cremona and being buried out there doing nothing, we decided to go to, to Rome where something is happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">[Technical interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q. Well, I think what I was asking you about was the DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: The, the DP camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A. See, I could have been -- all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: It’s ok.</span> <span id="s1619">Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: I could have been, more or less I knew -- know a lot of people that ended up in a German DP camp, but not in a DP camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s1621">But even now the sound of German language affects me, sort of gives me the, the creeps.</span> <span id="s1622">I don't like it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: -- in spite, in spite of the fact that I spent a few good weeks -- a few nice weeks in Switzerland, where they speak mostly German.</span> <span id="s1625">It didn't bother me there, but sort of I, I, I dislike them.</span> <span id="s1626">I have a friend of mine, that we grew up together that stayed, himself, in the partisans, who actually still lives in Munich, and I can't understand how he can do it.</span> <span id="s1627">Or how he did it until now.</span> <span id="s1628">He said, “I only lived there.</span> <span id="s1629">I only made my money here.</span> <span id="s1630">I traveled all over the world.”</span> <span id="s1631">I said, “Fine, but I, I can't stand the sound of that -- the language, not just the people.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">07:18:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q.</span> <span id="s1634">What kind of an adjustment was it to come to the United States?</span> <span id="s1635">Do you remember your first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A. I -- when I came to the United States, one of the conditions that the American council that gave me the visa gave me is that I must go immediately to school, because it was February 18, and school semester started the beginning of February.</span> <span id="s1637">So, if you're going to school, you must go to school immediately.</span> <span id="s1638">I promised that I will do it, so when I came to the La Guardia airport, I had to take a plane, because on a boat it would have taken too long.</span> <span id="s1639">The AJDC paid for my flight.</span> <span id="s1640">I came TWA on a Friday night, Friday -- late Friday afternoon, and the immigration officer refused to allow me to disembark.</span> <span id="s1641">He said, “There are so many people that come here on funny visas.</span> <span id="s1642">Look at these guys,” he says, “they are rabbinical students.</span> <span id="s1643">Do you think they came here to, to, to go to a rabbinical school?</span> <span id="s1644">They'll marry and they'll stay here.”</span> <span id="s1645">He says, “We have to check out your visa.</span> <span id="s1646">University of Illinois?</span> <span id="s1647">And you speak poor English?</span> <span id="s1648">I mean, it doesn't make sense.”</span> <span id="s1649">They put me -- they took me to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1650">Ellis Island was still in existence.</span> <span id="s1651">And the immigration officer said to me, “You're the only one I'm taking to Ellis Island.</span> <span id="s1652">You're going by taxi.”</span> <span id="s1653">He said, “Let me show you New York.</span> <span id="s1654">This might be the only time you're going to be here.”</span> <span id="s1655">So fine.</span> <span id="s1656">So, one of the main attractions he showed me in New York was the Fulton Fish Market.</span> <span id="s1657">That's one thing I remember, especially the smell.</span> <span id="s1658">It is very strange; I came to Ellis Island Friday night.</span> <span id="s1659">I spent on Ellis Island Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s1660">Monday morning I was called, and they apologized to me for keeping me there.</span> <span id="s1661">I was given a pass.</span> <span id="s1662">I came back to mainland.</span> <span id="s1663">I don't remember where I slept.</span> <span id="s1664">I don't remember what I ate.</span> <span id="s1665">I don't remember what I did.</span> <span id="s1666">Those two days in -- on no man's land because I have left Italy on the 15th -- or actually on the 14th.</span> <span id="s1667">I came here on the se-- on the 15th.</span> <span id="s1668">The 16th and the 17th, Saturday and Sunday, I was nowhere.</span> <span id="s1669">The -- my official entry to the United States is the 18th.</span> <span id="s1670">I was nowhere these two days.</span> <span id="s1671">They don't appear anywhere, and I don't remember what I did then, how I -- what I actually did on Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">07:21:38</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q. Were there barracks there or -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A. No, I was on Ellis Island now.</span> <span id="s1675">I went to visit, but I don't remember physically what I did.</span> <span id="s1676">My memory is blank for some reason.</span> <span id="s1677">I don't know why, my own memory.</span> <span id="s1678">I spent another week in New York.</span> <span id="s1679">I went to, to Illinois, and I went to school.</span> <span id="s1680">And I -- because I was thrown into a fraternity of boys -- what were there, 40 or 50 American Jewish boys that spoke English only, that knew very little about a Holocaust, that -- they didn't know a single foreign language that I could converse with them.</span> <span id="s1681">I was actually forced to learn -- to, to, to make -- to take a crash course of English.</span> <span id="s1682">I forced myself.</span> <span id="s1683">I used to listen to the radio day and night actually, to get used to the sound of the language, because the first thing, in order to le-- learn a foreign language, is to get used to the melody, to the sound, to know when one word ends and the other one starts.</span> <span id="s1684">Because if you don't know where the words starts and the word begins -- one ends and one starts, how can you, how can you learn the language?</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q.</span> <span id="s1686">Did they accept you well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A.</span> <span id="s1688">They accepted me very well, in spite the fact that I was a few years older than, than many of them, than the majority.</span> <span id="s1689">They were 18, 19, 20, but there were some ex-GIs that were there.</span> <span id="s1690">I was sort of on par with them, because I was already -- when I got there I was 26.</span> <span id="s1691">I was actually -- no, actually I was 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q.</span> <span id="s1693">They must have seemed young or naïve or something to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A.</span> <span id="s1695">They did, they did, but they respected me, you know, because to be a member and I was a -- I became a full pledged member of the fraternity.</span> <span id="s1696">I started as a pledge.</span> <span id="s1697">I didn't have to go through the hazing, through all that, you know, nonsense that a pledge goes through where you are pledging.</span> <span id="s1698">I don't know if you're familiar with it.</span> <span id="s1699">I didn't go through, I, I didn’t go through it to the extent that they put through other, other, other young bo -- young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">07:24:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q. Any other first impressions of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A. I remember my first trip to Chicago, for example.</span> <span id="s1703">I mean, the majority of my friends were from Chicago of course, because University of Illinois is south of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1704">Seeing Chicago, talking to their parents, talking to their grandparents, to some of the grandparents, and using the grandparents language, which sort of put me one step higher than, than, than they thought of me.</span> <span id="s1705">Sort of gave me a foot over them.</span> <span id="s1706">Then my first Thanksgiving was very impressive because I ha-- I had to stay at the University of Illinois.</span> <span id="s1707">I had to make -- I, I couldn't afford to take off a few days.</span> <span id="s1708">I had to study.</span> <span id="s1709">So I was invited -- one of the instructors invited me and, frankly, I never saw so much food in my life.</span> <span id="s1710">Then actually, that was one of the few times that we had -- I had turkey which tasted good.</span> <span id="s1711">In Poland, they didn't know how to make turkeys.</span> <span id="s1712">Turkey food was alw-- turkey meat was always dried out, so for a holiday they always used to make a goose because goose was fat and the meat was much more tender, was fa-- was fattier.</span> <span id="s1713">It wasn't as dry as the white turkey meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q.</span> <span id="s1715">Did you start being a practicing Jew again, or was that important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A. I observed all the holidays.</span> <span id="s1717">I obser-- I was married in a Jewish, traditional ceremony.</span> <span id="s1718">My wife was an American born Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1719">My son went to Hebrew School.</span> <span id="s1720">My son had Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1721">He has a lot of certificates from the East Mid Jewish Center, prior to that from the West Orange Jewish Center in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s1722">We observed all the holidays, but we used to dr-- go on Yom Kippur we went to the Temple by car because it was too far to walk.</span> <span id="s1723">I would not call myself a practicing Jew, but I still observe all the holidays and I really cherish tradition.</span> <span id="s1724">In spite of the fact that my daughter married an Italian, from whom she is getting a divorce now, she always -- after her mother passed away, she made all the major holidays, holiday dinners, and holiday celebrations, including the Rosh ha-Shana, and the Yom Kippur, and the Seders.</span> <span id="s1725">I'm exposing my grandchildren to it.</span> <span id="s1726">I don't know what's going to be with my grandson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q.</span> <span id="s1728">But it's important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">07:28:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A. It's important to me.</span> <span id="s1731">It's definitely important to me.</span> <span id="s1732">And I believe it should be important to everyone because to be a Jew you have to -- everybody should be proud of it, after what we went through because of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q. Is -- was, was there a point during the war when you resented it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A. No, I have always accepted it.</span> <span id="s1736">I have never denied it.</span> <span id="s1737">I could have been on Aryan papers, gotten false papers that I am not Jewish, which would have been very easy to detect for anyone that I was, because of circumcision.</span> <span id="s1738">I -- the thought never entered my mind.</span> <span id="s1739">I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s1740">The times that I have masqueraded for a non-Jew was for a reason, but I had to do certain things, which being a Jew would not -- would have not have allowed me to do so, like move freely in the city of Lvov, or carry certain orders or certain commands from to one place to another.</span> <span id="s1741">But I have -- I, I, I was never hiding the fact that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1742">I'm proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">08:00:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q.</span> <span id="s1745">In all this period of difficulty and hiding and I guess seeing a lot of experiences that I haven't been unfortunate enough to witness, are there certain images that have stuck with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A. Basically, there are, more or less I would call it, three incidents that, that got to me more or less more than other ones.</span> <span id="s1747">One would be the first time when we came from work, when I saw the Judenrat, the 12 hanging at the entrance to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1748">Maybe because I sort of believed on the beginning that maybe the Germans are sort of civilized.</span> <span id="s1749">That would have been the first act of murder committed directly by the Germans that I would attribute directly to the, the, the Nazi command.</span> <span id="s1750">The second one is during one of the Aktions, where on the main square we were lined up, and we were waiting to get to move to go to work.</span> <span id="s1751">That was during one of the Aktions where they were getting the old and the young.</span> <span id="s1752">And it was rather quiet, and all of a sudden there was a cry of a baby.</span> <span id="s1753">The German officer was startled because supposedly that all of the young and all of the old were already gone and there was nobody left, and he sent the -- these people to, to look.</span> <span id="s1754">And he says, “You stand here, and you don't move until I find what's going on.”</span> <span id="s1755">Now, that was translated to me because my German was not that good to understand everything he said or even to hear what he said.</span> <span id="s1756">But that was related to me by some, some other people.</span> <span id="s1757">And then they finally pulled a little girl out from, from a hole, from a hidden place, under something -- camouflage place.</span> <span id="s1758">She must have been choking or what that she cried out.</span> <span id="s1759">The two Ukrainian policeman started to toss her from one to the other, and then the German says, “Ehh.</span> <span id="s1760">That's no good.”</span> <span id="s1761">And two Germans, one grabbed her by one leg, one grabbed her by the other leg and they pulled her apart, the little girl.</span> <span id="s1762">She screamed out, and then she was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q.</span> <span id="s1764">That was in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A. No.</span> <span id="s1766">That was in ‘42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">A: That was in ’42.</span> <span id="s1769">That was in fall of '42 because the weather was still nice.</span> <span id="s1770">The third incident was when they -- our group, we were on the way to work and we were grabbed.</span> <span id="s1771">A truck was standing next to -- a truck pulled up, and the head of our group was arguing, the argument that ensued between him and the Sonderkommando head.</span> <span id="s1772">A guy with the, with a black uniform, black SS -- the, the SS man, he wanted us, and this guy said, “No.</span> <span id="s1773">They are going to work.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">08:06:10 And finally the -- our Jew convinced our SS man, our guy, that whatever we are going to do today is of such importance that he can't spare us, not even for a day.</span> <span id="s1775">He gave the -- that, that man with the truck took somebody else.</span> <span id="s1776">He got another group.</span> <span id="s1777">We found out that no one from the other group survived, and that was sort of like, like fate.</span> <span id="s1778">We were as close as it can be to, to perishing at the time.</span> <span id="s1779">But, but maybe we didn't know it at the time how close we came to, to, to being annihilated.</span> <span id="s1780">In fact, every day was like -- more or less like that.</span> <span id="s1781">You never, you never knew if you were coming back or not because they were quite capricious and they could have -- they could do anything they wanted anytime they wanted for what’s-- for no reason whatsoever, without being afraid of ever being questioned, punished, or having to respond -- being responsible.</span> <span id="s1782">It's just like if someone goes and kills a fly.</span> <span id="s1783">When do-- who does he have to respond to?</span> <span id="s1784">No one.</span> <span id="s1785">I mean it's they were dealing with non-humans, not even subhumans, but non-humans whose existence didn't mean anything to anybody.</span> <span id="s1786">After all, sooner or later you, you, you were destined to be, to be exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q. Was most of the, the abuse that you saw or experienced perpetrated by the Germans or by the local Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A. I would give it 50/50, however, whenever the Ukrainians did it, the Germans were present.</span> <span id="s1789">It's not that the Ukrainians or the Poles or whoever else did it by themselves.</span> <span id="s1790">There was always a German present, like they didn't trust them enough, and because of it, they were over-anxious, and they did it twice as, twice as good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q. Are there other episodes you want to mention?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A. No, I think that's enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: That’s enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: That’s enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q. One, one -- I guess one last question for you: what gave you whatever strength you needed to get through all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">08:09:20</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A. My mother was a very strong woman because whenever she saw a German, she used to stick that piece of paper in front of his face, “I'm an American.”</span> <span id="s1798">Not -- they never honored it, but she saved it all the way, and it could be her help, could be the fact that I just didn't feel like dying.</span> <span id="s1799">I didn't feel like giving up and, and forgetting.</span> <span id="s1800">After all, I said to myself, “I, I went to school.</span> <span id="s1801">I have a bright future of me -- I had a bright future ahead of me.</span> <span id="s1802">Why should I give up?”</span> <span id="s1803">Zest of life.</span> <span id="s1804">I never gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: And you thought you’d get through it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: There were people that were quite desperate.</span> <span id="s1807">The man who was with us, he said, “I can't take it anymore.</span> <span id="s1808">They're going to kill us, they’re going to -- ” when we were in hiding, when they were removing all that furniture and all those things from the basement.</span> <span id="s1809">He left.</span> <span id="s1810">Unfortunately he did not survive.</span> <span id="s1811">I guess my fate is such that I should remain and be able to tell it as it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q.</span> <span id="s1813">Did you have any dreams at the time or -- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A. Maybe I did or maybe I didn't.</span> <span id="s1815">I, I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1816">I'm sure I did.</span> <span id="s1817">I am sure that nightmares were there, however, we were quite exhausted every day.</span> <span id="s1818">That we were glad that we are able to sleep anywhere.</span> <span id="s1819">I did have an -- occasionally nightmares, reliving what I -- my, my past, because when I applied to the -- I don’t know what they -- for the reparations to the German government, they gave me a lump sum of money for being in the ghetto, which was just a few hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s1820">When it came to disability, I had no physical disability, fortunately for me.</span> <span id="s1821">They made me claim first physical disability, then I claimed mental disability.</span> <span id="s1822">They gave me -- I don't remember what percentage and so on.</span> <span id="s1823">Then it went to a review court in Germany, in Köln, in Cologne, Germany, and they rejected it.</span> <span id="s1824">They said if the man could go to school right after it, co-- go study in Italy, come here and get two degrees in engineering, where is his mental disability?</span> <span id="s1825">So, they rejected me.</span> <span id="s1826">So, I'm not getting anything, and I -- frankly I don't care.</span> <span id="s1827">I don't want it.</span> <span id="s1828">I have made whatever I have I had made it myself and I don't need the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">08:13:05 In spite of the fact that it's a different generation, another generation, whatever it is, I still don't like them because I still think that they have not repented enough.</span> <span id="s1830">They have benefited to an “nth” degree from what was stolen, what was confiscated, what was taken away.</span> <span id="s1831">The property that my family owned in what is now Belarus, I am not trying to claim because I have no proof of any kind.</span> <span id="s1832">People that were there are dead.</span> <span id="s1833">They are not in existence.</span> <span id="s1834">There are no documents of any kind.</span> <span id="s1835">In Lida everything was destroyed, burned.</span> <span id="s1836">I have no proof of any kind, just testimonials.</span> <span id="s1837">And on the ba-- basis of testimonials of other people, nobody is going to give anybody anything.</span> <span id="s1838">So, I'm not even trying it, and I'm not even doing it.</span> <span id="s1839">So, I have reconciled with the fact that I have to live with what I ha-- what I make and what I have made, and that's fine.</span> <span id="s1840">I am very happy with it.</span> <span id="s1841">The money that I have gotten at that-- at one time, that lump sum, went towards a in a small, very small part, I took my family, my wife and the two children, and my son and daughter, and we went to Israel, right after the '70 war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q. Anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A. No, unless you want to ask me anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: I think I have…</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: I think I have covered it as much as I can, I mean, besides telling you what we had br-- for lunch and breakfast, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q.
