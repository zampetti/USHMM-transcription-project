was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: April 26, 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Tell me something about your household growing up, who you lived with?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I was living with my parents and with my sister, which was six years older than me and played extremely important role in my life.</span> <span id="s23">It was rather a normal life.</span> <span id="s24">I attended private school all my life, and it was expected of me to do my homework and to be a good student.</span> <span id="s25">And it was a girls’ school.</span> <span id="s26">The name of the school was Frieda Mierlos(ph) in Warsaw, and I went there from kindergarten through 12 – no, the – I graduate gi – this was a gymnasium, which I graduate in 1936.</span> <span id="s27">I became – I got very good education in the school and after this I apply to law school, which wasn’t my first choice.</span> <span id="s28">Originally I wanted to be a pediatrician, but since being Jewish it was impossible to get to medical school in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s29">I even mentioned to my parents that I would like to go to France, but my parents were old fashioned and the idea of a girl going to France didn’t appeal to them.</span> <span id="s30">Could be if I would really fight, and wanted very much, I would go, but the upbringing was totally different than it is now of young people.</span> <span id="s31">And I was two years in law school, which I didn’t finish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which appealed to me.</span> <span id="s32">And then for a – before the war started, I was helping my father in his factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeeping, but nothing to get excited.</span> <span id="s33">And then the war started –</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Okay, let’s talk a little bit more about your home.</span> <span id="s35">Did you live in the town, within the town center?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: In – in the city of Warsaw I was living, we had a very nice, comfortable apartment.</span> <span id="s37">I had the room which I share with my sister, which I adore.</span> <span id="s38">She paints my life with roses.</span> <span id="s39">She was the best person before I met my husband, in my entire life.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Edith.</span> <span id="s42">Edith, Esfia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: It was a Jewish – not a goo – not a nice neighborhood.</span> <span id="s45">I would say too, except the janitor, hundred percent people were Jewish.</span> <span id="s46">Had three courts.</span> <span id="s47">The name of the street was Simonhof(ph) 13.</span> <span id="s48">It wasn’t a nice neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s50">In what sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Why?</span> <span id="s52">The streets were narrow, the people – the stores were ugly.</span> <span id="s53">Everything was – if anybody knows Warsaw, they know that it wasn’t a nice neighborhood.</span> <span id="s54">I was walking to school, we had always a housekeeper and we’re going for vacation, I went to camp.</span> <span id="s55">And I went even before the war to Latvia to see my father’s family, my grandmother, which I hardly knew, my aunts and uncles and cousins.</span> <span id="s56">And I had many, many friends and it was a nice, quiet life, I would say.</span> <span id="s57">I didn’t know any better.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Were your friends Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Majority of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s60">As I say, except the janitor and the housekeeper, everybody was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And at school were your other classmates all Jewish also?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: This was a Jewish private school.</span> <span id="s63">However, my first encounter was in law school, where, you know, it was a slogan, down with Jews.</span> <span id="s64">But the Jewish girls were the – we should be with the Jewish women but not with the Jewish men.</span> <span id="s65">And I witnessed when they were cutting with the blades, the coats from the Jewish students, it was winter.</span> <span id="s66">Do you know what I am talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Well, you want to tell us a little bit more about that?</span> <span id="s68">Who was doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: It was tremendous hatred toward Jewish students.</span> <span id="s70">I went to University of Joseph Pilsudski, which was – at this time he was dead, because he died when I graduate my gymnasium.</span> <span id="s71">And the hatred, there were many things which couldn’t – Jews couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s72">The majority of Jews who wanted to be physicians went to Italy, to France, to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s73">And they tried everything, although some of them were very poor and it was very hard to support themselves overseas, but they were working as waiters and some help from the parents.</span> <span id="s74">However, since I was accepted to law school, and in the beginning I thought maybe I’ll be a law-lawyer, and – however when the instructor professor was coming to the class and you know, the Jews were sit – standing behind the benches and he said still, the Jewish student will not sit on the left hand side, I will not start the lecture.</span> <span id="s75">And he was leaving, and this was right away totally chaos in the class because the Christian were beating up immediately the Jewish male students.</span> <span id="s76">The women they didn’t touch.</span> <span id="s77">And many times when I was walking on the street in Warsaw, in so called mixed neighborhood [indecipherable] Christian, I saw men who were attacked by young Christian boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you yourself experience, an – I mean, I know you observed anti-Semitic incidents, did you yourself –</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I tell you, til the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: – experience any?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: – I didn’t have any contact exactly, I didn’t have any Christian friends.</span> <span id="s82">I – so i-I – I was very limited because I was living in a ghetto, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s83">I was going to shows, and we went to opera.</span> <span id="s84">I remember “Madame Butterfly” was a Japanese song – singstress – sa – woman who was singing.</span> <span id="s85">And however my direct contact, so different from my husband, who went to a state school, was totally different.</span> <span id="s86">Some of our teachers in my gymnasium were Christian, however, it was a different relation.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: How religious was your family?</span> <span id="s88">A: My mother was a believer, my father wasn’t.</span> <span id="s89">He – Friday within – my mother was lighting candles, but my father was never there because he was working Saturday.</span> <span id="s90">The business was open on Saturday and Sunday he was off.</span> <span id="s91">And my mother was kosher – the home was kosher, however, my father outside was eating not kosher.</span> <span id="s92">And I was not believing at all, and my mother was always very upset because she couldn’t understand why I cannot believe it.</span> <span id="s93">However, came a moment in her life when we’re thrown out – during the ghetto, from our apartment and we’re living not far from Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s94">You know what is Umschlagplatz?</span> <span id="s95">There were the trains were loading the Jews, and the Jews were going to the trains with the name of God [indecipherable] I heard this, I remember.</span> <span id="s96">And she said, children, don’t believe in God.</span> <span id="s97">And I will never forget this because it was coming from a woman who was so blindly believing in God that if the hole would open in front of me, and I will go in, it would be less than to hear from my mother that there was no God.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Did you have any Jewish schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Any training?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: No.</span> <span id="s102">I don’t know how to – I understand Yiddish, and now when I am working with Russian refugees, they are very happy when they hear.</span> <span id="s103">My Yiddish is very poor, but I can manage very nicely.</span> <span id="s104">And they getting much better rapport than to – through translator, which I always have.</span> <span id="s105">And since I’m Polish, I understand Russian too.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Polish.</span> <span id="s108">And I was angry at my par – at my mother that she didn’t speak, I was ashamed a little bit that she didn’t speak a perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s109">However, when we came to this country and it came to my daughter friend, she said, why your mommy is talking Spanish?</span> <span id="s110">In her eyes it was that I was talking Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: What were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Maria and Samuel Ma-Magitte(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: And what kind of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: My father had a factory, dyeing factory, where he employed 50 people.</span> <span id="s115">It was in his building, he had few of the real estate.</span> <span id="s116">He was dyeing wool, silk, [indecipherable], rayon, felt, feathers, everything possible.</span> <span id="s117">And he had this – he came to Poland before the first war in 1914, I think, and he built up to – he was a very comfortable man.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: So you were considered middle class?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Yes, upper middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Upper middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s123">Why did you want to become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I loved children and I wanted to be a pediatrician and I felt – although I think I was wrong because I’m very poor with science, I am rather for humanities.</span> <span id="s125">And it was glamorous and that’s what I ar – but i – I – most likely i-it – it was not a strong wish, because I could go abroad, my father could support me.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: All right, well let’s come up to the time now when conditions started to change and war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: It started to change September first, immediately, the – our –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: T-Tell me what you were doing and what you remember from then.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: September first – sept – August 31st or 30th, I came from my boyfr – in – not – not even a boyfriend, a friend who is now my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: I met him in law school when he was – and through his brother-in-law, who was a lawyer for my father.</span> <span id="s132">So when my sister was going there which was helping my father in business, she said to his brother-in-law, I have a very good looking sister and how about if we’ll introduce?</span> <span id="s133">And when he saw me he decided that he fell in love with me, most likely, but he was fighting – he wasn’t ready to get married, my husband.</span> <span id="s134">My husband was thinking about having a child with a rather healthy Christian girl.</span> <span id="s135">Why Christian I don’t know, and to raise the child right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: What year did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: 1935. ’</span> <span id="s138">36, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: And we were – you know, were –</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: And you saw each other –</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Yeah, but we never had a date.</span> <span id="s143">Then the war start – wi – I met him – I – I don’t remember if I knew that he is going.</span> <span id="s144">I went with my girlfriend to the country, to the mountains, it was August for a few weeks and he was there coming h – and I saw him, he was always wearing tiny shorts because he is a very good tennis player.</span> <span id="s145">So I always remember, and – and as a matter of fact, he made the ji – I had the cold and I was sharing the room with a girlfriend and he came in to find out about me, and he said make room.</span> <span id="s146">I was 20 years old and I got very insulted and I didn’t talk to him for a week.</span> <span id="s147">I was very naïve, stupid.</span> <span id="s148">And then I saw him occasionally, but whenever, as I said never had a date.</span> <span id="s149">He had some girlfriends and I have some boyfriends and the life went on, and in the ghetto when the ghetto was being closed – we were in the part which was ghetto, because it was a Jewish neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Okay, let – let’s an – before we get to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Okay, it was August and you were in the country, and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: And we came back the same day and I remember my mother was waiting on the balcony because she was very nervous what happened to me.</span> <span id="s154">And we came in September first –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: – the Germans were throwing bomb on Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And where –</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: And the Polacks were robbing the stores and killing the Jews, before the Germans occupied Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: And what happened?</span> <span id="s160">What other memories do you have of that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: And it was a three court house.</span> <span id="s162">You know, in Europe mostly are courts.</span> <span id="s163">The first one, the second and the third.</span> <span id="s164">You know, in – it was – i-in New York you have very few houses where they have a court.</span> <span id="s165">Do you know what I’m talking?</span> <span id="s166">In the middle ha – you know, the – the part of the building in the middle, th-they threw the bomb and killed some tenants and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: This was your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: This was my building where I was living, but we’re living in the third one.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: And we’re always running to the basement, I remember, because they were bombing to Warsaw – seven days and – and they right away walked in.</span> <span id="s171">And the life changed completely.</span> <span id="s172">What I was doing, in the beginning were able to go to my father’ factory, which was still working, slowly.</span> <span id="s173">You know, it was outside of the ghetto, his factory.</span> <span id="s174">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: But the ghetto hadn’t been formed yet, not –</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: – for another year.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: No, but you know, there were strictly Christian neighborhoods and Jewish neighborhoods.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: You were in the Jewish neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes, I was living in the Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s181">And then it came January 1940, my sister moved with her husband to us.</span> <span id="s182">She had the different apartment, but we decided to be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: From September to January, you were working at your father’s factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yes, helping [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Did you have enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s187">We were comfortable, and we had jewelry which later on we’re selling to survive, so it wasn’t bad.</span> <span id="s188">I never suffered hunger.</span> <span id="s189">I – I didn’t have a place where to sleep later on when I was acting as a Christian, but I had money to buy food.</span> <span id="s190">And then in January, Gestapo came, three men from Gestapo and ask for Michael Minz(ph).</span> <span id="s191">And my sister grab him and run away through the kitchen entrance.</span> <span id="s192">That were to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: This is her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s195">They left a note.</span> <span id="s196">They said that they came to Michael Minz(ph) to find out some things from him.</span> <span id="s197">He wasn’t from Warsaw, he was from a different small town in Poland, Międzyrzecz, and they left a note.</span> <span id="s198">And when my father came back – that he should go to the Gestapo they left a note – my sister didn’t want to let him go to Gestapo but my father – and we had a manager, my father, of this dyeing plant, who was German descent.</span> <span id="s199">He was Polish, but he was a Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s200">His wife immediately, you know, decided to, because they had privileges, they were like Germans.</span> <span id="s201">And he went with them.</span> <span id="s202">My sister was standing outside the Gestapo and her husband, they were married two years only, and this – this foreman, and they arrested him.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Arrested your brother-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yes, and since then we didn’t hear anything from them, and then we find out from other people, doctors, teachers, anybody who had some education was arrested.</span> <span id="s205">300 men.</span> <span id="s206">My just – my sister got very busy with some lawyers to find out what happened to them [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s207">Then we find out that they were killed right away in the forest near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s208">This was the cream of a cream, you know, the elite of the Jewish intelligence.</span> <span id="s209">As a matter of fact, she had a nervous breakdown after.</span> <span id="s210">She became – she got a nervous hiccup I remember, and she was going to neurologists.</span> <span id="s211">We never heard from them.</span> <span id="s212">And then it was – we started to see – my father was extremely enterprising, decided, you know, that he will dye – he will be buying some linen and dyeing this home and selling maybe to outsider, this – but this didn’t work.</span> <span id="s213">Then he started to plant some vegetables in some lots near the houses.</span> <span id="s214">But by the time the vegetables were ripe, they were stolen by other people.</span> <span id="s215">He was trying everything, he was extremely energetic, and – and he was even smuggling – when the factory was – when the ghetto was closed, to supervise the work, which it was there –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: When – when did his factory close down?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I don’t remember, but it was walls and walls and we didn’t let him and he was denounced by a janitor from the place where it was in the factory, that he said when Hitler will come, my father will kill him.</span> <span id="s218">The Christian janitor said this.</span> <span id="s219">They arrested my father and they put him in a space where he couldn’t stay, only he – he could see – sit with the knees, you know, like this here.</span> <span id="s220">In those days a number wasn’t called, they kept him 48 hours and they let him go, and he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What month was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Spring of –</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: – 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s227">It was getting worse and worse and from the small town around the war zone, which were German liquidating, they were bringing everybody to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s228">So we had five rooms, two rooms we had to let – to sublet for people from Lódz, two families.</span> <span id="s229">And the quarters are getting smaller and smaller, we are sleeping in the dining room, we are sleep – and I was sleeping together with my sister.</span> <span id="s230">Altogether – the ration was bread which wasn’t edible but [indecipherable] it was more sent that it was bread, but we didn’t suffer hunger.</span> <span id="s231">However, was interesting, when somebody, when the neighbors sometimes were coming, we were trying to clean up from the table, because not to show that we have food and maybe they don’t have it.</span> <span id="s232">And then they liquidated second part of the ghetto which was in a different part of Warsaw and they brought everybody to this part where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: So your house was already in where the ghetto was –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s236">And the ghetto was closed off in October of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes, but this time already we had two ghettos.</span> <span id="s238">In 1940, originally a different part of Warsaw had the ghetto, and where I was living.</span> <span id="s239">Then, slowly, they liquidated the other part, and everybody was here, you know.</span> <span id="s240">Don’t forget the meantime they were grabbing people more and more and sending and many people voluntary were coming because they were starving from hunger.</span> <span id="s241">I remember some second or third cousin came.</span> <span id="s242">They took away her husband.</span> <span id="s243">She came with two children to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s244">She said, I was told that there were work, and I will be able – they will support us, and she was going herself to Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s245">And there were many like this.</span> <span id="s246">They couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s247">They were more and more dead body on the street in Warsaw, especially children, who are dying with their genitals covered with those garbage flies.</span> <span id="s248">It was awful.</span> <span id="s249">And I remember I was carrying in a packet stockings, which I was taking to somebody, you know, I – it is very hard for – when you had to run, there were people who were fixing this.</span> <span id="s250">So a kid grabbed the bag from my hand and started to eat.</span> <span id="s251">They thought this is a brown bag, that this is food.</span> <span id="s252">It was getting worse and worse, you know.</span> <span id="s253">The Gestapo and the Germans were beating up walking on the street.</span> <span id="s254">You couldn’t cross the street.</span> <span id="s255">And the walls which they built, you know, people were smuggling because there was still some getting food.</span> <span id="s256">Kids were smuggling and they were killing those children near the walls, if they were carrying a bread, or something.</span> <span id="s257">It – and less and less people were, because the trains to Treblinka were going all the time.</span> <span id="s258">We didn’t know the Treblinka – some people were even getting cards, come here because we are working and everything is fine.</span> <span id="s259">The German machine was so sophisticated and complicated, that they could accomplish that people voluntary were going.</span> <span id="s260">I-It was totally unbelievable.</span> <span id="s261">And we were selling many things.</span> <span id="s262">I remember my mother had the chain which was from my grandmother, and – and every time, you know, we – we had to – there were still people who were selling this to the Christian.</span> <span id="s263">First of all, the first time we had to give away the radios, bring to the precinct.</span> <span id="s264">Then the fur coats.</span> <span id="s265">Then everything that was valuable, they could come to you and – and clean up the whole house, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s266">And the quarters, living quarters were getting smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s267">My mother was kosher, and my father brought, how you call slonina, felt from the pig?</span> <span id="s268">How you call in eng –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Lard?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Lard, yeah.</span> <span id="s271">And h-he brought a big piece, and she was, you know, a – how you call –</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Cooking?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Not cooking only, because it was a piece, so she had to make like butter, how – how you say –</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Melting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Melting it.</span> <span id="s276">And she said, I’m – and he told her that this is lamb fat.</span> <span id="s277">And she said, I wonder why I didn’t – why we didn’t use this before the war, it tastes so good, you know.</span> <span id="s278">She was very naïve in this respect.</span> <span id="s279">And he was much more enterprising, he was a very strong man.</span> <span id="s280">When you couldn’t get coal, and our apartment were warming u – warm up by coal, he brought half a ton of coal up on the 10th floor on his back.</span> <span id="s281">And then it came that they moved – they started to build the shops for German industry, you know, we were working.</span> <span id="s282">First of all they throw us out from this apartment, there were still four of us, from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s283">And they took – they gave us one room near the Umschlagplatz where –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: May I ask [indecipherable] maybe he remembers?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A2: [indecipherable] I remember it?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: That’s all right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: We were there a short time.</span> <span id="s289">Few months, I think we were.</span> <span id="s290">So we left the apartment the way we were.</span> <span id="s291">We weren’t allowed to take anything.</span> <span id="s292">We went down and I will never – one room and it happened that this apartment, I met later a woman who survived Russia, was her parents’ apartment.</span> <span id="s293">I will never forget this apartment because the bedbugs were coming from the ceiling.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: This is the new place?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: The new place, yeah.</span> <span id="s296">And it was a balcony and we heard the trains coming and the Jews going to the train, and praying to God.</span> <span id="s297">And it was constant.</span> <span id="s298">The trains were going constantly.</span> <span id="s299">And then they opened the Germans shops, and we were able – I and my – my mother, when we’re going to the shops we’re hiding her.</span> <span id="s300">We put a big closet, you know, and cover part of the wall and [indecipherable] because she couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s301">She – she had heavy arthritis and she was overweight.</span> <span id="s302">So my father was working in a different shop and my sister and myself were working not far from my father in a different shop.</span> <span id="s303">The name of the shop was [indecipherable] roefrich, r-o-e-f-r-i-c-h, from [indecipherable] and we’re sewing uniforms.</span> <span id="s304">There I met part Jews, which I never met before, it was the working class of Jews.</span> <span id="s305">Bund, b-u-n-d.</span> <span id="s306">And they were singing the Jewish songs very, you know [indecipherable] you know, all those [indecipherable] and – you know, and they were those one who started later the uprising.</span> <span id="s307">They were very, very important Jews that I met in my life, which some of them survived.</span> <span id="s308">And they were much more doing for the Jews than people like me, who was a Jewish princess.</span> <span id="s309">And then we’re sewing, but then started selection.</span> <span id="s310">All the time the Gestapo was coming.</span> <span id="s311">We all had to go outside and they were looking if there were older people or some people who had the pimple on the nose or something, they were taking away.</span> <span id="s312">And meantime there was, in 1942, the street of – name was Millar(ph) and this time was a big selection and they took tremendous amount of Jews.</span> <span id="s313">And I will never forget my neighbors, who had the little girl Marilka(ph) and they put her in a suitcase and they made holes in the suitcase for air.</span> <span id="s314">However, she started to cry.</span> <span id="s315">They were living on the same house, and Germans put the cara – machi – guns, and shot this suitcase, as – this couple left the suitcase and walked away.</span> <span id="s316">There are things which always stays in your mind.</span> <span id="s317">So there were less and less Jews in the ghetto because they were killed, or they were taking to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s318">We didn’t notice the – there were some people who are coming from Treblinka who threw themselves together with the clothing, because they were telling them that you have to go and you know, to the shower and this – those things, you know.</span> <span id="s319">So, you know, some of them who are helping to sort the clothes into this, th-the shoes, and – th-they got back to Warsaw and they say remember, Treblinka has ba – is burning – crematoriums are working day and night.</span> <span id="s320">So with that already, the idea that this is not that they are sending them to work, only they are sending them to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: So you were called out some – for selections that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I was not, no, because we’re young.</span> <span id="s323">My sister and I were young, and my father, who was this time in the late 50’s was hiding when they were calling.</span> <span id="s324">You know, you never knew for whom they were looking.</span> <span id="s325">However, one week –</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Were you ever called down to – to the street?</span> <span id="s327">You were never called down to –</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: However, once we came, and the hot soup was on the table, my mother was gone.</span> <span id="s331">She came out from this hiding place to cook the soup for us, and they came and they took her away.</span> <span id="s332">I run to Umschlagplatz, but she was gone.</span> <span id="s333">We continued work, and once I came and I heard that they took my sister.</span> <span id="s334">And I went to Umschlagplatz and they told me that she was on this and this train, which was staying, and I entered the train.</span> <span id="s335">When I was in the train, they told me that my sister was hiding, that she wasn’t on that train, and I decided to jump.</span> <span id="s336">It wasn’t – the train was just moving, so I – I wasn’t a heroine, you know.</span> <span id="s337">They helped me, you know, and they picked me up and through the window, because the doors were locked.</span> <span id="s338">My sister heard that I was in the train, she went to the other train.</span> <span id="s339">She was extr – extremely important to me.</span> <span id="s340">In the same time, we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of the train and we went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s341">And my father was sitting on the floor near the door.</span> <span id="s342">He said, I knew that you will come back.</span> <span id="s343">We decided that we have to do something to leave the ghetto because we didn’t have a chance.</span> <span id="s344">My father knew a man, a Christian, he was a lawyer, who took over the management of his factory.</span> <span id="s345">And through him we got false papers for my sister and for myself.</span> <span id="s346">I was looking more like Christian than her, because the whole Jewish tragedy was in her eyes.</span> <span id="s347">You know, they say [indecipherable] in Jewish eyes, there is such a thing.</span> <span id="s348">I was always smiling and – and really, although – and my Polish and her Polish was excellent, and this was extremely important.</span> <span id="s349">And we said – and it was very hard for her to move around because she could be very easy recognized.</span> <span id="s350">So through this man he found somebody, and she was sitting mostly inside.</span> <span id="s351">This was April, before the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: April 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s354">And I got papers too, and I went – I rented somebody – my friend told me that she’s coming back to the ghetto because her husband – as a man you didn’t have a chance, because of circumcision.</span> <span id="s355">And I took over her room.</span> <span id="s356">And I was working in the ghetto as a Christian this time.</span> <span id="s357">I could see my father, I had papers as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: What kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: This was factory for Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Manufacturing work.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yeah, I was very gutsy.</span> <span id="s362">They were making – I – from lead or something.</span> <span id="s363">It was a short time.</span> <span id="s364">I was coming in the morning, and leaving five o’clock.</span> <span id="s365">This time I could al – I could always bring for my father some food, who was in a different [indecipherable] this time.</span> <span id="s366">My sister was already on the false paper hidden, you know.</span> <span id="s367">And then it was Passover, the first Seder, Sunday night and I stayed, I wanted to be with my father.</span> <span id="s368">And he asked me stay there today, maybe it was Sunday night.</span> <span id="s369">I say okay, I will stay.</span> <span id="s370">And the next morning when I got up, it was Monday, I found out that the uprising was, but it was in different – it was in the part of the ghetto where my husband was.</span> <span id="s371">And I got dressed, I had the coat with the collar from a rabbit.</span> <span id="s372">Jews weren’t allowed, so when I went to the false paper, I bought myself a rabbit and I put to my coat to look more like Christian.</span> <span id="s373">And I went to the guard and I passed the – it was a house ba – from – who had two entrances from the street.</span> <span id="s374">The Jews in towers were staying in the court and praying to God.</span> <span id="s375">It was quiet in this part of the ghetto because the uprising started there.</span> <span id="s376">And I went to the guard, I showed him the papers.</span> <span id="s377">He said, what you are doing in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s378">I said [indecipherable] caught me, and I decided I didn’t have a choice, I had to stay.</span> <span id="s379">He looked at me, he looked at the paper, and as I say, the number was [indecipherable] and he let me through.</span> <span id="s380">And near the guard were children six, seven years old, Jude, Jude, waiting for the Jews to show them to the German.</span> <span id="s381">I had guts, and I walked in with my head up.</span> <span id="s382">And my sister, maybe one street from there she was waiting.</span> <span id="s383">She knew that to get out I had to come there.</span> <span id="s384">She knew that – she was sure that she will never see me.</span> <span id="s385">And I met her and I said, don’t go in there, because it was the worst time.</span> <span id="s386">The Polacks were showing left and right, you know, and they could recognize me.</span> <span id="s387">No Germans stopped me in two and a half years.</span> <span id="s388">But the Polacks, who knew me from university one, my husb – my father’s work and – and luckily that I had money, because this man, my father gave him money, and whenever I needed.</span> <span id="s389">And there was incident when I was living in the room, in the furnished room, there was a little boy, the first question he asked me, if I ever saw a Jew.</span> <span id="s390">So I said yes.</span> <span id="s391">Is this true that Jew have a tail?</span> <span id="s392">I said, I don’t think so, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s393">And when they started the uprising in ghetto, I – I knew that I have a father there and I had a husband – husband, not a husband, we weren’t officially married, but I – I felt, you know.</span> <span id="s394">I went to the wall, and I was looking and next to me was standing a Christian woman and she said, very good that they burning the Jews, only they spoiling our Easter.</span> <span id="s395">This was vox populi, it wasn’t a single voice, everybody felt the same way.</span> <span id="s396">As I was living in this furnished room, once is coming a woman and she said to me, may I see your papers?</span> <span id="s397">I said yes.</span> <span id="s398">What happened to the woman which was living here before, she was Jewish, are you Jewish, too?</span> <span id="s399">I said, I don’t know if – I never met her, but I’m not Jewish.</span> <span id="s400">She said, anyway, we’ll go to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s401">She – it was after the curfew.</span> <span id="s402">She was a Polish woman, but she was working for the Germans, and she – we’re walking, it was quite a walk.</span> <span id="s403">We were walking, I said look, I can give you money, I have a watch, let me go.</span> <span id="s404">She said no, we’re going.</span> <span id="s405">Suddenly she got tremendous pain, and we stopped near the pharmacy where she was ringing the bell, it was after the curfew.</span> <span id="s406">And the owner was living in the same building, opened the door for us, and we walked in and she said to him, if you will let her go, she is Jewish, you will be killed too.</span> <span id="s407">You have to help me.</span> <span id="s408">And he gave her some medication, I don’t remember, and she continued to walk with me.</span> <span id="s409">We’re maybe quarter of a mile from Gestapo, she said give me the money and give me the watch.</span> <span id="s410">I will [indecipherable] but I will not do anything to you.</span> <span id="s411">And I didn’t move.</span> <span id="s412">I get out from this room and I didn’t have a place where to go.</span> <span id="s413">I went to the hotel in a very nice neighborhood in Warsaw, Marshal(ph) Kostka(ph) street.</span> <span id="s414">And the man who took my papers said, I am sure your papers are all right because Gestapo is coming every night and checking the papers.</span> <span id="s415">I didn’t have a choice.</span> <span id="s416">I said, my papers are okay.</span> <span id="s417">And I was sleeping there, nobody came.</span> <span id="s418">And I was looking through the window, and I wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s419">I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s420">And I said, if they will find me, they will not know even who am I.</span> <span id="s421">But I was young, an-and I said no, you cannot give up.</span> <span id="s422">And the next morning I walked on the street, and I met my friend, a Jewish woman who was working as a governess, French governess.</span> <span id="s423">She was studying medicine in France and her French was perfect and we were very friendly.</span> <span id="s424">She was working for a very nice family.</span> <span id="s425">She was taking care of two girls.</span> <span id="s426">And she said – I said, Marisha(ph), I don’t have a place where to go.</span> <span id="s427">She said, today we’re interviewing for my woman where I’m working.</span> <span id="s428">She has a mother in a small town [indecipherable] and we’re looking for a housekeeper.</span> <span id="s429">You come and I am going to interview, and you’ll get the job.</span> <span id="s430">I went for the interview, you know, it was like I – I am talking to you and I think I am lying.</span> <span id="s431">I-It’s hard to believe.</span> <span id="s432">I went there and this woman came to see me and then she said to her, you know what?</span> <span id="s433">She looks a little bit Jewish.</span> <span id="s434">But she was a nice woman.</span> <span id="s435">She said oh no, you know, she’s from a different town only.</span> <span id="s436">Because my papers were from a small town, from Częstochowa, and I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: What was your name then?</span> <span id="s438">Were you –</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Stefania(ph) Dolinska(ph).</span> <span id="s440">I have the Kennekarta.</span> <span id="s441">And I was two years older from 1917, and the parents were illiterate, you know, I – I had to – to have a family.</span> <span id="s442">So wherever I went I had an aunt, an uncle, you know, everything was fiction.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And what town were you born in?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I was born in Warsaw, and it was in Warsaw, and this was Częstochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: No, I’m saying the papers –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: That it said what –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: – the papers said you were born –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Częstochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Częstochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: And this – there was a well known shrine of Saint Mary, she was black, that Matka Częstochowska, yeah.</span> <span id="s451">Very well known.</span> <span id="s452">And I was carry – wearing, of course, a big cross and all the things.</span> <span id="s453">And if you would wake me up during the night, I could recite all the Catholic prayers by heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: How did you learn them?</span> <span id="s455">A: I learned.</span> <span id="s456">I got the book and I – this was survival.</span> <span id="s457">And I went there and the – wa – one was deaf and one was blind.</span> <span id="s458">And I wasn’t prepared to work, I was a Jewish princess, I got the wrong education.</span> <span id="s459">And when I cook potatoes I didn’t know that you need water.</span> <span id="s460">So I felt the potatoes will give waters all when they started.</span> <span id="s461">When she walked in she said oh, Stefcha(ph) forgot to put – not enough water.</span> <span id="s462">So it dawned on me.</span> <span id="s463">They once were going to confession, so she said, let’s hurry, because I was going to church with them.</span> <span id="s464">I said yes, only I will finish my breakfast.</span> <span id="s465">I forgot that when you going to confession, you don’t eat anything before.</span> <span id="s466">You know, they were such a little things which – here I am coming from a family which wasn’t assimilated one and here I am suddenly a Christian.</span> <span id="s467">The best place was ch-church.</span> <span id="s468">Then nobody was touching you, you know, you were pretending that you praying and you cover your eyes.</span> <span id="s469">But I-I was working.</span> <span id="s470">Like, I was washing the floors, I put sud on the floor and then you – you had to put clear water to remove the soap.</span> <span id="s471">So I was swimming in the sud and I didn’t know that you need clear water.</span> <span id="s472">And I was there and it was rather good, you know.</span> <span id="s473">I – my sister, before I left, she dye my hair, you know, blonde.</span> <span id="s474">And I couldn’t become blonde somehow, I – I’m very dark, now I color.</span> <span id="s475">And I was a reddish hair, but I was good looking and I had guts, you know, yeah, I – and my eyes were happy.</span> <span id="s476">And I was working there for a short time and then I went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s477">I – for – I was going for weekend, I – I said that I had – and [indecipherable] said, oh good that Stefcha(ph) because the [indecipherable] came and he is checking everybody’s paper, so I said that you will come tonight.</span> <span id="s478">I say, oh I am so sorry.</span> <span id="s479">My aunt got very sick and I have to stay with [indecipherable] it was split of a second.</span> <span id="s480">I came only to get – I had a small suitcase, and a pillow you know, I was carrying here like – because this was a – the servants were, pillow and a blanket, you know, you – you needed your own.</span> <span id="s481">She says, oh please tell him that when my aunt will get better, I will come back and I will go to him.</span> <span id="s482">And I disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Let’s go back.</span> <span id="s484">Did you ever go to confession in the church?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No.</span> <span id="s486">I said that I am going, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s487">And – but I was going to communion, you know, and I was whe –</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: You took communion?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: And I went to Warsaw and I had a friend who was looking very Jewish.</span> <span id="s490">Her name was Roma, too.</span> <span id="s491">This is the same friend that when he came and he saw the name, you know, he thought this is a man, yeah.</span> <span id="s492">She was living with her mother.</span> <span id="s493">Her mother Jewish was atrocious – Polish was atrocious, so she pretended that she was mute.</span> <span id="s494">However, my friend had very curly hair like black, like afro, so she couldn’t leave the house, so the mother was coming out and going, you know, shopping, pointing, you know, the – and the daughter was always home.</span> <span id="s495">So whenever I was desperate, which was not fair to them, I was going to them for the night when it was dark, and the janitor was the biggest enemy.</span> <span id="s496">Sneaking, and spending the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Roma Fleischman(ph).</span> <span id="s499">The mother was a wa – I was telling them when we’re sitting there, the first train I will be sitting, and the mother said no, we’ll stay here.</span> <span id="s500">And then, you know, I heard that there is a job on a farm, to milk the cows, to help with the far – I was all used to farm like – now I would go, maybe as astronaut I would be better.</span> <span id="s501">So I went there and there was a wife after a – a – a widow after a judge and a big farm.</span> <span id="s502">And she said to me, do you know how to milk the cow?</span> <span id="s503">I figured, what’s a – wha-what’s so easy th – bi-big deal, you know?</span> <span id="s504">I was wearing silk stockings, and my Polish was so good and my handwriting was so good.</span> <span id="s505">You know, for a maid in Poland, who were mostly illiterate, but I told them that I was working as a bookkeeper in this different city.</span> <span id="s506">So now I – since I moved, my parents die, everybody, you know, to convenience.</span> <span id="s507">Sometimes they were alive, sometimes they were dead.</span> <span id="s508">And she says okay, so milk this cow.</span> <span id="s509">I started to pull, kill me, couldn’t get a drop of milk and the flies were biting me through the stockings and the cow was hitting me with the tail.</span> <span id="s510">And – and she looked at me, she said, you don’t look like a girl who knows – who was working on a farm.</span> <span id="s511">I am sorry, but I cannot keep you.</span> <span id="s512">I left again.</span> <span id="s513">In between there, there were jobs where I felt that this is not safe, that I have to leave, you know.</span> <span id="s514">So after two days I was leaving without, you know, and I didn't – I had working papers, which were extremely important.</span> <span id="s515">By the way, I forgot to tell you, when I was going to get my Kennekarta(ph) with my birth certificate, which I got to my hand – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: – I got my false paper, I needed a Kennkarta, which was the official germ – German document to live in occupied Poland.</span> <span id="s517">And when I went on the way there to this German office where they were giving the Kennkarta with my picture, I had a picture with my nose like this, I – you will see the picture.</span> <span id="s518">And on the way there somebody stole from me the – the – my pocketbook.</span> <span id="s519">And I didn’t have the birth certificate.</span> <span id="s520">And I called up this man, Mr. Rokulski(ph), he said, I cannot get – you have to go to the Church of che – of Three Crosses, that was a big church in Poland, and ask for the birth certificate.</span> <span id="s521">I didn’t have a choice, this was like – like going in a – in a mousetrap and I went there and I ask and they gave me.</span> <span id="s522">I don’t know if she was alive or she was dead, you know?</span> <span id="s523">Could be if I would ask for death certificate, they would give me too.</span> <span id="s524">So again I went and I got the Kennkarta which w – and a arbeitskarta, work paper, which was extremely important because when the Germans were stopping me, when I had the arbeitkarta, this work karta, they let me loose.</span> <span id="s525">My dream was to get to Germany, to work in Germany as a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s526">However, you couldn’t volunteer, because if they would see a woman like me volunteer, there was a priest who was specializing in recognizing Jews.</span> <span id="s527">He would see right away that the woman, you know, with my Polish, is not voluntary to go to work as a – in labor camp.</span> <span id="s528">So my only hope was to be caught by the German, and to send to Germany.</span> <span id="s529">But because of my arbeitkarta, they never – I went to library, the ju – Gestapo came to library.</span> <span id="s530">I showed them my paper, they let me loose.</span> <span id="s531">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: You were – you were talking about you left the farm –</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I left the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: – where – where you couldn’t milk the cow, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah, and I looked and I-I – I was at the end – I – I – I looked in the paper.</span> <span id="s536">However, it – it was – I went on – on another job where I was two days.</span> <span id="s537">And the man – I didn’t – the man was looking at me very suspicious.</span> <span id="s538">You know, you develop a different sense, where is – wh-where you are not sure if – if you will not be caught, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s539">And it was split of a second was deciding about your life.</span> <span id="s540">So I flew down to that – near Warsaw was a summer place where they were before the war sending TB patients.</span> <span id="s541">Otwotski(ph), it was.</span> <span id="s542">And they are looking for people to – chambermaids and other workers to change from that hotel to hospital for German soldiers.</span> <span id="s543">So I went there.</span> <span id="s544">It was run – supervised by nuns, and I was working there, it was empty.</span> <span id="s545">They were preparing for the German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: What time of year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: It was summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Summer ’44?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And I was there and so I read, you know, from the employment, a German employment that they are looking for a governess in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.</span> <span id="s551">Garmisch-Partenkirchen was Hitler’ summer home.</span> <span id="s552">And intelligent, educated and I went there to this office.</span> <span id="s553">Well, the moment I walked in, I saw that I made a mistake.</span> <span id="s554">There was sitting a Polis Deutsche, a Polack who was a German, a German descent.</span> <span id="s555">And I remember him when I was working when the ghetto started.</span> <span id="s556">You know, they took the Jews to work to put the names in every building, you know, who were – and he was there.</span> <span id="s557">And I – you know, I figure out he couldn’t recognize me, but I – when I saw him, he was talking Polish.</span> <span id="s558">And I ask about the job, he said yes, yes, I will let you know.</span> <span id="s559">Where are you now?</span> <span id="s560">I said, I am here in this, I am working here and here.</span> <span id="s561">When I came back to this place where I was working, the nun was waiting for me with a – my little suitcase.</span> <span id="s562">And she said, ste – Stefsha(ph), right away go to back Warsaw because Gestapo is coming to arrest you.</span> <span id="s563">They recognize you.</span> <span id="s564">She took me to the train.</span> <span id="s565">I said, but I don’t have a place where to go.</span> <span id="s566">She said, go to th – our convent.</span> <span id="s567">She gave me the name of this Mother Superior in Warsaw and I went there.</span> <span id="s568">And they talked to me, they say we don’t have a place where to keep you for the night, but we have in the country a place, a convent.</span> <span id="s569">Take the train and go there.</span> <span id="s570">I spent – they kept me three months there.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: What convent was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Marie’s family – Mary’s family.</span> <span id="s573">Regina Mary.</span> <span id="s574">The priest knew that I am Jewish, the nuns didn’t know.</span> <span id="s575">I shared the room with a nun who was shaved like [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s576">And since I am very curious, I was asking what made them become a nun, so I’m – different story was there.</span> <span id="s577">And they had some Jewish children there in this convent.</span> <span id="s578">The ones that – I was working on the f – that was gardening, and they were, you know, vegetables, things, all I – and going – four o’clock in the morning we’re going to church.</span> <span id="s579">And it was already cold, it was coming winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: What town was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Grodzisko Mazovieke, g-r-o-d-z-i-s-k-o, one word.</span> <span id="s582">Mazovieke, m-a-z-o-v-i-e-k-e.</span> <span id="s583">And he said, I am very sorry, but you cannot stay here any more, because we’ll jeopardize the life of the children.</span> <span id="s584">And people are asking question what – I wasn’t a nun, you know, I was in my normal thing.</span> <span id="s585">I said, so – but I have no place where to go, so they sent me back.</span> <span id="s586">I ca – bought the paper, and it was my last job in Warsaw and they said in case they will need reference, I can give them their references, which was extremely important.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: You had stayed there three months?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s589">After the three months, you know, in the country.</span> <span id="s590">And I started to work with a woman who was a white Russian.</span> <span id="s591">She was Russian Orthodox.</span> <span id="s592">You know, ye – after the revolution in Russia, there were white Russian we – who went to Poland, to China, to all over the world.</span> <span id="s593">And he was a Volksdeutsche, again.</span> <span id="s594">He recognize me, but I was good for him and he was good for me, because he knew that is coming end of the war, and he had the uniform.</span> <span id="s595">Once, I took the uniform and I put on the balcony, and I thought that he will kill me.</span> <span id="s596">He grabbed the uniform because he didn’t want any Polacks to know that he’s a Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s597">You know, Volksdeutsche was a person who was born from German descent.</span> <span id="s598">Lempke(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s599">It was and it wasn’t a German name, but it was convenient.</span> <span id="s600">He got the Polish villa in the country from a – a – a Jewish villa, where Jews used to go, a beautiful apartment and he awa – had a sewing – a salon, you know, where she had the manager, and women sewing dresses made to order.</span> <span id="s601">Everything that they had was from Jews, different monograms, you know.</span> <span id="s602">And th – he had girlfriend, because when the telephone was ringing, when I was picking up, nobody answered.</span> <span id="s603">However, when he was picking up, he was oh, how are you Mrs. this and this, you know.</span> <span id="s604">And she was older than him, and she had the dog, a Pekinese dog who hated my guts, the dog.</span> <span id="s605">I hated the dog, too.</span> <span id="s606">I was sleeping dressed up – dressed.</span> <span id="s607">I couldn't get undressed because I felt in case somebody will come from the front door, I will be able to run through the back door.</span> <span id="s608">And I was singing in there, you know, it was curfew hours, eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s609">I was singing in – every home had the altar.</span> <span id="s610">So who was singing?</span> <span id="s611">The maids were singing.</span> <span id="s612">And everybody was sending the maids to sing and to pray in the altar.</span> <span id="s613">I, who doesn’t have any – if you would hear me singing, like my husband said, [indecipherable] this, I wasn’t a main singer that, you know.</span> <span id="s614">And then, once I – I didn’t know how to cook, and she knew it that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s615">Yeah, I could – so she had the big party and she called a special wo – a woman who was a cook.</span> <span id="s616">And I was wearing a – whatever I was wearing, she was asking me where I was buying.</span> <span id="s617">I said, oh, I bought this in a flea market.</span> <span id="s618">And she said, it looks like a – from a rich Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s619">Those were my own things, few things that I had, the black dress with a pin something.</span> <span id="s620">And I was wearing a black dress and a white a – white, you know, apron, and I walked to the room and I saw a German sitting in the uniform among her guests.</span> <span id="s621">And I got so scared that I fell down, together with a tray, with the food on the tray.</span> <span id="s622">She didn't kill me this time, was – once he threw the shoe in my head, this guy, that I didn’t do a good job.</span> <span id="s623">And you know, we’re picked together, this is not important.</span> <span id="s624">When we went – it was Easter, ’44 – went to the summer place.</span> <span id="s625">And this is a custom among Christian, that you share the egg, the hard – and you exchange wishes.</span> <span id="s626">I don’t know if you know about.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: In the country, in the summer place with those people.</span> <span id="s629">And she said to me, oh, the war is almost over.</span> <span id="s630">You will not be the maid any more, but Stefcha(ph) has a very good taste, so you will be supervising my salon and cleaning only the salon.</span> <span id="s631">So she looked at her and said, I think that after the war you will be working for her.</span> <span id="s632">I can bet you she’s a daughter of a rich indust – [indecipherable] and not watch only Warsaw.</span> <span id="s633">And then we went to church and he was watching every step if I didn’t many any mistake, but I was smarter than him.</span> <span id="s634">When to knee, when to cross, when to this, when to that.</span> <span id="s635">And then to get started the uprising, August first in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s636">The Polish uprising, had nothing to do with Jewish.</span> <span id="s637">And the Germans – the Russians stopped on the outskirts of – Warsaw was divided by Vistula.</span> <span id="s638">It was Praga, which was the outskirts part of Warsaw, but it was outskirts o – actually, and Warsaw.</span> <span id="s639">The Russian decided to conquer the Warsaw, but the Polacks say oh no, they were – they were their worst enemies.</span> <span id="s640">When the rush – when the Russians are already on the water Vistula, now we’ll fight for Warsaw.</span> <span id="s641">But this was impossible, because the Germans were still very strong, and the Russians said okay, let the Polacks fight their own battles.</span> <span id="s642">We’re not moving.</span> <span id="s643">And the Germans again – and when I told to this my – this woman for whom I was working, I said, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s644">She said, and your mother for sure was selling herrings on the flea market, she said to me.</span> <span id="s645">She was so angry.</span> <span id="s646">She hated the Jews so much, it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Why did you tell her you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Because I thought this is the end, but it wasn’t the end.</span> <span id="s649">You know, when the Russian were coming, and it was an hour away, but they stop because the stupid Polacks, they said, we’re going to fight for our capital.</span> <span id="s650">So it was not here and not there.</span> <span id="s651">October 15, evacuate the whole Warsaw.</span> <span id="s652">Many Jews were killed who were kill – who were hidden.</span> <span id="s653">My friend from Australia was staying in the sewers with rats and mice and her legs when she came out were so swollen, because Warsaw was totally flat now.</span> <span id="s654">We had one skyscraper, 14 floors, it went, I saw it.</span> <span id="s655">And they were flying so low, the Germans, that we’re hidden in the basement and part of the basement was destroyed because Poland didn’t have anything to defend.</span> <span id="s656">They didn’t have before and they didn’t have for sure later.</span> <span id="s657">And the Russian didn’t move.</span> <span id="s658">And they put us on the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So you went back to – you went back into Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: I was in Warsaw at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: When did you go back to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: I was in Warsaw at the time, but octob – October fifth they evacuate every Polack there.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: When did you go back into Warsaw, before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: I – I was on th – I was what – this was in Warsaw I was working for this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: The Volksdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Yeah, oh, I see, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: And we went every weekend –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: You came back from the summer place, back to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yeah, every weekend we were going there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s671">And I tell you, since he was a Volksdeutsche and he suspected that I was Jewish, but I – I didn’t have a place where to go any more, you know, we to – I was in so many places, I was – when I went to the butcher to buy, you know, something for the people I was working, when he looked at me I saw that he didn’t look at me because I was good looking, or young.</span> <span id="s672">I – I didn't – you know, right away I said, oh you don’t have this?</span> <span id="s673">I disappeared, you know?</span> <span id="s674">It was everything split of a second that you didn’t make – I didn’t tell you something that was important, how I lost my sister and my father.</span> <span id="s675">Can I go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: My father – so we were both on false papers.</span> <span id="s678">May eighth – May eighth, or maybe May six, my father through the sewers escaped from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: This is ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: This is ’43.</span> <span id="s681">The Germans stopped him because it was nighttime, and they ask him what he was doing, he said, I was cleaning the sewers.</span> <span id="s682">And he knew to cross himself and he went to his worker.</span> <span id="s683">This was a third generation worker who was working for him.</span> <span id="s684">And he knew my telephone number and he called me up and he said, you have to take my – your father because I have a family, I cannot keep him.</span> <span id="s685">And I got in touch with my sister, we didn’t know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s686">And as I was walking, I met – everything was li-like – like fate.</span> <span id="s687">I believe in fate.</span> <span id="s688">I was walking on the street and I met a young man who was working f-from a different city, who was living in the house where I was living with my parents, during the war.</span> <span id="s689">He came from a different – and I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s690">And I said, I don’t know what to do, but my father is here and I don’t have where to put him.</span> <span id="s691">He said look, my father is hidden and my whole family is supposed to come but suddenly was the uprising and they couldn’t leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s692">I am very happy that I met you because my father is getting crazy being there all alone.</span> <span id="s693">Well right away I picked up my father night time, you know, before the curfew and my sister put him there.</span> <span id="s694">It was Fildierska(ph) Oshamashti(ph), it was in ghetto with.</span> <span id="s695">Then she told me there was a woman, a Polish woman and she was hiding them for money, for big money.</span> <span id="s696">And it was Saturday, May eighth.</span> <span id="s697">We went together, and I said, I like to go in to see Father and to take the money.</span> <span id="s698">And she said to me, you didn’t live yet.</span> <span id="s699">You are much younger than me.</span> <span id="s700">I will go.</span> <span id="s701">And when she went there, few minutes after, there came Polish police and arrested them.</span> <span id="s702">One of the policemen, the Polish policeman, we gave him five thou – I gave him 5,000 zlotys because he promised that he will let him – that he will work.</span> <span id="s703">Then he gave me back the money [indecipherable] said, we couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s704">And I got a letter from my sister.</span> <span id="s705">She gave somebody to put in the mail, I should never forget her, and I should fight for my life.</span> <span id="s706">This was May 8th, 1943.</span> <span id="s707">Then it was the ghetto, the uprising in ghetto, I never – you know, Poland is well known for uprising, and when I read history [indecipherable] in the 19th century [indecipherable] uprising, and I – as – as dispirit as I was, I was young and – and the first time I saw what it means uprising, you know.</span> <span id="s708">Since I was on the other side of the fence, I wasn’t Polish, I didn’t give a damn.</span> <span id="s709">And when they taking the Volksdeutsche and putting against the wall and killing them, the Polacks.</span> <span id="s710">And again, I was on the train with a woman from the same building where I was working.</span> <span id="s711">And she said, you know what?</span> <span id="s712">The train was going again to some camps, I don’t know, but it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: We’re talking about the October –</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Fifth.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: – 5th, 1944 uprising now?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Uprising was August 1st, 1944.</span> <span id="s719">October 5th, 1944, I left Warsaw.</span> <span id="s720">Not that I left, everybody was evacuated.</span> <span id="s721">The trains were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s722">Where they were going, I think some of them were going to concentration camps, some to labor camp.</span> <span id="s723">The train was stopping on a small si – you know, small villages and we’re going to Piastów.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: What kind of trains were these?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Regular train.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Regular train.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes, Piastów were one of our general signs of capitulation, you know, was – and then she said to me, you know what?</span> <span id="s728">I don’t want to go to any camp, she said to me.</span> <span id="s729">I said, but I don’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s730">She said, I have a friend who has a farm in the – one of the small villages.</span> <span id="s731">Why don’t you go with me?</span> <span id="s732">I say okay, and I went there.</span> <span id="s733">There were five jew – five Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: You got off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: With your friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s738">This wasn’t that the train was speeding, you know, there was – you know, like before the train was stopping, you know.</span> <span id="s739">Many people went because they – they didn’t have where to go, don’t forget.</span> <span id="s740">Polacks, all were mostly Polacks.</span> <span id="s741">This was the worst time for Jews who – which were hidden, because they were the – the color of the walls, you know, they were hidden.</span> <span id="s742">They didn’t see fresh air for so many years, so when they were coming out from those hidden places, you could recognize them right away.</span> <span id="s743">I was looking like milk and honey.</span> <span id="s744">I never suffered hunger.</span> <span id="s745">I – you know, my eyes were smiling, and – and I had guts.</span> <span id="s746">So when we got there, the woman was an alcoholic, a very charming woman, a teacher from profession, whose husband was living with a young girl who was Jewish, was hi – who – whom she was hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: What town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: It was near Poland, Piastów, p-i-a-s-t-o-w.</span> <span id="s749">And then it was October and we were working.</span> <span id="s750">We [indecipherable] there were potatoes and onions, and I had even, you know, a wagon with a horse that we’re sitting, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s751">And the food was scare, but since we had growing there, you know, yeah – we had Christmas there even, and I remember that they killed a goat, which was smelling like anything.</span> <span id="s752">And I remember the first time I saw a girl who had epilepsy attack.</span> <span id="s753">She was younger than me, a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s754">She fell down on the floor and I remember they put a knife with a wooden handle between her teeth.</span> <span id="s755">We don’t do this any more, I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s756">And we’re sitting on – and this woman, she knew.</span> <span id="s757">She didn’t directly, you know, nobody came to her, say I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s758">We didn't confess.</span> <span id="s759">But she, you know, th – was smart enough, but she was – we survived there from October til January eighth, where it was the end of the war for me.</span> <span id="s760">It was one day when the Germans left, and the Russian didn’t come.</span> <span id="s761">I will never forget this day.</span> <span id="s762">And it was a awful day, you know, because here I am, I don’t have to fight for my life, I don’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s763">And why I survive?</span> <span id="s764">What was the purpose?</span> <span id="s765">And I went to my – I went to Warsaw, it was frozen, everything.</span> <span id="s766">Totally frozen, it was a very strong winter.</span> <span id="s767">The Russians were coming and they were looking like beggars.</span> <span id="s768">Sleeping on the ground and the Germans, who are escaping, were looking much better.</span> <span id="s769">And I went to Warsaw, to my – where it was my parents, this house, Zamenhof [indecipherable] was living.</span> <span id="s770">Zamenhof was a guy who this – who started Esperanto, you know.</span> <span id="s771">And I were – and grass was growing there, and I was very glad that there was no sign of this house.</span> <span id="s772">I didn’t – I would be upset if somebody, you know, if people were living there, and – I didn’t want.</span> <span id="s773">I wasn’t ready mentally to walk in and to see what – what’s going on.</span> <span id="s774">And as I was staying, there were two, maybe four young boy soldiers in German – in Russian uniform, you could see that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s775">And they say to me in Polish, you know, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s776">I said, I used to live here.</span> <span id="s777">They said, we used to live here too, we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s778">I said, I am Jewish too.</span> <span id="s779">They – you know, they say, you survived?</span> <span id="s780">Because it was typical what my husband, everybody who survive were sure that I was the only one who survive and a few other people.</span> <span id="s781">But we didn’t know, you know, there was none n-no – no network, nobody was – was bringing the news like years ago in United States by horse, you know, was traveling.</span> <span id="s782">They went back to the truck or something, they brought me cigarettes, I was smoking, and cans.</span> <span id="s783">They say, how did you survive, how is this

and we had the scapegoat, we had black people, which are – refuse any more to be scapegoats, but this can happen.</span> <span id="s980">Even with a strong club, that would happen.</span> <span id="s981">This is the way I feel.</span> <span id="s982">And the more, you know, and – and I was maybe selfish because I wanted to save my own feelings.</span> <span id="s983">I didn’t want to come and to talk and to dig out and then – but at certain moment it was pressure from our son, too, who is a psychiatrist, so – and he said, I remember the holidays and always you were crying.</span> <span id="s984">You know, when Passover, it was Seder or something like this.</span> <span id="s985">And – and you were always talking how was it, you know, and – and the memories and he said now – now that we have holidays, mostly we’re going to her – to my daughter-in-law parents, which are second generate – first gen – her parents were – her parents were from Hungary or Romania and he is too, but they are totally Americanized, very well-to-do people.</span> <span id="s986">And – and they ha – nobody cries, nobody talks about anything.</span> <span id="s987">Th-Th – different story.</span> <span id="s988">However, we’re going for the second Seder to a young couple whose father was an editor of Jewish [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s989">And she reads in Yiddish, you know, about the [indecipherable] ghetto and my son writes in English.</span> <span id="s990">And it has a meaning, you know?</span> <span id="s991">I became more, not religious, only more traditional, you know, yeah.</span> <span id="s992">And I feel this is very little ah – I wou – if – if my son wouldn’t be born here, we wouldn’t circumcise him most likely.</span> <span id="s993">And anyway, he was circumcised by the doctor, not by a moyl.</span> <span id="s994">A-And – however, he – now that I have three grandson, wonderful three boys, and I-I would like – I would like a ni – and I don’t know if I would like because for example, after the war, that I didn’t know that my husband survive or no, I could never marry the Gentile.</span> <span id="s995">And many people just drop – they said – which, you cannot blame them, decided enough of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s996">When I decided to go back to school, you know, I didn’t know – I – I wanted to be a librarian because I liked to read, but then I was discouraged.</span> <span id="s997">And then after thinking over and between my husband and my son, you know, they said that I – I – I – I should help people, you know.</span> <span id="s998">So I was working, when I got my Master’s degree in a state mental institution for 13 years, which wasn’t that rewarding because I couldn’t do too much for them and you need some happy ending.</span> <span id="s999">But I – even there, I was exposed to tremendous suffering, which to compare to my, you know, those were people which were out, totally.</span> <span id="s1000">They di – they didn’t know what – they were for 50 years in a mental institution.</span> <span id="s1001">And then when it came the time for psychotropic drugs, you know, they started to give them, and – and then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell.</span> <span id="s1002">And it – through all those years I did lots of growing you know, between the war and between my work, you know, I became extremely – much more tolerant and – and a much better person than I ever would be, even not all those things.</span> <span id="s1003">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: That’s it?</span> <span id="s1005">Oh – [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Going back to my life during – starting August first, where it was uprising, Polish uprising in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1007">There was time where there was nothing to eat because Warsaw was surrounded by Germans, and on the wa – Vistula river by Russia there was no food coming in.</span> <span id="s1008">All the horses were eaten up.</span> <span id="s1009">This reminds me on the revolution in France when they were eating rats and mice.</span> <span id="s1010">There was – this was Armia Ludowa and Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s1011">This was one which was to the left and one was to the right.</span> <span id="s1012">The Armia Krajowa was very much against Jews.</span> <span id="s1013">I was working there as a clerical person for awhile – End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: – Jewish, and I was working in the building there, who belongs to well know Emil Wedel, who was German descent, but he never declared himself as a German.</span> <span id="s1015">There was a – one of the best factory of chocolate which existed now, E. Wedel, w-e-d-e-l.</span> <span id="s1016">And I – the people were – for whom I was working as a maid were – had the apartment in the same building and the ones, the soldiers who were fighting, the Polish soldiers, not officially soldiers, but to defend Warsaw, they were cooking in our court, this was barley and some kasha, and they were – supposedly told me that it was a horse, but then we find out that it was a – a dog – a dachshund who belong to a well known Polish writer, Maria Rodzewiczkofna, very hard name to pronounce, r-o-d-z-e-w-i-c-z-k-o-f-n-a.</span> <span id="s1017">And then, the second time they caught some kids, I don’t know where, because the uprising started August first and it was til October where the Polish people have to capitulate because the Germans by air were throwing bombs and marching, occupying back the Warsaw which for a short time was in Polish hands.</span> <span id="s1018">And there it was a cat cooked together with all the ingredients.</span> <span id="s1019">When I ate this I didn't know, I didn’t get sick, but I was young, and actually it didn’t matter what I was eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: When you found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: When I found out, yeah.</span> <span id="s1022">But then it was written a book by somebody, by a Polish writer and she mentioned this [indecipherable] dog.</span> <span id="s1023">I don’t know if the dog has a name.</span> <span id="s1024">But anything that was alive those days was doomed to be killed for food.</span> <span id="s1025">One of the – after the war, when we’re – I was working with my husband in Lódz and I saw Mrs. Lempke(ph).</span> <span id="s1026">This was the woman which – where I was working on my last job on a maid.</span> <span id="s1027">She didn't see me, and I said to my husband, you should hit her a few times.</span> <span id="s1028">And my husband said, she is a head taller than me, how can I do it?</span> <span id="s1029">And she wasn’t good to you, you survi – she wasn’t bad to you, you survive.</span> <span id="s1030">So why – why do you want me to harm her?</span> <span id="s1031">I cannot do anything, right?</span> <span id="s1032">And this was the end.</span> <span id="s1033">But I had a strange feeling that always I would – I-I would never go back to Poland, never, never.</span> <span id="s1034">Now we’re – financially we’re okay, that is out of question, but I remember when we we’re struggling, I always used to say, if anybody would put a million dollars under condition that we’ll go to Poland to visit, I wouldn’t go.</span> <span id="s1035">I hate everything that they did for us.</span> <span id="s1036">And I hated that in a normal country like Denmark, even French were – was a excellent underground, although they have their own Gestapo, Maquis and in other countries you hear so many beautiful stories.</span> <span id="s1037">And that’s true that the nuns helped me, and there were other Polacks, but it is such a small percentage.</span> <span id="s1038">Well, a – mostly a – were – where we had th-three and a half million Jews living in Poland, well before Germans enter Warsaw, the Polish people already was beating us up.</span> <span id="s1039">The – before the war, you know, the – there was tremendous hatred always.</span> <span id="s1040">And I am sorry that I was born in Poland, not here.</span> <span id="s1041">Joe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Any other –</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Do you want –</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: – stories that you remember, that you would like to add, any other –</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: I tell you, I had a good childhood, and I was 20 years old in 1939, and looking back, you know, maybe I didn’t know any better.</span> <span id="s1046">However, when I think – when I got my – graduated gymnasium, I thought that I would conquer the world.</span> <span id="s1047">I had so many dreams which were never fulfilled, and I didn’t realize, maybe because I was stupid, or young, that so many things were off the limits for us Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s1048">They were talking about engineers jokingly, that they are to measure the street.</span> <span id="s1049">The doctors, if they didn’t marry the rich girl, he couldn’t open the office.</span> <span id="s1050">Lawyers, the bar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young one.</span> <span id="s1051">A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew couldn’t be a chimney cleaner.</span> <span id="s1052">A Jew couldn’t get a city job.</span> <span id="s1053">And now living here for 44 years and to see what the opportunities everybody can have, I am for sure reinforce that it was the wrong place of birth for us.</span> <span id="s1054">And I see how people are coming from different country, working in my capacity, what the help they getting, what the chances they have to be somebody, to develop, to educate.</span> <span id="s1055">To compare to Poland and being born and being Polish citizen and fighting the Polish wars, we couldn’t get any place.</span> <span id="s1056">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1057">Whatever I will say more will be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span
