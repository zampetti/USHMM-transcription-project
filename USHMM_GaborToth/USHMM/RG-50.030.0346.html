your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s22">It was a vary large family.</span> <span id="s23">My parents, sisters, and brothersI mean, my mother had about seven siblings.</span> <span id="s24">And my father, the same.</span> <span id="s25">And for instance, on Purim we're gathering all of us in the house of my grandma.</span> <span id="s26">And it was.....</span></p> <p><span id="s27">01:02:21</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Stop tape.</span> <span id="s29">We have to do this again.</span> <span id="s30">Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Now, as an example, for instance, on Purim we were all gathering at my grandma's house.</span> <span id="s32">It was grandma Weingarten.</span> <span id="s33">And it was extremely festive, you know.</span> <span id="s34">On Purim, you bring schlackamonies.</span> <span id="s35">So there were just beautiful cakes, and what they call torte, and there was fruit.</span> <span id="s36">And everybody gathered there, all my cousins, and all my aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s37">And usually, it lastedthere was one cousin who played the violin.</span> <span id="s38">And that was Itzic (ph) Weingarten.</span> <span id="s39">And then weit was very nice for us children because we had to stay up longer.</span> <span id="s40">And then when we came to our house, the manager of the house came out, and we have to ring the bell, and he opened the gate.</span> <span id="s41">And for us children, it was a big happening coming so late.</span> <span id="s42">And heand it was Purim.</span> <span id="s43">But it must have been cold because he was coming out with a fur coat.</span> <span id="s44">And it was a good life.</span> <span id="s45">We were to our grandma's we surely went by druzka, which was a horsehorse‑drawn carriage.</span> <span id="s46">And there was always a lot of fun too.</span> <span id="s47">We met the cousins.</span> <span id="s48">There were my aunts.</span> <span id="s49">And in the summer, in the beginning, we used to go to a spa, like Rainitza (ph), or Rapka (ph).</span> <span id="s50">And later on, we built a house in Portumbina (ph).</span> <span id="s51">And it was onethere were, like, four apartments.</span> <span id="s52">And one was ours, and the other one we use to rent out.</span> <span id="s53">In fact, I have a picture in front of it.</span> <span id="s54">It was beautiful there too.</span> <span id="s55">And we were spending the vacations there.</span> <span id="s56">So life was pretty normal and very much based on family.</span> <span id="s57">I was going to school.</span> <span id="s58">It was called gymnasium imienia Hochsztajnowei.</span> <span id="s59">And it was a lovely school.</span> <span id="s60">It was so beautiful there.</span> <span id="s61">In our auditorium, the floor was like a mirror.</span> <span id="s62">And when we came to school, we had to change shoes.</span> <span id="s63">And we often had concerts in school.</span> <span id="s64">We had the grand piano.</span> <span id="s65">And there was oftenChopin was often being played.</span> <span id="s66">When I hear Chopin now, I remember it.</span> <span id="s67">And my brother was going also to a school.</span> <span id="s68">And in the afternoon, he had to go to a parochial school to learn more Hebrew and so on.</span> <span id="s69">And we used to play.</span> <span id="s70">I remember we played train, I and him, in the house when our housekeeper put the chairs in the middle so that she could clean them.</span> <span id="s71">And there were holidays.</span> <span id="s72">There were beautiful occasions.</span> <span id="s73">There were summer outings.</span> <span id="s74">There were picnics.</span> <span id="s75">And all of a sudden, like a lightening from the sky actually, everything changed.</span> <span id="s76">And, of course, we had no idea that anything like that could actually happen.</span> <span id="s77">And so there were actually clouds in the sky.</span> <span id="s78">There was bunchen where the people from Germany were coming.</span> <span id="s79">But somehow, when you live a normal life, you just don't think and don't believe of such a possibility.</span> <span id="s80">My father didafter the Germans entered Lodz, he predicted certainI mean, even before, he predicted certain things.</span> <span id="s81">And I asked him, "If that's what you believe, why aren't we leaving?"</span> <span id="s82">.</span> <span id="s83">First, there was no place to leave.</span> <span id="s84">And then you have really to have guts and you have reallyto be able to leave.</span> <span id="s85">But there was no place to leave.</span> <span id="s86">Nobody wanted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">01:06:31</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Let me stop you a minute.</span> <span id="s89">Was your family fairly religious?</span> <span id="s90">You had mentioned Purim.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">We actually celebrated all the holidays.</span> <span id="s93">And my father was rather religious.</span> <span id="s94">He wasat the same time, he spoke French and he spoke German.</span> <span id="s95">He was a wizard in mathematics.</span> <span id="s96">And, of course, we had a business.</span> <span id="s97">The business was on Ostrowska 10 and polizei station.</span> <span id="s98">And it was Golontaria Emenya Weingartenya (ph).</span> <span id="s99">And everybody in Lodz knew that place.</span> <span id="s100">And today, I sometimes meet people here even in Los Angeles who said, "Of course, we were going there."</span> <span id="s101">We had a very good name.</span> <span id="s102">Everybody was safe because in Lodz, at that time, you didn't have prices on any articles.</span> <span id="s103">But they knew you could send a check to that store and they would be treated fairly.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">01:07:36</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: What kind of store was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: If somebody is familiar with the Silk Shop, which used to be in Los Angeles, it was very similar.</span> <span id="s107">There were wools, and lace, and buttons, and gloves, and hats, andI mean, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s108">And it was in existence for a very long time, until the Germans took the keys away.</span> <span id="s109">And so my father's family was more religious than my mother's family.</span> <span id="s110">But we celebrated all the holidays.</span> <span id="s111">And our Passover was just fantastic.</span> <span id="s112">It was so beautiful andit was so beautiful, I remember that weI used fall asleep finally, because it lasted so long.</span> <span id="s113">But all theit was just beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Did you</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: You asked me about the school, sorry if I interrupt?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">01:08:36</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s118">I was wondering if you had any Christian friends or if you really lived in a Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: It's very interesting.</span> <span id="s120">We lived in a Jewish community.</span> <span id="s121">The manager of the apartment house was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s122">And in our summer house, the keeper of the grounds was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s123">And some of the housekeepers at my grandma's house were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s124">But, in generally, we were actuallywe thought that everybody was Jewish.</span> <span id="s125">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Large Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: It was a very large Jewish community.</span> <span id="s128">Lodz wasI understand there were 250,000 Jews or more.</span> <span id="s129">It was a textile in the street there and it was called the Polish Mattress Stash.</span> <span id="s130">And so when some of thisof the big industrialists in textile were going to our school.</span> <span id="s131">It was Vininsky (ph), Korn (ph), and others.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">01:09:46</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you experience any anti‑Semitism or you just weren't around it?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Oh, we felt it.</span> <span id="s135">Somehow we did feel it.</span> <span id="s136">We knew that it exist.</span> <span id="s137">We felt it much more beforeafter Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s138">That really felt it and I remember one program.</span> <span id="s139">We went to the summer house all the father, I and Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the window because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there is a program andbut we were able to somehow safely reach our house.</span> <span id="s140">And there was some times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it had much to do with anti‑Semitism.</span> <span id="s141">That ....</span> <span id="s142">did that answer your question?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">01:11:01</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war?</span> <span id="s146">See, that school I was going to was a private school and I started the school from the first grade and then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and theyI had my papers graduation papers.</span> <span id="s147">I thought they were very important.</span> <span id="s148">Dave, my husband, saw them and when we went to Auschwitz I thought it would be helpful.</span> <span id="s149">I put it in my stocking.</span> <span id="s150">But of course, it wasn't helpful.</span> <span id="s151">I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to Warsaw, but it's notnot really important right now.</span> <span id="s152">So it wasit was actually a good life.</span> <span id="s153">It was a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s154">We also had very high morals and ethics.</span> <span id="s155">And I remember that when the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was concerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more assimilated home and she didn't want to go out I said, "Genya, they're doing it to us.</span> <span id="s156">They are the perpetrators.</span> <span id="s157">Let them be ashamed.</span> <span id="s158">Why should we be ashamed to wear the star?"</span> <span id="s159">And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my house and we knew much about charity.</span> <span id="s160">My father used to always to say "It's not enough to give.</span> <span id="s161">It's important how you give."</span> <span id="s162">I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who needed help.</span> <span id="s163">There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father was bringing from the House Of Prayers a guest which is called the orrach, and he was sitting with us at the table and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to take with him and nobody asked him any questions.</span> <span id="s164">It was a charitable atmosphere in our family.</span> <span id="s165">For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her daughter says, "Don't let him in anymore."</span> <span id="s166">She says, "Look, if he wouldn't have needed the spoons, he wouldn't have taken them."</span> <span id="s167">So considering the high ethics and high morals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on are possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">01:14:00</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: One more question about before the war.</span> <span id="s170">Were you involved in any political or Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I knew of their existence.</span> <span id="s172">I knew of their existence.</span> <span id="s173">However, inin retrospect I know that it wasactually the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s174">Because if you have an idea, no matter how impossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it?</span> <span id="s175">Because the first there is an idea always and there are deeds following it.</span> <span id="s176">But because of the background and because of the school I was not involved in it.</span> <span id="s177">I remember a certain time somebody wanted totome to join, but I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">01:14:55</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing.</span> <span id="s181">They put up some</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: What was the, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s183">What was the date, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September.</span> <span id="s185">And some gallows were put on in Lodz and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as many as possible people would see it.</span> <span id="s186">When they entered Lodz they somehow wanted to harass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our house and they wanted my father.</span> <span id="s187">People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to actual work.</span> <span id="s188">Some people were, for instance, bringing furniture up the set floor and the others were suppose to take it down and so on.</span> <span id="s189">It was just shear harassment.</span> <span id="s190">Shear torment.</span> <span id="s191">Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father was still going to the store and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was going with him and he called me his angel.</span> <span id="s192">I had long brown hair and somehow I was very often able to talk the German out of letting him go.</span> <span id="s193">I remember that one time wethey brought us into a court yard and they left.</span> <span id="s194">Andbut it was a very frightening time because it was a very unsure time becauseand what was so tragic about it the Germans actually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children standing on the street and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that they were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it?</span> <span id="s195">You know, very often I'm thinking about it.</span> <span id="s196">Where does all this, I mean, it'sit's based onon the teaching unfortunately of the church which I hope is being changed.</span> <span id="s197">But in Poland it will take a very, very long time until it would be changed.</span> <span id="s198">I heard somebody saying that he got this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother.</span> <span id="s199">Becauseand as I understand, that the church, theanyhow the Catholic Church since Pope the 23rd, is realizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of the church.</span> <span id="s200">Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and their changes areare going on.</span> <span id="s201">I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good heart and I'm glad that there is from the Vatican some directions now to change the liturgy.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">01:18:48</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s204">We were talking about how the Polish people wouldwould turn you in.</span> <span id="s205">What else was happening on the streets at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: It was especiallyfor instance, it was so dangerous that my parents decided to send Lolick, my brother, to a smaller city where his closest friends were living.</span> <span id="s207">In the hope that he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad there.</span> <span id="s208">There was also much more difficult to get fuel.</span> <span id="s209">Much more difficult to get food, so we were living in one room in order to save fuel.</span> <span id="s210">We could sometimesof course we couldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food.</span> <span id="s211">It was dangerous to get out of the house.</span> <span id="s212">It was dangerous to be in the house because they were just coming in and pulling you out.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">01:19:52</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Were there any bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s216">In fact, we went to a cellar.</span> <span id="s217">Weyou know, there were cellars where people were keeping the food to keep it cold and we were hiding there because there were some raids.</span> <span id="s218">That was in the period, the short period, before the German army actually entered Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">01:20:24</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: So how long didhow long did this last?</span> <span id="s221">The Germans were in thethe Germans came in, they were around all the time harassing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, they were harassing people and one day when I brought my father to the store some Germans approached him and told him they wanted the keys to the store.</span> <span id="s223">We just had to hand it over.</span> <span id="s224">Now, we probably were expecting it and were bringing certain materials from the store and hiding it under the hardwood floors and we hid there also some Torahs.</span> <span id="s225">Maybe I'll mention it later, but when we were in the ghetto the manager, we assume, or we actually know that the manager of that apartment house informed the German about it and my brother was taken to the Kripo and from the Kripo he had to go to our apartment house and toto show them where everything is and they removed everything.</span> <span id="s226">And it wasyou know, it was a veryit was a very dangerous, dangerous time because there were shootings.</span> <span id="s227">There were shootings at that time and thisthis constant harassment, you don't know whether a person would go out on the street or even from his house and he would come back alive because the torture was quite perverse.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">01:22:10</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So, did you stay in most of the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the house.</span> <span id="s231">I remember one time when they came and we hid my father in the bathroom, but it didn't help.</span> <span id="s232">We had to show them where he is and they pulled him out.</span> <span id="s233">And he wasn'the was very spiritual and he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically.</span> <span id="s234">But he actually survived at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">01:22:47</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did the Germans promelgate a bunch of decrees?</span> <span id="s237">Were there new laws, things you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s239">Yes.</span> <span id="s240">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: First they liquidated all our stores.</span> <span id="s243">We couldn't own any stores.</span> <span id="s244">I'm sure there was a catch for us.</span> <span id="s245">The amount of food we could get was limited.</span> <span id="s246">Of course, I couldn'tthe schools were closed.</span> <span id="s247">Our schools were closed.</span> <span id="s248">We hadwe hadactually, the minute they came in we were prisoners.</span> <span id="s249">We were prisoners and as an example of it they were putting up gallows and, you know, hanging people.</span> <span id="s250">And, our dignity was taken awayI mean, it mythe way I feel it, my dignity was never taken away.</span> <span id="s251">Not even in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s252">I never felt inferior to them.</span> <span id="s253">It could be with the teaching ofthe teaching atmosphere of my house I felt that the ones who do the wrong they should be ashamed of myof themselves and when I heard somebody say that he felt inferior during this time it struck me actually because II never felt inferior.</span> <span id="s254">Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">01:24:20</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Did all these changes happen right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Right away.</span> <span id="s258">Right away, but the taking out of theI mean, theasking for the keys of the store because I remember I was still taking my father to the store for a short time and before he had to hand over the keys.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: You must have been fairly terrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: We were fairly terrified.</span> <span id="s261">It was, they were a very terrified times.</span> <span id="s262">Very terrified time.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">01:24:55</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Did your family have any plans or you were just going to....</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: There was no way.</span> <span id="s266">There was absolutely no way.</span> <span id="s267">You live a normal life and something which is beyond your many imagination happens you cannot prepare for it.</span> <span id="s268">There was no way to prepare there were some very very rich people who were somehow able toto reach a different country.</span> <span id="s269">However, even the people of Germany who would have left Germany couldn't.</span> <span id="s270">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s271">Eveneven a ship wasa ship was sent aware form the shores of the United States.</span> <span id="s272">The white paper was issued and there was no entrance to Palestine.</span> <span id="s273">Otherwise, some people could have maybe reached Palestine.</span> <span id="s274">No other country would have opened the door, so, I mean, we were just boxed in.</span> <span id="s275">Completely boxed in.</span> <span id="s276">And, so some people did leave to Russia, for Russia.</span> <span id="s277">And a friend of mythe closest friend of my brother left for Russia and survived, and he asked, he came to our house and asked my father's permission that Lolick should go too.</span> <span id="s278">And I do understand my father ononin a way because he said we all should stay together.</span> <span id="s279">Nobody could have predicted what would happen and he said no.</span> <span id="s280">And Lolick was an extremelyfirst he was absolutely gorgeous.</span> <span id="s281">He was so handsome that when he was helping out sometimes in the store people would say "Go to that store just to take a look at that guy because he's so handsome."</span> <span id="s282">Then he was extremely talented.</span> <span id="s283">As a child he was curious how the grandfather's clock is working.</span> <span id="s284">So he took it apart and when he couldn't put it together he used a string, but the clock was working.</span> <span id="s285">I mean, by losing him, of course I lost a brother, but the world lost something too.</span> <span id="s286">And when we considered all these people who were burned, gassed, tortured, murdered, the world lost something too because they were scientists and they were future doctors and they were future physicists and they were just people who learned from childhood, charity.</span> <span id="s287">And that you are not living only for yourself, but you're living only for others.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">01:28:08</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: At what point did the ghetto come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Um</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: What did you findI mean, how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s293">There were announcements that we better go to the ghetto or else they'd be shooting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: When was this do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: That was in 191940.</span> <span id="s296">It was maybe six months after the Germans entered Warsaw.</span> <span id="s297">I guess when we went to the ghetto it must have been somehow the beginning of April and theyso we just had to go because otherwise, we would have been killed.</span> <span id="s298">And fortunately there was a neighbor of our's who was very helpful because she said she had some kind of a wagon and why don't we go with her?</span> <span id="s299">So we packed some belongings.</span> <span id="s300">Not much of furniture and we went.</span> <span id="s301">It was very very traumatic.</span> <span id="s302">I was a pretty pampered child.</span> <span id="s303">I wasn't a child anymore, I was 17.</span> <span id="s304">But I was pretty pampered and I couldn't take it so I kept fainting and there was no, there were only lavoratorythere was no, you know, accomadations for bathrooms or anything like that.</span> <span id="s305">And I remember we stayed there and then Ciotka [aunt] Hannah (ph) came and Uncle Moshe (ph) came and we all were sleeping on the floor and then some how somebody told us about the room of the Fresetska (ph) eight.</span> <span id="s306">I think it was the same neighbor and that was one room.</span> <span id="s307">We lived in this room and that was my father, my mother, my brother, myself and later on during one deportation there was also Ottos.</span> <span id="s308">Ottos</span></p> <p><span id="s309">02:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: You know, I'mWhat had you decided to take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: The time was very limited.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: When you went to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes, and the amount of things we could take on this wagon was also very limited and, of course, we didn't have anybody ecspecially to help us, but anyhow I remember when theI remember that we had a bed.</span> <span id="s314">And I remember that we had one piece of furniture which must have come from our kitchen.</span> <span id="s315">We had also a table and we had chairs and the room wasn't very large and whatwhen ever I think about that place on Fresetska eight, who wasn'twhich wasn't very big and was the kitchen and everything was in this one room, I have to give an enormous credit to my wonderful mother because it was extremely clean.</span> <span id="s316">Always, extremely clean.</span> <span id="s317">We're cooking there and sometimes I think about it, how was she able to keep this place such meticulously clean.</span> <span id="s318">And later on after one deportation Ottos, our cousin, was adopted by us.</span> <span id="s319">I think it had to be done so that they have his name in the register so, that's why he was really adopted.</span> <span id="s320">And he came to us with a skin disease and my mother bathed him and cured him and my father got infected and she bathed my father, and she cured him.</span> <span id="s321">And my mother was absolutely a very remarkable women.</span> <span id="s322">She was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s323">She found a job for herself, by herself.</span> <span id="s324">She was doing somesome working with a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s325">She cooked where ever there was some food to cook.</span> <span id="s326">She keeped everything clean and I know that at a certain time she was going to sick people and she was washing them.</span> <span id="s327">She was washing their bodies.</span> <span id="s328">And thats why the tragedy ofwhen ever the tragedy was touching my mother she never complained, but it was very very painful to me andif I think about the time we were taken to the Kripo.</span> <span id="s329">Kripo was the Kriminal Polizei.</span> <span id="s330">They were actually having a building within the ghetto and since we were considered well to do in the ghetto, I mean, beforethey assumed that we had some valuables which they wanted to have.</span> <span id="s331">Now first it was only my father who was being taken to the Kripo.</span> <span id="s332">We were just petrified of the thoughts that they were going to take him and whether he would come back.</span> <span id="s333">Many people didn't come back from the Kripo.</span> <span id="s334">The Jewish authorities were notified to take the corpse away from Kripo.</span> <span id="s335">My father never disclosed anything and the strength hishis spiritual and strength to be able to take thebecause they were actually whipping and hurting him and he came back and he didn't disclose anything.</span> <span id="s336">One time, they took my mother and I remember exactly.</span> <span id="s337">I was standing there when they took her and fortunately they came later on for me because I was very much afraid about her not that that I could do any help.</span> <span id="s338">I remember I walked into the Kripo, the cellars, in the cellars, there were the torture chairthere were the cells, where we were kept and in the back were the torture chambers.</span> <span id="s339">So when you were sitting in the cellar you could hear cries and screams.</span> <span id="s340">Andbut when I walked in there and this head of the Kripo, I think his name was Stutar (ph), was standing there and I laughed.</span> <span id="s341">I was laughing in his face and he says "Das Lachen wird dir hier vergehen," which means "The laughter will stop here.</span> <span id="s342">Your laughter will stop here."</span> <span id="s343">And I was also taken to theto the chambers and I was also tortured, but not to a degree that, you know, that I had to be hospitalized or something like that.</span> <span id="s344">And finally, I don't know how it happened that they werereleased us.</span> <span id="s345">Itthe whole time we were in the ghetto, there was always an enormous fear that we would go to the Kripo.</span> <span id="s346">And I remember when my father was in Kripo, when I was very concerned that he is not coming back, and he is not coming back.</span> <span id="s347">I went to his brother's house.</span> <span id="s348">The brother was already deported.</span> <span id="s349">But his two sonsone son was there.</span> <span id="s350">And the son was very religious.</span> <span id="s351">He was the one who was playing the violin so beautiful.</span> <span id="s352">And he was a real genius.</span> <span id="s353">And he says he was very religious.</span> <span id="s354">He said to me, "Look.</span> <span id="s355">It's Friday night, and we didn't light the candles yet.</span> <span id="s356">So until we light the candles, he might still come back."</span> <span id="s357">I just remember what he was saying.</span> <span id="s358">Even in the ghetto, we tried to remember when it's Friday.</span> <span id="s359">And on certain holidays, we made somemother prepared something from the grass, or from the leaves, or something which was appropriate for that particular holiday.</span> <span id="s360">Now, you want to ask me something?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">02:06:57</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s364">Now, the problems in the ghetto were hunger, lack of fuel.</span> <span id="s365">But the worse of the worse was, the constant, deportations.</span> <span id="s366">And you could never be sure that, what is not being deported.</span> <span id="s367">Andbut there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by the Germans.</span> <span id="s368">The other deportationswhen they hit somebody, of course, it was very tragic.</span> <span id="s369">So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought that we were going to places that they would gas us in some wagons.</span> <span id="s370">In the beginning, they are telling us, they are taking people to work.</span> <span id="s371">And there was a small number of people who were deported from the ghetto for the purpose of working in Germany, or in the territories.</span> <span id="s372">In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time from a working camp.</span> <span id="s373">But they took himafter a very short time, they took him again.</span> <span id="s374">I don't know whether to a working camp.</span> <span id="s375">Very likely, yes.</span> <span id="s376">But it was torturous work.</span> <span id="s377">So we did not know.</span> <span id="s378">We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to death, or gassed, or murdered.</span> <span id="s379">And this Germans were master of deceit.</span> <span id="s380">Before theythe deportation to Auschwitz, there were loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s381">And I don't know who, in particular, it was.</span> <span id="s382">But it was people.</span> <span id="s383">And they were assuring us that we should take everything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better working camp.</span> <span id="s384">And I remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible.</span> <span id="s385">They say, "Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better place"and I was sick already at that time.</span> <span id="s386">So I was just watching them.</span> <span id="s387">But they were packing.</span> <span id="s388">Now, the deportationgoing back to the deportation.</span> <span id="s389">There were always deportations.</span> <span id="s390">There was a list made, which in view of what happenedthis was, I think, '42, Septemberthe alternativethe other alternative was verywas terrible.</span> <span id="s391">They justI amthey just came into the ghetto with trucks and with wagons, they ordered a gehsperren, which means, you know, a curfewthey ordered a curfew and they said that they would take all elderly people, they would take children, and takewe areif anybody would hide in the apartment, they would be shot.</span> <span id="s392">What I didI knewmy mother was actually in her 40s.</span> <span id="s393">But she already had gray hair.</span> <span id="s394">And I was very much afraid for her, that they would take her.</span> <span id="s395">I don't know how I did it.</span> <span id="s396">But I took her to the part of the ghetto which they already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there.</span> <span id="s397">But I had to run back because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the courtyard for them to do the selection.</span> <span id="s398">And then I went back and brought her home.</span> <span id="s399">Now, that was a terrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a wagon, or run to a place that they didn't want to, or whatever.</span> <span id="s400">They were all shooting.</span> <span id="s401">They were just shooting.</span> <span id="s402">They were taking some people who were younger.</span> <span id="s403">They did not really select only the older, the elderly, ones.</span> <span id="s404">It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying deportation.</span> <span id="s405">So there's no excuse for anything.</span> <span id="s406">However, maybe because none of my family was deportedso I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother.</span> <span id="s407">In comparison with the alternative, the alternative would have beenI'm talking about the listthe alternative would have been that they would enter the ghetto and just shoot whomever they wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin with.</span> <span id="s408">And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know about Auschwitz, which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the outside would not somehow give us, because they knew.</span> <span id="s409">They knew where Auschwitz was, and they knew what was going on in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s410">Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to be deported.</span> <span id="s411">What happenedmy mother was at her sister's, and I was home, and that Sonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported.</span> <span id="s412">And he hid.</span> <span id="s413">But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the hiding, and they took him.</span> <span id="s414">And I had only one solution.</span> <span id="s415">See, he was very sick in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s416">He was sick with typhus.</span> <span id="s417">And he wasthat was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and his eyes were not completely closed, only partial.</span> <span id="s418">And finally, it was so hard on me to look at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the windowwe had the shutters closedand looking through the shutters whether he is still there.</span> <span id="s419">And my mother, did everything possiblewe got some food for himshe washed him, she bathed him.</span> <span id="s420">And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart specialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s421">02:13:59 And Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected.</span> <span id="s422">And everybody suspected its typhus also.</span> <span id="s423">But if it would beif they would have taken him to the hospitalof contagious diseasesyou would have never come out.</span> <span id="s424">Nobody came out of there.</span> <span id="s425">Andbutso he was finally taken to the hospital, a regular hospital.</span> <span id="s426">And fortunately, this was not at the time.</span> <span id="s427">Because later on, the German took all the patients from all the hospitals, including the children's hospital, and deported them.</span> <span id="s428">But that was earlier.</span> <span id="s429">He reported that he was going to work.</span> <span id="s430">But I knew Doctor Yorkiche.</span> <span id="s431">And Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and who is notno, I mean,so I ran to her, and I said, "Do you remember how sick he was?</span> <span id="s432">Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take him."</span> <span id="s433">So we were togetherand maybe I should inject it now.</span> <span id="s434">When you philosophically think about life, it's true.</span> <span id="s435">They didn't survive.</span> <span id="s436">I'm the only one who survived.</span> <span id="s437">But everydayI mean, the life is not forever anyhow.</span> <span id="s438">So that we were together and that we were together until Auschwitz has its great value.</span> <span id="s439">And when we talk about going to Auschwitz, I will mention to you that we had a day extra.</span> <span id="s440">But I think I should do it later.</span> <span id="s441">My father was also sick.</span> <span id="s442">But he also recovered.</span> <span id="s443">And he had a work, which was much too much for his physical strength.</span> <span id="s444">Sobut I was able to find him some other work.</span> <span id="s445">I felt always some responsibility for everybody.</span> <span id="s446">When my brother was sick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him.</span> <span id="s447">And I always tried to get something.</span> <span id="s448">I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able to go to the resort ofI mean, the place where there were vegetablesand get the potato, or get something.</span> <span id="s449">But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation.</span> <span id="s450">And I, actually, was never used towasn't a big eater.</span> <span id="s451">But I was the one who had swollenwho had edema.</span> <span id="s452">And later onthat was already '43.</span> <span id="s453">'43I may be jumping aroundbut in '43, many people had tuberculosis, many people had pleurisy, the worst diseases, which were the result of starvation, because there was very little food.</span> <span id="s454">It was an accumulated process.</span> <span id="s455">The body was being starved and being starved and being starved.</span> <span id="s456">In the beginning, you saw people in the ghetto who were much slimmer than they used to be.</span> <span id="s457">You could see it in their clothes.</span> <span id="s458">You could see, when you look at them, they had funny color of skin.</span> <span id="s459">But later on, there were people working with a lot of edema.</span> <span id="s460">It was from malnutrition.</span> <span id="s461">And there were many people dying of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s462">Most of the pathological diseases somehow disappeared, like my father who used to have diabetes.</span> <span id="s463">He didn't have it.</span> <span id="s464">My mother used to have a kidney stone.</span> <span id="s465">She didn't have the kidney stone.</span> <span id="s466">It was mostly the effect of malnutrition.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">02:18:05</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Tell me a little bit about the food situation.</span> <span id="s469">How did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: There were portioned.</span> <span id="s471">And they weresee, depending what the German appropriatedfor the ghetto population.</span> <span id="s472">It was known in the administration of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s473">They were also very good at knowing where people lived, where people worked, how many people died, how many peoplemost of the time, they even knew how many people are deported.</span> <span id="s474">Only the time when the Germans deported people, probably, they were not able to have the real good statistics.</span> <span id="s475">So they were able to fix the rations forbased on how much food it was.</span> <span id="s476">Now, there were sometimes starvation rations.</span> <span id="s477">Now, people who had worked were entitled to a soup.</span> <span id="s478">The soup was actually some vegetables and it wasn't much.</span> <span id="s479">But it was something.</span> <span id="s480">And we all were working.</span> <span id="s481">So we all had the soup.</span> <span id="s482">And the rations of food were sometimes very, very small.</span> <span id="s483">But it was, I was able sometimes to get an additional soup, or something additional.</span> <span id="s484">We somehowI mean, I was actually the smallest eater before the war.</span> <span id="s485">I hadI had signs of starvations already.</span> <span id="s486">And soI sometimes think about it.</span> <span id="s487">How that everybodythere was very little food.</span> <span id="s488">But it wasn't likeyou know, sometimes you stand in line, and you say, "No, we ran out of food."</span> <span id="s489">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s490">Everybodythat's a little minimal, that very little was substandard.</span> <span id="s491">I mean, and it was not sufficient, it was a starvation diet.</span> <span id="s492">But everybody got it.</span> <span id="s493">And here, maybemaybe we should give thought to the way the administration of the ghetto has been formed and of their functioning, that they were able to provide everybody with what little it was.</span> <span id="s494">But everybody got it.</span> <span id="s495">It was never a situation that somebody was completely left out.</span> <span id="s496">And also, most of the time in the ghetto, maybe not at the very end, I don't recall any time where there was ever corpses on the street, or where there waswe had toit had to be clean, because the Germans would notwould have closed us up and finished the ghetto off.</span> <span id="s497">And also, there were in the beginning, and now later on too, but people were afterthey were afraid to go the hospital, because they were afraid they would be deported the wayit was a big tragedy.</span> <span id="s498">Human life, as I see it, was very important to everybody in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s499">Because I recall that wethere was a little bit of land at Fresetska eight.</span> <span id="s500">And it has been divided so that we cannot at the very beginning, but later onit was divided so that we could grow some tomatoes, or onions, or what have you.</span> <span id="s501">And I, we had also a piece of land.</span> <span id="s502">Now, I don't recall that anybody stole anybody's vegetables, and really don't recall it.</span> <span id="s503">And I am very impressedI am very impressed with it.</span> <span id="s504">And as far as the neighbors, where my brother would sleep, they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s505">They disappeared.</span> <span id="s506">They must have been deported.</span> <span id="s507">The neighbor who came with us, who helped us with that wagonthey were deported.</span> <span id="s508">And they had a little child.</span> <span id="s509">In '43, you didn't see any children.</span> <span id="s510">There were no children in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s511">In the very beginning, the administration in the ghetto tried to have schools.</span> <span id="s512">One time, there was even a graduation.</span> <span id="s513">And to keep up, you know, the intellectual part of life so that we can survive intellectually.</span> <span id="s514">Now, about the German Jews who came in, I remember them.</span> <span id="s515">They were so different.</span> <span id="s516">They were, like, normal people.</span> <span id="s517">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">02:23:08</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Well, before you tell me about them, when did they come in and how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Must have beenwait for just a second.</span> <span id="s521">They might have come in in 1941.</span> <span id="s522">1942 was that big, big deportation.</span> <span id="s523">And they were deported before.</span> <span id="s524">So it must have been, like, 1941, or something like that.</span> <span id="s525">They came from the lawyers, Germans, Germans who have the iron crosses, I mean, some Mischlings, which means they were married to Jews, some whose ancestry was discovered that they were Jewish, some who were actually Jewish.</span> <span id="s526">But when they came in, they were normal people.</span> <span id="s527">We were not normal people anymore, not in ournot in our looks, or not in our way of life.</span> <span id="s528">Maybe, some intellectually, actually were.</span> <span id="s529">And they alsosome of them brought farce (ph) with them, or different clothes.</span> <span id="s530">But it was tragic, because it was a very short time they were so miserable.</span> <span id="s531">They were so miserable.</span> <span id="s532">But there were also many lawyers.</span> <span id="s533">And some of the lawyers were, had positions later on as prosecutors and judges in the courts.</span> <span id="s534">There were courts in the ghetto, and there were judges in the ghetto, and there was a priest in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s535">And soand then most of them, the majority of themthere were some rumors that about 20,000 came in.</span> <span id="s536">But many of them, afterwards, were deported.</span> <span id="s537">And there were many musicians.</span> <span id="s538">And at the end of the ghetto, all the instruments, musical instruments, had been requisitionedrequisitioned.</span> <span id="s539">I will just repeat that.</span> <span id="s540">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">02:25:26</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: When the German transports came into the ghetto, did they mix with thewith the rest of you, or did they keep to themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: It probably varied.</span> <span id="s544">For instance, it varied.</span> <span id="s545">There was one big industrialist Hirsch (ph).</span> <span id="s546">And I know that my husband let him come to his office where he was and</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Your present husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: My present.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Not your husband in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s551">That's my first husband.</span> <span id="s552">And I was not married</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: No, I know that.</span> <span id="s554">But when you say, "my husband" you're talking about fifty years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s556">Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s557">My present husband, right.</span> <span id="s558">And he washe wasit was a Mr. Hirsch.</span> <span id="s559">And hehe washe kept exempt so that he could get us toso there was something.</span> <span id="s560">Of course, I'm sure theywhen they looked at us, not properly dressed that there was malnutrition and we probably looked like heck.</span> <span id="s561">So of course, I'm sure they felt superior.</span> <span id="s562">So unfortunately, after a not very long time, they didn't look very much different than we did.</span> <span id="s563">But many talented people werewere incorporated in the administration of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s564">And the, the musicians werethere were, sometimes, concerts.</span> <span id="s565">So they were active there.</span> <span id="s566">And the lawyers wereweresome of them were active as judges.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: In order to bring in all these new people, did it just get more crowded, or had the ghetto been cleared of a lot of</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: At this time, it had been cleared somewhat, but not completely, because there were people coming from other places, from ghettos which had been closed, like Pabanitzya (ph), Suskavolya (ph), and others.</span> <span id="s569">It was a problem.</span> <span id="s570">And that whatin retrospect or maybe even then, this very well organized administration of the ghetto, with all its flaws and so on, was able toto somehow incorporate them, maybe first not in apartments.</span> <span id="s571">But they were incorporated, and they weregiven foodthey were also buying food with their fares and with the fixed wage they brought.</span> <span id="s572">But each time there was an influx, somehowsomehow, the administration of the ghetto was doing something about incorporation.</span> <span id="s573">But later on, there was so many deportations that the ghetto shrunk.</span> <span id="s574">I mean, you could see when you walked that the ghetto's shrinking.</span> <span id="s575">I don't know whetherwhat, maybe, not even one third of the population was there when we were ready to go to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">02:28:39</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Was thereyou've mentioned a number of things like concerts, schools, all this.</span> <span id="s578">So there was</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: In the very beginning.</span> <span id="s580">It was in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s581">Because then, when the older kids and everybody has to workand I understand children who were very young had also to work, so that there wasthe schools were only in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s582">Later on, we could not have any schools.</span> <span id="s583">They went to middling schools and ifif a person wouldn't work, they could be deported.</span> <span id="s584">They had to work.</span> <span id="s585">And they took, in this awful deportation in 1942children were taken away.</span> <span id="s586">And before we went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s587">There were no children in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s588">I heard of aof a which, Dave my present husband witnessed and mother.</span> <span id="s589">See, the Germans were masters of deceit.</span> <span id="s590">So they were telling stories, like, they were going to take the children and they should be make to look pretty, by whichever means is possible, and that they would be going to better places.</span> <span id="s591">And then, this mother had to put the child on a wagon and, right away, she'd become insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s593">03:01:01</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: You were talking about the ghetto and you had mentioned concerts.</span> <span id="s595">Was there some attempt at a normal life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: A person who has been in the ghetto has to answer that there was no normal.</span> <span id="s597">It was absolutely not a normal life.</span> <span id="s598">We were living in a constant fear.</span> <span id="s599">And when we talk about concerts, very, very few people actually attended.</span> <span id="s600">We knew that they werein the very beginning, more people could attend.</span> <span id="s601">But it really is only like a token that something like that existed in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s602">But I'm sure that many people didn't even know about the exsistence of the concert, because very few people were able to reveal themselves to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Was there a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s605">In fact, there werein the beginning, there were some Rabbis.</span> <span id="s606">But later on, they had tothey cut their beards off, and they were not able to function.</span> <span id="s607">In fact, see, they werethere was a marriage, marriage ceremony.</span> <span id="s608">At the very end, the only person who can conduct the ceremony was Rumchovsky (ph)the Rabbis had no rights to do anything of this kind.</span> <span id="s609">Servicesthere was no services.</span> <span id="s610">They wouldn't allow that.</span> <span id="s611">See, the ghetto was also changing, it wasn't always the same.</span> <span id="s612">If we talk about schools, they were only at the very, very beginning.</span> <span id="s613">Later on, the German wouldn't allow it, they would allow only work, and they demanded work of children who were very young.</span> <span id="s614">I think anything above 10they had to work.</span> <span id="s615">So schools were absolutely out of question.</span> <span id="s616">The life was really, absolutely not normal.</span> <span id="s617">So, let's say, our familywe were extremely fortunate.</span> <span id="s618">Oneone reason for our good fortune was a cellar.</span> <span id="s619">In the other room, there was a cellar.</span> <span id="s620">The cellar was very close to the back wall where our bed was standing.</span> <span id="s621">And very frequently, when we knew there was a deportation, we went down to the cellar.</span> <span id="s622">It was very crowded.</span> <span id="s623">My brotherthere were two boards to cover that cellar.</span> <span id="s624">He covered it, and he put the bed over it.</span> <span id="s625">We would close the shutters.</span> <span id="s626">So there were quite a few times that we escaped deportation this way.</span> <span id="s627">That's why we were able to stay so long before we went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s628">In the same wayit was no normals, because it was terror, it was fear, there wereI don'tI didn't have any social life.</span> <span id="s629">The life was work, and you came home, and there was alsowe were not able to use electricity very long.</span> <span id="s630">So it was darkness.</span> <span id="s631">And you know, in such a situation as it was in ghetto, you just want to survive, you are happy that you lived that day, and that your mother lived that day, that your brother is living the day, that your father is living the day.</span> <span id="s632">That wasthat was all we wanted.</span> <span id="s633">And nobody even hadhadwe, you knowyou haveyou accept it that you don't live, actually, for today.</span> <span id="s634">You accept it that you justor you live for today, that you accept that a day passed by without any deportation, without any shooting, without anyany decrees.</span> <span id="s635">And it was in the time of theit was a time in the ghetto, at the very end, that they were cutting off parts of the ghetto, so people have to go, have to leave their apartments and go to others.</span> <span id="s636">We were fortunate, quote in quote, that we stayed, you know, in this, one apartment, from the beginning, you know, to the end.</span> <span id="s637">And when it was very coldthere were times that it was very cold.</span> <span id="s638">But I think that they even cleaned the streets during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the Germans, so that theynothing should happen to the Germans.</span> <span id="s639">And it was lie that wethey were always some rumors.</span> <span id="s640">And it wasit wasn't really what you call a life.</span> <span id="s641">It was a subsubliving, subliving.</span> <span id="s642">And see, wewe had somethingthat the war is going well for the Allies.</span> <span id="s643">And you know, we were hoping.</span> <span id="s644">We were hoping.</span> <span id="s645">And that this hope kept us alive.</span> <span id="s646">But we were not even visiting family.</span> <span id="s647">First, many of them have already been deported.</span> <span id="s648">And in fact, my grandfather, my mother's father, and his daughter went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s649">It was a time that, for one reason or anotherI don't know how it was arrangedbut it wasn'tit wouldn't haveit wouldn't matter.</span> <span id="s650">Because when I told you about this Purim celebration, at this very crowded beautiful table, there is, there are only two people, me and my cousin, Renya (ph), who lives also in Los Angeles, who survived.</span> <span id="s651">All of everybody there, all myCiotka Dopcha (ph), Ciotka Hannah, Ciotka Sulcha (ph), Ciotka Peza (ph), and their husbands, and their childreneverybody was murdered.</span> <span id="s652">On my mother's side, I had family in Tomachav (ph).</span> <span id="s653">And I was able, while we were still in Lodz, to somehow go there, because I didn't look very typically like a Jew.</span> <span id="s654">And we took some money, brought it to Tomachav in the hope that it would be easier to live there.</span> <span id="s655">So she had two small children.</span> <span id="s656">It was Paula Rosenblum and they perished, they perished.</span> <span id="s657">From my mother's side, I had a picture of the Ciotka Rucha (ph), who perished in Warsaw, Ciotka Paula, who perished in Tomachav.</span> <span id="s658">And there was, in fact, a brother of my mother who lived in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s659">And sure enough, he was taken to Auschwitz and murdered, with his wifeand with his two small children.</span> <span id="s660">Now, we were sure that he would be surviving.</span> <span id="s661">But he didn't survive even in Holland.</span> <span id="s662">Theyso, you know, when you live in a place where there is death all around you when people are being deported, when you don't know what will be tomorrow, when everyday they can come and take you to Kripo and murder you there, when you are starving, when you are cold, when, when, when there is disease, because there was typhus quite a few times in the ghetto, you don't really think that there is something like a social life, you don't think that there is something which would entertain you, orwe never went to anybody's house.</span> <span id="s663">And the neighbors somehow were disappearing too.</span> <span id="s664">They were disappearing.</span> <span id="s665">And so</span></p> <p><span id="s666">03:10:16</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Do you remember what you talked about when you were at home with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I was thinking about it.</span> <span id="s669">I was thinking about whether we talked.</span> <span id="s670">But we must have talked, because my mother wasone time, had a dream.</span> <span id="s671">I do not believe in, you knowI'm not superstitious at all.</span> <span id="s672">But she had a dream that she went someplace, and that she met her brother, who was in Holland.</span> <span id="s673">I mean, he went to Auschwitz and she went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s674">I meanI mean, why she had this dream and how this dream came upon I really don't know.</span> <span id="s675">And what did we talk about?</span> <span id="s676">Now, when</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Maybe we should stop a minute.</span> <span id="s678">Is that music still here?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: So the life was justit was to survive, to see that your family survived.</span> <span id="s680">And I feel that considering that we had, you know, this littlelittle places where we could grow vegetablesand I do not recall anybody stealing.</span> <span id="s681">And I remember kindness from the neighbor and, actually, kindness from the people I worked with.</span> <span id="s682">So I don't think that IIthat it is a picturea rosy picture is el (sic).</span> <span id="s683">(pause) The way I saw itand I do not think that it's something in my imaginationbut anyhow, from my experienceand I did not have any special standing in the ghetto, or any special influencebut I, myself, experienced a pretty high moral fiber.</span> <span id="s684">And the ... that's what I experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">03:12:40</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Let me ask you; what kind of work did you do in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: It was actually desk work.</span> <span id="s688">There werewe had to issue what was legitimaceje obiadove, which meansthere was a little booklet based on it.</span> <span id="s689">You got a stamp that you got the soup.</span> <span id="s690">It was actually a part of the administration of the ghetto, which I was working in.</span> <span id="s691">And it was a job like a bookkeeper's job.</span> <span id="s692">And we were issuingit was called legitimaceje obiadove, which meanssuch a little booklet, where it was stamped whetherwhen somebody got his or her soup.</span> <span id="s693">And in order to be entitled to the soup, they had to have this booklet.</span> <span id="s694">So that was my work in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s695">Before, I was working in the produce department doing similar work.</span> <span id="s696">And then I was transferred to that department.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">03:14:48</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Is this where you met your future husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Actually, he was the head of the office management in that department.</span> <span id="s700">He was very strict.</span> <span id="s701">He was the first to comeand he was standing thereand if somebody dared to come latehe was just peering at that person, didn't say a wordI don't think anybody came late anymoreand was very much respected forfor his, I would say, noblemaybe yes, noble behavior and so onintegrityfor his integrity.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">03:14:29</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Now, working in the food department, I would think, in a situation like the ghettothis is a pretty good job?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: It did not entitle me to any additional food, maybe sometimes a soup.</span> <span id="s705">But otherwise, I could not get anything.</span> <span id="s706">In fact, I had diarrhea, and I needed some rice, and I approached my future husband, and he refused because he had his reasons.</span> <span id="s707">I am not blaming him.</span> <span id="s708">But it is very telling that I approached him, and he said, "No," he can not give it to me.</span> <span id="s709">He had suchsuch strong conviction of what he can and what he cannot dohe wouldn't give it to me.</span> <span id="s710">He wouldn't take it for himself either.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: So you had no opportunity to</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: I had sometimes</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q:cheat a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: I had sometimes an additional soup, which I brought and gave to my parents.</span> <span id="s715">But otherwise, I sometimesit was a time that I couldwhen there were more potatoes in the ghetto, I could get a few more potatoes.</span> <span id="s716">Then we were actuallythe worstwe found out that there was something growingI don't know exactly what it wasit looked like spinach or something similarand we were gathering it, and we were cooking that.</span> <span id="s717">So that was, of courseevery little bit was helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Did people come to you and try to get favors?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I wasI wasn't the one who they knew.</span> <span id="s720">So they couldn't come to me for favors, because I am notI don't have the means to give anybody favors.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">03:16:29</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Were you aware of much corruption and bribery going on in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I don't know whether I am an optimist, or I have a rosy outlook.</span> <span id="s724">I knew that somebody who was working, let's say in the bakery, had more, could get some more bread.</span> <span id="s725">Butand somebody who worked in the police department could have some favors.</span> <span id="s726">Somebody who worked in the Sonderkommando and hador helpedwas stationed in the Kriminal Polizei, in the Kripo, for sure was able to get some favors, some more nutrition, and so on.</span> <span id="s727">If you needed medication, you had to go to the people who were connected to the _________ Polizei, who were either policemen, or something.</span> <span id="s728">They were able to bring some, which Iwhen my brother was so very sick, you know, I got some medication from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">03:17:44</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I knew somebody who knows somebody.</span> <span id="s732">And so, one time, I got some medication.</span> <span id="s733">And that was in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s734">In the very beginning, we hadit was easier to get medication.</span> <span id="s735">At the end, it was nearly impossible.</span> <span id="s736">And maybe, I felt that it is a matter of fact that people who were associated with these places would have a little bit more nutrition.</span> <span id="s737">But nobody lived in a beautiful apartment.</span> <span id="s738">I don't think anybodymaybe very fewhad a bathroom.</span> <span id="s739">They were mostly latrines.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">03:18:37</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: There weren'tyou went outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yes, we went outside.</span> <span id="s743">Most of the people were living in one room.</span> <span id="s744">See, it was a part of town which was a part of town where very poor people used to live.</span> <span id="s745">So you know, there were notI, you knowso corruption.</span> <span id="s746">By the naturelet's say there was a Sonderkommando, who was very much in touch with the GermansI mean, not in touch because they were informers or somethingthey were because they were supposed to be performing certain duties.</span> <span id="s747">It was obvious that they had probably a little bit more food.</span> <span id="s748">But allas I understood it, all was about food.</span> <span id="s749">They couldn't have much better living conditions, because they were not availablemaybe some people did have running water and some people did not have running water.</span> <span id="s750">Many people did not have running water.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">03:19:48</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Now, you worked in the food administration.</span> <span id="s753">Was this....</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: A part of the food administration.</span> <span id="s755">But it</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: You worked on these coupon books for</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q:for people</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q:but your department also worked on distribution to food sitters?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No.</span> <span id="s762">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: We hadwe never saw food.</span> <span id="s765">We never saw food.</span> <span id="s766">It was just a bookkeeping department.</span> <span id="s767">I neverno food went throughwe were a part of the so‑called Aprovisation Department.</span> <span id="s768">But we were the part, an administrating part, only of thisof this coupons, coupon books, and we never saw food.</span> <span id="s769">It never came to my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Did everybody get coupons?</span> <span id="s771">Did everybody get the same amount?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Everybody who was working was getting a soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: And people who were not working how did they get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: There wassee, what was happeningthere was a certain amount of food which we're getting besides the soup.</span> <span id="s775">And the food, which they were getting besides the soup, they were getting.</span> <span id="s776">And if they were working, they were also getting the soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">03:21:10</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: How did they get this, were there soup kitchens?</span> <span id="s779">I mean, how did the poor peoplepeople who were not working, how did they get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: In the Distribution Centers.</span> <span id="s781">They wereeverybody was entitled to a certain amount of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: They didn'tthey had coupons?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: It was calledwait a minute.</span> <span id="s784">They were calledthey were cards.</span> <span id="s785">They were cards for food.</span> <span id="s786">In fact, as I recall one instance after this deportation fromwhen the Germans werecame to the ghetto and took the people outsome people who were not expecting toexpected to be takenbecause they just were not so exact to what they were saying they were going to dosome people took some of the bread, or whatever, cards with them, and it was a hardship for the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">03:22:12</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Let me ask you a different question; do you think that women were treated differently in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s790">It happened whatit happens even now.</span> <span id="s791">The women were living longer.</span> <span id="s792">I think that, physiologically, the women are equipped withbecause we are the child‑bearing speciesthat we have certainthiswhat is chemistry, or there is the glands, or somethingthat we can survive easier than the men, because there were more women afterwards in the ghettos than there were men.</span> <span id="s793">But treatmentI don't think that we were treated differently.</span> <span id="s794">In fact, you know, in Europe, women were treated better, in a way.</span> <span id="s795">I mean, it depends from what point of view you are looking of course, because the man was the man of the house and the woman, you know, hair dropit was different.</span> <span id="s796">So there were many women who were in professions.</span> <span id="s797">There were women doctors.</span> <span id="s798">There were women chemists.</span> <span id="s799">I had a relative who was a chemist, a relative who washad a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s800">And there were many doctors.</span> <span id="s801">And actually, I wanted to study biochemistry.</span> <span id="s802">That was my chosen profession which, of course, never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: More thandid you think that there were women who were able to use their appeal, to get favors in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Not that I was aware ofnot that I was aware of.</span> <span id="s805">If somebody, of course, worked close to the administration, there is a likelihood.</span> <span id="s806">For instance, I know, when people got married, they could have asked Rumchovsky to give themto give them something.</span> <span id="s807">But I don't think so.</span> <span id="s808">I do not think so.</span> <span id="s809">I might have not come across it.</span> <span id="s810">But I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">03:24:32</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: So how long were you in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Until the very, very end, until nearly the last day, because II don't have a tattoo.</span> <span id="s814">Because when we came, the last transportsthey were so crowded that they didn't tattoo us.</span> <span id="s815">So it must have been very late in August already when we came.</span> <span id="s816">And we had extraan extra day for ourselves.</span> <span id="s817">What happened was that we were on the way which we didn't know is Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s818">And we</span></p> <p><span id="s819">03:25:12</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Well, how didbut how did you even get rounded up; how did all of this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s822">They were comingin the beginning, they thought we would go full of tyranny [terror].</span> <span id="s823">But people didn't go full of tyranny [terror].</span> <span id="s824">So the Germans started rounding people up.</span> <span id="s825">They also came to our apartment.</span> <span id="s826">But we had the cellar, and we closed the shutters, and we went down there, we heard them.</span> <span id="s827">They were banging with their rifles in many places.</span> <span id="s828">But it was that we could pull the bed thereand it was not usuallyI don't know whether they expected itbut they banged it on the floorthey didbut they didn't bang where we were.</span> <span id="s829">So we did itwe did it whenever, which was probably very, very oftenyou know, it waswe were in the cellar.</span> <span id="s830">And in fact, what happenedI have the picture of my cousinand his whole family was deported, and he came to us.</span> <span id="s831">And unfortunately, I, my father, my brother, and Aros (ph)Aros must have been, maybe, seven years, or something like itand we don't have room for Fishek (ph)sobut there was a shed.</span> <span id="s832">So we said, "Fishek, we'll hide you there," and we hid Fishek there.</span> <span id="s833">We got up in the morning, we looked in the shed, he was gone.</span> <span id="s834">So the German took him out from there.</span> <span id="s835">They were looking everywhere.</span> <span id="s836">They were looking everywhere.</span> <span id="s837">They were justjust going through everywhere and herding people to go, herding people to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">03:27:02</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: And this is in August, 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: That was in August, 1944.</span> <span id="s841">And Ithis waslike, I wish maybeI was thinking about hiding there.</span> <span id="s842">But we didn't have any food, and we didn't know what will happen.</span> <span id="s843">If we would have known where we were going, we would have probably stayed in that ca...., cellar, maybe suffocated.</span> <span id="s844">But we would stay there.</span> <span id="s845">Now, with the transport</span></p> <p><span id="s846">03:27:27</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: What happened, how did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s849">So this extra dayI have to tell you about it.</span> <span id="s850">So we were on the way to this gathering placeand August was just a beautiful monthand we saw very close where we were supposed to be gathered.</span> <span id="s851">We saw, like, a little house or something.</span> <span id="s852">Anyhow, there was a guard, a German guard, in front of it.</span> <span id="s853">But it wasn't a Gestapo.</span> <span id="s854">So we said, "Can we stay there for a day?"</span> <span id="s855">.</span> <span id="s856">He said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s857">But no more."</span> <span id="s858">So we tookwe took residence for a day in that room.</span> <span id="s859">And I was so spoiled that, even in the ghetto, I had to have my spoon.</span> <span id="s860">And we were there, andyou know, in retrospect, you sometimes think only, "Did we survive?</span> <span id="s861">We didn't survive, right?</span> <span id="s862">We didn't survive.</span> <span id="s863">So what good was everything?"</span> <span id="s864">.</span> <span id="s865">But no.</span> <span id="s866">Maybe it's philosophical.</span> <span id="s867">And since life is not forever, this one day was also important, because this was the last day that we were a family and that we were together.</span> <span id="s868">Aros was with us too.</span> <span id="s869">And that's why I think sometimes about this day.</span> <span id="s870">And I don't want to say, "What good was it that they didn't survive?"</span> <span id="s871">.</span> <span id="s872">But they had to stay.</span> <span id="s873">And then we went.</span> <span id="s874">It was the most strange thing.</span> <span id="s875">I met my cousin and her mother on the ground where we were waiting to be taken away to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s876">And we stayed together, I and my cousin, until we were liberated, which was very lucky for both of us.</span> <span id="s877">She claims that my spirit helped her to survive, because I was justwhen we were working in Sasel, one time, we passed by windows which were lit, and there was some kind of a holiday, and she mentions to me, "Look, we will never live like that."</span> <span id="s878">I said, "What do you mean, Renya?</span> <span id="s879">Why not?</span> <span id="s880">Of course, we'll live like that."</span> <span id="s881">And she always repeats it.</span> <span id="s882">And I think that it was the defiance, the defiance.</span> <span id="s883">I just wanted to defy the Germans, because I went to Auschwitz with pleurisy, which is water of the lungs.</span> <span id="s884">I had a bladder infection.</span> <span id="s885">I was very sick before we went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s886">And when I was lying down naked on the ground in Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Oh, you probably</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q:made your point for now?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: Yes, I made my point.</span> <span id="s891">I made my point.</span> <span id="s892">And that's not so much</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: I just want to backtrack a minute because</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">04:01:10</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q:I want you to tell me a little bit about how things were organized in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s898">Since I wasn'tI was in a very, very smallmy job was administrative.</span> <span id="s899">But I had nothing to do with food, I had nothing to do with distribution of food, or anything of this kind.</span> <span id="s900">So I wasn't so close to the administration.</span> <span id="s901">But as a person who lived in the ghetto from the very beginning to the very end, my assessment is that so it was hunger, so there was deportation, so there were tragediesbut there wassomehow, we knew what is happening.</span> <span id="s902">There were hospitals.</span> <span id="s903">Nobody came back from a hospital with contagious diseases.</span> <span id="s904">That's another story.</span> <span id="s905">But there were hospitals.</span> <span id="s906">There were hospitals also where children could go.</span> <span id="s907">There were hospitals where peopleif someif there was a birth that they could go.</span> <span id="s908">There was certain civil safety.</span> <span id="s909">I mean, we were not afraid that somebody would come into our house and rob us.</span> <span id="s910">There were veryof course, some of the criminals were included in the early deportations.</span> <span id="s911">That's true.</span> <span id="s912">There were prisons.</span> <span id="s913">There was a court.</span> <span id="s914">There were judges.</span> <span id="s915">There was a prosecutor.</span> <span id="s916">They had names of everybody.</span> <span id="s917">They knew where everybody was living.</span> <span id="s918">There was a Department of Statistics.</span> <span id="s919">There was a Department of Distribution of Food.</span> <span id="s920">And within this department was the Department of Produce.</span> <span id="s921">It was a department where they distributed flowers.</span> <span id="s922">There was a Department of Bakeries.</span> <span id="s923">Now, there was milk and coffee.</span> <span id="s924">I mean, they knew exactly about how many people we had.</span> <span id="s925">I think that could have changed after one of the deportations.</span> <span id="s926">But they knew.</span> <span id="s927">They knew about who has an apartment, or whether there is an empty apartment.</span> <span id="s928">They knew who had died.</span> <span id="s929">So it was in this tragic conditions there was something thatwe, for instance, knew that there would be a deportation.</span> <span id="s930">We, for instancebesides, there were many rumors which, sometimes, were not true.</span> <span id="s931">Very often, Rumchovsky had speeches and prepared us for certain things, certain changes, or what have you.</span> <span id="s932">They were an instrumentin the beginning, Rabbis were performing ceremonies, if somebody, you know, got married.</span> <span id="s933">There were circumcisions performed.</span> <span id="s934">Later on, when theywhen the Germans didn't allow it, Rumchovsky was the one who married people.</span> <span id="s935">So for a very short time, there was even something, likeon the marichian (ph) was something like a reserve for people who worked very hard.</span> <span id="s936">And one time, my brother had the privilege, and I took him there.</span> <span id="s937">And that was in the beginning.</span> <span id="s938">The ghetto became more and more less run by the Jewish administration, and the Germans had more of a part.</span> <span id="s939">But this was at the time when Jews had more to say about administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">04:05:05</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Was thisdo you think that this was positive that Rumchovsky and the Jewish Consul had so much control over your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Considering the alternative, because if they would not be an order, if there wouldn't be order, if there would be dead people lying all over, if there would be a lot of crime, I believe the German wouldn't go for it, they would just close the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: So you thought he was a pretty good man?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Ibesides that I saw him, I never met the man.</span> <span id="s945">But I'm, what I'm thinkingin this abnormal condition, with enormous pressure of the German from the outside, with the population probably being very often not very happy with whats going on, to have this kind of an administrationso that since we're taken care of, no matterno matter what, I think that people who survive the ghetto, if not for this kind of an administration, would not survive it until August the 25, 1944, because the ghetto would have been closed.</span> <span id="s946">And if this workshops, would not be administered, administrated the way they are, they were they were, the ghetto would have been closed also much sooner.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">04:06:50</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What workshops are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: The workshops for the Germans, the workshopslike, there was a leather workshop, and there wasthere were all kinds of workshops whichfor which, you know, they were paid, and they could use the money to buy the food, and so on and so on, andI mean, the administrationthe administration, not individualseverything, the administration.</span> <span id="s950">Now, you know, when you think today what's going on in certain countries, that, under this awful circumstances, they had an administration who had everything in check, they had powersof course, they hadif they wouldn't have the powers, there would be wars there.</span> <span id="s951">Because if somebody wouldn't get enough food or something, no matter whose fault, people would rebel.</span> <span id="s952">But there were no rebellions.</span> <span id="s953">Anyhow</span></p> <p><span id="s954">04:07:46</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Did you get paid for your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Notno.</span> <span id="s957">Whether I gotokay.</span> <span id="s958">But</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s960">Why don't we pick up again where you were at the train</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q:to get deported toyou didn't know where</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q:or anything</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q:and you met your cousin</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q:and you got on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">04:08:10</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Why don't you tell me about that journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s973">I told you about my mother.</span> <span id="s974">And I had enormousallI mean, respect and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Wait.</span> <span id="s976">You told me about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s978">I told you that she was beautiful and</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Oh, you have.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A:that she kept everything so clean</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s982">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A:and she wouldtook care of me when I was sick.</span> <span id="s984">I took care of my brother.</span> <span id="s985">And she never complained.</span> <span id="s986">And we went into this cattle wagon with all these packages, which they deceitfully told us to pack, and she was sitting on the floor.</span> <span id="s987">I can sit on the floor.</span> <span id="s988">It doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s989">But my mother sitting on this floor and being so unhappyit just broke my heart.</span> <span id="s990">And a I said, she never complained.</span> <span id="s991">And it was so embarrassing.</span> <span id="s992">It wasI meanand there was a little window in that cattle wagon, and people were trying to look whether we are going.</span> <span id="s993">And, as I said before, the day was absolutely gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.</span> <span id="s994">And here, she was, poormy poor mother was sitting on the floor andI'm not sureit must have been the air thereand I don't know what happened to the excrementsI think there was some kind of an opening or something.</span> <span id="s995">Anyhow, then they slid the door open from the wagon, and we came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: How long had you been riding?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: I do not recall exactly.</span> <span id="s998">I was just from Lodz to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s999">From far away, it looked like a place for the insane, because there was some wire around it and there were people running back and forth, back and forth, with shaven heads.</span> <span id="s1000">And here, we had to come out, leave everything in the wagon.</span> <span id="s1001">And then they told us to go to the left, to go to the right.</span> <span id="s1002">And there was one Oberscharffuhrer at the head, closer to the camp.</span> <span id="s1003">And he said to my mother to go to the left, and I went to the right.</span> <span id="s1004">And not knowing, really, the depth of that tragedy, I still felt that it means that I'll go to work and she won't.</span> <span id="s1005">So I run up to the Oberscharffuhrer, and I said, " Meine Mutter kann arbeiten viel besser wie ich," which was true, that she can work much better than I can.</span> <span id="s1006">So he said, " Du willst, sie schon sehen im abend, " that I would see her in the evening.</span> <span id="s1007">There were very deceitful, veryI mean, that this deceit was the smallest deceitI mean, because the one which they did to get us out of the ghetto was a much greater deceit.</span> <span id="s1008">Now, I was with my cousin and her mother, Tess (ph).</span> <span id="s1009">She had lighter hair.</span> <span id="s1010">My mother was already, partially gray.</span> <span id="s1011">And we went in, and there was a second selection.</span> <span id="s1012">We were supposed to completely disrobe, which we did of coursewe didn't have any other choiceand that we will go to the showers andthere was something roundand I was close to my cousin and her motherand all of a sudden, they took her mother out.</span> <span id="s1013">It was a second selection.</span> <span id="s1014">Of course, when she was undressed, they realized she is not in her 20s or 30s.</span> <span id="s1015">In fact, only one mother went with us, a Mrs. Kohn (ph).</span> <span id="s1016">And what she went through in the campsshe was lashed and whipped so many times.</span> <span id="s1017">But that's another story.</span> <span id="s1018">Then we, from there, there wasthey shaved our hairand I had long brown hairand my cousin, Renya, said, "You know, I couldn't recognize you"so I was calling, " Tusa, tusa "and so I came out and she saw meand they shaved our headsand we were nakedand we were supposed to lie down someplace on the ground to sleep overnight, which we did.</span> <span id="s1019">Everything seemed completely insane.</span> <span id="s1020">And miraculously, I awoke, I didn't have my bladder infection.</span> <span id="s1021">Then we were given some shoes, and I was given some shoes which had my foot, and we were given some clothes.</span> <span id="s1022">And then I remember Auschwitz, I remember we were standing, one time, in line and I had some container with somewhat was supposed to be soupand it was all, like, in a maze, what was happening, what has happened, I mean.</span> <span id="s1023">And what I see someplace, a sign, " Arbeit Macht Frei."</span> <span id="s1024">That was the sign in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1025">And fortunately, we were there only a few days.</span> <span id="s1026">And everything seems like a very, very bad dream.</span> <span id="s1027">And they were telling us that going out of Auschwitz to a working camp is a rather fortunate occurrence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Who was telling you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: It must have been some other personpeople who were alreadyhave been there in Auschwitz longer.</span> <span id="s1030">Some of them were incarcerated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">04:15:19</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Now, you were over in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes, that was Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: So you talked to some of the people who were</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Who were there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: What else did you observe while you were there in those few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: The first impression was that it was some gathering of insane people.</span> <span id="s1038">They just didn't look normal.</span> <span id="s1039">They absolutely didn't look normal.</span> <span id="s1040">Their movement didn'twasn't normal.</span> <span id="s1041">That was my first impression when I went out of the wagon, and I looked to my left, to my left andbecause we went out of the wagon, and then we were standing facing this Oberscharffuhrer here.</span> <span id="s1042">So then I was on the left sideI mean, I was on themy mother was on the left, and I was on the right.</span> <span id="s1043">Soand then, as I said, it was like alike a bad, bad dream, the whole thingit was so unbelievable, the movement of the people, everything there.</span> <span id="s1044">When I think about Auschwitz, I just remember, like, fragments because it was such an enormous shock.</span> <span id="s1045">It was an enormous shock for, for me.</span> <span id="s1046">And they took my mother away, and my father, and myand Aros and Lolick were also taken away.</span> <span id="s1047">I didn't know where they will be going.</span> <span id="s1048">And I didn't realize what actually happened to my mother for a long time.</span> <span id="s1049">Because, from there, we went to another camp.</span> <span id="s1050">My leg started swelling up.</span> <span id="s1051">And we went to a camp in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1052">There, we were supposed to be laying railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s1053">And there were German woman, women who were ourI don't knowthey were called Kapo.</span> <span id="s1054">And in the morning, very early in the morning, we have to stand in line.</span> <span id="s1055">And there was a German SS, and he was pointing out who's going and who's staying.</span> <span id="s1056">In the beginning, I went.</span> <span id="s1057">And in this camp, there was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1058">In most camps, there was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1059">They wanted to have us, on one hand, probably, fit, and on the other hand if not, eliminated.</span> <span id="s1060">So thisthis doctorI ask her whether I still have water on the lung.</span> <span id="s1061">And she said, "Yes, you have."</span> <span id="s1062">And I had a cut on my leg.</span> <span id="s1063">So she put a very large bandage on my leg.</span> <span id="s1064">And it so happened that, after I had the bandage, in the morning, she, for a short time, pointed out for me to stay.</span> <span id="s1065">Now, you were asking whether I realized what happened.</span> <span id="s1066">So what actuallywhen I started going to work, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1067">It was very hard, to me, to climb on the wagon because my legs were so swollen.</span> <span id="s1068">But since it was very early, there were stars in the heaven, and I prayed.</span> <span id="s1069">So I prayed for my parents, and for Lolick, and for myself.</span> <span id="s1070">Butso at this time, I had no inkling what, actually, is happening to them, absolutely no inkling.</span> <span id="s1071">And then we were in Hamburg for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">04:18:48</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: What was the name of this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: I remember only that it was Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1075">I do not know any name of this particular one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: This was not Sasel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: No, this wasn't Sasel.</span> <span id="s1078">From this camp</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: How long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: It wasn't a very long time.</span> <span id="s1081">But it was more than a month.</span> <span id="s1082">From there, we were transported to Sasel.</span> <span id="s1083">And I, as much as it was, the conditions were not goodthis camp was situated in a very woody area.</span> <span id="s1084">And I am very sensitive to good air.</span> <span id="s1085">And also, when we came there, there were always accommodations that the doctorthere was a doctor.</span> <span id="s1086">So when people came from work, they could come there.</span> <span id="s1087">It was called the ambulance.</span> <span id="s1088">Actually, it's like an infirmary.</span> <span id="s1089">And I approached this doctor and I asked her whether I could work for her.</span> <span id="s1090">And she saysso she had chosen me to work for her.</span> <span id="s1091">That also allowed me to recuperate somewhat.</span> <span id="s1092">I had to work, I had to wash the floors, which no big deal.</span> <span id="s1093">It was a big deal for me then because, you know.</span> <span id="s1094">But anyhowand when people were coming, I was greeting them, I was taking reports, and I gotthey were saying that I am very polite and friendly to everybody andnow, this doctor wanted me to sleep with hershe was afraid to sleep by herselfwhich I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">04:20:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Was she a Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1098">She was from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1099">She committed suicide after the war.</span> <span id="s1100">And so that was going on for a while.</span> <span id="s1101">But then, for one reason or another, I guess she wanted me to sleep with her and somebody else wanted me to sleep in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1102">But anyhow, somebody else got my position.</span> <span id="s1103">So I was going to work.</span> <span id="s1104">When we were coming from work, we had to stay at attention.</span> <span id="s1105">And if there were any complaints about anybody during the work of any kind, the person was whipped, and we had all to stand and watch it.</span> <span id="s1106">And in the middle of this courtyard was somethingI don't remembersome wooden contraption or something where the people were whipped.</span> <span id="s1107">Now, one time, I was also punished.</span> <span id="s1108">And it wasthey claimedwhich I do not know whether it's true or notbut that I brought some meat.</span> <span id="s1109">We were working someplace.</span> <span id="s1110">Over there, we were digging foundations.</span> <span id="s1111">And at one time, we were carrying heavy stones, one giving it to another in a line.</span> <span id="s1112">And one time, we were called to a slaughter house.</span> <span id="s1113">And theyhe claimed that I took some meat into the camp.</span> <span id="s1114">And I had a big speech.</span> <span id="s1115">I spoke German.</span> <span id="s1116">And I was just sentenced to clean the latrines, whichI don't know whetherI think I remember it right.</span> <span id="s1117">I never feltI felt always defiant.</span> <span id="s1118">I never felteven when I had to clean the latrines, I didn't feel inferior.</span> <span id="s1119">This mother, Mrs.Kohn, has been unfortunatly, she has been lashed and whipped so many times.</span> <span id="s1120">So over there, one time, I was milking a cow.</span> <span id="s1121">We were working someplace and we saw cows there.</span> <span id="s1122">So I was milking a cow.</span> <span id="s1123">But unfortunately, another girl was doing something similarI don't know whether it was a cow or it was a bulland hit her.</span> <span id="s1124">And it was tragic.</span> <span id="s1125">There was not enough food and the coatsthe coat was a big problem.</span> <span id="s1126">And one time, we walkedworkedwalked to work, and we had wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1127">And the ice was building up on the shoes and building up on the shoes, and we stopped and wanted to get the ice off our wooden shoes.</span> <span id="s1128">They wouldn't let us.</span> <span id="s1129">And it seemed like it will never end.</span> <span id="s1130">And I remember that, later on, we used to say, "If this walk ended, anything difficult will end."</span> <span id="s1131">And</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: I am going to have to stop you because you are alluding to a lot of things</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Which you would</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q:that I want to ask you questions about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Good.</span> <span id="s1136">Good.</span> <span id="s1137">I am coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">04:24:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: First of all, this camp Sasel</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q:was it women and men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: All the camps which I was in Hamburg, in Sasel, only women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Was it large?</span> <span id="s1144">Were there a lot of women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: No.</span> <span id="s1146">Sasel was not very huge.</span> <span id="s1147">I couldn't tell you the numbers.</span> <span id="s1148">But it wasn't huge.</span> <span id="s1149">I mean, it wasin comparison with Auschwitz, it was really small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: How many people were in your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: That is a very difficult question for me to answer.</span> <span id="s1152">We were sleeping in the beds, like, one, I on the top, and Renya on the bottom, or vice versa, I believe.</span> <span id="s1153">And how many people in the barracks?</span> <span id="s1154">Wait a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: 20, 50?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1157">25.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">04:25:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: When this woman doctor wanted you to stay with her, she just wanted companionship, or she wanted</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Just companionship, just plain companionship.</span> <span id="s1161">She was scared too.</span> <span id="s1162">She was, you know.</span> <span id="s1163">She was working as a doctor.</span> <span id="s1164">But she was, you know.</span> <span id="s1165">She was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1166">No, no.</span> <span id="s1167">She wanted justbecause she was, scared.</span> <span id="s1168">She probably lost her family and she was scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: You don't remember, maybe, people sleeping together</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q:having sex</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q:or relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: No, no, no, no!</span> <span id="s1175">I tell you it's impossible.</span> <span id="s1176">There was no drive for that.</span> <span id="s1177">There wasI mean, we were so devoid of energy, of desires.</span> <span id="s1178">I mean, it was allwhat was important was not to be so awfully coldthe cold was very hurtfulmaybe not to be so very hungry, not to be whipped or hurtbut nothing of this kind.</span> <span id="s1179">She was just a nice human being and she was just scared.</span> <span id="s1180">And at night, I'll tell you, my cousin was also scared, you know.</span> <span id="s1181">I mean, people were scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">04:26:18</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Where were most of the prisoners there from?</span> <span id="s1184">Were most of them from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yes, yes, I think so.</span> <span id="s1186">I think so.</span> <span id="s1187">There was one girl who, who was whom,maybe who was there from Germanybut probably, she was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1188">And that's how she got to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: And the guards, or the Kapos; where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: There were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: They were all German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">04:26:50</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Didwell, getting back to strictly women‑oriented issues, did you have your period throughout?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Fortunately, not.</span> <span id="s1196">They said that they gave us something in Auschwitz, or something.</span> <span id="s1197">But we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1198">We thought that we'd never regain it.</span> <span id="s1199">But we did regain it because we have children.</span> <span id="s1200">But, no, we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1201">And we were told that they were giving us something so that we shouldn't have the period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: That must have been somewhat alarming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Not really, because who would like to be bothered with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">04:27:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Did you have enough food there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Was it anywas it better or worse than the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: The ghetto fluctuated, you know?</span> <span id="s1209">Sometimes, it was more.</span> <span id="s1210">Sometimes, it was less.</span> <span id="s1211">And at the end, there was only starvation.</span> <span id="s1212">We didn't have enough food.</span> <span id="s1213">For instance, when I saw the cow, I milked her, you know.</span> <span id="s1214">And when we went to the slaughterhouse, maybe I, you knowI took some meat.</span> <span id="s1215">We were getting some bread.</span> <span id="s1216">We were getting some soup.</span> <span id="s1217">That's what Iwhat I recall.</span> <span id="s1218">And I recall that the hunger was bad.</span> <span id="s1219">But the cold was miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">04:28:26</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: One more question, and then we'll have to change tapes.</span> <span id="s1222">You said you were laying foundations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: What were they for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: We didn't see the finished products.</span> <span id="s1226">But there were some German civilians also who were overseers.</span> <span id="s1227">So there must have been something contracted by the SS, for some companies, I assume.</span> <span id="s1228">Because there were some civilian overseers at that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: Do you think they worked for the factory or housing, or you just don't know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">A: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1231">But I don't think about the size of it.</span> <span id="s1232">It's likely that it was not for factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Were you awarewell, when you were outside of the camp working</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q:did you have any contact with the German people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: We never have contact.</span> <span id="s1237">But in Hamburg, one time, they werethey were looking at us.</span> <span id="s1238">But we looked like criminals, because we had this shaven hair, shaven heads, and we had these outfits, you know, special outfits, and we looked like prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">05:00:47</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: At this timeI guess it was the Fall of 1944were you aware of Allied bombings in the area, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Well, we were in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1243">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1244">And we were not that happy about it.</span> <span id="s1245">We didn't care what would happen to us.</span> <span id="s1246">And they were running to the shelters.</span> <span id="s1247">And we reallywe reallyin Hamburg, any time we heard the raid, we were just very happy, because it was a sign, you know, that something is being done about the Germans, of course, and that the countries would be saved, from this tyrant.</span> <span id="s1248">So we were happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: It gave you hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Maybe, maybe, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: You just said somethingthat there was a real turning point, in your mental outlook from Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s1253">When you have your family, you first, you feel more like a human being.</span> <span id="s1254">See, Auschwitz was very dehumanizing.</span> <span id="s1255">You were not a person.</span> <span id="s1256">You just were not a person.</span> <span id="s1257">And you felt it, that you are not a person.</span> <span id="s1258">And since Auschwitz, they did something to us.</span> <span id="s1259">So as I said, on one hand, I didn't feel inferiorbut I had it also say thatyou see, there was a lot of where I wasI knew that I could do something in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1260">So when my brother was sick, I tried to bring him ice because ice washad to be put on his heart.</span> <span id="s1261">And I remember the person I was getting the ice from.</span> <span id="s1262">He, afterwards, saw me.</span> <span id="s1263">He was afraid to ask me what happened to my brother, because I was so crushed.</span> <span id="s1264">I could help a little bit.</span> <span id="s1265">I could do something.</span> <span id="s1266">I was stillI was still a person who had certain, certainI wouldn't say powersbut I could help my father, I could help my brother, I could encourage them, I could do something for them, I could be with them.</span> <span id="s1267">Now, when they took everybody away andI mean, we were not reallyin a way, we were not really human beings.</span> <span id="s1268">In a way, you know, you didn'tcertain feelings were taken away, you know?</span> <span id="s1269">And besides that, the type of, of,I couldn't call it lifethat wasn't lifethat wasn't lifeand we, but we probablyI in particular, probably believed that we will survive.</span> <span id="s1270">I also believed that my brother will survive.</span> <span id="s1271">I also believed that Aros will survive.</span> <span id="s1272">And, but Bergen-Belsen</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">05:04:29</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1275">You have to tell me how you got to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1277">Now</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: How long were you in Sasel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Very close to the end of the war, because I wasn't in Bergen-Belsen too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: How did youhow did you leave Sasel; what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: They took us on trains.</span> <span id="s1282">They were not cattle trains.</span> <span id="s1283">And we were still standing in the station, and I decided that I am going to jump out of the window, which I did.</span> <span id="s1284">And I asked my cousin, "Come with me," because I knew there is some camp of some prisoners, Italians, and I think that maybe I can walk over there, or do something.</span> <span id="s1285">This German girls overseers came up to me, picked me up, put me back on the train, and I was expecting, the whole time, that I'll be punished or something.</span> <span id="s1286">Nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1287">Now, we came to another hell, because Bergen-Belsen was like a dug up cemetery.</span> <span id="s1288">There were piles, piles, over piles, of skeletons, one skeleton over the other skeleton, piles, a hill.</span> <span id="s1289">We were put into something that looked like a warehouse, lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s1290">One time a dayor I don't know whether every daythey opened the doors, they whirled up something which was some watery soup.</span> <span id="s1291">Now, people were very sick there.</span> <span id="s1292">There was a lot of diphtheria.</span> <span id="s1293">And I remember the latrines.</span> <span id="s1294">And somehow, I probably had the urge to survive.</span> <span id="s1295">So I don't know where I gotI got some metal containers, one for me and one for Renya.</span> <span id="s1296">And when I heard the squeak of the opening door, I ran to the door, and I put this container into this kettle.</span> <span id="s1297">So I got some soupand I think I got for both of usbecause they were not staying there very long, so not everybody got anything, you know?</span> <span id="s1298">So it was important to run there and to get the little bit of watery soup in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1299">Otherwise, you didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s1300">And there, you realized subconciously and conciously, that I will never see my mother, never see my dad.</span> <span id="s1301">And justjust lyingwe were just lying on this floor there day and night.</span> <span id="s1302">Probably, when we had to go to the latrine, we went out.</span> <span id="s1303">We must have gone out, because we were able to see thisthis piles, piles, and piles, of skeletons, just skeletons, unburied.</span> <span id="s1304">And they were throwing more and more piling up more.</span> <span id="s1305">And, that was Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">05:08:22 And I remember when we were liberated, we were liberated by the British.</span> <span id="s1307">There was no joy in my heart.</span> <span id="s1308">I understand they told ussomebody told us not to run out too early, one girl did, and she got shot.</span> <span id="s1309">There was no joy what I was doing, I got some place, some paper and a pen, and I was writing.</span> <span id="s1310">I writeand I never thought that I should keep this writing.</span> <span id="s1311">I'm sure I wrote in Polish.</span> <span id="s1312">And I wrote and wrote.</span> <span id="s1313">And, thenthat was liberation.</span> <span id="s1314">Fortunatelyunfortunately, they meant very well.</span> <span id="s1315">Some people were taken to, like, a hospital or something.</span> <span id="s1316">They meant well.</span> <span id="s1317">But they wanted to share with us the food, and they gave some chocolate and other things to people, who were starving for a long, long time.</span> <span id="s1318">And their stomachs couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s1319">So they got diarrhea, and some of them didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1320">And then we must have been taken out of there.</span> <span id="s1321">And we were still in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1322">But, of course, in completely different quarters, and with food and so on, supplied by the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Right now, I couldn't even think.</span> <span id="s1325">It was 1945.</span> <span id="s1326">And I think it was April, 1945.</span> <span id="s1327">I just couldn't think of dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: So you weremaybe only there a few weeks, or</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: I think I was there only a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1330">I think I was there only a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1331">That's what I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: When the British came in, were you inside this barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Then how did you know you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Probably, the screams, and they probably walked in, and we probably saw the uniforms.</span> <span id="s1336">But I know as much as later on, at that point, there was no happiness.</span> <span id="s1337">Because after Bergen-Belsen, II knew, that my parents didn't survive.</span> <span id="s1338">And there was absolutely you know, maybe, seeing all these corpses, and I mean, you couldn't be happy about anything.</span> <span id="s1339">I wasn't happy.</span> <span id="s1340">However, once we were transferred to some human quarters, and I wanted to look for my brother.</span> <span id="s1341">He was in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1342">But he didn't survive.</span> <span id="s1343">And I do not know why.</span> <span id="s1344">And I was sure that Aros would survive, because he was such a tough young, young boy.</span> <span id="s1345">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1346">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1347">There's no way to find out anything right.</span> <span id="s1348">I talked to people who knew my brother in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1349">And that's why I didn't stay long in Bergen-BelsenI mean, notthis camp in prisonbut liberated Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1350">But I went to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1351">I got some clothes there.</span> <span id="s1352">I don't know how I did it.</span> <span id="s1353">And then I went to Hanover, because it was where I was asking everybodyI was inquiring whether anybody saw Lolick, and whether they know, and maybe he registered someplace or something.</span> <span id="s1354">But, he did not survive.</span> <span id="s1355">He did not survive.</span> <span id="s1356">And so everybody, everybody from this enormous family was tortured, starved, gassed.</span> <span id="s1357">And there is a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">05:12:40</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: When you wentyou went to try to find some family, find your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: It so happens that I met my present husband, Dave Klipp.</span> <span id="s1363">And he was alreadyat that time, he was thinking positively.</span> <span id="s1364">There were people who didn't have awho did not belong anyplace.</span> <span id="s1365">So he and some others contactednot the Nazis, of course, at that timebut the German authorities to form this KZ Ausschuss, so that we get some housing, get some nutrition.</span> <span id="s1366">Because there were cards at that time.</span> <span id="s1367">There were nutritional cards.</span> <span id="s1368">So Iat that time, I actually stay stayed in Hanover, and I just didn't feel like going to Poland, which I very much regret.</span> <span id="s1369">And so from there, we started living what I would say is a much more normal life.</span> <span id="s1370">I was together with Renya and there were some other people who survived.</span> <span id="s1371">And so there was already a social exchange.</span> <span id="s1372">We already cared that, how we get dressed, and how we look, and we gotwe got through this KZ Ausschuss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">05:14:14 We got an apartment with some German person.</span> <span id="s1374">I mean, it was her apartment.</span> <span id="s1375">And her husband didn't come yet from the war.</span> <span id="s1376">So we werewe were designated this quarters for us to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: And she was there also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: She was there also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Wasn't that strange, living with a German after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: She knew that she just has to let us live there, you know.</span> <span id="s1381">She realized, you know.</span> <span id="s1382">It wasn't reallyit wasyou see, there were not enough housing to give uslater on, we did get a house for ourself.</span> <span id="s1383">But at this time, it was the best solution.</span> <span id="s1384">Because, at least, we lived in a normal apartment with a kitchen, and with a bathroom, and so on.</span> <span id="s1385">At that time, she realizes they are the, that that's the only way it will be for a while.</span> <span id="s1386">When, her husband came from the, back.</span> <span id="s1387">He was rebeling.</span> <span id="s1388">He was rebeling a lot.</span> <span id="s1389">And then, of course, we got another place to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">05:16:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: So this organization there gave you food coupons and</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1393">Because the Germans were also getting coupons.</span> <span id="s1394">At that time, it was rationed.</span> <span id="s1395">And we got an apartment, and we gotwe got foodand we got some clothing, and we started what you would call the beginning of a normal life.</span> <span id="s1396">Some people, you knowthatthat's what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Was it difficult to resurrect yourself in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: I have to admit that itI remember some extreme elation.</span> <span id="s1399">Not in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1400">Not when I wasbut when I startedwhen I left Bergen-Belsen to go to HamburgI don't know whether it started there or much laterbut I was so elated that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1401">I justmy cousin, Renya, was just, like, envious.</span> <span id="s1402">I mean, she was happy about that.</span> <span id="s1403">But she was envious thatI mean, I felt that I am alive.</span> <span id="s1404">And it wasit was a elation for me toitI went through this grieving period for a while.</span> <span id="s1405">And I waswe were always grieving, we were always talking about it, and so on.</span> <span id="s1406">But thisthis absolute transformation for being not even a human beingand all of a sudden, being freewhen I realized it, I wasthere was a periodit didn't last foreverbut it was a period of great elation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">05:17:46</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: How long did you stay there with your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: In Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: No, it was in Hanover.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: Hanover.</span> <span id="s1413">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: We actually stayed there for a long time.</span> <span id="s1415">We also were in Frankfurt for a while.</span> <span id="s1416">And yes, the reason we stayed so long in Germany was we wanted to leave Germany as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1417">There were too many memories and you never knew to whom you're talking.</span> <span id="s1418">Because if they told you that they always were buying into your storesor something like thatthen you know: "Watch out."</span> <span id="s1419">Then we didn't want tobut anyhow, Dave had a sister in the United States, in New York.</span> <span id="s1420">So actually, they were doing something to send us status.</span> <span id="s1421">However, I had no pleurisy in the ghetto and also in the camps.</span> <span id="s1422">And so I didn't have the pleurisy when I was liberated just miraculously.</span> <span id="s1423">On an x‑rays, there were shadows.</span> <span id="s1424">And the United States, very rightfully, didn't want to let people in with tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1425">They would have let somebody in with pleurisy, because it's not contagious.</span> <span id="s1426">So I had a very hard time, to, until they declared me.</span> <span id="s1427">It took a long time becausewe came here in 1950, liberated in 1945until I got a clearing that I can go.</span> <span id="s1428">And that's why it took so long for us to come here to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">05:19:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: So you and David got together pretty soon in Hanover?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1432">Well, we got married in 1946, March 16th.</span> <span id="s1433">And you know, the lady in whose house we lived, who we met afterwardsshe just couldn't believe it, that we got married.</span> <span id="s1434">You see, there is a big age difference between David and me.</span> <span id="s1435">But it reallyhe'sI mean, he's a young man.</span> <span id="s1436">So he now believes that he'sam I on tape still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">05:20:08</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: You know, one thing that's confusing to meI've never heard this before about both you and your husbandisI didn't realize, that you were sort of operating with German authorities, as opposed to with Britishthe British military Government or the American military Government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1442">Now, we got the British Governmentand that was a UNRR, UNRRthey were also helping.</span> <span id="s1443">Now, I don't know whether KZ Ausschussz was later.</span> <span id="s1444">Formed later.</span> <span id="s1445">I would have to check with Dave exactly where it waswhere it was formed.</span> <span id="s1446">Because in the very beginningI have a picture with La Guardia.</span> <span id="s1447">And yes, in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1448">This happened later.</span> <span id="s1449">That's whatwhat we are telling you about the KZ Ausschuss.</span> <span id="s1450">It didn't happen immediately after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1451">It didn't happen immediately.</span> <span id="s1452">Because at this time, we were being sent supplies from the United States to the UNRR, and La Guardia came, and, since I was involved in with the distribution center of the foodbut this was food given directly to peopleand La Guardia cameand there's a picture of him with mehe was so shocked when we were telling him what was actually happening.</span> <span id="s1453">So in the very beginning, there were not sothe people started coming, you knowmore and more people started coming.</span> <span id="s1454">And then whenthat's how, that's how I remember itbecause in the beginning, we weren't old.</span> <span id="s1455">That wasthe beginning, we were on Auerstrasse (ph), and food was coming, yes, to the UNRR.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: And you got involved in food distribution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1458">I was working together with others and we wereyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">05:22:30</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: When you were in these camps and you were with your cousin, do you remember what you talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: We wanted to keep our sanity.</span> <span id="s1462">So when we were digging this foundations in Sasel, we were doing some algebraic in the sand.</span> <span id="s1463">We were doing square roots, when we had a little bit of time.</span> <span id="s1464">And um....</span> <span id="s1465">See, we were going to the same school.</span> <span id="s1466">She's a littleshe was a littlein a little bit older class than I.</span> <span id="s1467">So this, we remembered.</span> <span id="s1468">That we had a little bit free time, and we were were doing the algebretical roots.</span> <span id="s1469">So you know to keep the sanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">05:23:12</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Did you think about religion at all; did you pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: I never stopped prayingI think that I never stopped praying.</span> <span id="s1473">I do not prayI mean, I change the way I pray.</span> <span id="s1474">Very frequently, and I pray with my own words.</span> <span id="s1475">But I don't thinkI might not have prayed in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1476">I might not have prayed.</span> <span id="s1477">But I prayed in Hamburg, because I remember it.</span> <span id="s1478">And, I don't know whether it is, has something to do with my upbringing, or whether it has something to do with my spirituality.</span> <span id="s1479">And I think that we have certain powers.</span> <span id="s1480">Maybe powers is too strong a word.</span> <span id="s1481">But we werein the worst of times even, we have some abilities.</span> <span id="s1482">Not in Auschwitz maybe.</span> <span id="s1483">Not in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1484">But we have some abilities.</span> <span id="s1485">We haveand I think they are, maybeyou could say they are God‑given.</span> <span id="s1486">And so I keep praying.</span> <span id="s1487">I keep praying.</span> <span id="s1488">I keepactually, my way of praying is, if this is important, a way of thanking God for what I want to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">05:24:49</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Let me ask you one more question.</span> <span id="s1491">And if there's anything you want to add.</span> <span id="s1492">Have you thought about what sort of long‑term impact these experiences have had on you, and, and have influenced the way you are today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: It is absolutely miraculous.</span> <span id="s1494">I went, in the very beginning, after in Germany, through some times which I was veryI may be depressed, nervous, and so on.</span> <span id="s1495">It's likely that, having been blessed with two sons and two daughter‑in‑laws and four grandchildren, and having worked also on my physical and emotional health through things like yoga and others, I am, actually right now, in a very good, very good place emotionally.</span> <span id="s1496">Because I could talk about it and I couldwhen my husband was testifying at UCLA [University California-Los Angeles], there's no way I was able to testify.</span> <span id="s1497">It stillwhen I think about it, even about testifying, especially about the ghetto, I was having butterflies in my stomach.</span> <span id="s1498">Howeverand I cannot watch anyanything on television about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1499">And when I watched the first time when there was a Holocaust story, I was sick for quite a long time because I have a visual memory.</span> <span id="s1500">And when I hear something, it doesn't affect me so much.</span> <span id="s1501">But when I saw it, I cannot see it.</span> <span id="s1502">I cannot see.</span> <span id="s1503">And I trysince I don't do any good to anybody and I have my responsibilitiesso I try not to look.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">05:27:00</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Can you think of howcould you talk about it after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: It took you a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Yes, we couldn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s1509">In the beginning, we just could not talk about it.</span> <span id="s1510">And I couldn't talk about it for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s1511">And, my son was alwayswhen I started talking quite recently, he was, was, likein a way, he was pleased that I talk about it.</span> <span id="s1512">He'd be very surprised that I was able to testify, with pretty much of a composure, because IDave was talkingmy husbandI couldn'tI was always, want to protect everybody from everything.</span> <span id="s1513">Now, I have a little number which I was wearing in the camps.</span> <span id="s1514">And my granddaughter wants it, she said, "Don't give it to anybody," she wants itso probablyI will show it to youprobably when she will ever eventually give to the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Can you think of any other way that these experiences have affected the way you've lived for the last 50 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: What really affected me is my upbringing.</span> <span id="s1517">I was brought up to respect elderly peopleand I don't forget that I am one of them right nowI was taught to be honest.</span> <span id="s1518">I was taught that you're supposed to be charitable.</span> <span id="s1519">We never were taught to hate.</span> <span id="s1520">And I think it's not so much the experience.</span> <span id="s1521">But the way I was brought up, there are certain things I just would not do.</span> <span id="s1522">I wouldn't do it.</span> <span id="s1523">Because this period of timeof course, it is a bigit's not a voida hurtmy main concern is actually whether when myespecially, my mothermy father, of course, toowhen they went into this gas chambers, whetherhopefully, they didn't suffer too muchthat is my very, very important concern.</span> <span id="s1524">And I do not want to investigate too much.</span> <span id="s1525">Because I don't offon the one hand, in the beginning, I was hoping it was instantaneous.</span> <span id="s1526">But I understand it was not instantaneous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">06:00:47</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: What are we looking at, Estelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: This is a photograph taken in a spa which we spent the summer in.</span> <span id="s1530">And there is my dear mother, Hannah Ryba Weingarten (ph), my dear father, Yakaf Weingarten (ph).</span> <span id="s1531">And there is my dear, handsome brother, Herschlipe Weingarten (ph), we called him Lolick.</span> <span id="s1532">And that's me next to my mother.</span> <span id="s1533">I was about five years old.</span> <span id="s1534">And let me remember them the waythe waythe way they were here, and not think that they were gassed in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: What are we looking at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1537">This picture was taken in Portumbina, where we had a summer home.</span> <span id="s1538">And I am picking up the balls and my brother, who is at the right, is playing withand his name is Lolick Weingartenhe is playing with Fishek,</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">06:02:13 my cousin.</span> <span id="s1540">I mentioned his name because, before going to Auschwitz, after his family was deported, he came to us and we tried to hide him.</span> <span id="s1541">And there was no room in our cellar for him.</span> <span id="s1542">And there were already five people.</span> <span id="s1543">And we hid him in a shack.</span> <span id="s1544">But unfortunately, the SS found him and took him to Auschwitz a few days before we went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: What year do you think this picture was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: I must have been here, maybe, 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: So the early 1930s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Yes, it would be in the early 1930s.</span> <span id="s1549">(pause) On this photograph, on the left, standing, is Felka (ph), my cousin, Felka Weingarten.</span> <span id="s1550">And on the right is Ritcha (ph), Ritcha Weingarten.</span> <span id="s1551">And I am in front of Felka, and my brother, Lolick Weingarten, is in front of Ritcha.</span> <span id="s1552">Unfortunately, Felka perished in the Holocaust and Ritcha, her husband, and her baby, perished in the Holocaust also.</span> <span id="s1553">Rest their memory.</span> <span id="s1554">(pause) This is my aunt, Paula Rosenblum, a sister of my mother's.</span> <span id="s1555">She perished in the Holocaust together with her husband and three small children.</span>
