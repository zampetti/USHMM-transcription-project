Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is an interview with Rose Myerhoff for the JCRC-ADL Holocaust History Project by David Zarkin at Storer Cable Television in Saint Louis Park on June 28, 1983.</span> <span id="s5">You’re from Minneapolis, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I live in Fridley.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Mrs. Meyerhoff, I’d like to thank you for being here today with us.</span> <span id="s8">Could you tell me your complete name, including your Jewish name, if it is different?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: My complete name is Rose Myerhoff.</span> <span id="s10">I don’t have a middle name.</span> <span id="s11">My mother used to call me “Ruchale,’ So I guess that’s my Jewish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: When and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: I was born in Antwerp, Belgium in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: What were your parents’, grandparents or great grandparents’ names, and where were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My mother’s name was Gitlau Genicow and she was born in Poland, and I assume that her parents were born in Poland, too, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s16">And my father’s name was Hillel Jacobowitz, and he was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s17">I don’t know about his parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What were your parents’ occupations?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My mother was a homemaker and my father was a cabinetmaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And what languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Mostly Yiddish, but some French.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Would you say that your family was secular or religious in practice or orientation?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Secular.</span> <span id="s24">I think I went to one or two Bar Mitzvahs when I was small, and maybe one or two weddings, and that’s about it.</span> <span id="s25">And that’s about the only times I was in a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did your family do business with gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Oh, I’m sure they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you ever have gentiles in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s30">My personal friends, you mean?</span> <span id="s31">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did you receive any formal Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: No, none at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Between 1930 and 1941, what events, either local, national, international, were you aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Well, I knew that the war had started in 1940, because the drafting of men for the army took place.</span> <span id="s36">The registration was in our school, so our school was closed to the children so that it could be taken over to register people.</span> <span id="s37">The school was just a couple of blocks away, and my friend was by the school, so when I went to her house, I saw people going in to be inducted.</span> <span id="s38">And a few days later, we packed up and ran to France.</span> <span id="s39">I was seven years old at the time, so I was aware that something had happened, because here we were walking to Paris from Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Were you aware of any anti-Semitism around you?</span> <span id="s41">Or as it may have affected other Jews in your community/</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: At that time, I had no idea that there could be any anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s43">I was very small, of course, so I really can’t judge.</span> <span id="s44">And as people escaped to France to avoid the on-coming German armies -- because they invaded Belgium in May, I believe, in 1940 -- every type of person went.</span> <span id="s45">Catholics, Jews, everybody ran.</span> <span id="s46">So it was a whole lot of people walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: How did the outbreak of the war change your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Well, as I said, we -- my mother and I -- packed up and started walking with a male friend of hers.</span> <span id="s49">My parents were divorced two years before, so that’s why my father did not accompany us.</span> <span id="s50">We started walking.</span> <span id="s51">And we didn’t stop until we got to Paris.</span> <span id="s52">I don’t know how many kilometers that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Were there any other members of your family in Antwerp?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No, this was from Brussels.</span> <span id="s55">We had moved from Antwerp to Brussels sometime before, when I was five, I guess, and so I lived in Brussels -- outside of Brussels in a suburb.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And you had no other relatives then?</span> <span id="s57">Brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I had a sister, and she was living with my mother’s sister in Antwerp, and I imagine it had to do with the divorce, you know.</span> <span id="s59">I’m not sure how come she was living over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What became of your sister then?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, my sister with her aunt and uncle and cousin were supposed to meet us in Paris, and then we were going to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s62">I thought that the plan was, at the time, to make our way to the North Sea and get on a boat and go to England, because England was supposed to be safe since the Germans weren’t expected to cross the Channel.</span> <span id="s63">They were expected to over-run Belgium and keep going to France.</span> <span id="s64">But we never made contact in Paris, so we returned back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s65">And we couldn’t go up to the North Sea, because we heard that the borders had been closed by the Germans, and nobody would be allowed to leave France.</span> <span id="s66">So we walked back to Brussels from Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: How long of a walk was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I have no idea how many kilometers.</span> <span id="s69">When we drove in ’74-’75, it took us several hours going full-speed by car and not obeying the speed limit.</span> <span id="s70">So I have no idea how many kilometers, but it took quite a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: A week?</span> <span id="s72">Or less than a week would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: I’m sure it took a week.</span> <span id="s74">I just don’t have any idea, but I’m sure it must have taken at least a week, because I was small and I complained a lot.</span> <span id="s75">(Laughs) It’s, you know, hard.</span> <span id="s76">But there were an awful lot of people with us, you know.</span> <span id="s77">Strangers, I mean.</span> <span id="s78">Hundreds and hundreds of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And you said they were of different backgrounds?</span> <span id="s80">Religious backgrounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I’m sure, because you know, in Belgium there aren’t that many Jews, so I’m sure it was just a fear of the invading army.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So then you went back to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Brussels, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: And then what happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, my mother went to the police, to the missing persons bureau to find out what happened to her child and her sister.</span> <span id="s86">And they made enquiries, and told her to come down sometime later.</span> <span id="s87">I have no idea of the time.</span> <span id="s88">And told her they had found the bodies.</span> <span id="s89">Apparently they had been hit by a bomb, and as proof they had a bracelet, a ring and earrings that my mother recognized that was worn by her sister.</span> <span id="s90">So when she recognized that, she was quite upset, and realized that, in fact, they were killed.</span> <span id="s91">It was a very upsetting experience for me, because I went along and I saw her, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: At that point, was there any more discussion among you, and your mother, or other people in the community about getting out of the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, we decided, I guess, that there was no place really to go.</span> <span id="s94">What happened is the king of Belgium, instead of standing up and fighting the Germans, decided to give up without a fight.</span> <span id="s95">I didn’t know the exact political terms.</span> <span id="s96">But anyway, the Germans were free to go through Belgium and head straight for France without any opposition, and he went to England, the king did.</span> <span id="s97">So people in Belgium just all went back from France.</span> <span id="s98">They figured they’ll be the same, they’ll be under occupation whether they stay in a strange place or go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: When did the Nazi occupation then occur, do you remember the month and the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I’m not sure of the month, but it was 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What actions did the German forces take in the early months and years of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I saw them on the streets of Brussels, in, if not May, certainly June.</span> <span id="s103">We went to France and came back, and we moved from one house to another in Brussels, to another suburb.</span> <span id="s104">We went from Anderlecht to Scarbie.</span> <span id="s105">And there was a shortage of food and clothing.</span> <span id="s106">You could tell that there was something different, because now you had ration books, and the milk, for example, that used to be delivered every morning to the house was now rationed.</span> <span id="s107">You could only get one liter per day per household.</span> <span id="s108">It was a limited amount.</span> <span id="s109">And my mother was making cake out of chestnut flour instead of regular flour, and you know, there were severe limitations on the food.</span> <span id="s110">So I noticed that.</span> <span id="s111">In 1942 is when things started to get serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What happened then in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: In ’41 and ’42 I continued going to school.</span> <span id="s114">And except for the restrictions, the rationing, we managed.</span> <span id="s115">But in 1942, the Germans decreed that Jews could not attend school.</span> <span id="s116">They were not allowed.</span> <span id="s117">So I had to stay home.</span> <span id="s118">During the summer, before this decree, I was going to day camp, and one day we heard that the person who ran the day camp -- he was a Catholic priest -- he was shot by a firing squad, and the reason was because he allowed Jews to attend his camp.</span> <span id="s119">So some of the older people, older kids from the camp, they were maybe 12, 13, 14, attended his funeral and my friend was among those, so that’s how I know.</span> <span id="s120">And then in September the decree came down that we could not go to school, so I continued attending that camp.</span> <span id="s121">The camp remained open even though the priest had been punished, so-to-speak, had been shot for having Jews.</span> <span id="s122">And I think it was in September that I came home one day and a friend of my mother’s stopped me at the door and said, “ Don’t go in the house.</span> <span id="s123">The Germans were here.</span> <span id="s124">Took your mother away.</span> <span id="s125">Don’t go upstairs to the apartment.</span> <span id="s126">I’m going to take you someplace.”</span> <span id="s127">And he just took me.</span> <span id="s128">I trusted him because I had seen him many times at home.</span> <span id="s129">So I went with him to the train station, and we traveled from Brussels to Louvain, to a Catholic convent there.</span> <span id="s130">It was Benedictine sisters who were running the convent.</span> <span id="s131">It was, I guess, an orphanage for, I assume, Catholic children, because there were quite a few children there that were not Jews.</span> <span id="s132">But they decided to take in Jews, I guess, because there I was, you know, and he knew exactly where to go, it looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Do you remember this man’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A; No.</span> <span id="s135">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s136">When I arrived, there were quite a few Jewish children already there and more kept coming as the days went on.</span> <span id="s137">We were all given a Christian name.</span> <span id="s138">My Christian name was Christiane DeGraaf.</span> <span id="s139">DeGraaf is Flemish, so that was kind of 100 percent safe, I guess.</span> <span id="s140">But the reason I knew that there were many Jewish children in the convent is, every morning we had to go to mass before breakfast -- Catholic mass -- so we would file into the chapel -- we all wore uniforms, so we all looked alike -- black dresses -- and the Jewish children were asked to sit way in the back of the chapel and not participate in the Catholic morning mass.</span> <span id="s141">So you could tell who was Jewish and who wasn’t, because all the Catholic kids were sitting in the front and kneeling and standing and sitting or whatever the mass required, the order of the service, but the Jews just sat in the back and were asked to be quiet and just wait till the mass was over, and then we could all go to breakfast and to school after.</span> <span id="s142">The school was in the convent, too -- in one of the wings of the convent.</span> <span id="s143">So we never left the convent grounds during that time.</span> <span id="s144">I stayed in the convent two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: During that time, was there ever any encounters with the German army?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">As I said, we started by sitting in the back and being separated during mass.</span> <span id="s148">But the nuns got nervous, and after a few weeks, I’m not sure how long, we were asked to sit together with the other children and kneel and stand and sit and do whatever, open the prayer book, and act in every way like the Catholic children so anybody looking in would not be able to tell that there was two different types of people.</span> <span id="s149">Periodically, SS officers or Gestapo or officials like that of the German authorities would come to the convent, knock on the door and be received, and inquire that they, ah, heard that there were Jewish people hiding in the convent.</span> <span id="s150">And the nuns, I’m sure, denied it, and said, “ No, there aren’t any.”</span> <span id="s151">But they insisted on searching the convent grounds each time, and this was quite a large building.</span> <span id="s152">It was laid out in four adjacent squares, so to speak, with a courtyard in the middle.</span> <span id="s153">And it was about four stories high.</span> <span id="s154">Each square housed a different population.</span> <span id="s155">There were the children -- the girls from seven to eleven in one square, from eleven to fourteen in another square, and fourteen to eighteen in the same square and then the nuns in the third square and the boys in the fourth square.</span> <span id="s156">Somehow, each time the SS officers would come to the convent and insist on searching the grounds, a nun or two would manage to come to the classrooms -- this was always during the day -- and alert us.</span> <span id="s157">And for some reason, they were concerned that we don’t stay in the classrooms even though we would be all mixed with the other children.</span> <span id="s158">And I don’t know if there would be any way of knowing which child was Jewish.</span> <span id="s159">We all had false names, you know, Christian names.</span> <span id="s160">But for some reason they insisted that we leave the classrooms immediately and start running, quietly walking or running in the opposite direction from where the SS officers were coming, so we were always one step ahead, so to speak.</span> <span id="s161">If they were coming up one staircase, we would be going down another.</span> <span id="s162">So we were always out of sight of them, and we had to keep quiet, and we had to go fast, so it was kind of upsetting.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What were you feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Well, we were very afraid, and we managed to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s165">I was only nine, but I was put with the eleven to fourteen group, and it just amazed me, looking back on that, that we remained quiet.</span> <span id="s166">We didn’t, you know, start crying, especially the younger ones.</span> <span id="s167">I don’t know what happened to the seven to eleven year olds, but they also were kept on the go.</span> <span id="s168">And then the SS would be satisfied, I guess, and would leave, and would not come back again for a while.</span> <span id="s169">I don’t know how many months would pass between, but I estimate that they probably came six, seven times to search the convent grounds and we got exercise going up and down the stairs.</span> <span id="s170">They never found us.</span> <span id="s171">It’s kind of hard to believe, but when I went back in either ’74 or ’75 with my husband, we found the convent and we went in.</span> <span id="s172">and there were a couple of nuns there that had taken care of the seven to eleven year olds, and they reminisced like crazy!</span> <span id="s173">“Do you remember how the SS used to come?”</span> <span id="s174">And all this stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">So then my husband, I felt, he believed it more now that he heard them ask me if I remembered, rather than me telling him, because it just sounds fantastic that, you know, a hundred kids could go up and down the stairs and not be discovered.</span> <span id="s176">I mean, our bunch was a hundred, but there were more in the other age groups.</span> <span id="s177">So, you know, you can imagine about 300 kids going up and down the stairs -- the logistics.</span> <span id="s178">But, it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What else would you like to mention about your life in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Well, I retained a warm feeling for Catholics in general and nuns in particular from that experience, because they were taking care of us for two and a half years under enormous stress.</span> <span id="s181">They got this enormous addition of people, we were healthy kids, rambunctious.</span> <span id="s182">They punished us and spanked us.</span> <span id="s183">They were strict, but they did take care of us, you know, and so I’m impressed.</span> <span id="s184">I’m still grateful, I guess to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: When did you leave hiding then?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: It was, I think, at the liberation.</span> <span id="s187">I guess the liberation occurred in September -- VE Day.</span> <span id="s188">I was in the convent at that time.</span> <span id="s189">We knew it was coming, because the school teacher -- they were lay people, the school teachers -- she had access to an underground radio or whatever that’s called.</span> <span id="s190">So she knew that Allies were planning an invasion and liberation before the summer started.</span> <span id="s191">So she promised before the summer recess came, which is, I guess, in the middle of July in Europe -- you go to school from September to the middle of July -- she promised to come in every day if she could, or every other day, with a map and little colored pins --you know, the pins with the little colored top and flag --and advance them for us, so we could see the Allied advance through France and through Belgium, if they succeeded.</span> <span id="s192">So she did come every day, just about, and did her map, but we were scared, so we laid the map out on the floor and crouched behind her desk.</span> <span id="s193">We had very tall windows in the classrooms facing the street, and she was concerned if anybody looking through the windows, she didn’t want them to see that we were looking at a map and moving flags.</span> <span id="s194">She was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Was this convent located in the country or was it in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No, it was right on the edge of the city.</span> <span id="s197">We could walk.</span> <span id="s198">We walked every Sunday outside of the convent for a short time, a half hour maybe, to the downtown of Louvain -- all of us, in rows -- neat rows, you know.</span> <span id="s199">We just walked slowly, and went for a walk to the center of the city from the convent.</span> <span id="s200">And since we were all fairly young, I imagine the convent was not located too far, otherwise we could never have walked there and back in a short time.</span> <span id="s201">And then when we found the convent, it was very close to the center of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: How close did the war actually get to your convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Well, when the Allies came to liberate, we had quite a few days of bombing first -- all summer, and probably the spring too.</span> <span id="s204">I’m sure it was the spring, because during school break, in the afternoon -- we had a ten, fifteen -minute break in the school day -- we could stand in the courtyard and count the Allied planes, the flying fortresses, 200 at a time we’d count, flying over on their way to Germany.</span> <span id="s205">So we knew that something was going on from there, because we saw the planes every day -- close packed, you know.</span> <span id="s206">We counted 200 in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s207">They flew three together.</span> <span id="s208">Also we started getting bombing in Louvain, in Belgium, so we spent quite a few nights in the basement of the convent.</span> <span id="s209">And the nuns never knew whether to keep us in the basement in case the convent collapses, and how will they get all these hundreds of kids out, or keep us in the courtyard, you know, and maybe the bombs will fall on us in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s210">They didn’t know which place was safer, so, you know, they would periodically, “Well, we better go out in the courtyard,” you know.</span> <span id="s211">And so we’d all get up, go up from the basement, stand in the courtyard, they’d be nervous about that, they’d put us back in the basement, we’d lay down on the floor and try to sleep a little bit.</span> <span id="s212">So we had a time with the bombing too, but we weren’t afraid.</span> <span id="s213">We’d run down the stairs.</span> <span id="s214">The dormitory was up on the fourth floor -- on the top floor.</span> <span id="s215">So we’d have to run down the four flights, and then the one to the basement.</span> <span id="s216">But I remember we were not scared.</span> <span id="s217">We were very, very happy that the Allies were coming.</span> <span id="s218">And as I say, we knew from the teacher, what was going on.</span> <span id="s219">We couldn’t wait till they got here, and we just were not concerned about the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: During this time, did you receive any news or information about what was going on in the rest of Europe regarding concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Well, I knew in 1940 already, that Jews were being taken on trains -- cattle cars -- to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s222">And I don’t know how I knew except I probably overheard adults speak.</span> <span id="s223">But I knew by the time I went to the convent that the reason I had to go and hide is so that I wouldn’t be taken too.</span> <span id="s224">And when the fellow said, “Don’t go upstairs, your parents were taken away,” I knew exactly what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: I’d like to ask what were the channels of information at this time?</span> <span id="s226">How did you know what was going on throughout Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: The one that I remember is the teacher.</span> <span id="s228">We had school every day, and she managed to keep up with what was going on outside, and not only with the Germans, but the Allies -- when they were planning an invasion.</span> <span id="s229">And as I mentioned before, she brought in a map in the summer, just about every day, and showed us what she had found out -- where the English were, where the Americans were, and how they were moving through France, and so we knew just about to the day when they were going to be in Belgium, but of course, not the exact day that they would be in our town.</span> <span id="s230">But one night after supper we were playing around in the recreation hall and somebody happened to look out the window.</span> <span id="s231">There was only one large window in that room.</span> <span id="s232">And that person saw something coming down like snow, white dots coming down from the sky.</span> <span id="s233">And then other people came to the window.</span> <span id="s234">She must have made some kind of noise, like, “Oh, come and look and see.”</span> <span id="s235">Pretty soon the whole window was filled with kids looking, and we could see that there were parachutes coming down like snow into the fields not too far from the convent.</span> <span id="s236">So we just became completely hysterical.</span> <span id="s237">We knew this was the liberation.</span> <span id="s238">We ran outside the convent, which of course, you know, we never would have thought of doing, going outside.</span> <span id="s239">And outside were all these jeeps and tanks and other trucks and variety of conveyances filled with soldiers.</span> <span id="s240">And the population in general was just hysterical!</span> <span id="s241">They were laughing and crying, and the women were jumping up on the tanks and kissing the soldiers and throwing flowers.</span> <span id="s242">And us kids, we were just completely out of our minds.</span> <span id="s243">We were crying and laughing and hugging each other, and screaming and jumping.</span> <span id="s244">You can’t describe it!</span> <span id="s245">It’s just incredible!</span> <span id="s246">We knew that now everything would be okay, that we wouldn’t have to worry about getting killed, or caught, or sent away.</span> <span id="s247">And we came back into the convent and started dancing and jumping some more.</span> <span id="s248">It was just one big day!</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: And then what happened.</span> <span id="s250">How long did you remain in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Well, I’m not sure when the Battle of the Bulge took place in relation to this day.</span> <span id="s252">It seems to me we heard rumors that the Germans were coming back, and all of us kids were quite upset.</span> <span id="s253">And this whole new batch of kids came to the convent, and we found out they were all Jews, and they were running away from this new invasion, so to speak.</span> <span id="s254">They had come from Weisenbaek, which is a little bit south of Brussels.</span> <span id="s255">I don’t know how they got to Louvain, which is north of Brussels, but these kids were running away from what they thought was the Germans coming back and continuing where they left off.</span> <span id="s256">They stayed till it was considered safe for them to leave.</span> <span id="s257">They came in a bunch and kind of lived in a bunch.</span> <span id="s258">These kids were getting some kind of Jewish education where they had come from in Weisenbaek because they knew how to do Israeli dances, one of the things I remember.</span> <span id="s259">And they taught us -- the rest of us Jews -- how to dance the Hora and Mai’im and a few other Israeli dances.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Did they say where they had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: They had been in Weisenbaek, they said.</span> <span id="s262">That was a home, but I don’t know how they managed to learn all these Jewish things.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: When you say “home”…</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: An orphanage-type.</span> <span id="s265">In those days, before the war, this may not have been called an orphanage.</span> <span id="s266">It may have been called a summer camp.</span> <span id="s267">You know, like the convent was not set up to receive a large population, either.</span> <span id="s268">And the place I went to afterwards was a summer camp, essentially, that was just kept open for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So tell me about this second Nazi threat.</span> <span id="s270">What did that turn out to be?</span> <span id="s271">Was that for real or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Well, they, I guess, made some headway through the Ardennes in Belgium.</span> <span id="s273">And I don’t know how far into Belgium they got -- through the Ardennes Mountains.</span> <span id="s274">They came through the snow.</span> <span id="s275">It was winter -- Christmas.</span> <span id="s276">So it was very unexpected, but the Allies rallied and were able to repel the Germans.</span> <span id="s277">Many lives were lost in that, because it was the winter and people were not dressed adequately and so on.</span> <span id="s278">So the threat was removed again, and everything was okay.</span> <span id="s279">It reminds me, though, of another incident.</span> <span id="s280">When we would go on our Sunday walk to town, while the Germans were occupying, the nuns were very nervous, but, you know, “Just everybody stay calm and stick together and it will be okay.”</span> <span id="s281">But after the liberation, a couple or three times, when we got to a street, all of a sudden we’d be asked to stop and the street would be barricaded because the Germans were hiding in some of the houses.</span> <span id="s282">They had to be flushed out, so to speak, and we couldn’t go down the street that day, and so we had to find another way to get back.</span> <span id="s283">So even though the town was officially liberated, it wasn’t completely safe.</span> <span id="s284">You know, it was guns shooting and so on in an effort to get the Germans out.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: How long did that go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I only remember that happening two, three times, and I don’t know as far as weeks, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s287">I left the convent some time in January, it seems to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Of what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: I guess that must be ’45 now, because ’44 was the liberation, and I think it’s sometime in January that I left.</span> <span id="s290">The Jewish organizations -- I’m not sure which one -- but I knew at the time that some Jewish organization was concerned that Jews don’t remain in Catholic environments, like a Catholic convent or a Catholic home, so they were trying to find all the Jewish kids they could, and put them someplace else, secular-type.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Do you remember the name of this organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No, I have no idea who they were.</span> <span id="s293">I just knew it was some Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s294">And so we were rounded up and taken out of the convent, and I was sent to La’ilde, which is another outskirts area of Brussels, and I stayed there for about a year or so, a year and a half.</span> <span id="s295">This was a summer camp where kids would come for the summer vacation, like Camp Tikvah here.</span> <span id="s296">This was a secular camp.</span> <span id="s297">The director was a doctor, which was unusual in those days, to have a female doctor.</span> <span id="s298">And she ran this camp in the summer, but it was opened to receive these Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s299">So even though it was a non-sectarian camp normally, it was opened to receive Jewish kids, so the population was, as I recall, was all -- well, not all Jews, come to think of it -- all orphans, and some were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s300">And as I say, I stayed there.</span> <span id="s301">It was called a “fresh air camp,’ so we did a lot of exercise and walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: A year, year and a half.</span> <span id="s304">Something like that.</span> <span id="s305">And I guess nobody really knew what to do with us because we were too young to be sent off into the world on our own, and we didn’t have family to go to.</span> <span id="s306">Well, we didn’t know if we had family to go to.</span> <span id="s307">So, we were kind of in a holding pattern.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: You knew what had happened to your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Yes, but I didn’t know what family I could go to.</span> <span id="s310">You know, they couldn’t ask me, “Do you have an aunt or cousin or somebody that you could live with?”</span> <span id="s311">because I would have said, “No, I don’t know of anybody.”</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: So how was this all resolved?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Well, from the fresh air camp, the summer camp in La’ilde, some Jewish organization, it may have been the same, took the Jewish kids out of there, and moved some of us to Weisenbaek, the place where the other kids had come from.</span> <span id="s314">And that was some kind of camp.</span> <span id="s315">We were all Jewish, in that camp.</span> <span id="s316">And in there we learned about Passover and all the other Jewish Holy Days and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s317">I remember, we all tried to fast for Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s318">You know, that was: We’re going to do it!</span> <span id="s319">We’re going to be big.</span> <span id="s320">And we learned more Israeli dances and songs and Hebrew songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: About this time you were what, about nine?</span> <span id="s322">Ten?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: I went to the convent at nine.</span> <span id="s324">I came out about eleven, eleven-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s325">I was in La’ilde till about like twelve-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s326">And I was in Weisenbaek till about fifteen-and-a-half.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: And were you concerned at that time about where you would finally be?</span> <span id="s328">Or were you content to be in Belgium?</span> <span id="s329">Or did you have any thoughts about that, as to your future, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: It’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s331">In the convent, I was one of the younger people, so I had the older kids kind of look after me.</span> <span id="s332">But in La’ilde I was one of the oldest, so I became busy taking care of the younger kids and that I knew were orphans, I guess I thought they had it tough.</span> <span id="s333">Like I took care of a little boy, he was only five, and he didn’t have parents, and I gave him a bath and made sure he ate and so on.</span> <span id="s334">And then in Weisenbaek, I was one of the older -- well in the middle.</span> <span id="s335">And I don’t remember thinking what would happen to me.</span> <span id="s336">Somehow I thought things were going to work out.</span> <span id="s337">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s338">Maybe that’s when you’re a child, you’re not as smart as an adult, and you don’t think of that.</span> <span id="s339">I don’t remember worrying about what would happen to me, because I wasn’t an adult yet, and I didn’t have a place to go.</span> <span id="s340">While I was in Weisenbaek, I found out later that HIAS was the one that was trying to connect.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What does that stand for?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: HIAS is: Hebrew Immigration -- I don’t know what the “A” stands for, I think the “S” stands for Society.</span> <span id="s343">I found out later when I came here that they were the ones that were trying to connect Jewish kids with relatives of some kind.</span> <span id="s344">And I arrived here in April of ’47, and they located my mother’s brother in New York, and I suppose told him that there was this niece in Belgium, and he proceeded to fill out all the forms and do whatever was necessary to bring me over.</span> <span id="s345">At that time, quotas were strict, and only so many foreigners could come over from any one country, and I started out under the Belgian quota, which meant so many Belgian citizens could come over to the United States in a given year.</span> <span id="s346">And when I thought everything was done, my pictures had been taken, whatever, passport made, and everything, then I found out when I was just about ready to go, that I was now under the Polish quota, because I was considered a Polish citizen, since my parents were from Poland.</span> <span id="s347">And although I was born in Belgium, I was not a Belgian citizen for purposes of quota.</span> <span id="s348">And I found out later that the Polish quota is much smaller, and that apparently somebody was hoping to slow down the flood of immigrants coming here.</span> <span id="s349">So that delayed me a whole year, because of course, the Polish quota was filled that year.</span> <span id="s350">So I didn’t get here ‘til ’47 -- April -- in New York.</span> <span id="s351">We lived on Port Washington Avenue in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: You lived with your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: And his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: When had they come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: They had come in the 1920s, like 1922 or something.</span> <span id="s356">And I understand there was another brother here too, but I never met him, so I don’t know him at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: How did your life proceed after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Well, my aunt and uncle adopted me.</span> <span id="s359">They became my legal guardians.</span> <span id="s360">And I attended elementary school here.</span> <span id="s361">I New York, you went to elementary school up till you finished the eighth grade, so I completed the eighth grade in New York and then I started high school in New York after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: And how was it that you came to Minnesota then?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I met my husband in New York, and we got married in New York.</span> <span id="s364">He was an engineer, and he was offered a job.</span> <span id="s365">At that time, this was in 1959, most of the large corporations that needed engineers would have search agencies find engineers and try to talk them into moving from one company to the other, and so there was a lot of traffic.</span> <span id="s366">And he got talked into coming out here, by Honeywell.</span> <span id="s367">They offered him a good deal, and he thought, well why not?</span> <span id="s368">We’ll come out here and live here.</span> <span id="s369">And I’ve been here ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Just a few more questions.</span> <span id="s371">Do you maintain contact with the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: In Minneapolis, yes.</span> <span id="s373">I am a member of the Holocaust Study Committee.</span> <span id="s374">And I go down to the Jewish Community Center once in a while for whatever programs they have.</span> <span id="s375">They have plays, periodically, and I’m on their dance committee, and we put on either dance programs or dance classes, or have guest teachers, dance teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: Maybe you could share with us a bit of what the Holocaust Study Committee does.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: The Holocaust Study Committee plans and carries out, every year, a Holocaust memorial service that alternates.</span> <span id="s378">The service takes place once a year in Minneapolis, the following year in St. Paul, and then back again in Minneapolis.</span> <span id="s379">But in addition to that, the Holocaust Committee is in the process of recording what happened to Holocaust survivors that are now living in Minneapolis and the surrounding communities.</span> <span id="s380">Also liberators and people who were hidden and so on -- whoever lived through that period.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: As we’re doing here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Which will become a part of a permanent library.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s385">It’s also going to be condensed and edited and so on into a booklet that can be distributed to schools and teachers for purposes of study.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Can you tell me what it has meant to you to be a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s388">I guess I’m glad because the way things turned out, I have a wonderful husband.</span> <span id="s389">I have three beautiful, wonderful, smart children.</span> <span id="s390">I’m not prejudiced at all.</span> <span id="s391">(Laughs) and I now have a grandchild four weeks old who was named after my mother.</span> <span id="s392">So I feel, altogether, I have made out okay, but otherwise I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Can you describe to me, after your experience during the Holocaust, your general feeling about human nature and non-Jews and Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Well, I am kind of neutral, you know.</span> <span id="s395">I don’t have any particular good or bad feeling towards non-Jews.</span> <span id="s396">I do tend to have a special feeling for Catholics and nuns in general, because of the risk that they took.</span> <span id="s397">They were risking their lives, you know, for several years.</span> <span id="s398">I continue to this day to have a real hard time with Germans.</span> <span id="s399">When I hear the German language spoken it’s really hard for me.</span> <span id="s400">I can’t make friends with Germans.</span> <span id="s401">If they’re German Jews, then it’s okay, but not if they’re German-Germans.</span> <span id="s402">It’s just been very hard to this day.</span> <span id="s403">I can’t.</span> <span id="s404">I can’t watch any T.V., The Diary of Anne Frank or anything like that, or Holocaust movies, or reads books on that whole thing.</span> <span id="s405">I was going to interview people for the Holocaust Committee, and I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s406">I decided I couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s407">You go on with your every day, you go to work, you take care of your kids, your husband and so on, but certain areas you don’t deal with.</span> <span id="s408">And that’s the way I try not to deal with it.</span> <span id="s409">I don’t wanna be reminded, read any books on it, or see it on the T.V.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Has your belief or practice in Judaism or a Supreme Being changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s412">Before we came to Minneapolis, we moved from New York to New Jersey, again due to the job situation, and there we joined a Conservative temple and we helped to renovate the building.</span> <span id="s413">They purchased an old building, and so we were active in that way.</span> <span id="s414">And they had services periodically when they could get somebody to conduct service on Friday night.</span> <span id="s415">So we were just starting to get into Judaism, because of course during the war I didn’t do anything, and before that I didn’t either.</span> <span id="s416">But then when we came to Minneapolis, we didn’t join any organized segment of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s417">In Fridley we were the only Jewish couple.</span> <span id="s418">As far as I know, we still are.</span> <span id="s419">There’s a couple of Jewish mothers and Jewish fathers but not couples that I know of, in Fridley And our kids were the only Jewish kids in the school.</span> <span id="s420">Maybe that’s a reaction to the Holocaust, that we didn’t go where all the Jews were -- I don’t know -- in St. Louis Park.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Well maybe, if I may be permitted an observation, when you lived in Belgium, I think you told us in the first segment that your family was assimilated into the general population rather than living in a so-called Jewish neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s423">I think that in general, I don’t know, but I would be surprised if there were Jewish neighborhoods in Belgium.</span> <span id="s424">I think, as a whole, the Jews were assimilated into the population, and I know that many Belgian families had Jewish children that they were hiding.</span> <span id="s425">I met some of them, you know, in Weisenbaek.</span> <span id="s426">I inquired, “Where did you stay the whole war?”</span> <span id="s427">“Well, I was hidden on a farm,” or here and there.</span> <span id="s428">So I know for a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: I think you said that you were a member, you participate in the Study Committee on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s430">Do you also do some public speaking or do you talk to groups, or do interviews like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, I have spoken to just one or two groups.</span> <span id="s432">I’m willing and able and ready, but I have not been asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: There might be some other comments that you might have that we could make at this time regarding those years, you know, in regard to the experience of living through that, and having some second-hand knowledge about what was going on to other Jews throughout Europe, and surviving the experience.</span> <span id="s434">Could you think of any?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Well, one incident stands out in my mind.</span> <span id="s436">When I was in La’ilde, one of the children that came to the same camp, I became friends with.</span> <span id="s437">I asked her what she did during the previous years, you know, how come she was still around.</span> <span id="s438">And she said that her parents or one of her parents worked for the underground -- the French underground or the Belgian underground -- and she was my age at the time, you know, ten, eleven.</span> <span id="s439">And since she was a small child, she was running the messages back and forth between the various groups.</span> <span id="s440">They thought she wouldn’t be suspected, being a child, and it would be easier for her than an adult to run from one group to another and run messages.</span> <span id="s441">And one comment she made that was strange, she said, “ All I wished for was a pair of shoes at that time.”</span> <span id="s442">Apparently she was doing all this without shoes.</span> <span id="s443">I know I didn’t wear shoes either in La’ilde.</span> <span id="s444">I had the wooden shoes the whole winter, for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: An interesting recollection from your time in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s447">PAGE 12</span></p> <p><span id="s448">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s449">PAGE 12</span></p></body></html>
