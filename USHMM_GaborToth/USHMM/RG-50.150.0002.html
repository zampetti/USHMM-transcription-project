born in Berlin, Germany in February of 1910 and we lived with our parents until 1913 when my mother was divorced.</span> <span id="s4">She married again in 1916 and my father again in 1918.</span> <span id="s5">The marriage from our mother wasn’t too successful but we managed to live a normal life until shortly before-well, until Hitler came.</span> <span id="s6">Our step-father was interned a couple-rather arrested a couple of times in connection with another matter not related to Hitler but when we- I emigrated or rather left Germany in 1929 in January managed to get-my sister emigrated in August of 1939 to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Before we go on, can you tell me something about your education in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: We were in high school educated in Berlin- both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: What did you hope to become?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">L: I had all intention of becoming a nurse but couldn’t because of health reasons so I had to look for other possibilities and I went into an office and started as an apprentice and I had quite a nice job but due to the Hitler coming to power, the company took another turn-somebody else came in and they decided- in the end I was the only Jewish employee left not because I was so good but because I was the only one who knew that particular job- it was like Sears Roebuck Catalogue Co. and I was the only one who knew it so they kept me up to August 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: When you started with this firm, was it Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">L: Completely Jewish.</span> <span id="s13">The boss was Jewish and the daughter and son wee in the business- it was a big company, approximately 200 people and of course it completely went to bits after-it was less and less and less when it became known that we were a Jewish company naturally.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: How early did the business start to deteriorate?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">L: It started already in 1931 and 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Before Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">L: There must be some connection with it because we had a marvelous Christmas</span></p> <p><span id="s18">business always and Christmas, 1932, it already started to be about 20% less approximately and then it continued to go down and in 1936, we had only about 10% of what we had in 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Was the business sold to non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: I’m not quite sure about that- if it was sold or forcible sold.</span> <span id="s21">Anyhow it was taken over.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: You were able to stay until 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">L: I then stayed until August 1939 because of what I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Did you notice and major difference in the attitude of the employees toward you as the years went by?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">L: Only a few.</span> <span id="s26">There was always ‘Heil Hitler’ salute in the morning and I was the only one who came in with ‘good morning’.</span> <span id="s27">And especially I remember our porter at the door- he became the fuehrer in the firm then for the employees and he was pretty stiff after-he knew me since I started there in 1930 so I wasn’t a newcomer but his attitude changed completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Did you have any problems as far as harm to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">L: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s30">Up to the end I was pretty lucky- I don’t know why but I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Did you also have a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, I was with my firm for about thirteen years and in the summer of 1937, my boss had to get out or would be arrested and immediately it was taken over, without pay, without anything and they kept me for six months and then they threw me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: The former own then was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Completely, Russian Jews and we were a small firm but I would say half of it Jewish and half Christian but all of us were completely eliminated immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: At this time when you were sent away from the firm, did you think of emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well, we thought of emigrating but we had absolutely no connection with anybody or something like that until my sister wrote to my father who had already emigrated a few years before and to this day I don’t know what letter she wrote but he immediately got me out through the usual procedure- being a household employee and I had the good luck of getting my sister out but no more my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: When you say your father had emigrated, had he gone to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And he sent you the papers to come there?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: He himself did not but through business connections, he got me a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Let’s go back a moment.</span> <span id="s42">You were in Berlin on Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s43">What happened on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: We didn’t see or hear anything during the night but the next morning when you went out in the street-it was gruesome.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">L: I happened to go past our temple which was Ridenstrasse in the center of Berlin and I just went past and I started to cry because the bare wall were standing and we went there since we were children so our whole life was in that synagogue and I never forget the site of those empty walls standing there- no more Ark, no more Torahs, no more nothing.</span> <span id="s46">I just can’t describe it- right now when I remember it, I see it before my eyes and I think it is a site you never forget once you have seen it.</span> <span id="s47">The building which meant so much to you for all you life- that was the one thing that hit me most.</span> <span id="s48">Of course, there were other things too but that one house gave you everything you ever wanted to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Did you know any of the local Nazis in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: No.</span> <span id="s51">I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">L: No.</span> <span id="s53">I only know that we-we always got our rolls delivered in the morning- hot rolls hanging on the door in a little bag- but it stopped completely and that one baker wouldn’t even sell bread anymore.</span> <span id="s54">My mother went somewhere else and later on she told me that our butcher didn’t want to sell to her anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did you ever see any signs “Judan Unerwuenscht”?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: That was a common sign.</span> <span id="s57">I suppose it hurt you deep inside.</span> <span id="s58">You saw it and you had to pass by.</span> <span id="s59">You didn’t know what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">L: There wasn’t one Jewish store which wasn’t written all over or the houses or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Or “don’t buy here- Jews”.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: How did you feel about this mounting pressure from let’s say 1936 on as a Jew in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">L: Well, we felt like every German Jew I guess.</span> <span id="s64">It’s fo everybody else but nothing is going to happen to you-you were born here after all, you are a German and a German Jew, what can happen to you.</span> <span id="s65">That was my opinion.</span> <span id="s66">Nothing can happen to you- I mean, Deutsche Jude that’s a German first and then a Jew even if the religious part is strong in you but nothing can happen to you-till the Kristallnacht- then you knew-then it really started to get serious.</span> <span id="s67">I remember once coming home and there was a little girl maybe 10-12 years old and a few boys were running after her.</span> <span id="s68">I was coming from work.</span> <span id="s69">They were shouting “Jew, Jew, Jew” and the little girl was running and when she saw me, she came to me and she said “would you take me home?”</span> <span id="s70">.</span> <span id="s71">I said what’s the matter and she said the boys are coming after me, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s72">I said so am I, come on, I’ll take you home.</span> <span id="s73">It gives you a kind of an eerie feeling to see kids like that being deprived of their childhood and everything to be afraid to go on the street that bigger children come after them and little things like that which I never thought about before but now thinking about it you see those scenes again, right before your eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: You mentioned this Temple which you belonged to in Berlin, was this orthodox or liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Almost the same service as we have now in the Hebrew Tabernacle.</span> <span id="s76">That’s why we were so drawn to them because it was like coming back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">L: All the same melodies and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Did you ever remember in that synagogue, the rabbi or anyone else speaking about the situation in Germany or Auswanderung?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">L: Dr. Warshauer always said “our help is only coming from the East, nobody else can help us” The East meaning the Russians or somebody else but nobody was talking about actually doing something about it and Dr. Warshauer or Dr. Blumenthal, I’m not quite certain which one died in concentration camp because he wouldn’t leave Berlin.</span> <span id="s80">Those were the two Rabbis I remember most during our time.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: I do not remember any Rabbi ever saying something from the pulpit about emigrating.</span> <span id="s82">Whether or not they said it- they might but I don’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Do you remember feeling a pressure from people emigrating up that time-thinking well, maybe I should do the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">L: Not in our immediate relationship or fiends, very very few emigrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: That’s why we lost so many relatives because everyone said well, nothing will happen to us but I must say once my company in 1937, then I started to think secretly whatever will happen to us because we neither have the means nor the possibility to go anywhere but what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s86">I don’t think I thought about death or concentration camp but I do remember one speech that must have been after Krisallnacht from Goering- he said and I quote “We do with the Jews like we do with flowers- we don’t give them any water” and to this day, those words ring in my ears and I said you really did what you said you were going to do and since that time, I don’t think I ever really breathed freely.</span> <span id="s87">That was always in front of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: That’s exactly what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s90">And they did it in a more cruel way than we ever would anticipate.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Did most of your friends and relatives think he wouldn’t last long?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">L: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">Think so because so many other countries, they wouldn’t all the Jews to be exterminated.</span> <span id="s94">And to be quite frank, there was never really any fear, so to speak, about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s95">Nobody knew of that- the word was never mentioned so what did we know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s96">I remember the day I arrived in England- a lot of my step-mother’s relatives wee there and they said what is it like in Germany and I said- those are words which still stick in my mind- there will be war within two months.</span> <span id="s97">They said “don’t be ridiculous, how can you say anything like that”.</span> <span id="s98">I said “you didn’t see the people marching in Berlin- you didn’t see the SS and the Gestapo going through Unter den Linden and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them and the people on the side cheering them up like anything.</span> <span id="s99">I said you didn’t see them.</span> <span id="s100">They said “don’t be rediculous Lilo how can there be war”.</span> <span id="s101">I said well, we saw the airplanes all going over Berlin and there was a parade, I don’t know what it was, Hitler’s birthday or something, I don’t remember exactly what it was but there was a big, big parade with the airplanes flying and the tanks rolling along.</span> <span id="s102">You didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s103">Well, they found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: How did you look upon these parades in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">L: With fear-fear in my heart because I knew I was by myself.</span> <span id="s106">I’m not speaking about my relatives-my mother or anything-I’m speaking in general.</span> <span id="s107">You knew what can you do against hundreds of thousands cheering.</span> <span id="s108">The few, I mean the very very few people- I mean compared to those hundreds of thousands maybe a dozen people talked to you.</span> <span id="s109">But the other ones, for them you were just something to be trampled on or something not even to be looked at.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: You mentioned that baker and the butcher, were there more such incidents when people wouldn’t sell to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: There were signs everywhere on- Jews not wanted- I mean that you couldn’t go in or you wouldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s112">Even if they wouldn’t recognize you as a Jew but you yourself were kind of held back.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: These were stores you patronized before?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">L: Of coarse, since we lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Was there ever any conversation between you and the proproietor?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">L: About Hitler?</span> <span id="s117">Never a word mentioned.</span> <span id="s118">That was just.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: To me it was you are not allowed to speak about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">L: Or you didn’t dare to speak about it.</span> <span id="s121">Even if you would like to sell to you, maybe it was the one who stands next to you would be an SS and would give you over- I mean not for me but fo the proprietor of the store- would give you over as a Jew friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: In this job which you had, was the owner ever put in a difficult position for retaining you as late as 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">L: No, because- I can’t remember what the name of the man who was in charge of the Nazi Party in the store- it wasn’t a gauleiter-we would say shop steward here.</span> <span id="s124">He okayed it because he knew well I was the only to get that catalogue- it was a deadline for the printer and I was the only one to get that catalogue out on time and there were small translations to be made in French and English and I was the only one, I didn’t speak French and I spoke a little English but I was the only one who could use the dictionary sufficiently well.</span> <span id="s125">I knew the right words to put into print.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Was there ever a Gestapo agent in the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">L: That I don’t know because after all, I was only a little cog in a wheel.</span> <span id="s128">If there was one in the office for the manager, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: You mentioned that you left your job in 1937</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, they kept me on until June of 1938.</span> <span id="s131">The Jewish boss left in 1937.</span> <span id="s132">They kept me on but under protest of course of the few Nazis in there and I left in Jan. 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: When you say under protest, did they make any problems for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s135">It was pretty uncomfortable but I needed the money and where would I go so I had to swallow my pride and- I mean we would have starved at home if we wouldn’t have gone out.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: In what way did they make it uncomfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, they would never talk to me directly and when there was something to do you were always sort of eliminated.</span> <span id="s138">They gave me to do just the bare necessities.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did these people ever ask you if and when you were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No, not me because they couldn’t care less what happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: I would imagine that that’s a very difficult day, the day that you left Germany.</span> <span id="s142">How did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: That is I think very hard to describe or to say something about because deep in my heart I knew I would never see my mother again.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">L: I remember my mother was always talking about suicide- after my sister left because I only left in August- that was seven or eight months later and I always said to her “Mommy, you can’t do that to us, we need you” because we were very very close with her.</span> <span id="s145">And I remember that night I left- I said “Mommy, I give you back your promise” I never told Ann that, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: No but that is something to- even to think now about about it after almost forty years.</span> <span id="s147">When you said to me how I felt about it- it’s terribly hard to describe when you know and by then of course, you knew- well, you didn’t know whether you could get somebody out or not because I was the only one who was lucky I don’t know whether to use that word because at that time you didn’t feel lucky.You felt alone in the world with nobody- you even thought God had deserted you.</span> <span id="s148">What was it to be taken away from your twin sister, from your mother.</span> <span id="s149">I thought how could anybody do that to you.</span> <span id="s150">But my mother always said to me “you won’t forget what happened but time will make you”.</span> <span id="s151">In a way, she was right but even now, it’s hard, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Was there any chance that the person who allowed you to come to England...</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No, I had to do that all by myself.</span> <span id="s154">I think my father at that time- he had his own family.</span> <span id="s155">I mean he got married and had a daughter and he wasn’t too keen on the awareness that he had two elder daughters so I knew whatever had to be done, I had to do by myself.</span> <span id="s156">My English wasn’t good or perfect at that time but I managed to get my sister out and I also managed to try to get a position for my mother and the woman said to me “My son said I should give you an affidavit for your mother but you have to wait three weeks.</span> <span id="s157">If in three weeks, no war breaks out then I can give it to you.”</span> <span id="s158">And the time was August between 15th and 20th, I forget the date.</span> <span id="s159">But what happened after that, September 3, 1939 war broke out and that was the end of my dreams to get my mother out.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">L: I still remember we got letters from our mother through the Red Cross later on and she in one letter.</span> <span id="s161">In the meantime, all the Jews had to move in with relatives or friends.</span> <span id="s162">Who had a three room apartments had to have so and so many people in and so forth so my mother move in with her sister-in-law from her first husband and she wrote that everybody said “Oh,if you go to Auschwitz, it’s much better.</span> <span id="s163">It’s such a nice camp.”</span> <span id="s164">That was the idea they had in Germany at that time from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s165">They didn’t know what they went in for.</span> <span id="s166">“The treatment is much better in Auschwitz then it is in Theresienstadt”.</span> <span id="s167">And my aunt she survived Theresienstadt- she came back.</span> <span id="s168">She lived till she was 96 and she was in Theresienstadt and she said she never forgets it- she told me once she was at the end of the compound and she was just looking for company or something and a woman came up to her and she looked bedraggeled and so thin that you wouldn’t recognize anyone she said “you are Elise Callman, aren’t you”.</span> <span id="s169">And she said “yes, that’s me”.</span> <span id="s170">And the woman said “don’t you recognize me?”</span> <span id="s171">And she said no- it was her own cousin.</span> <span id="s172">And my mother was sent to Auschwitz- Ann found that out when she was- in the meantime in England we left our job and joined the British Army because we had dideas that no going into munitions or anything, we would get our mother out if we were so minded to help the country fight Germany.</span> <span id="s173">That was our ambition and Ann went the war was over, she went to Germany(Tape Turned)</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Did England give you permits in transit or a permanent visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Permanent visa as domestic only.</span> <span id="s176">And you had to report any movement you made to the local police.</span> <span id="s177">You weren’t restricted in any way.</span> <span id="s178">I don’t know if it was for their protection or for my own protection that I had to report to the police.</span> <span id="s179">I was in a very small town in Yorkshire- whether that was locally or not I’m naturally not aware.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Where and with whom were you placed?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: With a family in Yorkshire as a domestic.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: A Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s184">But the job I got for my sister was also in Yorkshire- that was not a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s185">People were quite willing to get to help people in that way if they had the room and they needed help.</span> <span id="s186">For my mother the was an elderly Jewish lady who desperately wanted a companion.</span> <span id="s187">It depends on the individual people.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: I still remember my mother telling me how difficult it was for her to swallow the roll on the day she left because she had such mixed emotions, how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">L: Well, I was still choked up from the night because I didn’t sleep and I know I didn’t have any breakfast but - a little thing- the day before I left, I went to the flower shop and ordered a flower pot to be delivered to my mother the same day in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s190">And a friend of the family and my mother brought me to the airport.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Airport?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Airport?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">L: Yes, I went by plane and because my Jewish boss had a daughter and son in England and he paid my fare in return for me taking care of him during the trip to England.</span> <span id="s194">He went along with me- my Jewish boss before the firm was taken over.</span> <span id="s195">He wanted to get rid of his apartment and things but his children said now you come and this was on the 14th of August 1939- that says everything right.</span> <span id="s196">And so we went by airplane- Lufthansa at that time and they took to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Did Lufthansa make any restrictions as far as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">L: No.</span> <span id="s199">Once you had your ticket and your official papers that you could leave the country, then everything was all right.</span> <span id="s200">There were of course Nazis at every check out counter and you couldn’t- mother was only allowed up to a certain point and I still see them standing there and my mother turned around and didn’t look anymore and then the plane landed in Holland and I don’t know- it felt unreal.</span> <span id="s201">I felt as if it wasn’t me because the crew changed- we took another plane.</span> <span id="s202">At that time there were no jets or anything.</span> <span id="s203">I had a complete eerie feeling that it is somebody else sitting there in the airplane- it was my first airplane ride of course.</span> <span id="s204">It wasn’t me.</span> <span id="s205">It couldn’t have been me and I think excitement turned to pain of leaving my mother in the background because I was a person was so excited that everything was storybook like- that’s the only way I can describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: When you came to England, I assume that maybe Ann met you</span></p> <p><span id="s207">L: No.</span> <span id="s208">Ann couldn’t meet me because I arrived in London and she was in Yorkshire which is approximately by train 6 or 7 hours and of course she didn’t have any money to come.</span> <span id="s209">So there was a mix up in the arrival time and we weren’t met at the airport and I had to bring that old gentlemen to an outskirt of London and from there somebody called and they drove me back in the car to my father’s house.</span> <span id="s210">I called Ann of course the same night on the telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Did any Jewish organizations help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">L: In London, you didn’t need anybody.</span> <span id="s213">But in Berlin, you had to have a certificate from a Jewish organization, I don’t know which one it was at the time, that you were capable to doing household work for the English consul and there I got a test in a household and that woman- I was there by eight o’clock in the morning- and she said now you just do as if it’s your own house you do what’s to be done- there’s the pots and pans and there’s the towels and there’s the soap.</span> <span id="s214">She didn’t even appear- I did everything by myself and in the afternoon she saw that everything is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: This was a Jewish agency?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">L: It was a Jewish agency</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: You would think that they would have just filled it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">L: No, no, they didn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: That is something knew to me, I didn’t even know that because I left in January, there was absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s220">I even went out without the Jewish Sara in my passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">L: Well, I got Liselot Sara Callman on my passport.</span> <span id="s222">And we got a big J on the front of the passport- that distinction didn’t escape anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: That must have come between January 1939 and August 1939 because I did not have it- I had my plain passport with no J or Hagenkreuz or anything of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: You both had these jobs in Yorkshire, how did you get the idea of joining the British Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">L: Well, we were interned like every good German was - it didn’t make any difference if you were a Jew or non- Jew and we were in an industrial area where they were afraid of spy movements and so on and we were interned in May of 1940 and to be quite honest, we had the best time of our lives because we went to the Isle of Man and the British government paid for everything.</span> <span id="s226">You had your food, you had your lodging.</span> <span id="s227">We were together with all our friends in one boarding house- German friends we met in Yorkshire- all highly educated people who were domestic and we were all together interned and we had the most marvelous time- we went to the beach all the time, we swam for hours, went home for lunch.</span> <span id="s228">A few of us always had duty to help the landlady who was preparing for the meals.</span> <span id="s229">We were responsible for our own rooms but otherwise no.</span> <span id="s230">Of course, we were confined the one little town- there were no trains out.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: How did you feel when the British came and told you you had to be interned?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">L: The only question I asked was- my sister at that time the next house to me- I would see her, it was as if you were on Ft. Washington Avenue and you look over to the Temple, so near.</span> <span id="s233">And the only question when they came in the morning- a woman officer and two men officers came- only question I asked was if they were taking my sister too.</span> <span id="s234">That was the only question I asked and when they said yes then I said everything was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did they explain to you why they were taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">L: Well, you knew something was going on but the lady I worked for was very civic minded and she knew every mayor and official in the town of Bradford which was the name of the town where I worked and I went up to her with of course escort to her room to wake her- it was that early, she wasn’t up then.</span> <span id="s237">She said “ Lisa, they can’t do that to me, I need you” and the officer said we have to.</span> <span id="s238">She said she is calling the mayor right away and he said she could do that but it won’t help.</span> <span id="s239">Because that is not his domain, it is the government.</span> <span id="s240">I said to myself, so what, if Ann is coming, what’s the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Well, we knew that the war was pretty difficult and in a way I felt that we knew we were not responsible fo the war but we were born there and we knew the people who were fighting and think we knew that something was going to happen- that we might be interned and when they came to the door and I opened up and I saw the people I said I think I’m ready but before I go, will you please tell me, is my sister coming and of course, they laughed and said your sister said the same thing.</span> <span id="s242">Yes.</span> <span id="s243">And a lady went upstairs to pack and she said take this, that take the other thing but she said don’t forget a bathing suite you sure can use it.</span> <span id="s244">I thought to myself what a difference between what you think your mother is going through in Germany and here the people- they sort of apologized to you but it’s for your own protection.</span> <span id="s245">You knew you are an enemy alien.</span> <span id="s246">It was heartwarming experience to see those officials talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Was this a usual experience in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">L: Yes.</span> <span id="s249">It was, in the industrial regions and in those regions where troop concentrations were.</span> <span id="s250">It was a question of security.</span> <span id="s251">My father and step mother and others in London, they didn’t know anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: How did you then get the idea of joining the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">L: Well, when we were interned, of course, anybody wasn’t then thinking of going back to household but those people who gave you- where you were employed with, they had to go to a tribunal and vouch fo you that you didn’t have any tendency to be a spy before that and then they had a tribunal on the Isle of Man and they asked you all kinds of questions and then they decided you were okay, you could go.</span> <span id="s254">But once we came back, it wasn’t the same anymore.</span> <span id="s255">This was in January 1941 and the war went pretty badly then a few of our friends went into munition but Ann and I talked it over and said well, if the Army or the Air Force take us- by that time they took Germans in a special regiment, men too, and then we decided we try the Army.</span> <span id="s256">They took us and we were the second German battalion to be formed with the women’s army- the auxiliary territorial service and we both served from October 1941 until November 1947 and we went from so to speak a dollar a day when we started- it wasn’t even a dollar, it was less something like 50 cents.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: It was thirteen shilling a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">L: And when we left the Army we got about 50 shilling a day.</span> <span id="s259">So we went from private to sergeant both of us.</span> <span id="s260">I worked as a cook all the time and Ann because she has bad feet was lucky and was sent to the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Where were you stationed?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">L: At first, we were stationed in Oxford and from Oxford we went to Colchester and then to Halifax, then Yorkshire again and from there, we bot made application to go overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: This was still with the intention of helping your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">L: Helping our mother.</span> <span id="s265">That was the only intention.</span> <span id="s266">I mean we made thirteen shilling a week which was of course a ridiculous pay but we had the distinction of helping the country and being in uniform and not making money in munitions factory- just to make money.</span> <span id="s267">We felt that was our part for helping our mother to come later to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I want to continue on that one.</span> <span id="s269">When I went to Germany naturally as a volunteer, the first thing my superior said to me “Of course, being a German Jew, you want to find out about your family” and I looked at him and I said “yes, sir, that is my intention”.</span> <span id="s270">He said you have a pass to go to Berlin tomorrow morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: That was in February of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: After the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s275">And the next morning I went with the Library and Document where I worked.</span> <span id="s276">We had a couple of trucks going there and I went on a truck for I don’t know how long through Germany.</span> <span id="s277">I knew a cousin of mine had survived concentration camp.</span> <span id="s278">As soon as I got to Berlin, I went to him.</span> <span id="s279">Of course, he didn’t recognize me being in uniform and I said to him “Hello, how are you” and he said I’m sorry, I don’t recognize you and then I said kiddingly I called him uncle when I was little and I said “Uncle” and he said “Oh my god, it’s you.”</span> <span id="s280">Knowing Germany but after the war and everything, he went with me to the Jewish Center which was Oranienburger Strasse which now is the center behind the wall and I went up and I said I am looking for my mother and they kind of looked at me being in uniform and I said to them I am a German, of course, I spoke German with them.</span> <span id="s281">So they gave me the list to look through and I didn’t find my mother’s name and then a man came up terribly disfigured.</span> <span id="s282">I think they must have crushed his back or something because that man is still sort of before me and he sat down with me and he said which transport did your mother go on and I said to my knowledge she went in that and that transport- February of 1943 to Auschwitz and he said you mother was lucky.</span> <span id="s283">To the best of our knowledge that transport was immediately gassed.</span> <span id="s284">To me at that time it was of course well, I don’t think I can describe me feelings at that time.</span> <span id="s285">I think anybody can understand that.</span> <span id="s286">And then he said, of course, you want to keep the day, you want to light the candles.</span> <span id="s287">And I said yes and he said will, we would very much like it if you would light the candles for your mother on February 17th- that’s the day we have set apart.</span> <span id="s288">I said of course,I certainly would and since then we keep it as the day my mother passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: It must have been difficult when you came to this Oranienburg Strasse center and saw essentially this Jewish remnant of</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I was kind of heartened by the fact that I saw quite a few Jewish people there and talking to them I found that most of them had lived underground in Berlin and of course if you had come back from concentration camp and that’s what they built up- I suppose they had worked with them that started it quite some time before I came but it was a moving experience to see that some people had had the stamina- I don’t think I could call it anything else- and the will to go underground and survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">L: We have a cousin who is now 86 years old and she lived underground.</span> <span id="s292">She had one daughter who was sent to a children’s transport to England.</span> <span id="s293">She lived underground all that time and luckily enough she survived- her husband was taken I don’t know from the street- I didn’t want to ask, don’t want to ask.</span> <span id="s294">She got papers to come to America in 1945 or 1946 and her daughter was still in England and coincidence she joined the army too and years and years later in America we went through some of our pictures and Ann and that cousin’s daughter both looked at the picture and one or the other said “that’s you and that’s me” they were standing next to each other and didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: What’s important was that it was our Rosh Hashanah service for the Jewish soldiers and we were all gathered together at that time and the Rabbi said come on, I want to take a picture of all of you to let you keep a memory.</span> <span id="s296">In the army, there were really no last names and she used the name Phyllis because it sounded more English than her real name.</span> <span id="s297">She was Phyllis and I was Ann so there was actually no relationship other than that we were two Jewish soldiers attending the service.</span> <span id="s298">This was in the Army in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: You went to Germany after the war ended, where were you during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">L: I went first to Belgium before the war ended that was in April of 1945.</span> <span id="s301">My unit went to Belgium (we were in different units then) and we only went to Germany in the end of 1946- we went to Hamburg and at that time we were reunited again in one unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: When you went to Berlin, did you go to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: The first time I didn’t because I was completely down with searching for my mother then the moving experience to be reunited with my aunt and we had to go through the Russian sector, I had no civilian clothes with me so I went in uniform and at that time they were saying that the Russians were kind of keen on women and so I said to my cousin who was with me if anything happens, take this little paper, go there and there, they’ll speak German, tell then what happened, where I went, I wasn’t allowed to go there, I did that on my own and they will try to get me out.</span> <span id="s304">Don’t worry about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Your home was in the eastern sector?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I didn’t go then to my home.</span> <span id="s307">I went to my aunt who was in a heim, a nursing home so to speak.</span> <span id="s308">That was the second time and of course, I went there now very frequently on business and the second time I went, I went with a girlfriend of mine, and we comandeered a jeep, also one of our German Jewish friends, and I said whatever we do, I have to go to the street where I lived.</span> <span id="s309">Of course, in that jeep we went and we stood there and I couldn’t believe it- a shell of a house was left- everything else was- and the same little grocery store- if they were the same owners or not I couldn’t tell you- and one of the fellows said “ let’s go and take a picture of you”.</span> <span id="s310">Of course, everybody came out to take a look why are these soldiers standing at that house and taking pictures.</span> <span id="s311">Unfortunately, the pictures never came out but it’s the memory I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: How did you react to being Germany as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">L: Well, I tell you.</span> <span id="s314">It was pretty tough in Berlin for me because you knew everything but you didn’t recognize anything- it was just a shell.</span> <span id="s315">We went once to Rickestrasse Synagogue and you could still see the hay where they kept the horses.</span> <span id="s316">And of course that is a picture I never forgot.</span> <span id="s317">I mean I never went to Rickestrasse, I knew the temple was there but we were liberal and that was orthodox but I mean it was a synagogue and a synagogue to a Jew is like St. Patrick’s Cathedral to the Catholics and I still see those partitions for the horses, the partitions showing that there were horses in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s318">Just imagine if you come to the Hebrew Tabernacle and everything is taken out- where how benches are and the Ark and everything and you see wooden partitions put up for animals- nobody who hasn’t seen this can understand- you can’t describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: When did you leave the Army?</span> <span id="s320">When did you leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yes, we went back to England only for a little while because at that time, my half-sister who had married and had emigrated to Canada had said to us you have no other family than us.</span> <span id="s322">It doesn’t make any difference where you live, why don’t you come to Canada.</span> <span id="s323">And I have to interpret in there that being in the Army, we were naturalized- we the British passport and of course Britain and Canada was practically one so it was not difficult for us to go to Canada.</span> <span id="s324">So she said to her that when we leave the Army we would come to her.</span> <span id="s325">It was an experience, it was traveling.</span> <span id="s326">I mean, we were by ourselves, we had no other ties so whether we were living in England or Canada, it didn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s327">We left the Army in November 1947 and our severance pay from the Army did not run out until I believe the end of January, 1948 and we left England before that and we were still on high seas, we were still being paid by the Army and when we got to Canada, how long did you stay....</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: We only stayed, because not living with my father before, I could not be the dutiful daughter and bow down to everything my father</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: He had emigrated to Canada too?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">L: And he was still the real Prussian father, very domineering and we weren’t used to this because we lived with my mother- as we said they were divorced in 1913.</span> <span id="s331">We never lived with him and by that time we were 38 years old and you can’t bow down then to anybody- you have to live your own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: What made you come to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: What made me decide to come to New York was very simple because I would not take any- could with my father because it was intolerable and I came to New York and our cousin also a member of the Hebrew Tabernacle gave us an affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: They had also emigrated from Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: They were here since 1944.</span> <span id="s336">They also lived first in England and they came over to America.</span> <span id="s337">They were here quite some time before us.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: How did you manage the first days in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Well, to me when I was in New York for my vacation for Rosh Hashanah in 1949, it was to me as if I had lived here all my life.</span> <span id="s340">It was home to me immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Why did you feel this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">L: Because we were big city people.</span> <span id="s343">Berlin was a big city, right.</span> <span id="s344">And at this time, Toronto in 1948 was a very, very, a small English city.</span> <span id="s345">It wasn’t as it is now- 1 million people city.</span> <span id="s346">It was no cinemas open on Sunday, no restaurants open on Sunday- everything closed and coming from Berlin- we still had that big city feeling in us.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: And of course, as I said, being here with my mother’s family was also a very big drawing point for me and I thought if we could find work in Toronto we certainly could find work here too.</span> <span id="s348">As it so happened, I stayed with the same company here as I started with in Canada and I got a transfer reaffected over here and so I stayed with them for 28 years until I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: So when you came to New York you knew that you would have employment?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No really.</span> <span id="s351">The- I being independent said I would go to see them but I would not ask for a transfer but my boss here in New York said why be so stupid, I’ll reaffect if and reestablish you seniority.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you settle in Washington Heights immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: We lived on 110th Street in rooms but were looking for an apartment and would you believe it in 1952 we moved into this house hee and we are still here.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany since you settled here?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">L: 1963.</span> <span id="s356">My aunt was still living at the time.</span> <span id="s357">We didn’t have any intention of going but she said well, I send you the money I would like to see you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: She was the one who survived Theresienstadt and lived in the heim in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">L: Yes.</span> <span id="s360">Would you believe it, we couldn’t wait until we were on the Templehof Airfield again to board the plane to go back home.</span> <span id="s361">You have the feeling every person you meet, not that you knew them, that maybe he had something to do with it, maybe he was the one.</span> <span id="s362">Of course, we went to the Friedhof, my grandparents are buried there and that part where my grandparents were, wasn’t destroyed at all.</span> <span id="s363">It looked just like- every leaf was glazed with sunshine.</span> <span id="s364">It was a revolution to see those two graves.</span> <span id="s365">But part of it where other family members were buried was completely destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did you have any different feelings when you returned in 1963 than you had when you returned with the British Army in 1946, 47?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">L: Yes.</span> <span id="s368">I had because you were with the soldiers, don’t forget that.</span> <span id="s369">You were one of the conquerors.</span> <span id="s370">I mean not you yourself but what you khaki uniform stands for pushed them in the ground and that was complete different feeling as if you go there in 1963 as a civilian and maybe it’s those years which elapsed in the meantime may have something to do with your attitude too, but you wee one of the conquerors.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did you notice any difference in your attitude towards the German people in the two times you were back?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Well, I would say not us toward the German people but the German people toward us- the other way around.</span> <span id="s373">When we were with the Army, they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">L: Kowtowing to us</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: they were going down, they were clapping their heels, thank-you and please and almost kissing your feet in thankfulness for what you are doing for them while in 1963, there was a completely different feeling.</span> <span id="s376">The people had forgotten.</span> <span id="s377">They had, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s378">We hadn’t forgotten but they had forgotten what happened during the 1930's and during the war.</span> <span id="s379">To me it meant, they were feeling much as we were feeling here in America- secure.</span> <span id="s380">They said it couldn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s381">But to us, to see them strapping around, cock-sure of themselves again and we said well, it can happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Did you ever engage in any conversation with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">L: No.</span> <span id="s384">Not me.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s386">Not me personally but in a group.</span> <span id="s387">I wouldn’t attempt because I think I would get pretty nasty but in a group we did and of course the more you speak with them- the more you hear .</span> <span id="s388">We only had to go along with them- we weren’t responsible.</span> <span id="s389">We had Jewish friends, we were friendly with Jews.</span> <span id="s390">Suddenly there was absolutely no nastiness among them.</span> <span id="s391">They were all being forced through others higher up.</span> <span id="s392">But they themselves were pure as driven snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: This reminds me of your story about the parade in Berlin and one has to wonder who made up the parade.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">L: Ya.</span> <span id="s395">And not only the one who were marching but like a parade on Fifth Avenue, they are standing 10,20,30 people deep to view that parade- where did they come from?</span> <span id="s396">At that time in 1963 when we went back- not all of them were dead.</span> <span id="s397">There were still those people who stood there at that time who knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: How do you feel about the Wiedergutmachung?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">L: We didn’t take a penny from them.</span> <span id="s400">We said both of us in accord that nobody can pay us for the death of our mother.</span> <span id="s401">We got a few marks- the stuff everybody got but to make a case out of it- we both said no.</span> <span id="s402">We wouldn’t lower ourselves to that.</span> <span id="s403">We don’t get a pension, we get our social security- naturally we paid for it so why shouldn’t we get it.</span> <span id="s404">We worked both of us for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: You mean German social security?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">L: Yes.</span> <span id="s407">That is not Wiedergutmachung- that is what is due to us.</span> <span id="s408">But other money- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: That is taking blood money because they want to try and pay for us for our mother first of all and for our family and the Jews who were murdered.</span> <span id="s410">And it is blood money to me and I wouldn’t touch it- I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s411">I mean there are lots of people who say so what, take every penny you can get.</span> <span id="s412">But that’s not in us- that’s something so highly personal.</span> <span id="s413">Of course, we had our discussions within the family who said crazy, take any penny you can get but we said both together-not at all, we wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s414">I don’t know whether there are other people of whom it’s being said you’re stupid as we were told but to us it’s not stupidity.</span> <span id="s415">To us it’s something sacred for which you cannot get paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: It’s principle.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: If we would have starved, we would not have taken any money.</span> <span id="s418">For what, for furniture or things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: When you look back, what do you think was the most difficult adjustment in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: In this country, there was no adjustment because we spoke the language perfectly and adjustment could only have been made when you come out of Germany and go as domestic to England as we did where you had to swallow your pride quite a bit to do work which you at home had people who did it for you- to do it, it would take books to describe what pride I personally had to swallow.</span> <span id="s421">I don’t want to go into that but there were the adjustments to be made, they weren’t to be made in Canada or here because</span></p> <p><span id="s422">L: You had the freedom of choice of work and worship and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: When you talk about this adjustment in England, I would think that must be very difficult for girls who were educated and had jobs in offices.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">L: It was pretty difficult.</span> <span id="s425">The first job I didn’t get along with because they expected you to be perfect at everything right away- they knew you didn’t speak the language perfect.</span> <span id="s426">That was a veternarian and you had to answer the telephone and take the calls from people around- what can I who was just in the country three weeks understand on the telephone, what they are talking about to me- about sickness of animals.</span> <span id="s427">I could hardly make myself understood for the day to day living.</span> <span id="s428">But then I got a job with a very,very nice elderly lady and she took so much pain not only to teach me the language properly but to teach me everything I know about English literature, about English cooking, about English-about everything English.</span> <span id="s429">She was very, very upper class so to speak and in her own right, she wrote poems and she even had them published but she really took pleasure in teaching me to make me- I can honestly say not the person I am now but to give me a foundation in English living and thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: In your jobs in this country, did you find that there were any holdovers from your German training?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No, only accuracy (laughter), and of course, being a company that large as I had te good luck to be, my job was pretty secure and also I could do it without any difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Were you able to take this job in Canada and here as a result of the training you had in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Well, I did the same job-When I had my interview with the company in Canada, the man said what did you do when you were in Germany.</span> <span id="s434">So I told him my experience in Germany and also my experience in the Army and he said you’re hired because he said that’s exactly what I want you to do here.</span> <span id="s435">Naturally, in the 28 years I was with the company, my job had changed.</span> <span id="s436">I sort of went up the rung of the ladder but in essence it was the same- what I was trained in Germany to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: I neglected to ask you before, exactly what kind of training did you have in Germany?</span> <span id="s438">Were you apprentices?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I went to a business school for six months so I was not an apprentice.</span> <span id="s440">I immediately got a job with a terrific low pay but at that time, you were glad- 1925- that you got a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: And you L were an apprentice?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">L: I was an apprentice in Germany, yes but when I came to England, we worked in a household and as I said I had good training from that lady and in the Army I was a cook and when I arrived here, I went to Schrafft’s and got interviewed and I didn’t go home the same day until 9 o’clock at night because they didn’t let me go- I started work right away because they were looking fo people with that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: In your life today, are most of your friends American or German-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: German- Jews, what else</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Why do you think this is so?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: I think there is a drawing point- perhaps also because we are a little older that you try to go back to your roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Do you think it is also a consequence of living in Washington Heights?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">L: Of course, we didn’t have that many friends- we were both working and Saturday and Sunday, you had to clean the house, go shopping so me, being out of the house everyday at 5 o’clock, the only time I could go somewhere was Saturday night so we didn’t have a tremendous social life but when I retired in 1975, I started to work actively in the Tabernacle and since that time I haven’t stopped.</span> <span id="s450">I don’t think there is a day where we don’t either work for the Temple pr do something for the Temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: How do you feel about Jewish successes in American politics like Koch and Kissinger?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">L: Why not, why not because they earned their way.</span> <span id="s453">I don’t wish it on them because being an outsider or not knowing much about it, you feel that everything they do or not do goes back- well, It’s a Jews, what can you expect</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Do you think that’s a carryover?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">L: It’s a carryover from my German experience, maybe.</span> <span id="s456">Jews born here who didn’t have this experience, they may think entirely different.</span> <span id="s457">They say it’s only natural but it kind of comes back to you every time.</span> <span id="s458">I don’t wish it on him, even Beame, why an elderly man like that.</span> <span id="s459">God forbid, he does something wrong, it goes back right away- it’s a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: That’s exactly my sentiments.</span> <span id="s461">I only hope they’ll succeed because God forbid something goes wrong in one way or the other, you might not agree with their politics but immediately there is that- oh, it’s a Jew and I am sure, I am positive that that stems from the Hitler time when that was stamped on us in indelible pencil.</span> <span id="s462">It can never be rubbed off.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">L: It’s only a pity that they don’t teach that lesson.</span> <span id="s464">All right, it’s a pity they don’t teach that lesson but nobody can teach experience.</span> <span id="s465">The next generation should know what their parents went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Not only their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Something remembered at end of interview</span></p> <p><span id="s468">L: I went once to a flower (blumenhalle) to fetch some flowers for I don’t know what it was, and while I was just passing the Lindenstrasse Synagogue which of course was boarded up, sirens went and everybody had to go into a house and there were big signs up “No Jews Allowed”.</span> <span id="s469">What should I do.</span> <span id="s470">Should I stay out- I couldn’t stay out because everybody had to be off the street- everybody had to be off the street- everybody had to be underground.</span> <span id="s471">No Jews allowed big signs up in the hall.</span> <span id="s472">Jew Unerwuenscht, Todt ze den Juden.</span> <span id="s473">I had to go in- I can’t describe my feeling.</span> <span id="s474">I had to stay there but it makes you feel not only as an outsider but as a bug which has to be destroyed, which has no right to live.</span> <span id="s475">I stood there and thank goodness the sirens went off after about ten minutes or so but those ten minutes were hell.</span> <span id="s476">Everybody was talking with everybody else.</span> <span id="s477">I just stood there.</span> <span id="s478">I don’t know if they thought I was deaf or dumb or something but I just stood there.</span> <span id="s479">You couldn’t look at that wall, you couldn’t look at that wall because they all said the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: That reminds me of something else- almost the same experience as my sister had.</span> <span id="s481">While I was still employed with that now Aryan company, there was also- the sirens went off- they had these tests and you had to go to a shelter and of course, the Nazi leiter said I wasn’t allowed to go into the shelter, I was the only Jew left in that company.</span> <span id="s482">Then another one said well, we have to take her own with us.</span> <span id="s483">So I sat there just like a statue and again, as my sister, said, nobody talked to me.</span> <span id="s484">I was sitting there by myself.</span> <span id="s485">I had forgotten about this until my sister brought this up.</span> <span id="s486">I had forgotten about this until my sister brought this up.</span> <span id="s487">And to hear the roar of the airplanes overhead, that must have been in the early part of 1938, but to sit there like a statue and think should there be an accident and should that airplane drop over this house, I don’t care about me but that one plane is only a small cog in a wheel- it’s like a hydra with so many heads- one is being dead and there is always another.</span> <span id="s488">That is exactly the same experience my sister had.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: This was practice?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s491">German practice.</span> <span id="s492">And the gauleiter in there said now don’t be afraid, absolutely nothing can happen.</span> <span id="s493">Even if there is a war, then nobody can penetrate the protection Germany had-especially Berlin.</span> <span id="s494">Don’t worry, the air protection of Berlin is so good that nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s495">And of course, my thoughts at that time were pretty bad with me sitting there and I had to think about these words at my last trip back in Berlin in 1946 and I saw all these destroyed buildings.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Callman, Ann August 10, 1978 (small second interview) When you came to England, you mentioned that you had come on a permit as a domestic.</span> <span id="s497">What was your first job?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A. Well, I came into a house with four grown up people and to do the-- I had to clean the complete house, it was expected to do all the cooking, all the washing and that was rather difficult because I had never done anything like that, being used to an office job and coming from home where I did some cooking of course, German style, but not the English style which they expected me to do.</span> <span id="s499">The thoughts which crept into my mind, the adjustment which I had to do can’t even be described in words because it was the feeling you had—perhaps it should be expected to say “thank you for letting me come to England to be alive.”</span> <span id="s500">That is one thought but then also, I had my mother and my sister still in Germany and that was also on my mind knowing that the war was imminent to break out—and also when you did the laundry in the cold garage and in the winter time, you had to hang out the wash in the garden and do the blankets which we didn’t have to do in Germany and then a couple of things which are outstanding in my mind—I was expected to sleep with the lady of the house in the same room, which I refused.</span> <span id="s501">and then I had my own room: small but it was mine.</span> <span id="s502">And one thing more was, that I call him an old man, but he was kind of handicapped and they expected me to give him a bath, which I, of course, also refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Was it easy to refuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A. No, it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s505">I just pretended I don’t understand so much English, that I refused him, not in so many words, but I made myself understood that it was no and they understood it.</span> <span id="s506">They had to keep me for a year because they were kind of obliged to keep me.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q.</span> <span id="s508">That was what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A.</span> <span id="s510">They had to keep me for a year because we had to report to the police ever so often, especially after September 3rd, and finally it became so that, just before the year was out, before Christmas, I got a job offered also as a domestic near where my sister worked and that job was even worse.</span> <span id="s511">That was a house I would say, it was a large villa with 20 rooms which I was expected to keep clean.</span> <span id="s512">The lady of the house went with white gloves about the fireplace to see that I had dusted that morning and there were two children which I had to keep: a baby and a boy.</span> <span id="s513">Of course, the cooking had to be done and everything and I, from about two months, I lost about 50 pounds in weight because I was on the go from 6 a.m. until 12 at night because I had no where else to go.</span> <span id="s514">Finally, I had to let go because my health didn’t hold up so the lady where my sister was then working took me kindly in and found a job for me which was more suitable as a domestic.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">What would happen if you didn’t have a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A. I suppose you could have applied to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s517">I happened to be in Yorkshire.</span> <span id="s518">In Leeds they would have taken care of you and found a job for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q.</span> <span id="s520">It must have been terribly difficult coming from an office job to essentially a job as a maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A.</span> <span id="s522">In retrospect, thinking about it now, there was one thing uppermost in my mind.</span> <span id="s523">You don’t care what you do so long as you have a chance to try to bring out your sister and your mother and being I would say a more sensible person, I had to swallow my pride in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q.</span> <span id="s525">You mentioned learning how to cook English-style.</span> <span id="s526">Did anyone try to help you, the other employees?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A. Oh, there were no other employees in the house.</span> <span id="s528">I was the only one and I remember leeks, the green vegetable, well, I have never known to put the meat in the oven with it.</span> <span id="s529">That I didn’t mind, cook potatoes and vegetables in water.</span> <span id="s530">What she told me, I did it.</span> <span id="s531">But when she told me we are having company tonight, cook leeks and I had never seen that thing.</span> <span id="s532">And when she came home she said, “Where are the leeks?”</span> <span id="s533">I said I don’t know what you are talking about.</span> <span id="s534">So she said, “Well, haven’t you cleaned them?”</span> <span id="s535">I didn’t know there was sand inside or anything.</span> <span id="s536">So once she showed, then it was alright but without being shown, then you can’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q. Were they kind to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A.</span> <span id="s539">In their fashion I think so.</span> <span id="s540">They thought that they were doing something for the Jews; they themselves were Jews, and helping the German Jews—that was on their mind—showing me off as a refugee.</span> <span id="s541">I don’t think it was kindness.</span> <span id="s542">It was more like here; I’m doing something for the poor refugee from Germany.</span> <span id="s543">That, God forbid, had the war gone in a different direction, they might have been in the same shoes we were, that didn’t even occur to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q.</span> <span id="s545">That must have been quite difficult to cope with—that attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A. I can only say one thing: when they weren’t in that house and I had to do the housework, I would say that most nights that is true but also during the day time, I was continuously in tears.</span> <span id="s547">And of course, when they came home and then they said, “What, have you been crying again?”</span> <span id="s548">I had to kind of wash my eyes and contain myself, steel myself that is a better word, not to let them see how you feel inside because they felt: look what we’ve done for her, she should be eternally grateful.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q.</span> <span id="s550">A lot must have to do with homesickness.</span> <span id="s551">It was a totally different environment.</span> <span id="s552">You came from Berlin and you were now in a small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A. I had never been away from home.</span> <span id="s554">I had never been separated from my sister; I had never been separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s555">It was—I had no other thoughts in mind but homesickness.</span> <span id="s556">And then, of course, you couldn’t show it to them.</span> <span id="s557">And I said to myself quite often, don’t be so silly; if you aren’t here…you have to do the things for my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s558">That sometimes steeled me for the setbacks which I had.</span> <span id="s559">But when Lilo came over, I came in January and she came in August 1939, she didn’t recognize me; I had lost so much weight.</span> <span id="s560">I mean good for me, I’m not complaining, I was overweight anyhow but I lost so much weight that she hardly recognized me.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q.</span> <span id="s562">Did your feelings change when Lilo came?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A. Well at least I had somebody from home and she was new so it was still up to me to try to get my mother out.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q.</span> <span id="s565">There must have been a lot of other girls, English girls not necessarily in the same position, but did they befriend you?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A. Funny you should ask that.</span> <span id="s567">It was such a small place—there was absolutely nobody.</span> <span id="s568">I had nobody to talk to with the exception of the policeman who asked me into his house—didn’t give me anything to eat or anything like that but that wasn’t necessary but just to talk to somebody other than being told aren’t you this, aren’t you that, why haven’t you done this and why haven’t you done that?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q.</span> <span id="s570">So the relationship within the house was strictly an employer-employee…</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A. No doubt about that.</span> <span id="s572">And also that you should be grateful that you are getting paid 50 shillings a week, which I dutifully saved.</span> <span id="s573">I had half a day free a week and that half a day consisted—I was allowed to leave the house by 12 or 1 o’clock but I had to be back by 6 o’clock to cook the supper.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q.</span> <span id="s575">What did you do with your time off?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A. Well, I went to—there was nothing else to do but go to the pictures and I went invariably every week to see another film and I had—there was a place where I went for tea and I had a cup of tea and something to eat because the food which they left me—the lady said you can have baked beans for lunch.</span> <span id="s577">I never had baked beans in my life.</span> <span id="s578">I mean our idea was a sandwich or something like this and the things she offered me to eat for lunch were so—the baked beans stand out in my mind.</span> <span id="s579">I can’t remember what else she left for me but it was so distasteful to me that I often went out and bought some sausage or some cheese that I could have something to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q.</span> <span id="s581">Did you eat other meals with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A. Oh certainly not.</span> <span id="s583">I mean the maid is supposed to eat in the kitchen, strictly in the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q. And since there was no other help, you ate by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A. Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q. And when you went to the movies or this little restaurant?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A. All by myself.</span> <span id="s588">Never anybody.</span> <span id="s589">There was nobody there, only the policeman.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q. Everybody needs somebody just to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A. Yes, but there was nobody.</span> <span id="s592">There was one good thing for me because in the eight months that I was strictly by myself I had no opportunity to speak one word of German.</span> <span id="s593">I spoke English all the time or I had to speak English so that in about 10 months, I was almost fluent.</span> <span id="s594">I spoke some English before and I had private lessons in Germany but I spoke fluent English because of this—even my sister was surprised when she came over.</span></p></body></html>
