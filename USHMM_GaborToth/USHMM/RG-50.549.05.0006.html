Let’s begin then with, would you tell me something about your, well first of all, let’s begin with where you were born and your date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born in Paris, France, May 29, 1932.</span> <span id="s13">I did my school in France, my medical school, also.</span> <span id="s14">And I stay until the first World War and when the German came.</span> <span id="s15">And by the time probably I was around nine years old, and the Germans start to come in the school, but first it was the French police who came, just asking every teacher, “Do you have any Jewish boy in the school?”</span> <span id="s16">And she said or he said, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s17">So they ask, “Who is Jewish, raise your hand.”</span> <span id="s18">And I didn’t raise my hand and when I did go back home, I said to my mother and father, well, this is what happened.</span> <span id="s19">And they sent me in a safe place in South of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: How did you know not to raise your hand?</span> <span id="s21">What made you not do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I think it was personal instinct.</span> <span id="s23">I thought, you know, you can ask, “Are you French?</span> <span id="s24">Would you like to stay and live in France?”</span> <span id="s25">But the question “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s26">was a little bit surprising for me.</span> <span id="s27">Why should people ask what kind of religion, mostly we knew it was the police.</span> <span id="s28">So, I didn’t feel comfortable, so I said, I’m going to wait a little bit and speak to my parent and ask them what they think.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Had you been aware at all at that time, that there was any danger to Jews posed by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Oh yes, I, in Paris, they start to prepare a big place, to put a lot of people, belonging to a certain religion, so I knew something was going on, but , you know, at my age, when I was nine or ten years old, it is not, it’s not like a game, but it’s not very serious.</span> <span id="s31">But I knew they’d been taking Jew in other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: What was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: The same name I got now, Paul Pressman, P R E S S M A N.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Do you know anything about the name Pressman?</span> <span id="s35">Is that where your family came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Mine parent are both born in, at the time it was Romania.</span> <span id="s37">It was Romania, became Russian, then became Romania.</span> <span id="s38">And all of my family, I don’t know any of them, but come from Romania.</span> <span id="s39">The name of the town is Kishinev, Bessarabia.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: When did they come to France, to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: They got married in Romania and they came, I remember my father saying, at the time they arrive in France, my mother was sixteen or seventeen.</span> <span id="s42">And they try first to come in United State, but they didn’t let them in United State, because my mother did have glaucoma.</span> <span id="s43">And they didn’t know what was glaucoma at the time.</span> <span id="s44">They thought it was a very dangerous sickness, so she did go back to England, stay in England a little while and establish in Paris, France.</span> <span id="s45">And this is where I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: What was your, what were your parents’ names?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: My mother is Pauline Kogan, K O J A N and my father was Joseph Pressman.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: I did have three brother.</span> <span id="s50">I’m the youngest one.</span> <span id="s51">The other brother, both of them did work with my father in a drapery factory he did open.</span> <span id="s52">The other one, at the time didn’t work, he was young.</span> <span id="s53">And I was the smallest, the little one.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: What were your, what was your oldest brother and your middle brother’s names?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: The oldest brother, who survived the Holocaust, name is Bernard and the other one, who died in Auschwitz was Maurice.</span> <span id="s56">The other one, the third one is Gaston, and I am Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And Gaston survived as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Yes, because he was sent with me in a safe town, south of France, because at the time France was cut in two parts, north and south.</span> <span id="s59">And the south was with the Italian and it was much easier there.</span> <span id="s60">It didn’t stay long, but by the time the Italian were there, it was much easier than in north, where the Germans were much more rough with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did your mother work?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Before the war, yes, she was working with my father.</span> <span id="s63">She was working a sewing machine in Havre (ph), in the business of my father.</span> <span id="s64">And until the end, she was working with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And she stopped when the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, she stopped when the French police, under the order of the German came to pick up my two brother.</span> <span id="s67">And my two brother did follow the police with no resistance, because they, you know, the police said it is just to make a verification of your paper.</span> <span id="s68">And they didn’t ask anything about my father, but he right away closed the whole thing.</span> <span id="s69">And we had been waiting about the answer, but my two brother never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Can you just tell me something about your childhood, your home?</span> <span id="s71">What stands out in your memory from that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Well, we used to have a nice apartment in Paris, close to the business of my father.</span> <span id="s73">And also about fifteen miles from Paris, we did have a little villa, where we used to go on Saturday and Sunday and stay there.</span> <span id="s74">Life was very simple, happy, didn’t have any major problem.</span> <span id="s75">They used to work during the week.</span> <span id="s76">I used to go to school.</span> <span id="s77">Saturday… Friday night, we load the car, we did go and stay outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s78">And everything was fine and dandy.</span> <span id="s79">So, life was normal, until the whole German story start and then everything change overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Were your parents religious at all?</span> <span id="s81">Your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: My mother was very religious, but my father was not religious at all.</span> <span id="s83">So, he ask me one day, I remember, he said, “Do you want to do your Bar Mitzvah?”</span> <span id="s84">And I said, “No, I don’t want to.”</span> <span id="s85">Okay, no Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s86">And it was the end of the story.</span> <span id="s87">My brothers never did a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s88">He was really not very interested in, not only in the Jewish religion, but on any religion.</span> <span id="s89">This is, I think, the way I am now.</span> <span id="s90">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Was it hard for your mother that you, that you and your brothers weren’t being raised more religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s93">I think it was hard for her and this is why she asked us, the day she’s going to die, she wants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which we did.</span> <span id="s94">At the time, I did have an office in south of France, close to Nice.</span> <span id="s95">And when she died, we made... the rabbi did the whole thing.</span> <span id="s96">We didn’t understand anything about it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did.</span> <span id="s97">But here she is in south of France, in a Jewish place, where she was buried like the Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Do you remember... I assume you, were you going to a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Do you remember when the Germans occupied France?</span> <span id="s101">Do you remember them coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: In France?</span> <span id="s103">They came very, not in force.</span> <span id="s104">They came very, very slowly.</span> <span id="s105">The reason, I think, they got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s106">So, for them to give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem.</span> <span id="s107">And I don’t mean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our apartment, who was from the police.</span> <span id="s108">And I even remember his name.</span> <span id="s109">His name was Mr. Reddler (ph).</span> <span id="s110">And every time something did happen, he came in our door, knock on the door and said, “Be careful.</span> <span id="s111">They’re going to do this, they’re going to do this.”</span> <span id="s112">So, I don’t mean to say all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Did you have any sense, up to that point, of being a Jew?</span> <span id="s114">Had you personally experienced any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: All the time, even when I was a little boy I took the subway in Paris and you can see on the wall, Jew equal concentration camp, Jew go home, things like this.</span> <span id="s116">Yes, you couldn’t do otherwise than to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our own country.</span> <span id="s117">When I say our own country, I’m born in France, so I thought I was a Frenchman, which was a big mistake, because no.</span> <span id="s118">I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s119">It’s a little bit the same problem and I don’t want to start any…</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: It’s the, my feeling… I speak with a lot of black people here and I ask them why do you call yourself, African-American?</span> <span id="s122">I don’t say to people, I am a French-American.</span> <span id="s123">I’m an American, because I asked to become an American.</span> <span id="s124">If I would call myself French-American, it would mean to say, I’m very happy to be French and I’m also happy to be an American.</span> <span id="s125">And I think in life, you have to make a choice, either you are an American or you’re French.</span> <span id="s126">And if it wouldn’t be… I say this the other day to a black guy.</span> <span id="s127">He was very surprised.</span> <span id="s128">And coming from me, I think it was not a big problem.</span> <span id="s129">But I said, “I think you’re very lucky, your grand-grandparent was brought in United State.</span> <span id="s130">At least now you can drive a car.</span> <span id="s131">You can have a nice home, instead of being in Africa where you’d be starving.</span> <span id="s132">You wouldn’t have any clothes to put on your back and anybody can kill you.</span> <span id="s133">And this for me is racism.</span> <span id="s134">Here racism is not this.</span> <span id="s135">They are not racist, so I don’t understand why you call yourself African-American.</span> <span id="s136">You are American from two, three or four generations.</span> <span id="s137">And it’s not because your parents were slave.”</span> <span id="s138">And when you know the story about the slave, it’s not the American who took the black people.</span> <span id="s139">It’s the chief of the village, who give black people to the American.</span> <span id="s140">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What kind of response did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Most of the time they said, “Well it’s a way of things.</span> <span id="s143">You have a different way of speaking.”</span> <span id="s144">And I said, “You know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist.</span> <span id="s145">So, if I tell you this, it’s because coming from another country, I’m surprised the way you deal with your slave story.</span> <span id="s146">You feel sorry for yourself, but you’re so lucky to be in a country where you have freedom and you can live like any other person.</span> <span id="s147">You’re Black?</span> <span id="s148">Sure it’s, you can see a black man, but sometimes you can recognize a Jewish boy and so it’s nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don’t want to fight the country for this.”</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: You don’t think that Jews can be racist, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s151">Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can be very, very racist.</span> <span id="s152">And I saw this on many different occasion.</span> <span id="s153">But it’s not the same kind of racism they have.</span> <span id="s154">It’s a… I don’t know any Jew belonging to the KKK.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: They wouldn’t probably accept them.</span> <span id="s156">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Absolutely, so I don’t think... but it’s, it make a..</span> <span id="s158">.</span> <span id="s159">Man is man, woman is woman, people are people.</span> <span id="s160">And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I think, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist.</span> <span id="s161">It doesn’t make a… but before we have to define: what do they mean by being racist?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: What do you think that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, racism is something, it’s hate with no reason.</span> <span id="s164">You like some people, you like some people living in this country.</span> <span id="s165">You like some people living in another country.</span> <span id="s166">You don’t like people the way they live, this can be racism.</span> <span id="s167">But basically, it’s not racism, it’s something, because you don’t like their way of laughing.</span> <span id="s168">Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American don’t like this and this can be a form of racism.</span> <span id="s169">And like I said before, Jewish people living in America are much more American than they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s170">And because of this, they can be racist.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: I don’t understand that last.</span> <span id="s172">Because they’re Jewish people living in America, they can be racist.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Because they feel very safe in this country.</span> <span id="s174">And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish by tradition, but they belong to a minority.</span> <span id="s175">And if you are in France or in United State or any country in the world, you still are minority.</span> <span id="s176">But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish people forget the background and say, “But I’m an American.”</span> <span id="s177">And I say, “No, first you are Jew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they’re going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not because you’re an American.”</span> <span id="s178">And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being Jewish, just because they feel so comfortable.</span> <span id="s179">They feel, It’s my country.</span> <span id="s180">Yes it is, in one way.</span> <span id="s181">But until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against black, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the bank.</span> <span id="s182">It’s not true, but in his mind it is.</span> <span id="s183">And he killed people and he killed himself.</span> <span id="s184">You saw this on TV two or three days ago.</span> <span id="s185">This is the big problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Let’s go back a little bit to, you were just telling me before about your experience as a child in Paris and the anti-Semitism that you experienced.</span> <span id="s187">Did you have, were all of your friends Jewish at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: At the time I didn’t have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection.</span> <span id="s189">I’m not the kind of man who have a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s190">And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish.</span> <span id="s191">The reason is, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people.</span> <span id="s192">And again, I don’t speak about religion.</span> <span id="s193">I speak about tradition.</span> <span id="s194">Going to a Jewish restaurant once in a while, it’s fun and it remind me memory.</span> <span id="s195">Watching a movie with Jewish song, it’s fun.</span> <span id="s196">I’ve been married twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or word.</span> <span id="s197">Even in New York, when I go to New York, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it’s always funny.</span> <span id="s198">And I always say, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s199">“No, but we use a lot of Jewish word here in New York,” but they are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s200">But it’s funny, I like it, because it’s something… So when I was in France, I didn’t want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the same guy is not going to give me a knife when the time comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: You really felt that at a very early age?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Well, my brother came back from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s205">The only reason I left France to come in the United State, I decided to come here in 1983, is because I didn’t feel comfortable in France.</span> <span id="s206">Because up to this date, you have this anti-Semitism in France.</span> <span id="s207">My brother, who is seventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s208">He said, “No, this is in your mind.”</span> <span id="s209">And he is married with a non-Jew woman.</span> <span id="s210">She is wonderful woman, but I don’t feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s211">I..</span> <span id="s212">.</span> <span id="s213">France is a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s214">I like to go on vacation, but I couldn’t live there anymore, because of all this background.</span> <span id="s215">I’ve never been comfortable in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did your family speak Yiddish at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Do you still speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes, uh huh.</span> <span id="s220">I don’t find a lot of people I can speak Yiddish with, because most of the Jewish people here, don’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s221">But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my daughter doesn’t follow the religion.</span> <span id="s222">But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, “But sometime they are racist between…” And I said, “Yes, I know.”</span> <span id="s223">I think if you put two men with no religion on an island, there’s going to be racism, because man is stupid.</span> <span id="s224">They want to fight.</span> <span id="s225">They want to fight for a reason.</span> <span id="s226">The reason is religion.</span> <span id="s227">And they are going to fight about God, it’s my God, it’s not your God.</span> <span id="s228">God is God.</span> <span id="s229">Your God is my God.</span> <span id="s230">There is only one God.</span> <span id="s231">But we don’t want this, this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Going back to Paris, you were talking a little bit earlier about the time when your two brothers were called in and they were deported.</span> <span id="s233">Do you remember around when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: It was March in 1942, when they did go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s235">Before it was a camp a little bit outside of Paris called Drancy, where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think it was between eight and ten month.</span> <span id="s236">Where they start to shape the whole thing: “Are we going to send them?</span> <span id="s237">What kind of train are we going to use?”</span> <span id="s238">It was another camp not far from there, called Compiègne, which was also the same kind.</span> <span id="s239">So... there is a man, who came here in Lexington, a Jewish man, who gave something… I’ve got something, I will remember his name.</span> <span id="s240">And he explained what the German did have in mind.</span> <span id="s241">And it’s amazing the way they did organize the whole thing.</span> <span id="s242">Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a train, they didn’t know nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go.</span> <span id="s243">Everything was real on paper.</span> <span id="s244">The train company didn’t know what they were going to transport, because it was special train for animals.</span> <span id="s245">So, it was so well organized, and they prepared all this and from each country it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s246">From Poland it was another way.</span> <span id="s247">From Yugoslavia it was another way.</span> <span id="s248">From Austria it was another way.</span> <span id="s249">It was really a technique they did have.</span> <span id="s250">And the top of those guys, I’m afraid to say he was a brain, because he was crazy.</span> <span id="s251">But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing.</span> <span id="s252">And he organized this very well.</span> <span id="s253">And you know, the Jewish people who’ve been in camp, most of them were, what we call here blue-collar, simple people.</span> <span id="s254">They didn’t think we’re going to kill them.</span> <span id="s255">Even until they arrive in the camp, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, “You go this way, you go this way.”</span> <span id="s256">No, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s257">The only time my brother realized he was in a bad direction is when one time, coming down from the train, he didn’t go fast enough.</span> <span id="s258">The SS slapped his face.</span> <span id="s259">And he was nineteen years old.</span> <span id="s260">Then he realized something is going to happen, now it’s another world.</span> <span id="s261">But until then, well it was hard, they didn’t have anything to eat in the train.</span> <span id="s262">They didn’t have any water.</span> <span id="s263">They didn’t have any... but it’s going to clear up, no problem.</span> <span id="s264">They didn’t realize they go to the butcher.</span> <span id="s265">They go to die, by thousands.</span> <span id="s266">And this was the life.</span> <span id="s267">They did go, because the only one who realize what’s going on were the educated people, the attorney, the doctor, the people who did study.</span> <span id="s268">But they were not many people.</span> <span id="s269">When my brother was deported in Auschwitz, it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French army.</span> <span id="s270">And he said, “They are going to do nothing to me.</span> <span id="s271">I’m a colonel from the French army.”</span> <span id="s272">He died like all the one, just because he was Jew.</span> <span id="s273">That’s all.</span> <span id="s274">They didn’t care he was a colonel.</span> <span id="s275">He did have a high education.</span> <span id="s276">Doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s277">You are Jew, you must die.</span> <span id="s278">It’s amazing, eh?</span> <span id="s279">But…</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Did you and your family have any contact with your brothers while they were in Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes, we did have the possibility to go around the camp, Private Honor (ph) from Haus (ph) let us in and we could communicate by sign.</span> <span id="s282">So we can see they are alive, because in Drancy they didn’t kill anybody.</span> <span id="s283">They been starving.</span> <span id="s284">They even allowed to receive some package of food.</span> <span id="s285">But like I said, it was not a long time, but communicate mouth to mouth?</span> <span id="s286">No, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s287">No German in Drancy just the French military and the police.</span> <span id="s288">No SS, no German, the whole camp was under the surveillance of the French police.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Were your parents surprised about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: It’s very hard for me to remember.</span> <span id="s291">It’s very hard, because like I said, I was eight, nine year.</span> <span id="s292">No, I have a hard time to remember the reaction of my father, the reaction of my mother.</span> <span id="s293">No, I don’t have any recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Do remember any talk about the political situation at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Well, you have to remember, my parent were not very high educated people.</span> <span id="s296">My mother did barely write.</span> <span id="s297">She spoke mostly the language, but she didn’t speak the... but it was, it was something.</span> <span id="s298">You have to remember my parent left Russia because of the Bolshevism.</span> <span id="s299">My parent were three hundred percent for the idea of communism.</span> <span id="s300">So, they were with one track mind.</span> <span id="s301">So politically, even if I could remember, I don’t think it would be accurate, because they were too much in one way.</span> <span id="s302">I couldn’t have any discussion.</span> <span id="s303">Even my brother, who is alive now, I can, some conversation about politic I cannot have with him, because he is still in one track.</span> <span id="s304">Very hard to discuss about politic.</span> <span id="s305">And again, like I said before, France is his country.</span> <span id="s306">It’s the best place, why should I go in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Doctor Paul Pressman.</span> <span id="s309">Do you, how, did your parents tell you at all, when they were making plans to escape to the South of France?</span> <span id="s310">Was there any discussion with you about that or did it just happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: No, they, my parent, neither my mother, neither my father, didn’t discuss with the children.</span> <span id="s312">We’d been raised with a lot of authority from my folks.</span> <span id="s313">And they say, “This is an emergency; we have to go.”</span> <span id="s314">So my father is going to go there.</span> <span id="s315">We are going to go there.</span> <span id="s316">And we’ll see how it is going to be.</span> <span id="s317">And we’ll decide day by day, because it was no other way.</span> <span id="s318">We have to leave everything.</span> <span id="s319">Everything we got lost.</span> <span id="s320">We left with too little luggage and that’s it, because we knew we never going to see anything we left.</span> <span id="s321">Because it was the end.</span> <span id="s322">We try to save our life, that’s all.</span> <span id="s323">So another time for me and like my two other brother were in Drancy, so it was only another brother and me, so it was a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s324">So, my father left with my other brother, Gaston, and I stay with my mother.</span> <span id="s325">And at the time it was, Paris became very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s326">No place to hide, so my mother send me through the Zone.</span> <span id="s327">It was a line between the North and South and you have to pass the Zone.</span> <span id="s328">And some French people for money, they direct you between the army.</span> <span id="s329">And I did go in South in Grenoble.</span> <span id="s330">And when I arrive in Grenoble, a friend of my mother took me and three days later she came down.</span> <span id="s331">And we stay... and I don’t remember how long, maybe couple months, three months.</span> <span id="s332">And it became very dangerous to stay there.</span> <span id="s333">So, she send me to my father.</span> <span id="s334">And where my father was, was more dangerous than there, so they decide... I came back to see my mother and my mother, remember I was nine years old.</span> <span id="s335">So, they decide to send me to Switzerland with a group of Jewish people, boys.</span> <span id="s336">And I think I was the oldest one from all the boys.</span> <span id="s337">We were about fourteen, fifteen.</span> <span id="s338">So, we did go in one little town, just to the frontier, slept there until midnight, one o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s339">Then two men took us, make us walk and we arrive on the border.</span> <span id="s340">The Swiss took us and put us in a refugee camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Did you leave to go to the South of France immediately, was that before your brothers had been deported for Auschwitz from Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No after, right after, because it was very, they realized now that’s it.</span> <span id="s343">If we don’t do something, they are going to take us and we’re going to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s344">So, probably my parents said, let’s save there two boys and we’ll see.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did you know anything about Auschwitz at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No.</span> <span id="s347">No.</span> <span id="s348">No, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s349">No, I don’t think I knew something.</span> <span id="s350">We knew about Drancy because I did go to Drancy with my mother just to see from far away my brother.</span> <span id="s351">But we didn’t know anything about the camp where they burn cadaver, where they put them in a chamber and put gas.</span> <span id="s352">We didn’t know all this.</span> <span id="s353">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Do you remember from that time any restrictions starting to be imposed on you as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Oh, the first restriction was to carry the yellow badge.</span> <span id="s356">We did have a yellow star, the Jewish star, with inside “Jew” and you have to carry this in anything you wear.</span> <span id="s357">So, you did have two way, either you don’t carry this thing and if they catch you, they kill you right there, or if you have one, everybody can see you.</span> <span id="s358">And this was only in the north of France, in Paris.</span> <span id="s359">So this is why my mother decided to let us go down in south, because it was, I remember when they start to give us this yellow badge to carry.</span> <span id="s360">In the street I used to live, it was a man, who was very old, maybe eighty-five, ninety and he was blind, Jewish.</span> <span id="s361">And he carried this yellow thing and I thought to myself, this is terrible, because if you can treat a human being, because of religion, it’s really the end.</span> <span id="s362">And this is, I think where my mother decided to send me, because, you know, it’s so easy.</span> <span id="s363">It’s very hard to explain how does it look.</span> <span id="s364">How do you realize a park, like here, Rupp Arena, downtown, with all the door closed, only one open and you push all the Jew inside.</span> <span id="s365">And it was, I don’t know, maybe five hundred thousand, six hundred thousand.</span> <span id="s366">I don’t know... all there.</span> <span id="s367">And from there, they start to spread group.</span> <span id="s368">And this was the beginning of the end.</span> <span id="s369">So, it was time to do something, leave, hide and this is where I think they organized this, my mother and my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did they have any connections with any resistance organizations at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I found out my mother was a captain from the French army.</span> <span id="s372">Since when, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s373">When I was in Grenoble, this is where I realized what she was doing, because I never saw my mother with a gun.</span> <span id="s374">And one day, she did have a big book, she always carry with her.</span> <span id="s375">And I said, why do you carry this book?</span> <span id="s376">And she said, well, I will show you, but you forget about what you are going to see.</span> <span id="s377">She opened the book and it was cut and it was a gun inside.</span> <span id="s378">Because she used to bring food to Resistance who had been caught and put into the hospital.</span> <span id="s379">And she survived the whole thing, because she die after the war, with… So, yes she belonged to a group, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Was it, when you say French army, what exactly do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: The French regular army.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: But the French army...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Was illegal, because the real army were at the service of the Germans.</span> <span id="s384">All the, I don’t know how I’m going to tell you…</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: It was under de Gaulle?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s387">Force Française de l’Interieur (ph).</span> <span id="s388">So, it was civilian.</span> <span id="s389">They didn’t have any uniform, but they been working to liberate France under the order of Charles de Gaulle, who was in England.</span> <span id="s390">So, they been listening to the radio at night for special message.</span> <span id="s391">But all this for me was, I didn’t understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: When did you find out that she was a captain with the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I think I was, just before I left for Switzerland, which was about... when I left for Switzerland, I think it was in ‘44, around 1944, what month, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s394">But it was in 1944.</span> <span id="s395">This is where she went... and I, we were a little bit surprised, because when we… when they took us to the frontier at Switzerland, two military from Swiss did have the gun and say, “Approach the door.”</span> <span id="s396">And I don’t know if you know it, but the Swiss soldier are dressed exactly like the German soldier.</span> <span id="s397">Green with the same helmet.</span> <span id="s398">And I thought to myself, “That’s it, they got us.”</span> <span id="s399">The only difference, they got button who say Switzerland.</span> <span id="s400">And with the light, I saw the button and I said, “Uh huh, maybe we got a chance,” but otherwise they look exactly like the German.</span> <span id="s401">And they put us in the camp.</span> <span id="s402">A lot of people… they did have to put us in a camp.</span> <span id="s403">For one reason is because, a lot of people left France to go to Switzerland, but the Swiss didn’t know who they was.</span> <span id="s404">So, before, they did the same thing, they put them in a camp and ask questions.</span> <span id="s405">Interrogate them.</span> <span id="s406">And from there, they put me in another camp of children.</span> <span id="s407">And from there, you did have a lot of family from Switzerland who said, “I can take one or two boy in my home.</span> <span id="s408">I have the room.”</span> <span id="s409">And this is how I did go to this priest, who was, not Catholic, he was…</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Protestant.</span> <span id="s412">And I stay with him until the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Before we go to that, tell me how you got from Paris to Grenoble.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: By myself.</span> <span id="s415">My mother put me on the train and she told me a lot of thing.</span> <span id="s416">“Don’t say this, don’t say this, don’t speak to nobody.</span> <span id="s417">Don’t do this.”</span> <span id="s418">She give me a couple sandwich.</span> <span id="s419">It took about maybe five, six hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Do you remember specifically what she told you to do and do not do?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s422">“If anybody ask you if you Jewish, you say no.</span> <span id="s423">Where do you go?</span> <span id="s424">You go to see your uncle, to stay with him.</span> <span id="s425">What his name?</span> <span id="s426">You don’t know.</span> <span id="s427">Somebody is going to be at the station to pick you up.</span> <span id="s428">If any German soldier come close to you in the train and you see he start to ask paper, stay close to somebody, don’t be by yourself.”</span> <span id="s429">Just basic common things, which I did.</span> <span id="s430">And when I arrive at Grenoble, she also give me a pass name.</span> <span id="s431">And she said, “Don’t go with anybody unless they tell you this.”</span> <span id="s432">And I don’t remember what it was.</span> <span id="s433">A word like summertime or something like this.</span> <span id="s434">And this lady came to me and said “Summertime,” and I said okay.</span> <span id="s435">And I did go with her.</span> <span id="s436">I didn’t have any luggage.</span> <span id="s437">I did have a little package, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s440">If my memory is correct, I was not afraid.</span> <span id="s441">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Was it kind of an adventure?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No.</span> <span id="s444">The funny part is all my life, like I said, I’m not religious, but all my life, I believe since I was a little boy... and I used to speak about this with my mother.</span> <span id="s445">I believe we don’t die.</span> <span id="s446">The body die, but the spirit stay alive.</span> <span id="s447">So, I said, the worst can happen to me, they going to get my body, but my spirit is going to be reborn in another corp.</span> <span id="s448">This helped me a lot by making me feel more secure.</span> <span id="s449">And dying, I never been afraid of dying.</span> <span id="s450">It’s not a problem for me.</span> <span id="s451">I felt what should happen, will happen.</span> <span id="s452">But no, I don’t think I was afraid.</span> <span id="s453">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Did you have any problems on the train at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No.</span> <span id="s456">One time it was, I remember because I was standing.</span> <span id="s457">I didn’t have any seat.</span> <span id="s458">I saw the German beginning the train and going room to room to ask paper.</span> <span id="s459">And I thought to myself, now is the time to find myself a tutor.</span> <span id="s460">So, it was a couple in the train.</span> <span id="s461">And nicely I ask them if... I always been a good diplomat.</span> <span id="s462">I asked if I can sit close to them.</span> <span id="s463">And they felt something, probably.</span> <span id="s464">The German come in, they say, “Who is this boy?”</span> <span id="s465">“He’s with us.”</span> <span id="s466">And it was finished.</span> <span id="s467">And they left.</span> <span id="s468">I remember the whole thing from Paris to Grenoble like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s469">I could recognize the face of the German soldier.</span> <span id="s470">But it was, no it was not a game.</span> <span id="s471">I realized it was very serious, but when everybody dance, you have to dance.</span> <span id="s472">And I thought if I don’t survive, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Who was there to greet you when you got off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: A lady, and I don’t remember this lady, because I didn’t see her long enough.</span> <span id="s475">She took me to a group of people.</span> <span id="s476">I stay with this group in a room.</span> <span id="s477">I stay about a day or two.</span> <span id="s478">We didn’t go out.</span> <span id="s479">And then my mother picked me up and I stay with her one day, and she put me on another train.</span> <span id="s480">To save me, she try something... it was funny, but it was not funny in real.</span> <span id="s481">In Grenoble, she found a way, I don’t know how she did, she found a way to put me in a… Catholic people who are…</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Monks?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Monk.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Monastery?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s486">And I stay there for three days and I couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s487">And I couldn’t stand it.</span> <span id="s488">I left, I mean it was very hard to go out from the monastery.</span> <span id="s489">So, I put myself when… and I saw when they took the garbage can.</span> <span id="s490">And I found an empty one and I did go inside.</span> <span id="s491">And they put me on a truck.</span> <span id="s492">And I left the monastery and I did go see my mother.</span> <span id="s493">When I arrive, and she said, “How did you get out?</span> <span id="s494">Why?</span> <span id="s495">What happened?</span> <span id="s496">You’ve been safe!”</span> <span id="s497">And I said, “I can’t stay there, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s498">And one day or another, they going to come.”</span> <span id="s499">So finally she decided to send me to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: But how long were you in Grenoble before you went to Pau to join your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Very short time, very short time.</span> <span id="s502">We speak about maybe a week, not long.</span> <span id="s503">Every time it was a few days there, a few days there, back and forth, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And when you were in Grenoble was that during the time that the Italians were occupying that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Do you remember, did you have any interaction with Italian forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, Italian are very funny people.</span> <span id="s508">They are very, how can I say, I won’t say romantic, but they are very nice.</span> <span id="s509">Even now, I don’t know why, when I go to Europe, a lot of people, when I go to Europe I go with friends, “Let’s go to Italy.”</span> <span id="s510">I don’t want to go to Italy.</span> <span id="s511">It’s not I don’t like Italian, but they always romance, they are very crying, very... I don’t like Italian.</span> <span id="s512">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Do you think that goes back to that time that you were there in Grenoble?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s515">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s516">I have a hard time to analyze why I don’t like Italian, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s517">Spanish are completely different.</span> <span id="s518">They are more rough.</span> <span id="s519">Italian, when you go in Italy, men walk in the street, holding hand by hand.</span> <span id="s520">They are very different.</span> <span id="s521">And I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s522">I mean I wouldn’t do any harm to Italian, but going to Italy.</span> <span id="s523">The décor is always the same.</span> <span id="s524">You been to Italy?</span> <span id="s525">Did you go to the Piazza San Marco?</span> <span id="s526">And you see the police man with the, they look like... I don’t like this.</span> <span id="s527">[Laughing] So, I avoid to go to Italy.</span> <span id="s528">Three years ago, I did have to give a seminar in Torino, Turin in French.</span> <span id="s529">And I felt myself like twenty years ago, with all those guy, with the big parade, you know, they always…</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: A lot of pomp.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yes, they love this.</span> <span id="s532">And I don’t.</span> <span id="s533">So, I don’t go to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Why was it that your mother sent you to join your father in Pau?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Because she thought it going to be much easier for her.</span> <span id="s536">I didn’t know at the time.</span> <span id="s537">But it’s going to be much easier for her to do what she was doing.</span> <span id="s538">Because I was not easy.</span> <span id="s539">I was not easy.</span> <span id="s540">I didn’t obey very good, when she say you stay in this room and you don’t move.</span> <span id="s541">I didn’t see really the big danger.</span> <span id="s542">You know, Italian people are very nice, I can go in the street and walk, you know.</span> <span id="s543">She say, “No, you stay here.”</span> <span id="s544">So, she said, “I will send you to your father.</span> <span id="s545">He’s going to take care of you.”</span> <span id="s546">But it was very dangerous where he was, so this is why they decide to send me in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Was your father involved in the Resistance also?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s549">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s550">No, he was too hot-blood.</span> <span id="s551">When it was bad where he was in Tarbes, and I don’t know how they found out about him.</span> <span id="s552">The only thing I remember, he was in a big place, sitting on a bench and this police truck came to pick him up.</span> <span id="s553">And it was about ten, twelve police man.</span> <span id="s554">And when from the witnessed friend who was with him, who survived, he was almost naked.</span> <span id="s555">He fight so much, and he was so strong.</span> <span id="s556">And this was the last we knew about him.</span> <span id="s557">Where was he killed?</span> <span id="s558">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s559">Where is his body?</span> <span id="s560">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s561">Where is he buried?</span> <span id="s562">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s563">So, he fight for his life, but… No, he didn’t have the diplomacy of my mother.</span> <span id="s564">She was more soft.</span> <span id="s565">For him, he was raised, he was orphan, so he was raised in Romania, the hard way.</span> <span id="s566">So, even when he came in France, for him, no discussion, he punch, that’s all.</span> <span id="s567">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: How did you find out what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Because his friend, who was at the time with him, saw the whole thing.</span> <span id="s570">And he witnessed.</span> <span id="s571">But he died a long time ago, this guy.</span> <span id="s572">The only thing I remember, I’m... some people are visual.</span> <span id="s573">You can tell me a story about a place you’ve been and I can see where you are.</span> <span id="s574">And if you describe the place, and the border of the sea, with the boats, with the mountain, the sun, the water comes on your leg, I can see the whole thing.</span> <span id="s575">The picture is very clear.</span> <span id="s576">So, as soon as he explained to me what happened, I can see the picture.</span> <span id="s577">I saw… I know where was the place.</span> <span id="s578">So, I can see this whole thing.</span> <span id="s579">And when this is in my memory, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: How did you get from Grenoble to Pau?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I took the train.</span> <span id="s582">My father told me if anything happened, “Go home, here is the place where is the money.</span> <span id="s583">Take the money, buy what you need.”</span> <span id="s584">So, I did go buy a ticket and I did go see my mother again.</span> <span id="s585">And she said, “Now it’s time for you to escape.”</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: So how long were you in Pau before you left again?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Well, you see we moved from Pau to Tarbes, which is very close, maybe fifty miles.</span> <span id="s588">So it was a few days, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s589">I remember the room he rent with the little kitchen.</span> <span id="s590">How long did I stay there?</span> <span id="s591">I have no idea, maybe two weeks, maybe two months, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: And you were traveling the same way that you had traveled from Paris to Grenoble?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: The same, by train.</span> <span id="s594">Train in France is very safe.</span> <span id="s595">It’s always on time and it’s very easy, clean.</span> <span id="s596">And I did have my way to speak to people and trust them and they trust me.</span> <span id="s597">And you know, you’re always ready to, if you today, take the train and see a boy, eight, nine years old and he’s by himself, you are going to tell him, “Can I help you?</span> <span id="s598">Can I do something for you?</span> <span id="s599">What is your life?”</span> <span id="s600">“Well, I left my father and I’m going to meet my mother, but I’m alone on the train.”</span> <span id="s601">“Do you have any money?</span> <span id="s602">Do you want to eat something?”</span> <span id="s603">This is a normal, right?</span> <span id="s604">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s605">And people were very nice and again like I tell you, I got a little bit diplomacy.</span> <span id="s606">And I didn’t have any problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: What was your father doing during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: In Pau and Tarbes?</span> <span id="s609">Nothing.</span> <span id="s610">He couldn’t work.</span> <span id="s611">He was just, probably waiting until the war is going to be finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Was he…</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: It was not before, long before the war finished that he died.</span> <span id="s614">I think it was a question of months, six month or seven month, something like this and the war was finished.</span> <span id="s615">He was not lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Was he living openly as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No.</span> <span id="s618">No, openly as a Jew, you dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: He had false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s621">I know the name, I remember the name of my mother, the false name, Shauvel.</span> <span id="s622">But his name, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s623">He did have a false name, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s624">I remember one time, he did have, he became very ill.</span> <span id="s625">My father never got ill.</span> <span id="s626">He became very ill and when the doctor came, he palpate the stomach, and when he push in one side, he scream so hard, they thought it was appendicitis.</span> <span id="s627">And really it was a kidney stone.</span> <span id="s628">So, he was in the hospital for three, three, four day and he came out and it was all over.</span> <span id="s629">He lost weight, he was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Was your brother there at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s632">And my brother, Gaston, give him a hard time, because at the time he was seventeen, eighteen, something like this.</span> <span id="s633">Very good looking boy and for him, war didn’t mean nothing.</span> <span id="s634">He wants to have a good time.</span> <span id="s635">That was a big problem between my father and him.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: What did you do with your days?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: Start to read as much as I could.</span> <span id="s638">Walking with my father.</span> <span id="s639">He used to... he loved to walk.</span> <span id="s640">So I walked with him.</span> <span id="s641">We did go buy some food.</span> <span id="s642">He was cooking.</span> <span id="s643">We never been to a restaurant.</span> <span id="s644">He was cooking.</span> <span id="s645">He was not such a good cook, but it was okay.</span> <span id="s646">[Laughing] But we stayed together most of the time.</span> <span id="s647">He always got an eye on me.</span> <span id="s648">And we stay together.</span> <span id="s649">But I was young and it’s hard for me to remember a lot of things.</span> <span id="s650">But I have a little picture in my mind of things we did together.</span> <span id="s651">I will show you a picture of the whole family when I was a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Are there any other things that stand out in your memory from that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: No, everything is very clear.</span> <span id="s654">Everything… the only thing which is not clear is the time, how long did I stay there?</span> <span id="s655">How many time did I go back and forth?</span> <span id="s656">But I remember where I was living with my mother.</span> <span id="s657">I remember one time, I told you she did have a gun in the book, and she did go bring some food in the hospital for French Underground soldier, who were wound.</span> <span id="s658">And we came back to the house and we went on subway, but not underground, over ground.</span> <span id="s659">The police, German police stopped the whole thing, make us going down and align everybody.</span> <span id="s660">And I saw my mother with the book under her arm and I said, “Phew, if they open this.”</span> <span id="s661">They ask question, and up in the train again and we left.</span> <span id="s662">And I didn’t say anything to my mother.</span> <span id="s663">She didn’t say anything to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Dr. Paul Pressman.</span> <span id="s666">So you, when you, you were going back and forth a little bit between, between where your father was and where your mother was and that’s not all together... you’re not sure about how many times you went back and forth.</span> <span id="s667">Is that what you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah, no more than twice at the most.</span> <span id="s669">One, sure, but twice at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: What happened... at what point were you... were you separated from your father?</span> <span id="s671">Were you in, was it Tarbes?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Tarbes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Were you in Tarbes with your father when he was killed and then you left?</span> <span id="s674">Or what caused you to leave for the last time?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: No, I was there when he was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s678">I was not with him, but I was there and this is how I knew about the story, because his friend told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: And this is when I did go back and see my mother, who tried to find out, but we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s681">I mean she couldn’t find out anything about it, because relation between... the situation didn’t... it was not easy.</span> <span id="s682">She couldn’t call anybody.</span> <span id="s683">She couldn’t call the authorities without revealing herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Were you with, was your brother still with you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Yeah, he didn’t live with us.</span> <span id="s686">He live with, in another place.</span> <span id="s687">I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s688">Where was he?</span> <span id="s689">What was he doing?</span> <span id="s690">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s691">I don’t know what, where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: So, when you returned to Grenoble and prepared to go to Switzerland, your brother was not with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s694">He never been, at this time he never been with me.</span> <span id="s695">The only time I saw him again, is when the war finished, I was with Mr. Lederman in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s696">And I said, “Now it’s time for me to go home.”</span> <span id="s697">And he say, “Patience,” you know, “let’s wait a little bit.”</span> <span id="s698">And I said, “No, I know where we’re going to find... I know where I’m going to find my mother.”</span> <span id="s699">And he said, “You don’t want to wait a little bit?”</span> <span id="s700">Because it was a lot of thing going on.</span> <span id="s701">And I said, “No, no, I would like to go now.”</span> <span id="s702">So, he was a little bit reluctant to let me go, but he let me go.</span> <span id="s703">And I did go to Grenoble, from Switzerland to Grenoble where my mother used to live.</span> <span id="s704">And I didn’t find her.</span> <span id="s705">So, I did go to, there was a Jewish association in Grenoble, so I did go there.</span> <span id="s706">And they said they knew about my mother.</span> <span id="s707">They said, “No, she did go back to Paris and her sister apartment, because her apartment was with people, with your brother, Gaston.”</span> <span id="s708">I said, “How can I go?”</span> <span id="s709">And they asked me, “Do you have money?</span> <span id="s710">We’ll buy you a ticket.”</span> <span id="s711">They bought me a ticket, train again.</span> <span id="s712">And I did go to Paris.</span> <span id="s713">And when I did go to the train in Grenoble, I met a young soldier, French soldier and I did the whole travel with him.</span> <span id="s714">He took care of me.</span> <span id="s715">And before we left, this lady from the Jewish association sent a wire to my mother and when I arrive in the train station in Paris, my mother and Gaston were there waiting for me.</span> <span id="s716">And we did go see, we did go to the apartment of her sister, who die in Auschwitz and it was nobody in the apartment.</span> <span id="s717">It was a very small apartment and oh, maybe... time for me is very hard... maybe two months later or three months later, the Jewish people from the camp, from Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, all those places, start to come back in Paris.</span> <span id="s718">And it was a big hotel, called Hotel Lutecia (ph) prepare for clean them, to ask paper, if they got anything, you know.</span> <span id="s719">And Hotel Lutecia call us and say we have one Pressman.</span> <span id="s720">So, we did go there right away and it was Bernard.</span> <span id="s721">But we couldn’t see him.</span> <span id="s722">We didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s723">So, we wait, go, ask, couldn’t find him.</span> <span id="s724">The next day... so, we did go home at this apartment and the next day we receive a man, who said, “Your son did go to the old apartment,” who was let’s say like, five blocks from where we were.</span> <span id="s725">So, we did go by foot, walking and here, is coming, my brother.</span> <span id="s726">This is where we find out my other brother was dead.</span> <span id="s727">He was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s728">And Bernard was alive.</span> <span id="s729">Then we did go to the apartment of my aunt, sister of my mother, and life started to re-organize.</span> <span id="s730">We want to recuperate the fabric of my father.</span> <span id="s731">Everything was gone, but at least the wall was there and my brother decided to—because he was trained by my father—to open the place.</span> <span id="s732">And with my mother, they start to re-open the place and I started to go to college, to school, to school first.</span> <span id="s733">And after I decided to go to college.</span> <span id="s734">And it was a little fight, family fight, because they want me to be an upholsterer like my father and I said no, I want to study medicine.</span> <span id="s735">Everybody said, “But we cannot help you,” and I said, “I don’t ask for help.</span> <span id="s736">I will work myself.”</span> <span id="s737">I found a little room and I was working, doing a lot of things and studying medicine.</span> <span id="s738">After this, I became the doctor of the family.</span> <span id="s739">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Let’s go back because I want to hear about your time in Switzerland and I want to hear, can you tell me a little bit more in detail about your journey to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s742">Yeah, it was a very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s743">I think I wouldn’t study all the study I did, if I didn’t go with Pastor Lederman and his wife.</span> <span id="s744">Because I speak always about him.</span> <span id="s745">His name was Charles, but his wife was something great.</span> <span id="s746">I mean, she was a teacher in school for children, but she was a very, very strong person.</span> <span id="s747">And when they accept me, I receive a tag around my neck.</span> <span id="s748">They put me again in another train from Geneva to, it’s a little town where they used to live, Rances.</span> <span id="s749">Very small town.</span> <span id="s750">He was the pastor of the town.</span> <span id="s751">And they came and picked me up.</span> <span id="s752">I didn’t know where I was.</span> <span id="s753">Mine parrain, my godfather was very, very cheerful, very big open mind, very smart man.</span> <span id="s754">They were a very nice couple, but they never could have any children.</span> <span id="s755">So, mine godfather was priest, so he said, “You going to go to the synagogue.”</span> <span id="s756">And I said, “I never been to a synagogue and I don’t want to go to a synagogue.”</span> <span id="s757">He said, “I’m sorry, you’re Jewish, you’re going to go to the synagogue.”</span> <span id="s758">So, every week I did have to go and it was far away, because there was no synagogue where he was.</span> <span id="s759">So, I did have to take the bus and I didn’t like it all.</span> <span id="s760">But he said, “No, you have a wonderful religion, you have to keep with it.</span> <span id="s761">Okay.</span> <span id="s762">And I don’t want for you, unless you feel, but you don’t have no obligation to come in my church.</span> <span id="s763">If you want to come, no problem, but I don’t want you...” And I said, “Can I ring the bell?”</span> <span id="s764">And he said, “If you want to, Sunday morning you can ring the bell.”</span> <span id="s765">So, I ring the bell and he introduce me in a Sunday, when I was at his place.</span> <span id="s766">The second Sunday he introduce me to all the congregation.</span> <span id="s767">Swiss people are very, very nice people.</span> <span id="s768">And they treat me like the son of the house.</span> <span id="s769">They give me a room.</span> <span id="s770">I remember they did have a German Shepherd, who was trained.</span> <span id="s771">He was in the same time—I don’t know how you call this—a priest who take care of prison people.</span> <span id="s772">And he used to go with his dog, in case one of the prisoner did go away, the dog is going to be able... He was a very, very funny man, very smart, very funny man.</span> <span id="s773">And I help as much as I could.</span> <span id="s774">I carry the milk, because they did have a lot of cow.</span> <span id="s775">So, I work outside of the school for three, four hour every day, carrying the milk from the cow to the company where they make the cheese.</span> <span id="s776">And it was really, a family.</span> <span id="s777">They want me to learn how to play piano.</span> <span id="s778">They did have a piano.</span> <span id="s779">And since I have my own piano and I play because of them.</span> <span id="s780">He always, he make me feel something I never felt before: the importance of knowledge.</span> <span id="s781">And this is when I start to read, this is when I start to write.</span> <span id="s782">I spend with them less than one year, but I think the foundation of my life was based on this time I spend with them, because they were so good and so hard.</span> <span id="s783">They were not... they were sweet, but they let me pass nothing.</span> <span id="s784">I did have my job to do and I better do it, otherwise… And it became normal with me and really I spend... I learn how to love nature.</span> <span id="s785">Nature in Paris, you don’t know how to differentiate champignon…you know what…?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Mushrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Mushrooms.</span> <span id="s788">He took me to the woods, days, to say this one is not good, this one is good.</span> <span id="s789">Took the good one, brought it home, cook them, make a meal with it.</span> <span id="s790">I didn’t know all this.</span> <span id="s791">I didn’t have no idea.</span> <span id="s792">And it was very good for me, because it was a foundation of life.</span> <span id="s793">And every time up to this day, I think all the time about what they did to me as a kid.</span> <span id="s794">And I became a man because of them.</span> <span id="s795">And this is why, all the time, even like I said, I did go see them last, between ‘98 and ‘99, Christmas.</span> <span id="s796">And I couldn’t find them, they moved.</span> <span id="s797">I called everywhere.</span> <span id="s798">But otherwise, every time I go to Europe, I go see them.</span> <span id="s799">We spend beautiful time, quality time, even if we don’t speak together, he is the same.</span> <span id="s800">And she is the same.</span> <span id="s801">In my mind, she is the most beautiful woman I met in my life.</span> <span id="s802">She, the last time I saw her I think she was seventy-two and I think she was as beautiful as she was when I was a little boy.</span> <span id="s803">And he is the stronger man.</span> <span id="s804">It was really something.</span> <span id="s805">For me, it was a big chance to meet those people.</span> <span id="s806">And like I said, when I did go back and I found my mother.</span> <span id="s807">I said, “The first thing we can do, as soon as we get a little bit money, I want for you to meet.”</span> <span id="s808">And I think it was one year later, I bought a used car and I took my mother and we did go see them.</span> <span id="s809">And they were very happy and I was very happy to see them again.</span> <span id="s810">And like I said, I always, any chance that I did have to go, I did go see them, because I felt this... we were not family, but it was more than family.</span> <span id="s811">It was a good, a good thing.</span> <span id="s812">It’s a good memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Do you ever think about the irony of that…?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s815">Oh, gosh.</span> <span id="s816">Life is irony, the whole life.</span> <span id="s817">When….</span> <span id="s818">you know, when you become old, older than younger, life is an irony.</span> <span id="s819">Why this happened?</span> <span id="s820">What is the purpose of life?</span> <span id="s821">What is the reason of life?</span> <span id="s822">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s823">But I think everything is written, you in your life, another one in another life, everything is written.</span> <span id="s824">I say since a long time, we all have a ticket in the pocket.</span> <span id="s825">You have the date of birth and there is no date where you’re going to go, to be gone, but really there is one, but you don’t know it.</span> <span id="s826">And it’s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we celebrate birth of people, but we don’t celebrate death and death is something of life.</span> <span id="s827">It’s the end of life.</span> <span id="s828">If you did have a bad life, you’re going to have a bad time to re-incarnate in a good life.</span> <span id="s829">But if you look your life and you said yes, I did have bad time like everybody else, but the good time were good.</span> <span id="s830">And when I remember all this, all the good time, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s831">It’s experience.</span> <span id="s832">And in life, you cannot have all the time, good time.</span> <span id="s833">And on top of this, I say this too, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but compared to destiny, money is nothing.</span> <span id="s834">Destiny is what is going to make you what you are.</span> <span id="s835">You are going to be able to enjoy anything: a fruit, a good meal, good company.</span> <span id="s836">And when I say good company, feeling you are with somebody, friends, and you are on the same level.</span> <span id="s837">You can exchange... if you say something a little bit different, people are not going to laugh.</span> <span id="s838">They are going to say either “What do you mean by this?”</span> <span id="s839">or they’re going to say, “I know what you mean.</span> <span id="s840">I feel it, what you feel.”</span> <span id="s841">And this is the purpose of life, but it’s not every day you find things like this and it’s not every day you are in tune with things.</span> <span id="s842">But when you are, it’s wonderful and the rest, well, you have to do with.</span> <span id="s843">You receive a bad bill, you have a bad problem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhere... it’s tough, but you have to deal with it.</span> <span id="s844">You say, okay, I will remember next time I’m going to have a good time, this flat tire.</span> <span id="s845">It was bad, but in exchange look what good time I got now.</span> <span id="s846">And I think it’s a good philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: As far as the idea of destiny, do you apply that to the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s848">Do you think that the Holocaust, I mean when you mentioned being predestined, having something written down... do you think of the Holocaust that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s850">And it’s very hard, maybe it’s because as a Jewish boy I can say this.</span> <span id="s851">You know, Jewish people accept Jewish jokes from another Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they don’t like it.</span> <span id="s852">Did the Jewish people deserve what happened?</span> <span id="s853">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s854">Nobody deserve to suffer this way, but in the whole world, in the whole idea of human people, is it something who is going to serve humanity?</span> <span id="s855">I think so.</span> <span id="s856">I think so.</span> <span id="s857">How many people, who were in Auschwitz, in all those camps, are going to be able to use it?</span> <span id="s858">Minority.</span> <span id="s859">But the one who are going to be able to do it are going to bring something and we don’t know where we’re going to put this.</span> <span id="s860">On the newborn?</span> <span id="s861">There is a new book, written by a Rabbi, and people don’t like him very much, because he write, he wrote this book about reincarnation.</span> <span id="s862">And he said a lot of people call him, write to him and they say, “I’m born in a Catholic family.</span> <span id="s863">I’m Catholic.</span> <span id="s864">I go to the church every Sunday.</span> <span id="s865">I believe on Jesus Christ and I believe in God, but inside of me I got this Jewish feeling and I don’t understand why.”</span> <span id="s866">And it’s uh, how can I say, it’s surprising.</span> <span id="s867">And from what he say, he thinks they were in the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another corps, but they got this knowledge and they want to explain this.</span> <span id="s868">Long time ago, maybe not so long, but twenty years ago, you never spoke about reincarnation.</span> <span id="s869">A lot of people knew about, but they don’t want to say anything, because they say, “Well, they going to think I’m crazy.”</span> <span id="s870">Now it is more open.</span> <span id="s871">Sometime when I feel people react and it’s a small group... I give a lot of lecture on acupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human body and the illness of some people.</span> <span id="s872">And I go a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of people react and say, “I felt this.</span> <span id="s873">I felt I was in another life.</span> <span id="s874">I cannot pinpoint, but I know this is not my first life.”</span> <span id="s875">So, I think, coming back to the idea of the Holocaust, it served a purpose, which one, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s876">But I’m sure it serve a purpose.</span> <span id="s877">If you say this to my brother, he’s going to laugh for three hour, but it’s okay.</span> <span id="s878">And I mean, it’s his problem, it’s not mine.</span> <span id="s879">I don’t bring any proof, but I know there is a purpose.</span> <span id="s880">Can it be another Holocaust?</span> <span id="s881">Yes.</span> <span id="s882">The same one we saw?</span> <span id="s883">No.</span> <span id="s884">It’s going to be something completely different, but Hell is here on earth, so anything can happen.</span> <span id="s885">Anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: When you think in those terms, how do you, how do the Germans fit in?</span> <span id="s887">So… are they carrying out something that needs to happen?</span> <span id="s888">That is predestined?</span> <span id="s889">In other words, are they attuned with destiny in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: To answer your question you have to read a little bit about Hitler, which very few Jewish people want to touch.</span> <span id="s891">I read the life of Hitler.</span> <span id="s892">He didn’t have any chance in life.</span> <span id="s893">He could not succeed to nothing.</span> <span id="s894">He was nobody.</span> <span id="s895">He came at the right time and somebody above used him.</span> <span id="s896">But he was nothing.</span> <span id="s897">Are we going to remember Hitler?</span> <span id="s898">Yes, for a long time, but not for the real purpose.</span> <span id="s899">Because who was Hitler?</span> <span id="s900">Nothing.</span> <span id="s901">Germany was ready.</span> <span id="s902">Germany need somebody like Hitler and if it was Hitler or George or anybody else, it would be the same thing.</span> <span id="s903">We speak about the devil.</span> <span id="s904">Germany, the German people at this time, did find the chief of the devil and everything was so simple to organize.</span> <span id="s905">You see in life, people who try to organize something, something small, a factory... they never make it.</span> <span id="s906">Because it’s not the time and somebody above Earth, who’s got the little button, don’t push the button, say, because it’s not for him.</span> <span id="s907">It’s not meant to happen, not with him.</span> <span id="s908">So we are not going to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: So you can kind of think of the Holocaust as being Divine will carried out and that Hitler was an instrument of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span> <span id="s911">Because the whole story like, and I don’t... Rothschild said something one day, “For you Jewish people if you like it or not, this is the truth.</span> <span id="s912">You have the low level Jewish people, you have the middle level Jewish people and you have the aristocratic Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s913">And it’s true.</span> <span id="s914">All the Jew are so smart, all the Jew are doctor?</span> <span id="s915">No.</span> <span id="s916">What about the Jew who is a fireman?</span> <span id="s917">What about the Jew who is a police man?</span> <span id="s918">He’s got the brain of Rothschild?</span> <span id="s919">No.</span> <span id="s920">We did have, I mean... we, they did have to show to humanity Jewish people are not the enemy.</span> <span id="s921">Because, example, Israel, you have prostitute in Israel.</span> <span id="s922">Jewish woman who are prostitute?</span> <span id="s923">You say this to my father, if he was alive at the time, there are Jewish prostitute?</span> <span id="s924">He would say, “Never.</span> <span id="s925">Woman, Jewish woman never can be a prostitute.”</span> <span id="s926">Yes my dear, there are Jewish prostitute.</span> <span id="s927">You have lot of people in Israel who are crooked.</span> <span id="s928">We are people and this should stop racism.</span> <span id="s929">And when you speak with… all black people are stupid?</span> <span id="s930">No.</span> <span id="s931">You have a lot of black people who are born in poor family.</span> <span id="s932">They don’t know what is good from bad.</span> <span id="s933">They have a father, but they don’t know who he is.</span> <span id="s934">And you compare this black man with a judge from the high circuit, who judge things?</span> <span id="s935">How can you?</span> <span id="s936">They are two black people.</span> <span id="s937">With Jewish people it is the same thing.</span> <span id="s938">This is why I think the Holocaust was made, one of the reasons in my mind, to show we are people.</span> <span id="s939">There are good Jew and you have bad Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: What do you think some of the other reasons are?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: About the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Human race like atrocity.</span> <span id="s944">When they are... let’s say you are on the road and there is a bad accident.</span> <span id="s945">I stop.</span> <span id="s946">I am a doctor.</span> <span id="s947">If I can help, I will do it.</span> <span id="s948">But I don’t want to stop to see somebody bleeding, just for the pleasure.</span> <span id="s949">You have a crash of a plane.</span> <span id="s950">There was one big one in Paris a long time ago.</span> <span id="s951">Everybody come because somebody told them you can see a leg here and a head there.</span> <span id="s952">And in your normal mind you are going to say, “Oh, this is terrible.”</span> <span id="s953">But when you speak with people, they love to see this.</span> <span id="s954">Why do you think they show so bad thing on TV?</span> <span id="s955">Because people like it.</span> <span id="s956">I don’t think it’s a very good thing to show all this... it’s terrible.</span> <span id="s957">They like it.</span> <span id="s958">When you see all this blood going out, this head split, the eyes fall down.</span> <span id="s959">They like it.</span> <span id="s960">People are mean [laughing] sometime, but this is the way we are, and I think the Holocaust helped this, to show, you know... they did this, can we see a little bit…?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Do you think people are learning not to see things that way, through looking at that experience in retrospect?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I have a friend, he was an attorney and he raised his child, his boy, in the religion.</span> <span id="s964">Not… but, he raised him as a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s965">And the boy is a spoiled, what I called a spoiled American boy.</span> <span id="s966">And his father insists for him to go to Washington to see the Holocaust museum.</span> <span id="s967">And he said, “Oh, I don’t want to go there.”</span> <span id="s968">He said, “I insist, I want for you to go see a little bit of what did happen.”</span> <span id="s969">And I said, “So?”</span> <span id="s970">when he came back.</span> <span id="s971">And he said, “Well, he was not the same.</span> <span id="s972">He didn’t have no idea.</span> <span id="s973">He heard Holocaust.</span> <span id="s974">He knew it was a museum at Washington, but he said, ‘It’s a museum.’</span> <span id="s975">But when he came back, it was not a joke.</span> <span id="s976">He said, ‘I didn’t know it was like this.</span> <span id="s977">’” And I think this is why there is a museum.</span> <span id="s978">This is why you have people working in the Holocaust, not to forget.</span> <span id="s979">Not to enjoy, but not to forget, for young people, Jew or Non-Jew, anybody, to see: This happened.</span> <span id="s980">This is not a movie.</span> <span id="s981">This happened, so you have to remember to do anything you can, we can, not to happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: I’m pursuing kind of a metaphysical line of questioning, but do you think, so you feel like people have the power to make it not happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Yes, they do, absolutely.</span> <span id="s984">If they know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s985">Because if they don’t know what’s going on... When you see a movie and you know it’s fiction, if you see it or you don’t, it’s not a problem.</span> <span id="s986">But when things happen... I have a movie from the camp.</span> <span id="s987">This camp was liberated by the English army and the English are very tough.</span> <span id="s988">They show, they took the whole, bigger than a village, I think it was about fifteen, twenty thousand people.</span> <span id="s989">And they opened where they put all the dead, the cadaver, the Jewish people who they killed, they opened this with a special machine and they forced every people living in the town to carry a dead body and put it on the truck to give them a decent burial.</span> <span id="s990">Don’t you think they are going to remember?</span> <span id="s991">Yes, they will.</span> <span id="s992">Because when you touch with your hand, a dead body, you remember for the rest of your life.</span> <span id="s993">And if we could make people touch people or nothing else, force the youth to go to a hospital here, in Lexington, Louisville, anyplace, once an hour, every week and just walk and see people suffering, they are going to be a little bit different.</span> <span id="s994">American youth think they are indestructible, you know?</span> <span id="s995">They got the power.</span> <span id="s996">They can do anything until they die.</span> <span id="s997">This is why you have so many people who cripple themselves.</span> <span id="s998">They jump from, with a cord around their feet, you know… “I’m the best,” you know, the guy who jump with the motorcycle in Colorado.</span> <span id="s999">Okay, if the guy survive, it’s okay, if he die, everybody should see it, because life is not a joke.</span> <span id="s1000">Life is a gift.</span> <span id="s1001">You can use it badly and you can use it intelligently, but just by jumping and so you see... it’s like the guy who jumped from the Eiffel Tower and he say, “Nothing can happen to me.”</span> <span id="s1002">And you know, he fall down and every stage, he say, “You see, nothing happened to me,” until he reach the downstairs and then that’s it.</span> <span id="s1003">You don’t... gravity is like life, you don’t play game with life.</span> <span id="s1004">Take a knife, stick it in your stomach and you’ll see what happen.</span> <span id="s1005">And everybody should know about the Holocaust just as a reminder.</span> <span id="s1006">Justice in this country is too lenient.</span> <span id="s1007">Yesterday they liberate a man, who did abuse children.</span> <span id="s1008">He got ten year and after five year, they let him go.</span> <span id="s1009">He’s going to do it again.</span> <span id="s1010">What should we do?</span> <span id="s1011">This is another discussion, but don’t let him loose, because he’s going to take care... he’s going to take another innocent child.</span> <span id="s1012">This man is sick.</span> <span id="s1013">We have to do something about this.</span> <span id="s1014">But don’t say, “Well, you know, what can we do?”</span> <span id="s1015">What do you mean, what can we do?</span> <span id="s1016">Let’s us do the best we can, but do something.</span> <span id="s1017">Don’t let a man wild with normal people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: We’ll have more of a chance to talk more about these things I hope, but let’s go back to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1019">Before you joined the Ledermans, you were in a refuge camp for a couple of months, it sounded like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Yeah, it start, it start… I arrived on the first, a refuge of civil, I mean March ‘44, the thirty of March, ‘44 and I stay until, one month about.</span> <span id="s1021">After this they put me in a camp of refugee for the 25th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: April 25th…</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: That’s right, until May the 19th.</span> <span id="s1024">And after this I was authorized to live in Rances with Pastor Lederman.</span> <span id="s1025">It was the May the 30th, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Do you have any memories of your time in those refugee camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1028">It was not fun.</span> <span id="s1029">It was very strict.</span> <span id="s1030">We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s1031">I don’t speak about the food.</span> <span id="s1032">We survived.</span> <span id="s1033">But it was a camp.</span> <span id="s1034">I mean, it was not a vacation camp.</span> <span id="s1035">It was really very hard, but like I said before, it was all kind of people.</span> <span id="s1036">You did have bad people.</span> <span id="s1037">You did have all kind of people.</span> <span id="s1038">So they couldn’t do otherwise.</span> <span id="s1039">But by the date, you realize it was not a long time, it was maybe two months.</span> <span id="s1040">After what I saw before, two month for me was nothing.</span> <span id="s1041">Because like I said, after this, life was great with Pastor Lederman.</span> <span id="s1042">So, it was an experience again.</span> <span id="s1043">For me, everything is an experience.</span> <span id="s1044">When I’m going to die, it’s going to be an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: Did you cross legally into Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Illegally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Oh yes, completely illegal.</span> <span id="s1049">This is why they put us in a camp.</span> <span id="s1050">Because if it was legally, I enter Switzerland, it was no problem.</span> <span id="s1051">But it was illegally, because they didn’t want to open the door.</span> <span id="s1052">They didn’t want to, for anybody to come in Switzerland, because they didn’t have any room.</span> <span id="s1053">Everybody wants to go there.</span> <span id="s1054">So, it was hard and they did have too much people.</span> <span id="s1055">So, they tried to push away all the people, until the last two or three weeks, the Swiss Army was on the border.</span> <span id="s1056">And then anybody who wants to cross, they shoot them.</span> <span id="s1057">They didn’t want to let anybody come in, because a lot of German put civilian things to come.</span> <span id="s1058">They didn’t want to let them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: What did you do with your days during the time in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: In the camp?</span> <span id="s1061">Like a prison, you walk around.</span> <span id="s1062">You think about food.</span> <span id="s1063">You cry.</span> <span id="s1064">You fine if you know somebody…</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Did you know anyone?</span> <span id="s1066">Did you have any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No, no, there was no... I didn’t know anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: And did you have anything to do... Did you meet the Ledermans before they said “Yes, we’ll take this young man?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1070">No, no.</span> <span id="s1071">No, no.</span> <span id="s1072">They… this guy would go with this guy, this guy with this guy.</span> <span id="s1073">How did they decide for me to go with Pastor Lederman?</span> <span id="s1074">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1075">But I know I was designed to go there.</span> <span id="s1076">I did go there.</span> <span id="s1077">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1078">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: What was Mrs. Lederman’s name?</span> <span id="s1080">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: I knew you going to ask me.</span> <span id="s1082">And I can not remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Maybe it will come back later.</span> <span id="s1084">And you went to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: In Rances, yeah.</span> <span id="s1086">It was a little school, you know, an elementary school, where I was not very good.</span> <span id="s1087">The teacher said I don’t do any effort to learn.</span> <span id="s1088">When I think about, I know why.</span> <span id="s1089">At the time I didn’t know why.</span> <span id="s1090">But when I think, you know, I was… I did go over my head, study for what?</span> <span id="s1091">For who?</span> <span id="s1092">You know, it’s not like a man who is twenty and decides to become an attorney.</span> <span id="s1093">He is going to study hard, night and day.</span> <span id="s1094">But at my age, nine years old, you put me in a school to learn about mathematic and all this.</span> <span id="s1095">I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1096">I want to know, where is my brother, where is my mother?</span> <span id="s1097">I would like to know what am I going to become?</span> <span id="s1098">How long this war is going to be?</span> <span id="s1099">So, no, I was not a good student at all.</span> <span id="s1100">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Did everyone know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1103">Oh, he was proud of it.</span> <span id="s1104">He was telling to everybody... well, he introduce me, “This is my little Jewish boy.”</span> <span id="s1105">Oh no, people were very open and friendly.</span> <span id="s1106">I mean, you know, “I got a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s1107">No, no, no, this is my Jewish boy.”</span> <span id="s1108">He was proud of it.</span> <span id="s1109">The time was very good, I mean everything was... it was nothing, I can’t say they were mean.</span> <span id="s1110">The only time he was mad at me is one day, I touch his gun.</span> <span id="s1111">He did have a gun and I touched it.</span> <span id="s1112">And he was mad.</span> <span id="s1113">He said, “Let me show you how dangerous it is.”</span> <span id="s1114">And he shot something in the room and boy, I never touch his gun again.</span> <span id="s1115">[Laughing] They were very nice.</span> <span id="s1116">I have really only wonderful memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Did you make any friends with any other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: No.</span> <span id="s1119">Probably yes, but, you know, I left.</span> <span id="s1120">And it took a little bit time before I came back, so it was... No, I don’t remember anybody.</span> <span id="s1121">I’ve been back to the little town and I did hardly recognize the place.</span> <span id="s1122">It was people in the street and I was looking, do I know them?</span> <span id="s1123">Do I don’t?</span> <span id="s1124">Very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: You mentioned that, that was the time when you think you started to get interested in medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Gradually, gradually I start to, I was very interested in the human body, the function of the human body and the natural healing, mostly.</span> <span id="s1129">But it was very little by little.</span> <span id="s1130">I cannot say it came one night, I wake up in the morning, I said, “I want to be a doctor.”</span> <span id="s1131">No, no.</span> <span id="s1132">I thought it would be interesting to study and every day said, “Oh, but it’s going to be hard.</span> <span id="s1133">It’s going to, maybe I’m not fit for this.”</span> <span id="s1134">So, little by little, and it came, and I start my study.</span> <span id="s1135">Even when I start my study, I said “I will start, if it works, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s1136">If it doesn’t work, I’ll do something else.”</span> <span id="s1137">So, I was not saying “I will do it.”</span> <span

<p><span id="s1145">A: Oh yes, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1146">He told me everything.</span> <span id="s1147">He explained to me, “Here they are.</span> <span id="s1148">Here are the Americans, here are the Russians.</span> <span id="s1149">They are going to circle like this.”</span> <span id="s1150">Like I said, he was a very intellectual man and he wants to tell me as much as he can.</span>

what was happening to the Jews in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: I don’t... not really.</span> <span id="s1155">I knew it was bad, but I didn’t realize really what was going on.</span></p>

<span id="s1159">I always suspect that he was Jew, with his name.</span> <span id="s1160">It’s a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1161">And, but one day, I said something like this and he didn’t answer me, meaning he doesn’t want to speak about it.</span> <span id="s1162">And I stop right there, because I didn’t want to be, you know, mean.</span> <span id="s1163">If he did want to tell me, he would at the time.</span> <span id="s1164">But he didn’t say anything, so I didn’t pursue.</span> <span id="s1165">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1166">We stopped there.</span> <span id="s1167">But Lederman, it’s a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1168">Unless… it’s probably what he did.</span> <span id="s1169">His father was a tailor.</span> <span id="s1170">So, maybe he became Protestant.</span> <span

id="s1177">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: So do you remember hearing that the war ended while you were in Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1179">Were you in Switzerland when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1181">And well it was in every radio, every paper.</span> <span id="s1182">It was big celebration.</span> <span id="s1183">At the same time it was very scary because, like I said, you know, the German tried to go away the best they could.</span> <span id="s1184">I don’t think I left right away.</span> <span id="s1185">It took me, maybe two or three weeks, maybe a month before I left.</span> <span id="s1186">But I didn’t stay long after I heard the war was finished.</span> <span id="s1187">And did want to join my family.</span> <span id="s1188">And, but it was… yes, it was in Switzerland I heard all this.</span> <span id="s1189">Yeah, I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Do you remember celebrating in any particular way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1192">Like I said, it was a little village where we were.</span> <span id="s1193">And Pastor Lederman was a little bit sad to see... this I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s1194">It meant, “You stay with us, we treat you like family and now the war is finished, you can’t wait to go away.”</span> <span id="s1195">And at the time, I didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s1196">I felt bad, but my reaction was normal.</span> <span id="s1197">And his reaction was normal, too.</span> <span id="s1198">So, we both been right, but I want to go back and find how many member of my family are alive.</span> <span id="s1199">But we never spoke about this after this; it was finished.</span> <span id="s1200">We didn’t speak about… anymore about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: So you’re something like thirteen years old at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Yeah, I think so, something like this.</span> <span id="s1203">Yeah, twelve, between twelve and thirteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: And you just left on your own and forged out to look for your parents without any assistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1206">No, it’s uh, I always been a traveler.</span> <span id="s1207">I like to travel.</span> <span id="s1208">I was used to, it was not... I’ve been to Japan five years ago.</span> <span id="s1209">And I don’t know why, at the last minute I panic.</span> <span id="s1210">And it was because of the language.</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t speak Japanese.</span> <span id="s1212">And I panic, and I did have to speak to myself and said, It’s nothing.</span> <span id="s1213">It is another land.</span> <span id="s1214">And when I was there, it was easy, it was no problem.</span> <span id="s1215">I enjoy.</span> <span id="s1216">I got lost many time and I always found my way back.</span> <span id="s1217">It was no problem.</span> <span id="s1218">But no, it didn’t occur to me to say, I’m not going to go back because nobody is going to take me.</span> <span id="s1219">I was not used to have somebody who take me by the hand and bring you everywhere.</span> <span id="s1220">I was used to go by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Was it something from before the war that you think was just in your nature or is this something that... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Yeah, I think it was in my nature.</span> <span id="s1223">It’s something... I’m shy on things.</span> <span id="s1224">I know where I’m shy, and I know where I’m not shy.</span> <span id="s1225">Every personality is different.</span> <span id="s1226">I think we have to know our weakness points.</span> <span id="s1227">And I, this was not on my weakness.</span> <span id="s1228">It would be very hard for me to ask something on my favor, but I can ask anything for somebody else.</span> <span id="s1229">But traveling never bothered me.</span> <span id="s1230">I can go anyplace.</span> <span id="s1231">I like to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: I assume that during that time that you were with the Ledermans, you didn’t have any word from your mother at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: No, not at all, because, the only time I remember is, we tried to reach my mother by phone, but she was not home.</span> <span id="s1234">I mean, she was not at the home where she used to be when I left her.</span> <span id="s1235">In the apartment of her sister, they didn’t have any phone.</span> <span id="s1236">And it was a big mess.</span> <span id="s1237">So, I couldn’t reach her.</span> <span id="s1238">The only way to reach her is by the Jewish Association, who knew exactly where she was and they sent a cable saying, “Your son is leaving Grenoble at this time and he’s going to be in Paris in the gare at this time.”</span> <span id="s1239">And they were there, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Going back to one more thing, you mentioned that while you were there at the Lederman’s you started to read a lot and to become interested... do you remember what you were reading?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1242">I don’t... no.</span> <span id="s1243">They did have hundreds of books and I was very interested on philosophy.</span> <span id="s1244">I like philosophy of everything, life, but I don’t know what I was reading.</span> <span id="s1245">It’s too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Did you talk to Pastor Lederman at all about your interest in education or in studying medicine or any…?</span> <span id="s1247">Did he encourage you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1249">The only thing he knew to tell is, I..</span> <span id="s1250">.</span> <span id="s1251">you know those little bugs who eat potato?</span> <span id="s1252">Every time, every day we did have to go for an hour and collect this and put it in a bottle.</span> <span id="s1253">And I used to say it hurt my back, so he used to call me Paul with the ribs who go up and down.</span> <span id="s1254">He cannot bend.</span> <span id="s1255">So this is why… he made fun of me, because he thought I was—and I was probably—lazy.</span> <span id="s1256">Some work outside I didn’t like too much.</span> <span id="s1257">I did like to go to the mushroom, but I didn’t like to bend and put my hand on this mud and all things, you know.</span> <span id="s1258">So, he always make fun of me.</span> <span id="s1259">But he said, “You going to like to give speeches.</span> <span id="s1260">You’re going to like to speak in front of crowd.”</span> <span id="s1261">And it’s true.</span> <span id="s1262">I give a lot of seminar and I feel very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1263">I don’t have any problem with people.</span> <span id="s1264">And if some people ask me question I cannot answer, I said, “I don’t know the answer, but if you give me one of your card, I will find out and write to you.”</span> <span id="s1265">But we never spoke about what kind of study I’m going to do or what is going to be my future, what kind of job I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s1266">No.</span> <span id="s1267">Because I don’t think, I didn’t know anything myself.</span> <span id="s1268">I don’t have any idea what I’m going to do.</span> <span id="s1269">But I know, the only thing I know is, they change my life.</span> <span id="s1270">They... the orientation was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: And do you remember reuniting with your mother and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: Can you talk about that moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Well, I have to say something.</span> <span id="s1275">I don’t know if you’re going to find this funny or different.</span> <span id="s1276">I didn’t have a very good relation with my brother, Gaston.</span> <span id="s1277">Never.</span> <span id="s1278">Never been real brother.</span> <span id="s1279">Why, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1280">But my mother, when I was very young, I used to discuss with her, as long as she did have the power on me, it was okay.</span> <span id="s1281">But when I grew up and because of the separation of this, my attitude changed.</span> <span id="s1282">And my mother is a very, used to be a very strong personality.</span> <span id="s1283">She wants to organize everything.</span> <span id="s1284">Example, when I came to study chiropractic in the United States... I was married at the time and my daughter was eighteen months old.</span> <span id="s1285">And she didn’t understand why I took my daughter with me instead of leaving my daughter with her for two year.</span> <span id="s1286">And I said, I don’t know how you can think about me leaving my daughter for two year, eighteen month?</span> <span id="s1287">I’m never going to be her father anymore.</span> <span id="s1288">So, we did have a very, very big discussion about this and for the time I was gone, she never spoke to me.</span> <span id="s1289">And my brother, Bernard, reunite us when I came back.</span> <span id="s1290">But the problem is, I was at the time, as stubborn as she was.</span> <span id="s1291">And we were always on challenge.</span> <span id="s1292">I like her, I would do anything for her, but I couldn’t receive any order from her.</span> <span id="s1293">And it’s a feeling very hard to explain, because like when I open my office... she came in.</span> <span id="s1294">She wants to organize my office.</span> <span id="s1295">And I said, “Mother, it’s my office, it’s my place and I’m going to organize it my way.</span> <span id="s1296">You like it, you come.</span> <span id="s1297">You don’t like it, it’s too bad.”</span> <span id="s1298">But until the end, she wants to be the boss.</span> <span id="s1299">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s1300">And she never could, because probably we were the same way, you know?</span> <span id="s1301">But so the relation was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss her?</span> <span id="s1302">No.</span> <span id="s1303">And my mother was not a kisser.</span> <span id="s1304">One kiss a week was the top, no more.</span> <span id="s1305">So she stay in her, in her back, and I stay, and my other brother, Gaston, is… it was, is and was a very funny character.</span> <span id="s1306">He looks good and it was enough for him.</span> <span id="s1307">So, he was thinking more to buy nice suit, nice thing.</span> <span id="s1308">And when I came back he was a growing man and you know, he didn’t want to bother with me.</span> <span id="s1309">I was the little boy.</span> <span id="s1310">So, the relation was short.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Okay, this is an interview with Dr. Paul Pressman, a continuation.</span> <span id="s1313">It’s now August 17th, 1999, continuing our interview from July.</span> <span id="s1314">And this is tape number three, side A. I wondered when I was looking over the notes.</span> <span id="s1315">I took some, listened to the interview that we did last time and I took some notes on things that we had talked about, and one thing which stood out, that I didn’t ask you about was, I wondered how you felt... you were talking about your mother’s role in the resistance and discovering that she was actually a fighter or a captain in the resistance movement and that she showed you this gun that she kept hidden in this book.</span> <span id="s1316">And I wondered how that effected your view of your mother and how, whether that moment was significant to you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Not specifically, because I think I knew my mother since a long time, since I was very little, I mean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have very serious question to ask to each other.</span> <span id="s1318">And I think basically we didn’t, I didn’t have, she didn’t have any secret from me, so I was not surprised and not shocked to see what she was doing.</span> <span id="s1319">And she was doing this very naturally.</span> <span id="s1320">I mean, she didn’t show off.</span> <span id="s1321">It was what she was doing and that’s all.</span> <span id="s1322">But it was not something... a big surprise for me.</span> <span id="s1323">I never been afraid of gun.</span> <span id="s1324">I never been excited over gun, but I understood.</span> <span id="s1325">The question... it was no question in my mind.</span> <span id="s1326">It was a normal way of life, knowing what she was doing before.</span> <span id="s1327">And it was, to me, a normal situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Before she used to go, at the time when she was in Grenoble, in south of France, she used to go and bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1330">And those people were guarded by German.</span> <span id="s1331">And she always found a way to go in, bring what she did have to bring.</span> <span id="s1332">She did a lot of risky things, but the natural way.</span> <span id="s1333">So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a gun, didn’t surprise me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of your experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday.</span> <span id="s1335">You talked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor Lederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun.</span> <span id="s1336">And then you talked about that other incident with your mother.</span> <span id="s1337">And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if you have a gun now.</span> <span id="s1338">And that was something you didn’t talk about on tape.</span> <span id="s1339">And I was wondering if you would talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Well, it took me a long time before I could train myself.</span> <span id="s1341">I have now thirty year of martial art behind me.</span> <span id="s1342">I always felt in general, the Jewish people don’t like gun, don’t like to fight.</span> <span id="s1343">I mean I speak about the Jewish people in France.</span> <span id="s1344">And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish people in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world.</span> <span id="s1345">And I was not surprised, I was happy about, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun with Jewish people they don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1346">Jewish people in general are not fighter, unless you go in Israel and they did what they did.</span> <span id="s1347">And this is why I always felt very secure, and when I was with my godfather in Switzerland, I did like to have this gun close to me.</span> <span id="s1348">But it was very hard for me to explain to him why.</span> <span id="s1349">I always felt like if anything happened, maybe I’m going to die, but I’m going to defend myself.</span> <span id="s1350">I don’t want to die like a poor animal.</span> <span id="s1351">I want to die, but before I’m going to die, somebody else is going to die, too.</span> <span id="s1352">It was my feeling since a long time.</span> <span id="s1353">I was in very big contradiction with my brothers, but something I have to say... even I knew my father very little, my father used to carry all the time a gun.</span> <span id="s1354">I didn’t know why and I couldn’t ask the question, because I don’t think he would answer, but this is something I remember.</span> <span id="s1355">And maybe it’s because of this I always... But basically in my mind I think the reason I always like gun is because gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Did your father carry a gun before the war, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: So that meant when you saw your mother with a gun it wasn’t so unusual, because you had already seen your father with a gun and it was something you were used to having around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1360">Because my mother never touch gun before.</span> <span id="s1361">I never saw, before the war, my mother with a gun.</span> <span id="s1362">But when I saw her with a gun, it makes sense to me.</span> <span id="s1363">From where we come... it’s funny because we were four, five brother and we were so different.</span> <span id="s1364">The only one I know the best is the one who stay alive now.</span> <span id="s1365">And he is so different, like I said in the tape before and he’s not a fighter.</span> <span id="s1366">He’s a good man.</span> <span id="s1367">He’s not a fighter, and the only reason he came back is because he was lucky.</span> <span id="s1368">And you can… you know, in front of so many SS or Nazi in the camp, you don’t have a..</span> <span id="s1369">.</span> <span id="s1370">if they decide to kill you, they will kill you anytime they want.</span> <span id="s1371">So when he came back, he came back because he was lucky.</span> <span id="s1372">But my brother was not a fighter and I am a fighter.</span> <span id="s1373">Like I told him many time, if I was in a camp, if they took me in Auschwitz, I wouldn’t survive an hour.</span> <span id="s1374">They would kill me right away.</span> <span id="s1375">But the same idea, they would kill me, but I would kill somebody before I die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Do you ever feel critical of those who didn’t struggle enough?</span> <span id="s1377">There’s been a lot a criticism of Jews during the Holocaust, that they didn’t struggle enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Well, it’s always… was bad feeling for me, to see, like when in Paris they put together all the Jew in one big field, closed completely.</span> <span id="s1379">It was hard for me later, to understand why they didn’t do something.</span> <span id="s1380">Why didn’t they organize?</span> <span id="s1381">The only time they organized themselves and most of them time it was Polish Jew, it was in the ghetto of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1382">This is where they organize, they fight, because they say die for die.</span> <span id="s1383">We going to fight.</span> <span id="s1384">But in France, no, because again we come back to the same idea, all the Jewish people from France said, “I’m not Jewish, I’m French, Jewish is my religion,” which was true on the basic.</span> <span id="s1385">But the German said, “No, you Jew.</span> <span id="s1386">French Jew, German Jew, Italian Jew, you are Jew, you have to die.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: And along those lines, you also mentioned last time that before the war and maybe during the war too, you thought of yourself that way, as a French person and then as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1388">And I’m wondering when that switched that you really felt like, no I’m not French, I’m Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Well, everything changed when I saw they arrest everybody, young, old people.</span> <span id="s1390">And they arrest them just because they were Jew.</span> <span id="s1391">And to me it didn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1392">This is when I start to realize, I’m not French, I’m not American, I’m not Russian, I’m Jew.</span> <span id="s1393">This is the only reason.</span> <span id="s1394">I’m born Jew, so they want to kill me, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1395">Like I told you before, look up to this day, what happened last week.</span> <span id="s1396">This guy, who did go in California and kill Jew just because he doesn’t like Jew.</span> <span id="s1397">And this is when I said to the American Jew, maybe you are an American, but before everything you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s1398">And they are going to kill you, not because you are an American, because you are Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Have you ever gotten into trouble with any people, with any American Jews by telling them that?</span> <span id="s1400">I mean you have a very strong opinion about it and some people might have strong... Do you ever get into arguments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Oh yeah, all the time, all the time, because number one, I don’t go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1402">I don’t go to the Temple.</span> <span id="s1403">I, like I say to a lot of Jew, I’m Jewish by tradition.</span> <span id="s1404">I’m not Jew by religion.</span> <span id="s1405">And when we speak about, I mean the way the Jewish people are here, they make it easy for them.</span> <span id="s1406">They separate the traditional Jew, the Reformed Jew, and for me this make less sense than the rest of it.</span> <span id="s1407">But sure, they don’t... when I arrive here in the beginning, I did go to the synagogue to explain what was life in Europe.</span> <span id="s1408">And a lot of people were laughing because they thought I was telling story.</span> <span id="s1409">So, I quit going and they ask me why I don’t join synagogue.</span> <span id="s1410">And I said, I never join synagogue in France, why should I join a synagogue here on top of this?</span> <span id="s1411">This for me is not a synagogue.</span> <span id="s1412">This is a joke.</span> <span id="s1413">You know, Saturdays is the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1414">Saturday Jewish people don’t touch money, so we hire Catholic people to play the music, to clean the place, because we cannot work, because we cannot sing, it’s against the law of the Jewish Torah.</span> <span id="s1415">It doesn’t make sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: And when you said that people here, when you talked about your time in Europe and they thought you were telling stories, were you talking about the Holocaust years or afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Holocaust, the way they arrest us, the way, even up to this day, you don’t say you’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1418">Well, my name is Pressman, Pressman in France is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1419">Goldman, Pellman, this is Jewish.</span> <span id="s1420">People ask me, well Pressman is German?</span> <span id="s1421">I say no, this is a Jewish name.</span> <span id="s1422">But we have to be careful even up to this day.</span> <span id="s1423">And I don’t speak about Germany.</span> <span id="s1424">If you go to Germany and your name is Pressman, they don’t speak to you.</span> <span id="s1425">And a lot of people said to me when I was in Europe, they say, “Oh, this is finished.”</span> <span id="s1426">And one day, a guy did go to Germany, Jewish man and he said openly to people, you know, “I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1427">Nobody talked to him after all.</span> <span id="s1428">They didn’t want to have anything to do with him.</span> <span id="s1429">Anti-Semitism in Germany is as strong as it is now as it was before, the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: We left off last time where the war had ended and you went back from Switzerland to Paris and you rejoined you mother and your brother, Gaston, and eventually your other brother, Bernard.</span> <span id="s1431">And you didn’t have time to tell in detail about what happened from there.</span> <span id="s1432">So, but you did mention briefly that you moved into your aunt’s apartment, who had been killed at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1433">Can you talk about those, trying to reconstruct your and rebuild your life together in those few months after the war, in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Well we came back, we got together... This is where, like I told you the last time, my brother, we found out he came back from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1435">So, he was alive.</span> <span id="s1436">And we got the apartment, which was a very small apartment.</span> <span id="s1437">It was a two room apartment for my aunt.</span> <span id="s1438">And we did go in and we start to try to get back the apartment we used to have before we left.</span> <span id="s1439">And we got it back.</span> <span id="s1440">My father was an upholsterer and he did have a factory, very small, but a little factory.</span> <span id="s1441">We got it back, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: What was the name of it?</span> <span id="s1443">Sorry to interrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: You mean…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: The factory that your father owned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: His name was Joseph Pressman, underneath it was Tapissier.</span> <span id="s1447">Upholsterer.</span> <span id="s1448">And it was in the same street where we did have this apartment.</span> <span id="s1449">So my brother, who came from Auschwitz, who did have a lot of training with my father, did reopen this and start to work again.</span> <span id="s1450">And I was thirteen years old and I did go back to school, college.</span> <span id="s1451">And when I graduate from college, my brother wants for me to go and work with him on the _______________.</span> <span id="s1452">And I said, “No, I want to study medicine.”</span> <span id="s1453">This was the joke of the day, because why should I become a doctor?</span> <span id="s1454">What… so, my brother, like I said, is a nice man, tried to help me as much as he could.</span> <span id="s1455">And he helped me, but basically the whole family, cut a little bit between them and I, because what I would like to do, it was silly.</span> <span id="s1456">For them it didn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1457">The only time they realize it was true, is when I graduate from medical school.</span> <span id="s1458">And they said, “Well, he did it, with no help.”</span> <span id="s1459">I was working at night, and I was doing a lot of job.</span> <span id="s1460">And during the day I did go to medical school.</span> <span id="s1461">And when I graduate, everybody was very happy and we celebrate.</span> <span id="s1462">And meantime before I graduate, I got married with a Catholic girl, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1463">This didn’t help mine relation with my family.</span> <span id="s1464">I got a little girl at the time and I was twenty-three years old.</span> <span id="s1465">And I raised my little girl.</span> <span id="s1466">I did have, like I said, a lot of job, but I was making a good living.</span> <span id="s1467">And when it was, I think it was, I practice for about three, four year in Paris and I decide I want to learn about the mechanic of the body.</span> <span id="s1468">And this is where I came and find out about United State and Harvard, it was a special course for the mechanic of the body.</span> <span id="s1469">And I came by myself for two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s1470">And this is where I found out, somebody told me about chiropractic.</span> <span id="s1471">So, I did go to Davenport, Iowa, where I saw what was chiropractic.</span> <span id="s1472">I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1473">I didn’t have any idea.</span> <span id="s1474">And the first time I saw about chiropractic, I said “Those people are crazy.</span> <span id="s1475">Doesn’t make any sense,” you know, the spine, give an adjustment.</span> <span id="s1476">And before I left they give me a book, which I have even up to this day.</span> <span id="s1477">And I did go back to France, read the book and I said, “Gosh, this makes sense to me.”</span> <span id="s1478">So, I pack up all my thing, took my wife and daughter and came to the United State and did go to Davenport, Iowa, where they give me credit.</span> <span id="s1479">And I study chiropractic, graduate in 1962.</span> <span id="s1480">And came back to France in Paris and opened an office in Paris.</span> <span id="s1481">And I start to practice medicine and chiropractic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Let’s slow down, because I want to get some more details about just the time immediately after the war before we go on.</span> <span id="s1483">Was it, so you were staying in your aunt’s house for just a little while before you moved?</span> <span id="s1484">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: Maybe I would say a couple year, or maybe less.</span> <span id="s1486">But it was not long.</span> <span id="s1487">It was very hard to live, three men and my mother in a two room.</span> <span id="s1488">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: And were you surrounded by your aunt’s things, who had been killed?</span> <span id="s1490">That must have been strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: No, nothing was left.</span> <span id="s1492">They, you know, people stole everything.</span> <span id="s1493">No, it was nothing inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: How did you feel as a Jewish person, survivor of the Holocaust, living in Paris immediately after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: It was a inside revolution on me, but I, I’m, how can I say?</span> <span id="s1496">I’m very mean, if I want to, or I can ignore everything if I want to.</span> <span id="s1497">And I thought I didn’t want to be the fighter against the... like Don Quixote.</span> <span id="s1498">And I said, “It’s not going to bring me nothing.</span> <span id="s1499">I better build my life, chose what I want to do and just go on.”</span> <span id="s1500">For the time being after the war, there were no danger anymore.</span> <span id="s1501">So I didn’t think about the Holocaust, all the dead, why they die, how they die.</span> <span id="s1502">Because of my brother I knew a lot of things from inside.</span> <span id="s1503">But I did try to be in a neutral position.</span> <span id="s1504">I didn’t want for this to affect me.</span> <span id="s1505">I registered the whole thing, but I put this aside and say I will bring it back when the time is going to be there.</span> <span id="s1506">I don’t know how other people do, but this was my way of doing.</span> <span id="s1507">So, I’m not going to be bitter.</span> <span id="s1508">I’m not going to be all the time hungry, not hungry, angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: Angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Mad.</span> <span id="s1511">I don’t, I don’t think… I didn’t want to forgive.</span> <span id="s1512">At this time I didn’t know the technique of forgiving.</span> <span id="s1513">But I knew it was something I can do about this, but I was not ready to do it, because I didn’t know what to do and how to do it.</span> <span id="s1514">And like I said, my brother give us a lot of information, what happen to the camp.</span> <span id="s1515">They was some fight, not fight, but my brother said a lot of secret things from the camp.</span> <span id="s1516">And one day, my mother did repeat something he asked her not to speak about to anybody.</span> <span id="s1517">And a group of attorney call my brother to ask him, did he say this?</span> <span id="s1518">And my brother said, “Yes, but I want to know how do you know?”</span> <span id="s1519">And they found out and they say the truth, “Your mother said it.”</span> <span id="s1520">And I was there when he came back and he say to my mother, I ever going to speak to you anymore about this, and if we have to go to court because of what I told you, I will deny everything.</span> <span id="s1521">And I’m going to tell you, you a liar.</span> <span id="s1522">Because what happened in camp, have nothing to do with this world.</span> <span id="s1523">I told you this because you my mother, but I don’t try to... he said, “I don’t try to protect anybody.</span> <span id="s1524">But you cannot judge us.”</span> <span id="s1525">And hmmm, to me it makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: What was it that he told her?</span> <span id="s1527">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: It was… it was something bad, because the guy was alive.</span> <span id="s1529">And… and I mean, he survived, he did something very... you know, a piece of bread in camp is a question of life or death.</span> <span id="s1530">And when you say this now, what is a piece of bread?</span> <span id="s1531">Well, you got this piece of bread, you survive.</span> <span id="s1532">You don’t have this piece of bread, you die.</span> <span id="s1533">So, who are you people, to judge us, because somebody stole a piece of bread off of somebody who was dying?</span> <span id="s1534">Any way he will die.</span> <span id="s1535">So the guy... and nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s1536">And he explained this to my mother, but she shouldn’t repeat this thing.</span> <span id="s1537">Because... and this was a little thing, you know... I mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: So, the lawyers got involved because... why?</span> <span id="s1539">Why did the lawyers get involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Because it was Jewish lawyer and most of them came back from Auschwitz, but they been in Auschwitz for maximum a year, which was nothing.</span> <span id="s1541">But when they came back, you know, they want to show, “We are lawyer, now we going to judge people who were mean, bad in camp.”</span> <span id="s1542">Because if you know the story about the camp, the German, the SS were very, very few.</span> <span id="s1543">Let’s say in a camp of two thousand Jew, there were fifteen SS in uniform and they give order.</span> <span id="s1544">They say, “You are the Kapo of this room.</span> <span id="s1545">There is two hundred people here.</span> <span id="s1546">You are responsible.”</span> <span id="s1547">You say, “I don’t want to”—Boom.</span> <span id="s1548">“You are going to be the Kapo, you don’t want to be... so you are responsible of this two hundred people.</span> <span id="s1549">Tomorrow morning I want ten Jew on the floor dead.</span> <span id="s1550">I don’t care the way you do it.”</span> <span id="s1551">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Did you have, did your relationship with your brother Bernard change very much after the war, after he had been through these experiences in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: No, it didn’t change because I didn’t know him very well.</span> <span id="s1554">He’s much, I mean, you know, he’s older than I. I didn’t have, until I think it was two years ago, he got an interview in Paris from a French television.</span> <span id="s1555">And he give me a tape and I came here and I listen to the tape and I was so surprised.</span> <span id="s1556">I thought I knew my brother, but I didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s1557">And I don’t judge him, but we are so different.</span> <span id="s1558">He takes things one way.</span> <span id="s1559">I told him one day, “I think you are a Buddhist.”</span> <span id="s1560">And he said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s1561">I say, “Because Buddhist is not a religion, it is a way of life.</span> <span id="s1562">And Buddhist look on the floor and behind what he see on the floor and the rest he doesn’t see.</span> <span id="s1563">The only thing is what is on the floor, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1564">And this is why you survive.”</span> <span id="s1565">Because the tape he was doing, the interview he did on the French television, I thought to myself, we didn’t live with the same parent.</span> <span id="s1566">It was, you know, he was telling, we did have a normal life.</span> <span id="s1567">Sure, we felt anti-Semitism around us, but it was not so bad.</span> <span id="s1568">And I said to myself, we didn’t lead the same life.</span> <span id="s1569">We didn’t go to the same school and we didn’t see the same thing.</span> <span id="s1570">So, I did go see friend of our age, my age, his age, and I ask question.</span> <span id="s1571">He said, “No, your brother is different.</span> <span id="s1572">He’s a very sweet guy.</span> <span id="s1573">He’s a good man, but he see things completely different.”</span> <span id="s1574">I spend my Christmas with him, the last Christmas, ‘98, ‘99.</span> <span id="s1575">And I did something.</span> <span id="s1576">I spoke with him for an hour and I trying to explain to him, how, what is technique of forgiveness.</span> <span id="s1577">He was mad.</span> <span id="s1578">He was so mad.</span> <span id="s1579">And I said, “Understand, forgiveness is not to forgive what they did, it’s just to save yourself.</span> <span id="s1580">When you forgive them, at least you can breathe a little bit.</span> <span id="s1581">Right now, every night you cry, you scream, because you are in the camp now.</span> <span id="s1582">If you forgive, let them worry about their problem, but get rid of it.”</span> <span id="s1583">What did I say?</span> <span id="s1584">So, he send me, even two weeks ago he send me a book I couldn’t find here.</span> <span id="s1585">And it is in French.</span> <span id="s1586">I like to read in French.</span> <span id="s1587">And on the side he wrote, “Try to understand why I cannot forgive.”</span> <span id="s1588">We have two different way of thinking and until the last minute of his life he is going to cry and be mad, but he doesn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1589">He doesn’t want to help himself.</span> <span id="s1590">This is his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Okay, this is tape three, side B.</span> <span id="s1593">When you say the technique of forgiveness and learning about the technique of forgiveness, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: When I was in France, on my spare time when I was a student of medicine, I learn hypnosis.</span> <span id="s1595">I was very interested in hypnosis.</span> <span id="s1596">I put a lady through surgery under hypnosis.</span> <span id="s1597">And you have a lot of technique.</span> <span id="s1598">And mainly this technique of forgiveness, which I didn’t know before and I was very happy to learn and practice this first on me.</span> <span id="s1599">Every time I was mad at somebody or things I didn’t like, I did try to forgive the people I was speaking, I mean not openly, but in my mind.</span> <span id="s1600">And this way it was easy for me to be able to discuss with people.</span> <span id="s1601">Some people have a natural way of being patient.</span> <span id="s1602">I’m not patient, so I did want to find something who is not going to make me patient, but make me a normal human being.</span> <span id="s1603">And those technique of forgiveness is so… we hear this in the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s1604">Forgive and God will forgive you.</span> <span id="s1605">I always say to a lot of people, I don’t need any church because if I have a problem, I speak with God directly.</span> <span id="s1606">It is fifty percent joke and fifty percent true, it goes together.</span> <span id="s1607">Because another human being like me, ah, how intelligent he can be?</span> <span id="s1608">What can he do with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do it?</span> <span id="s1609">And this forgiveness came back to me.</span> <span id="s1610">And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the teacher said, “Today we’re going to speak only about forgiveness.”</span> <span id="s1611">And I thought, God, this is great, and I learned every bit of it.</span> <span id="s1612">And I practice this with me and with my patient.</span> <span id="s1613">And it was wonderful, because people used to say, “I didn’t think this way before, but now it make it so easy.”</span> <span id="s1614">And I thought to myself, I know, because I practice the same way for myself.</span> <span id="s1615">The more I can forgive things, easy my life is, and I come back always to the point zero.</span> <span id="s1616">If you let, if you do a mistake and you go too far with this mistake, it’s very... longer you keep with, harder it is to come back.</span> <span id="s1617">So, try to rectify the mistake as soon as you can, so this way it’s going to be much easier to work on it and it’s going to be quicker.</span> <span id="s1618">So they teach you every time at night before you, when you go to bed, before you go to sleep, try to go very fast on your day and say, “Okay what happened today?</span> <span id="s1619">What did I do that was not good?”</span> <span id="s1620">So you try to forget yourself by being sorry and said “I’m not going to do this any more.</span> <span id="s1621">I’m going to try to be better,” and also vice and versa, one way or another way.</span> <span id="s1622">It’s amazing the way it works.</span> <span id="s1623">It’s something very simple.</span> <span id="s1624">The only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it’s perfect.</span> <span id="s1625">If you don’t want to do it, it’s very hard.</span> <span id="s1626">And this is why, I try.</span> <span id="s1627">I stay about two weeks with my brother.</span> <span id="s1628">I said, “Bernard, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1629">You’re going to be mad, if you want to throw me out from your house, you do it.</span> <span id="s1630">But every day I’m going to speak to you about forgiveness, because this is your only savior.”</span> <span id="s1631">But he laugh, he became red sometime, he left the room, he took witness, friend.</span> <span id="s1632">Okay, he took friend who thought like him.</span> <span id="s1633">And you know, if you ask a friend, after all the story of the camp, he survive and he say, “Bloing (ph), face to face, can I forgive this?”</span> <span id="s1634">People say, “No.”</span> <span id="s1635">But this is not what I ask him.</span> <span id="s1636">I don’t ask him to forgive this way.</span> <span id="s1637">I want for him to forgive them their fault, they are the worst people.</span> <span id="s1638">He is not a bad man.</span> <span id="s1639">So forgive them for what they did to them and to you.</span> <span id="s1640">But it was… I don’t think... maybe I put a little something on the ground, but for him it is too late.</span> <span id="s1641">And I think, it’s not nice what I’m going to say, but I think also he enjoy a little bit his situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: Enjoys being angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: No.</span> <span id="s1644">He enjoy to be, people feel sorry for him.</span> <span id="s1645">And he likes this.</span> <span id="s1646">I think so.</span> <span id="s1647">But there is a lot of point I cannot clarify with him, because I don’t want to be pushy.</span> <span id="s1648">And he’s not going to tell me anyway, because at the same time with him, Maurice was with him.</span> <span id="s1649">And Maurice die when they were in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1650">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: Does he feel guilty about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: We cannot speak about that, so I cannot be pushy, because… The only thing I know, the only little thing, and he cannot hide this, because he said it.</span> <span id="s1653">You know, when you say something, it’s very hard to retract.</span> <span id="s1654">When they arrive in Auschwitz, I don’t remember the date, but they shave every man and woman.</span> <span id="s1655">And they put them in a big room.</span> <span id="s1656">And it was not very light, it was very dark.</span> <span id="s1657">And one moment he was walking and he turn around and he sees this guy on his back all the time.</span> <span id="s1658">And he say, “Why do you follow me all the time like this?”</span> <span id="s1659">And he said, “But I’m Maurice, I’m your brother.”</span> <span id="s1660">He didn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s1661">He was… and for me, my interpretation is, he was already gone.</span> <span id="s1662">He put a wall.</span> <span id="s1663">Not because... because the situation.</span> <span id="s1664">He said, “Okay, save your life.</span> <span id="s1665">I save mine.”</span> <span id="s1666">This is the way I felt it and this is the way I understood.</span> <span id="s1667">Maybe I’m wrong.</span> <span id="s1668">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1669">But this is the way I feel it.</span> <span id="s1670">Because in any situation if you don’t recognize your brother, your sister, your mother, it’s like what I said before.</span> <span id="s1671">Looks on the floor, “Everything here is mine, after this, I have nothing to do with it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Was it difficult for you to… you talked about how empowering it was to learn this technique of forgiveness.</span> <span id="s1673">Was it really difficult to get to that point where you’re forgiving not only people within your own life, but applying it to this larger situation of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Even… even now it’s hard.</span> <span id="s1675">It’s not… it’s not easy.</span> <span id="s1676">It’s not easy to forgive.</span> <span id="s1677">You can forgive little things.</span> <span id="s1678">But when it becomes so important, it’s not easy.</span> <span id="s1679">Because you have to visualize, and I’m good, I know how to visualize.</span> <span id="s1680">And when you see the whole picture... a month ago I read about this man in United State, who help people to die.</span> <span id="s1681">I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s1682">Cavajohn, something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Kevorkian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Kevorkian.</span> <span id="s1685">Somebody ask him, doesn’t he feel like a Nazi by doing this.</span> <span id="s1686">And I don’t judge.</span> <span id="s1687">I don’t judge him.</span> <span id="s1688">This would be another discussion.</span> <span id="s1689">But they ask him, he doesn’t feel like a Nazi?</span> <span id="s1690">And he said, “What the Nazi did to the Jewish people did help other people after the war.”</span> <span id="s1691">Meaning I don’t like what the medicine does with rats, with animal, the experience they do, because I don’t agree on this.</span> <span id="s1692">But when you judge human being to do experience like rat, there is no end.</span> <span id="s1693">I don’t know why he said this and what is the basic idea.</span> <span id="s1694">Maybe one day I am going to have the chance to speak with him.</span> <span id="s1695">But what did he mean by this?</span> <span id="s1696">In Germany, Der Spiegel did an article of a doctor, who was a doctor in the camp Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1697">He’s alive now.</span> <span id="s1698">They made an interview and they asked the question, “Do you feel guilty about what you did?”</span> <span id="s1699">Because they did horrible experience.</span> <span id="s1700">And he said, “No, I did my job.”</span> <span id="s1701">And people said, “What do you mean by your job?”</span> <span id="s1702">He said, “I was military.</span> <span id="s1703">They put me in a camp, but I save a lot of Jew.</span> <span id="s1704">I kill a lot, but I save a lot.</span> <span id="s1705">And everything we did, helped for this generation.”</span> <span id="s1706">So, the question is, is he guilty?</span> <span id="s1707">Is he not guilty?</span> <span id="s1708">He sleeps every day.</span> <span id="s1709">He doesn’t have any problem.</span> <span id="s1710">Is a normal human being able to sleep after killing healthy children, woman and man?</span> <span id="s1711">It’s a big question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Do you have any answers for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1714">Because I found out in any case, it’s very hard to put yourself in somebody else body on a case like this.</span> <span id="s1715">What would I do, if as a Jewish doctor, put him in a camp.</span> <span id="s1716">What would I do?</span> <span id="s1717">What road would I take?</span> <span id="s1718">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1719">I want to survive?</span>

id="s1724">I don’t have any idea.</span> <span id="s1725">It’s hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Do you remember when you first realized that you had a deep interest in medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: From long time, when I was nine years old, I was very interested of the… and I won’t say to save people, but just of the science of medicine, of the human being.</span> <span id="s1728">I’m, I don’t think I’m such a good man to say it was to save people.</span> <span id="s1729">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1730">But I was interested on how the body is made, why does the body react the way it is?</span> <span id="s1731">And this is why I did go to acupuncture, because acupuncture made me discover a lot of things I didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Do you remember any significant moments when you realized that?</span> <span id="s1733">Something that happened to you that made you say, “Ah, I really want to study this”?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: No, no, because I’m a bad student.</span> <span id="s1735">So every time you said the word when I was young, about studying, go to school and buy book and read book... I said, “Oh, I’m not going to do it.”</span> <span id="s1736">But I did it because I was interested on medicine.</span> <span id="s1737">But I was not interested on... my average, medical school, every school I did go was between seventy-eight and eighty.</span> <span id="s1738">I never made a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: When did you, so in the time after the war when you were in France and you were attending school again, did you have the… how long did it take before you had the idea that you wanted to become a doctor and do you remember how that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Like I said, I was nine years old when I said, I will be a doctor.</span> <span id="s1741">And all my path was on this direction.</span> <span id="s1742">But you know, when you are nine years old... I have a patient, who came, a woman, came with a little boy.</span> <span id="s1743">And very, very wealthy people.</span> <span id="s1744">It was in Paris.</span> <span id="s1745">And the boy was maybe five or six years old.</span> <span id="s1746">And I said, “What do you want to become when you are to be older?”</span> <span id="s1747">And he said, “I want to drive a garbage truck.”</span> <span id="s1748">And I said, “Why a garbage truck?”</span> <span id="s1749">And he gave me a good, very interesting explanation.</span> <span id="s1750">And much later, I found out he was driving a garbage truck.</span> <span id="s1751">He was eighteen, nineteen.</span> <span id="s1752">Sometime you don’t know what drives you, why you want to do something and this is when I say God is so strong.</span> <span id="s1753">Because sometimes God say, he wants to be a garbage driver, let it be.</span> <span id="s1754">And he open every door he can.</span> <span id="s1755">And the guy is very happy.</span> <span id="s1756">We need people drive truck, drive garbage truck.</span> <span id="s1757">We need fire people.</span> <span id="s1758">We need policemen.</span> <span id="s1759">So, why not?</span> <span id="s1760">The funny part is, every time I..</span> <span id="s1761">.</span> <span id="s1762">I used to take anybody who wants to have hypnosis, they want to know what they were in another life.</span> <span id="s1763">Because everybody think they were king, queen, princess, you know?</span> <span id="s1764">But I said to the people, “You know, there was a few King, but the majority were people working.</span> <span id="s1765">Why don’t you think you’d be a normal human body working to make a living?</span> <span id="s1766">You have more people who make eighteen, twenty thousand a year in United State than people who make a hundred fifty thousand.</span> <span id="s1767">But in another life, you want to be the one who make a hundred and fifty thousand?”</span> <span

never worry about, and even now, dying.</span> <span id="s1775">Dying for me is a normal end.</span> <span id="s1776">The same way when you believe in reincarnation, you know what is to be born

You know a lot of people come to acupuncture and said, “I hate needle.”</span> <span id="s1987">And I said, “If I tell you, you are not going to feel it.”</span> <span id="s1988">Okay, I can tell this until tomorrow and if I put in a needle and it’s painful, he’s going to say, “You lied to me.</span> <span id="s1989">It’s painful.”</span> <span id="s1990">But if the patient is on the table and I said, “Okay, I’m going to put a needle.</span> <span id="s1991">As soon as there is any pain tell me.</span> <span id="s1992">I take the needle out.</span> <span id="s1993">But the way, I put the needle and where I put the needle, you shouldn’t feel nothing.”</span> <span id="s1994">99 percent people say, “I didn’t feel it.”</span> <span id="s1995">This is one form of hypnosis: to do acupuncture.</span> <span id="s1996">“What did you do to me?”</span> <span id="s1997">Patient who come bent and they have low back pain.</span> <span id="s1998">Put them on the table, start to massage a little bit the back and speak to them, tell them about vacation.</span> <span id="s1999">What do you like, flying, thing like this.</span> <span id="s2000">I adjust them, if I didn’t speak to them, I couldn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s2001">You touch them a little bit: “Oh, it’s painful.”</span> <span id="s2002">You put a little bit under hypnosis and give an adjustment and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2003">And the patient goes away.</span> <span id="s2004">It looks simple the way I explain, but this is the way it goes.</span> <span id="s2005">It’s very simple.</span> <span id="s2006">Unless I play the doctor, “You lay down here.</span> <span id="s2007">I’m going to adjust you.</span> <span id="s2008">It’s going to be painful, but you have nothing for nothing.</span> <span id="s2009">You have to suffer.”</span> <span id="s2010">They say, “Just a minute, let me think about.”</span> <span id="s2011">It’s psychosomatic, I mean, everything is in your head.</span> <span id="s2012">“I’m going to adjust you, but I don’t know if I going to help you.”</span> <span id="s2013">“Well, so don’t touch me.</span> <span id="s2014">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2015">Leave me alone.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: You’re studying, you’re in medical school studying western medicine which has a very different approach than the one you’re describing right now.</span> <span id="s2017">Was that difficult for you?</span> <span id="s2018">That you have a very unconventional approach?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: I didn’t have any problem for one reason.</span> <span id="s2020">I know God is going to put me in the right way, when it is the time.</span> <span id="s2021">So I was not worried.</span> <span id="s2022">And this is something else very important: is not to be rush by things.</span> <span id="s2023">Everything is going to be in time.</span> <span id="s2024">When I was very young, I want it now.</span> <span id="s2025">And every time I did this, they spank me.</span> <span id="s2026">“Why did you spank me?”</span> <span id="s2027">“Because you are too nervous, take your time.</span> <span id="s2028">You’re going to get it.</span> <span id="s2029">Just a minute.</span> <span id="s2030">Don’t worry.”</span> <span id="s2031">And this was hard, but you learn.</span> <span id="s2032">It’s always the same.</span> <span id="s2033">My father used to tell a story when he was in Russia.</span> <span id="s2034">He said, a guy did have a horse and it cost him a lot of money to feed him.</span> <span id="s2035">So, little by little this farmer start to feed him less and less and less, until one day he died, the horse.</span> <span id="s2036">And the farmer said, “This is too bad.</span> <span id="s2037">Just the day he was used to not to eat, he die.”</span> <span id="s2038">And for me is the same thing.</span> <span id="s2039">When I’m going to be almost perfect, I’m going to go away.</span> <span id="s2040">Waste of time?</span> <span id="s2041">No, it’s not a waste of time, because it’s going to serve me for my next... my teacher of acupuncture in China told me, “Paul, it’s your first life as an acupuncturist.</span> <span id="s2042">You okay, but you not wonderful.</span> <span id="s2043">You need four life of acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2044">The fourth life, you’re going to be perfect.</span> <span id="s2045">And this is going to be the time, probably, you going to stay there.</span> <span id="s2046">You don’t come back.”</span> <span id="s2047">And I said, “It’s very encouraging because I have three more life to go.</span> <span id="s2048">Okay, let’s do it.”</span> <span id="s2049">[Laughing.]</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: When did you start getting interested in acupuncture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: 1965.</span> <span id="s2052">I got this book, one of the very, very interesting doctor.</span> <span id="s2053">I don’t know how you call this.</span> <span id="s2054">There is a group of Catholic doctor and I even don’t remember the name in French.</span> <span id="s2055">They are in black and white.</span> <span id="s2056">The robe is black and white.</span> <span id="s2057">This man is a very famous family.</span> <span id="s2058">And he became an M.D. and he want to learn acupuncture, but the only way to learn and write a book about acupuncture, he did have to learn Chinese.</span> <span id="s2059">So, he became an M.D. for a big family in China.</span> <span id="s2060">He learned Chinese and he learn acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2061">And I have his book with me.</span> <span id="s2062">It was five, six year before I was born.</span> <span id="s2063">Born in 1932, so it was ‘25, 1925.</span> <span id="s2064">And he did a complete study of acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2065">And I read this book three time and I said to a lot of people, if this house get in fire, the only thing I’m going to save is this book, because it’s got everything in it.</span> <span id="s2066">And I read the book and I said, “If I’m lucky maybe one day I’m going to study acupuncture.”</span> <span id="s2067">And I got a chance one day to go to Taiwan and I did go to the school.</span> <span id="s2068">I start my study, came back with all the books.</span> <span id="s2069">And since ‘65, let’s say I start to put needle in patient five year later.</span> <span id="s2070">And I still study acupuncture and I will study until the rest of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: What is it about it that interested you?</span> <span id="s2072">What did you read in that book, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: The mystery.</span> <span id="s2074">Acupuncture is very mysterious.</span> <span id="s2075">Yesterday my attorney call me for a patient of mine.</span> <span id="s2076">They don’t understand why I adjust the neck of this patient and she’s got a low back pain.</span> <span id="s2077">So, I say to my attorney, “You have two way, either you answer the way you want to this insurance company and you say what you want or you sue the company and I won’t charge you a penny to go to court.</span> <span id="s2078">Because if this people think I’m going to speak to them on the telephone and explain to them by phone why I adjust the neck to release the pain on the low back, they are dreaming.</span> <span id="s2079">I call you back in ten minute because I am with a patient.”</span> <span id="s2080">So, I hang up, call him ten, fifteen minute later and he said, “I call the insurance company, they settle.”</span> <span id="s2081">I don’t know what happen.</span> <span id="s2082">I try to get him before you arrive and he is not in his office.</span> <span id="s2083">But I will know what he said.</span> <span id="s2084">Because I said, “You have two way, but I’m not going to speak with this insurance.”</span> <span id="s2085">Sometime I’m very obnoxious... how do you call?</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Obnoxious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Obnoxious with people who don’t know nothing about medicine and challenge me.</span> <span id="s2088">If you want to challenge me in medicine, put me in front of a bunch of doctor, who are going to understand what I am talking about.</span> <span id="s2089">I can tell you anything and you’re going to say, “Oh yes, oh yes.”</span> <span id="s2090">So, you’re going to say “Well, this dummy, I don’t understand a word he is saying, but maybe he’s right.”</span> <span id="s2091">By phone?</span> <span id="s2092">Why do I adjust the neck to a low back pain?</span> <span id="s2093">An insurance company?</span> <span id="s2094">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2095">So, this is when I become obnoxious.</span> <span id="s2096">But acupuncture is very mysterious.</span> <span id="s2097">Well, it’s five thousand year old and it’s amazing.</span> <span id="s2098">I don’t know how far we can go with acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2099">But my experience was more than rewarding for me, I mean medically.</span> <span id="s2100">What I can do with acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2101">It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s2102">It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s2103">I don’t believe it myself.</span> <span id="s2104">If somebody else would tell me what I know, I would say, prove it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Tell me, give me some examples.</span> <span id="s2106">What have you been able to do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: Well, I did go this morning to put teeth and he drill.</span> <span id="s2108">And I said, “I don’t want any shot.</span> <span id="s2109">Let me put a needle, acupuncture needle in, you can do what you want.”</span> <span id="s2110">And the guy is, he teach dentistry here at UK.</span> <span id="s2111">And he say, “It’s okay with me.”</span> <span id="s2112">So, I just put two needle and I said, “Go ahead.”</span> <span id="s2113">And he said, “You’re sure?”</span> <span id="s2114">And I said, “Oh yeah.”</span> <span id="s2115">So, he drill and he said, “You’re sure you don’t feel anything?”</span> <span id="s2116">I said, “Listen, I’m human.</span> <span id="s2117">I don’t like pain and if it was painful I would have said, ‘The hell with acupuncture, give me a shot!’</span> <span id="s2118">No, I don’t feel anything.”</span> <span id="s2119">And this is the way it is.</span> <span id="s2120">I have a young lady, who came and she did have suspicious part of the breast.</span> <span id="s2121">So she said, “I would love to try…”—because she is a patient of mine of acupuncture—“You said you can anesthetize myself with acupuncture.”</span> <span id="s2122">And I said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s2123">So, we did go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2124">I prepared the whole thing the normal way and I said, “Okay, you ready?”</span> <span id="s2125">She said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s2126">So, I put needle.</span> <span id="s2127">And the surgeon came, a little bit smiling.</span> <span id="s2128">And I said, “Okay, cut.”</span> <span id="s2129">And he said, “You’re sure?”</span> <span id="s2130">And I said, “The lady agree, I agree, go ahead.”</span> <span id="s2131">He did the whole surgery under acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2132">She said, “I didn’t feel nothing.”</span> <span id="s2133">And I was looking, because I said, “My God, if she, if she start to scream, I have to put the mask, give her the gas.</span> <span id="s2134">And I’m going to put her down deep.”</span> <span id="s2135">But she didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2136">Did go to China at Christmas, this last Christmas.</span> <span id="s2137">And this guy, when I did go see my teacher, he said, “Would you like to see something interesting?”</span> <span id="s2138">I said yes.</span> <span id="s2139">He said, “I’m going to do acupuncture to an open heart surgery.”</span> <span id="s2140">And I said, “Can I come?”</span> <span id="s2141">And he said sure.</span> <span id="s2142">So, we did go.</span> <span id="s2143">Needle all over, start to see section open, bring the heart, massage.</span> <span id="s2144">The guy is covered here and the surgeon said, “You okay?”</span> <span id="s2145">He said, “Yes, I’m okay, but”—it was in Chinese, I didn’t understand—“I would like to drink something.”</span> <span id="s2146">So, they brought him a straw with orange juice and he drink and he was completely opened.</span> <span id="s2147">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2148">It’s very impressive, very, very impressive.</span> <span id="s2149">So, it’s rewarding and I like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: You said that you lecture a lot and do seminars.</span> <span id="s2151">On what subjects?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Acupuncture, but it’s very basic, because acupuncture in United State is not in a high level.</span> <span id="s2153">They, I have a lot of article from paper where they say if you have a headache, acupuncture can help you.</span> <span id="s2154">If woman have bad menstruation, acupuncture, but you know they bring it to the lower part, not very high.</span> <span id="s2155">You know, when you speak about open heart surgery, they say, “Just a minute.”</span> <span id="s2156">They don’t agree.</span> <span id="s2157">But they are interested.</span> <span id="s2158">They want to know.</span> <span id="s2159">So when, you know, every doctor have to do twelve, twenty four hour, depend on state.</span> <span id="s2160">So, they ask me to come and when I go and I give a seminar sometime one-fourth of the class go away, skiing and swimming.</span> <span id="s2161">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2162">It’s no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: I’m going to change the subject back to the time that you’re in France after the war.</span> <span id="s2164">I think you mentioned in the first interview that you were very anxious to have your mother meet the Ledermans once you were reunited with your mother.</span> <span id="s2165">And did you go back with her to see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2167">I did go back with my mother.</span> <span id="s2168">I did go back with my brother.</span> <span id="s2169">Well, I… every time I go to Europe I go to see them.</span> <span id="s2170">I just receive a letter from mine, I don’t know how you call this, godmother?</span> <span id="s2171">And from what I understand he is not in this world anymore.</span> <span id="s2172">I think my godfather die.</span> <span id="s2173">So, she is there, she must be over eighty.</span> <span id="s2174">So this, before the Christmas, this coming Christmas, I’m going to go back.</span> <span id="s2175">And I try to reach her by phone to find out how she’s doing.</span> <span id="s2176">It’s not the same address, it’s another address.</span> <span id="s2177">So, I want to find out.</span> <span id="s2178">But when I came back, I took my mother – oh very quick after the war, maybe two year after war or three year after the war.</span> <span id="s2179">Because I did want for... my mother was a very interesting person.</span> <span id="s2180">She didn’t have any, she didn’t ever study.</span> <span id="s2181">She didn’t know how to write, to read.</span> <span id="s2182">She was reading Jewish, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2183">And it took her about a week, a week and a half to read one paper in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2184">But she was very, she was very smart, not by studying, but by instinct.</span> <span id="s2185">And she… people like her.</span> <span id="s2186">The only thing I found out, is when people don’t have any background of studying to read aloud, when they get old, they lose this normal instinct of life.</span> <span id="s2187">They are confused.</span> <span id="s2188">And I did have a lot of very Ph.D. men, who got Alzheimer’s disease, so it doesn’t go with… but most of the time, these people, like my mother, like my brother, they don’t have the training of the brain to be able to hold on, on something solid.</span> <span id="s2189">It’s only by memory.</span> <span id="s2190">They don’t have any technique.</span> <span id="s2191">And the older she got, harder it was for us to discuss with her.</span> <span id="s2192">She was, imagine things, like one day she was watching TV and it was something completely normal and she got very angry.</span> <span id="s2193">And I said, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s2194">“Well, you didn’t see what they did on this TV?”</span> <span id="s2195">And then I realize, well, she didn’t understand and she got mad.</span> <span id="s2196">But otherwise, she was a very interesting person.</span> <span id="s2197">I cannot speak about my father because I was too young when he died.</span> <span id="s2198">But it, she was, she connect with my godfather when we did go see him, because my godfather was also very, very educated, a very interesting, wide idea of the world.</span> <span id="s2199">And they did have, I remember a very, very interesting conversation, in a high level, not “It’s a nice day today.</span> <span id="s2200">The food was good.”</span> <span id="s2201">It was... and mine, his wife of my godfather, she was a teacher.</span> <span id="s2202">I was in love with her, because she was, I think, the most beautiful woman in the world.</span> <span id="s2203">She was smart.</span> <span id="s2204">And I was afraid from her, because she was a teacher.</span> <span id="s2205">At my age, a teacher you don’t fool around with.</span> <span id="s2206">But I saw her later when I was a growing man and she was older and she was the most beautiful woman I had met.</span> <span id="s2207">[Laughing.]</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: When you call them your godparents, was there any formality or are you just calling them that because... was there any formal way…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: No, because I think they deserve to be called this way.</span> <span id="s2210">In French it’s parrain, and her it’s marraine.</span> <span id="s2211">In English it’s godfather.</span> <span id="s2212">And I don’t know if we have a name for a woman.</span> <span id="s2213">But every time…eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Godmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: Godmother?</span> <span id="s2216">Every time I used to write to them and even lately, I always, “Cher Parrain, cher Marraine,” because this is what they are for me.</span> <span id="s2217">They were very generous with me and I try to be as much as I can with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: Did their influence continue to be very active?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: So your relationship was... can you describe how your relationship grew after you stopped living with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: They were mine, smart parent.</span> <span id="s2222">What my father and mother couldn’t give me, because they didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s2223">My mother spoke to me.</span> <span id="s2224">She tried to be as much as she could, but they never study and they didn’t know… you know, when I said I want to become a doctor: “Why?</span> <span id="s2225">We have a good business.</span> <span id="s2226">We do upholstery.</span> <span id="s2227">You can make a good living.</span> <span id="s2228">Why would you like to be a doctor?</span> <span id="s2229">We don’t have any doctor in the family.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Did you tell the Ledermans when you wanted to become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2233">And what was their response?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">A: Oh, he was, my godfather was very, very, both of them were happy.</span> <span id="s2235">Because like I told you, I was a poor student.</span> <span id="s2236">And they said, “I don’t know if you are going to make it, but it’s an excellent idea.</span> <span id="s2237">Do it.”</span> <span id="s2238">They both were very, very, very happy.</span> <span id="s2239">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: So, did you keep in touch with them by writing letters?</span> <span id="s2241">Or did you visit them a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Both.</span> <span id="s2243">I wrote letter all the time and

I left France in 1960, 1983 to come in the United State.</span> <span id="s2244">But otherwise I was in their place anytime.</span> <span id="s2245">They, they, you know, he was a Protestant priest and after this, he likes to show people he was poor.</span> <span id="s2246">It was his way to... he was not poor, but he wants to show.</span> <span id="s2247">So, he bought a little place on the border of the lake, but on the other side to go to his house, you have to cross the railroad.</span> <span id="s2248">And I… he was very, very severe.</span> <span id="s2249">And one day, I ask him, you know, very… “Why did you buy so close to the railroad?”</span> <span id="s2250">“I’m not rich.</span> <span id="s2251">I’m poor.</span> <span id="s2252">I’m a priest.</span> <span id="s2253">I cannot afford to buy like the rich people, so thank God I can have this thing.”</span> <span id="s2254">I never ask anymore.</span> <span id="s2255">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2256">Because, he was, you know, this is what I can afford and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2257">But he was a good man, very, very good man.</span> <span id="s2258">Very, not religious like a priest, you know, not the man… one day I did go to, you know the Club Med?</span> <span id="s2259">It was my last year in medicine and they ask for a good swimmer to teach water ski and I was good on water ski, so I put my name and I been to Greece to teach in Club Med for two month, for the summer.</span> <span id="s2260">It was beautiful, because it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">End of Tape 4, Side A Tape 4, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: This is tape four, side B.

I’m not good in math.</span> <span id="s2289">But it was later, I mean like I said after the war I was thirteen.</span> <span id="s2290">So, let’s say ten years later I met this lady and we got married.</span> <span id="s2291">I met, she was an artist, painter and medical school was next to, and the cafeteria was together.</span> <span id="s2292">And that’s where I met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Did she, was there, did she understand your history as a Jew and as a Jew who had more or less had gone through the Holocaust and what you’d experienced with losing your family?</span> <span id="s2294">Was that an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: No.</span> <span id="s2296">No, she, it was a very, how can I say?</span> <span id="s2297">Very Catholic family.</span> <span id="s2298">And everything was going fine, everything was okay, until one day in Paris... we used to live a little bit outside of Paris, like you would say in Nicholasville, compared to Lexington.</span> <span id="s2299">And one day it was a strike, no car, I mean, no bus, no train, nothing.</span> <span id="s2300">And my brother-in-law, who was my age, studying to become an architect, did have a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s2301">He said, “If you want I can take you to the school, to the medical school.”</span> <span id="s2302">And his school was very close, too.</span> <span id="s2303">“You can ride on the back of the motorcycle.”</span> <span id="s2304">And I said okay.</span> <span id="s2305">And we rode there and coming to a fire place, you know, the red light?</span> <span id="s2306">The red light didn’t work.</span> <span id="s2307">He didn’t see the car and this car hit us and I flew over and fell down, but I didn’t get anything serious.</span> <span id="s2308">He did hit the car directly and he broke all his mouth, his right knee.</span> <span id="s2309">Bad accident.</span> <span id="s2310">Bad, bad accident.</span> <span id="s2311">They took us to the hospital and even to this day, my daughter told me this yesterday, they going to do surgery on his hip.</span> <span id="s2312">But he did have bad, he lost all his teeth.</span> <span id="s2313">He was stitched all over.</span> <span id="s2314">He stopped studying architecture.</span> <span id="s2315">With the money he touch from the insurance, he bought a moulin……</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: Like a windmill?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Windmill!</span> <span id="s2318">He bought a windmill outside of Paris, about two hundred miles from Paris.</span> <span id="s2319">And he became a farmer with his mother, his father.</span> <span id="s2320">The whole family moved there.</span> <span id="s2321">But his mother never forgave me to be in the motorcycle, because she said, if I wouldn’t be in the motorcycle, he wouldn’t be so badly injured.</span> <span id="s2322">So, since this accident, there was a bad tension between us, between the family and me.</span> <span id="s2323">Did it bring to the divorce?</span> <span id="s2324">Maybe yes, maybe no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2325">But life became much more difficult, more and more.</span> <span id="s2326">And even my brother-in-law used to get mad at his mother every time she bring up this.</span> <span id="s2327">Because every time he never complained.</span> <span id="s2328">Ever.</span> <span id="s2329">And sometime he was in bad shape.</span> <span id="s2330">But his mother said, “Yes, if you didn’t have this accident.”</span> <span id="s2331">And he say, “Please you stop.”</span> <span id="s2332">And he always defend me all the time, but she was, she was mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Do you feel that, that was really the reason... I mean, was she looking for an excuse to be angry at you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2335">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2336">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2337">Very hard to know what’s going on, on the head of somebody else.</span> <span id="s2338">And we never got the chance to discuss.</span> <span id="s2339">She didn’t want to discuss.</span> <span id="s2340">There was no possibility.</span> <span id="s2341">The father, he was a bird.</span> <span id="s2342">He was not on this earth.</span> <span id="s2343">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2344">He was good man, but out.</span> <span id="s2345">So, he never want to discuss about this.</span> <span id="s2346">He didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s2347">He didn’t want to know about anything.</span> <span id="s2348">And like I said, my brother-in-law didn’t, never ever, ever said anything.</span> <span id="s2349">Even when I was divorced, he always ask about me, what am I doing and everything is okay.</span> <span id="s2350">But the mother was mean.</span> <span id="s2351">She was mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: What about you being Jewish and marrying into a Catholic family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">A: We never spoke about.</span> <span id="s2354">We never... my daughter is born.</span> <span id="s2355">And we decide not to give her any religion.</span> <span id="s2356">When she grew up, she met a man, got married.</span> <span id="s2357">He was Catholic.</span> <span id="s2358">She became Catholic.</span> <span id="s2359">And… but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2360">I don’t know if the religion was involved or not.</span> <span id="s2361">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">Q: Did you, you had talked about feeling anti-Semitism when you were living in France.</span> <span id="s2363">Did you have any concern about that among your wife’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: You know, you married somebody, you don’t marry the family.</span> <span id="s2365">For me, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2366">I was happy with her.</span> <span id="s2367">I don’t have to love the mother, the father and the whole family.</span> <span id="s2368">I don’t know if it was against Jew or really I don’t have no idea.</span> <span id="s2369">No idea.</span> <span id="s2370">Never asked the question.</span> <span id="s2371">The feeling between my mother and them... I think they saw each other for my wedding and that’s all.</span> <span id="s2372">They never spoke together.</span> <span id="s2373">They never got together.</span> <span id="s2374">It’s very difficult to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: What about anti-Semitism on other fronts in France after the war?</span> <span id="s2376">Did you experience any overt anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s2378">This is… even today, you can take the subway and on the subway in Paris, you can see “Jew go Home” or “Jew go to Israel” on the subway.</span> <span id="s2379">It means, you know, it’s like do we have anti-Semitism in United State?</span> <span id="s2380">Yes.</span> <span id="s2381">Why, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s2382">But one day I spoke with a woman from Lexington, she’s a doctor.</span> <span id="s2383">And she does acupuncture and she one day asked me if she can come and watch me.</span> <span id="s2384">And we start to speak about things, I don’t remember exactly what it was and she said, “Oh, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s2385">The Jew, they have all the money.</span> <span id="s2386">They have all the bank.</span> <span id="s2387">Don’t ever trust a Jew.”</span> <span id="s2388">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2389">I didn’t know what to say.</span> <span id="s2390">And I said, “I have to tell you just now, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s2391">And why do you...” and she said, “Oh, because maybe you are not like this, but the Jew have all the bank.</span> <span id="s2392">They got all the money in this country.</span> <span id="s2393">They are politician.</span> <span id="s2394">They going to ruin the whole United State.”</span> <span id="s2395">And I said, “Well, if you feel this way, I think this meeting is going to be the last one.”</span> <span id="s2396">And it was the last one.</span> <span id="s2397">But, you know, when somebody is... at this point I know I’m going to be with an enemy all the time.</span> <span id="s2398">So tell me who is my friend, I will find my enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">Q: And you mentioned in the last interview that you didn’t really feel comfortable in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">A: No.</span> <span id="s2401">I don’t feel comfortable anyplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: That’s what I was going to ask you, whether the United States is more comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: No.</span> <span id="s2404">United State is a nice place to live.</span> <span id="s2405">It is much simpler than France.</span> <span id="s2406">You can be independent, more than in France.</span> <span id="s2407">You can have, they don’t look at you like in France.</span> <span id="s2408">They spy the same way in United State, but it’s a different way.</span> <span id="s2409">It’s much easier.</span> <span id="s2410">In France, they spy on you much more.</span> <span id="s2411">And they don’t have the law you have in United State.</span> <span id="s2412">You know, the Constitution here, it’s very well made.</span> <span id="s2413">Freedom of Speech is very important.</span> <span id="s2414">We don’t have freedom.</span> <span id="s2415">United State is a Democracy.</span> <span id="s2416">France is a Republic.</span> <span id="s2417">And it can take hour for me to explain to you, but I think you know the difference between Democracy and Republic.</span> <span id="s2418">And here you can live... I was surprised how many people was killed in United State by crime last year.</span> <span id="s2419">Twenty-five thousand people die.</span> <span id="s2420">It’s a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2421">We don’t have so many dead in France by crime because we don’t have this access of gun and all this.</span> <span id="s2422">But there is no safe place on Earth.</span> <span id="s2423">And America is one of the most happy place you can be.</span> <span id="s2424">You can live a normal life, almost.</span> <span id="s2425">You can buy a car when you want.</span> <span id="s2426">If you are courageous and work hard, you can make money, enjoy yourself.</span> <span id="s2427">But the limit is very short in United State.</span> <span id="s2428">And what is the limit?</span> <span id="s2429">My idea of limit is six hundred thousand dollar.</span> <span id="s2430">Not everybody can save six hundred thousand dollar, but after six hundred thousand dollar—and if you want, one day I’m going to explain this to you—everything, if you die or your husband die and leave you a million dollar, you’re going to get six hundred thousand dollar.</span> <span id="s2431">The rest goes to the government, no matter how you go.</span> <span id="s2432">They... the IRS law are very, very well made.</span> <span id="s2433">They give you this, they take this.</span> <span id="s2434">They get you anyway.</span> <span id="s2435">So if you have a little bit, if you are low profile, United State is perfect.</span> <span id="s2436">I am a low profile doctor and it’s okay.</span> <span id="s2437">I like this life.</span> <span id="s2438">I don’t have any problem.</span> <span id="s2439">But people who become rich, they do, they can, but they have to know how to do it.</span> <span id="s2440">I wouldn’t like to be rich in the United State.</span> <span id="s2441">[Laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Because you don’t support the way that the government spends the money that you have to pay them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: What are your political outlooks, affiliations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: I don’t have any political idea, because for the simple reason, anybody who wants to go, want to be a politician has to put money in his pocket.</span> <span id="s2446">Because people are stupid.</span> <span id="s2447">If people would be intelligent, they wouldn’t vote.</span> <span id="s2448">Neither for Clinton, neither for Bush, Democrat, Republican, not vote.</span> <span id="s2449">We don’t want you.</span> <span id="s2450">I would vote for Perot, just to see what he can do.</span> <span id="s2451">But he doesn’t play the game.</span> <span id="s2452">Perot is a smart man, but he doesn’t play the game, so no there.</span> <span id="s2453">It’s not a dream.</span> <span id="s2454">But let’s say maybe this movie actor, what’s his name?</span> <span id="s2455">Is going to present himself to become the President of the United State.</span> <span id="s2456">Warren Beatty?</span> <span id="s2457">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: I didn’t realize…</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2460">He present, maybe he’s going to present himself.</span> <span id="s2461">But otherwise... what Clinton did is a shame for the country.</span> <span id="s2462">I don’t think he deserve to be called President of United State.</span> <span id="s2463">He is a..</span> <span id="s2464">.</span> <span id="s2465">but Bush was not better.</span> <span id="s2466">“Read my lips, no more income tax,” I mean, and look what he did.</span> <span id="s2467">And the people go, they’re going to vote for his son, or they’re going to vote for another jerk, moron, who is going to be the President.</span> <span id="s2468">The people need to be whacked in the head.</span> <span id="s2469">And it’s okay.</span> <span id="s2470">I don’t belong to the people.</span> <span id="s2471">I’m not a politician.</span> <span id="s2472">So I enjoy myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">Q: So you don’t vote?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: Yes I vote.</span> <span id="s2475">Yeah, I vote because I think it’s a duty.</span> <span id="s2476">I vote, but just because I have to.</span> <span id="s2477">[Laughing.]</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: So you’re a..</span> <span id="s2479">.</span> <span id="s2480">when did you become a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: Oh, in 1983… ‘93.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: Was that a significant event for you to become a citizen of this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: No.</span> <span id="s2484">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s2485">No, no it’s not.</span> <span id="s2486">I think more about myself as a citizen of the world, more than a citizen of a country.</span> <span id="s2487">It doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s2488">I’m an American.</span> <span id="s2489">I’m a Spanish.</span> <span id="s2490">I’m an Italian.</span> <span id="s2491">I’m a French.</span> <span id="s2492">What does it mean?</span> <span id="s2493">I’m human.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">Q: Why did you decide to come to the United States in 1983?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: Well, number one is because I was a little bit tired about what I was feeling in France.</span> <span id="s2496">And it was time for me to change and this was some feeling.</span> <span id="s2497">I have feeling sometime and this was the time for me to go away.</span> <span id="s2498">Even I did have a very good practice in France, everything was going fine, but [clears throat]—excuse me—it was time for me to do something else.</span> <span id="s2499">And since before I left United State in 1962, I took the State Board of Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2500">I came back in Kentucky to establish... and I didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s2501">I choose Lexington because it was a challenge.</span> <span id="s2502">And I decide to open an office here and later maybe go to another state.</span> <span id="s2503">Because when you come back in United State with a license, you have to stay at least three year in the state, before you can move to another one.</span> <span id="s2504">I tried to have the equivalence of my medical license here and I found out Kentucky is one of the most difficult state to have a reciprocity of the diploma.</span> <span id="s2505">So, I decide I’m going to have mine, I did have mine license for Chiropractic, so I took my chiropractic license, renew it, and I stay here.</span> <span id="s2506">And since 1983, I did have three different office, one in Versailles Road, the another one in North Broadway for at least fourteen year and now in Palomar.</span> <span id="s2507">And it was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s2508">I like the state.</span> <span id="s2509">I like the weather.</span> <span id="s2510">A little bit cold in the winter time, but… I like horses, so I’m very happy when I can drive in the country and see all the horses.</span> <span id="s2511">I have a lot of friend who have horses.</span> <span id="s2512">I ride a lot of horses.</span> <span id="s2513">And I travel a lot.</span> <span id="s2514">I give a lot of seminar in United State and in Europe.</span> <span id="s2515">I go to China once every five year to re-educate mine acupuncture.</span> <span id="s2516">And life is great here.</span> <span id="s2517">Right now I have a project.</span> <span id="s2518">I don’t know if I’m going to do it.</span> <span id="s2519">But either I’m going to move to the Caribbean in an island where there is already a chiropractor.</span> <span id="s2520">And I’m going to go see him probably at the end of this month, September, 1999.</span> <span id="s2521">Or if I don’t like what I see there, I probably going to buy a farm in Woodford County around Versailles, like we say here.</span> <span id="s2522">And have a farm with horses and my practice at the same time until I die.</span> <span id="s2523">So, this is going to be my project until the end of 1999.</span> <span id="s2524">Thinking about what, I don’t know if it is going to be different in the year two thousand.</span> <span id="s2525">Everybody think about something different.</span> <span id="s2526">I don’t think nothing is going to happen, but anyway it doesn’t make any difference for me.</span> <span id="s2527">And this is my project.</span> <span id="s2528">I was very happy for my move to come here.</span> <span id="s2529">It’s different.</span> <span id="s2530">It’s very, even up to this day since 1983 I’m back in United State, even up to this day it is very hard for me to adapt to the American life, but it’s not too bad.</span> <span id="s2531">And I’ll survive.</span> <span id="s2532">And we’ll see what my project are going to give me and what am I going to do.</span> <span id="s2533">But it’s going to be a surprise for myself and for my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">Q: What’s hard to adapt to about American life?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">A: It is completely different.</span> <span id="s2536">Life here is different.</span> <span id="s2537">People live differently, they got different priority.</span> <span id="s2538">I could say the same thing about France.</span> <span id="s2539">They in France, they live different.</span> <span id="s2540">They have different personality.</span> <span id="s2541">Here, we don’t eat, we nourish ourselves.</span> <span id="s2542">In France a meal is like a big festivity.</span> <span id="s2543">We take our time.</span> <span id="s2544">Relation between male and female in France is much more romantic.</span> <span id="s2545">It is much more something sensitive, sensual.</span> <span id="s2546">Here it’s much more difficult, woman wants to be man.</span> <span id="s2547">Sometimes man become woman.</span> <span id="s2548">It is, it would take a whole book to explain the difference between France and United State.</span> <span id="s2549">But when you want, you adapt.</span> <span id="s2550">And I go back to France at least once or twice a year.</span> <span id="s2551">Every time I go, I enjoy.</span> <span id="s2552">I have a good time.</span> <span id="s2553">I read almost everything in French, because since I left France, I think poetry in France is beautiful.</span> <span id="s2554">And there is no problem, you always survive.</span> <span id="s2555">You adapt and you survive.</span> <span id="s2556">You don’t have always exactly what you want, but where do we have what we want?</span> <span id="s2557">It’s another world and it’s for me like another life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">Q: Why Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">A: Well, because when I left, I took my license in 1962.</span> <span id="s2560">I took the first license open and it was Kentucky.</span> <span id="s2561">So, I took my license and I didn’t even wait for the results.</span> <span id="s2562">Did go back home, open my office.</span> <span id="s2563">And I receive my license from Kentucky and this is why I came back here.</span> <span id="s2564">And when I came back here, I thought maybe I’m going to go to another state, but after a while I said, where can I go?</span> <span id="s2565">It’s nothing worse here or better than any other place.</span> <span id="s2566">I’m not a California man.</span> <span id="s2567">I’m not a Florida man.</span> <span id="s2568">So, it’s pretty good here.</span> <span id="s2569">So, I think this is where I am going to stay, if I don’t go to an island.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Did you know anything about Kentucky before you made the move?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: No.</span> <span id="s2572">No.</span> <span id="s2573">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2574">No.</span> <span id="s2575">I knew there was a lot of horses, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2576">But otherwise it took me a long time to understand the way they speak English, but now I think I’m used to.</span> <span id="s2577">A lot of people even now don’t understand me, but it doesn’t matter because they adopt me.</span> <span id="s2578">I like them, they like me and we don’t have any problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">Q: You didn’t have any stereotypes of what Kentucky was or what the South was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">A: No, I was surprised at the beginning a lot of times, because I didn’t know people still using chewing tobacco.</span> <span id="s2581">And I didn’t know... well, when I was in New York on my way to come here, a friend of mine said, “If you go to Kentucky, they are fifty years behind every other state.”</span> <span id="s2582">I didn’t believe it, but there was a little bit truth of what they say.</span> <span id="s2583">But didn’t bother me, no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: Are you involved in the community in Lexington in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: No, no, I don’t like to be involved in groups.</span> <span id="s2586">I’m not a politician.</span> <span id="s2587">I’m not a religious man.</span> <span id="s2588">So, I look, if it was something I can do or something I can help, I probably would do, but I stay put.</span> <span id="s2589">I stay on my backyard.</span> <span id="s2590">I don’t want to be too much involved with all those things, so.</span> <span id="s2591">I’m in the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">Q: Do you have Jewish friends in Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: Yes, I have a few Jewish friend, but like I always said, they are American Jew and they don’t know exactly what it is to be a European Jew, so we have a lot of difference.</span> <span id="s2594">The main thing is, Jewish in Europe help themselves with other Jew, around here to be Jew for another Jew doesn’t mean nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">Q: Do you feel that your experiences as a Holocaust survivor set you apart in some way from the Jewish community here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">A: You mean?</span> <span id="s2597">I don’t quite understand what…</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: The fact of your association with the Holocaust and your immediate experience, losing family members and so forth, gives you a very different personal history than American Jews, in the sense of the fact that you’ve seen this incredible tragedy close up and felt the effects very directly on your life.</span> <span id="s2599">I’m wondering whether, whether that has been a wall between you and Jews here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">A: Yes, let’s put it this way, they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s2601">They know what happened in Europe.</span> <span id="s2602">They are interested for six minute, that’s all, all the rest, it goes above the head.</span> <span id="s2603">They don’t feel like really they are concerned.</span> <span id="s2604">Even if it looks like, but they are, you know: “It’s just, it happened.</span> <span id="s2605">We hope it’s never going to happen again.</span> <span id="s2606">Only if they start to touch Jewish people in United State, this is another story, but otherwise, we send—this is what they say—we send money to Israel, we help them.</span> <span id="s2607">We have a clean conscience.</span> <span id="s2608">We are good Jew.”</span> <span id="s2609">End of Tape 4, Side B Tape 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Paul Pressman.</span> <span id="s2611">Do you feel that the Jews here in Lexington that you’ve come into contact with are naïve?</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Not only the Jew from Lexington, everywhere I did go... my name in France is unique, because there is no other Pressman.</span> <span id="s2613">But every time I go in places like San Francisco, any place, I look in the telephone book to see there is Pressman and I found a few.</span> <span id="s2614">I call them and there is no, no feeling.</span> <span id="s2615">I don’t... you know, they say, “Oh yeah, your name is Pressman, oh yeah, interesting.</span> <span id="s2616">Where were you?</span> <span id="s2617">From where are you, you have an accent?”</span> <span id="s2618">But we don’t feel like... for example, let’s say somebody, many time people came in my office in Paris saying “I’m Jewish, I come from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s2619">I’m passing through here and I’m going to try to go to United State or Spain or place.”</span> <span id="s2620">“Okay, where do you sleep tonight?”</span> <span id="s2621">“Well, I don’t have any place.”</span> <span id="s2622">“You come and you sleep at my place and you’re going to eat with me and I’m going to call a few...” And I try to put some money together and give it to this guy, so he can fulfill... when I came here the first time, I did go to a Jewish association, I don’t remember the name, to introduce myself.</span> <span id="s2623">And say, “My name is Paul Pressman, I’m a medical doctor and I’m going to open an office.”</span> <span id="s2624">They lady look at me and she said, “I’m sorry, we don’t have money to give to you.”</span> <span id="s2625">And I say, “Lady I didn’t come to ask money, I just came to introduce myself.”</span> <span id="s2626">I left and never, never saw those people again.</span> <span id="s2627">They send me paper and they wrote me letter.</span> <span id="s2628">I said, “If this is the way you welcome people in your congregation, the hell with you.</span> <span id="s2629">Stay where you are and I stay off.”</span> <span id="s2630">This is why since the beginning I didn’t join anybody.</span> <span id="s2631">I didn’t speak with anybody and I stay in my corner.</span> <span id="s2632">A lot of patient, Jewish patients, said “Oh, you should come.”</span> <span id="s2633">I said, “You go and you leave me alone.</span> <span id="s2634">I don’t want to belong.”</span> <span id="s2635">One day the Rabbi came here and he spoke to me and he said, “As a Jewish man you should at least belong to the synagogue.”</span> <span id="s2636">And I said, “You belong to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2637">You leave me alone.</span> <span id="s2638">I don’t want to see you anymore in my office.</span> <span id="s2639">If you need me, if you have a health problem, I will take care of you, otherwise forget me.”</span> <span id="s2640">I didn’t like the attitude.</span> <span id="s2641">I didn’t like the way they been treating people.</span> <span id="s2642">And now suddenly, they take Jewish people from Russia and they give them home.</span> <span id="s2643">Who do they think they show this?</span> <span id="s2644">For what?</span> <span id="s2645">No, it’s... for me, there are two kind of bad Jew in this world, the German Jew and the American Jew.</span> <span id="s2646">I don’t have any respect for the German.</span> <span id="s2647">We call them the Yecket (ph).</span> <span id="s2648">And what we call the Jew here, speaking about the woman, American Jew, the JAP, the Jewish American Princess.</span> <span id="s2649">I don’t want to have nothing to do with them.</span> <span id="s2650">They can live their life, but I’m Jewish by tradition.</span> <span id="s2651">I don’t go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2652">And they go to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2653">They do the Bar Mitzvah for the kids, but it’s not my kind.</span> <span id="s2654">So, I stay away from these people.</span> <span id="s2655">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: How do you feel as a Jew living in Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: I don’t have any problem.</span> <span id="s2658">I don’t have any problem.</span> <span id="s2659">When people ask me what kind of religion I am, I say “I’m born Jew” and there is no problem.</span> <span id="s2660">There is no, “Ah, you’re Jewish.”</span> <span id="s2661">No, no.</span> <span id="s2662">They don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2663">We have to remember United State is based on the free willing of religion.</span> <span id="s2664">Anybody can be what they want.</span> <span id="s2665">So, you have, I think, about two hundred different Christian religion.</span> <span id="s2666">Everything goes okay, is no problem.</span> <span id="s2667">If there is no problem with them, it’s no problem with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: Do you consider yourself a Holocaust survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Oh yes, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s2670">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2671">I don’t, without being sent to Auschwitz, I’m the closest one to suffer and been suffering because of the Nazi and because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2672">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2673">Q: And is that an important part of your identity as far as, I mean when you get to know people for example, is it important for them to know that you are a Holocaust survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2675">This is something who comes if they are interested, we can speak about it.</span> <span id="s2676">But no, this is mine, this is my life.</span> <span id="s2677">I didn’t choose it.</span> <span id="s2678">This is the way it is and I’m not ashamed of it.</span> <span id="s2679">I’m not proud of it.</span> <span id="s2680">This is the way it is.</span> <span id="s2681">They say Jewish people are the chosen people from God.</span> <span id="s2682">We pay the price.</span> <span id="s2683">But it’s okay.</span> <span id="s2684">If in the next life, we’re going to have another religion, maybe we going to be able to breathe a little bit and look on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">Q: Do you, have you ever thought about... the public consciousness of the Holocaust has changed a lot in recent years.</span> <span id="s2686">People have become much more aware of Holocaust history and much more interested in it, it seems, on a popular culture level, a lot of books, films and so forth.</span> <span id="s2687">Have you been interested at all in speaking publicly about those experiences that you’ve had?</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: No, because my, the way they do it now, is became movies, to make movies.</span> <span id="s2689">It’s always very hard to make a good movie.</span> <span id="s2690">This is a good subject.</span> <span id="s2691">Books, the writer will write about another writer, who wrote something about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2692">It becomes diluted.</span> <span id="s2693">And I think... men like my brother, for example, who survive Holocaust, doesn’t want to speak in public, because they wouldn’t understand what he’s got to say.</span> <span id="s2694">I mean, they wouldn’t... they say, that’s impossible, you tell us a story.</span> <span id="s2695">Story he told me, I know it’s true, because he wouldn’t lie to me.</span> <span id="s2696">And he’s not a liar.</span> <span id="s2697">But I can put myself in the shoes of somebody who never heard about Holocaust, listen to what he’s got to say.</span> <span id="s2698">It doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s2699">It is the truth, but it doesn’t make sense.</span> <span id="s2700">This didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2701">It can’t be done.</span> <span id="s2702">So, right now, sure, more we do about the Holocaust Museum, the best it is because it helps for people not to forget.</span> <span id="s2703">But it’s the basic.</span> <span id="s2704">Unless somebody is really interested on what happen and I mean Jewish people who are interested, they can find this someplace.</span> <span id="s2705">But in public, you know... my brother did go to Germany in a school to speak about Holocaust and half of the class didn’t know what was Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2706">“What do you mean by Holocaust?</span> <span id="s2707">What is it?</span> <span id="s2708">A fruit?</span> <span id="s2709">A piece of bread?</span> <span id="s2710">What is Holocaust?”</span> <span id="s2711">So.</span> <span id="s2712">You know you speak in front of people about something they don’t understand.</span> <span id="s2713">They don’t have a clue of what you talking about.</span> <span id="s2714">They say, “What is he talking about?</span> <span id="s2715">Did he make a movie?”</span> <span id="s2716">Schindler List was something close to the Holocaust and it make sense.</span> <span id="s2717">It was human.</span> <span id="s2718">Auschwitz is unhuman.</span> <span id="s2719">You tell things about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2720">It is not real.</span> <span id="s2721">It’s a bad dream.</span> <span id="s2722">And you have people listen to... “This guy is nuts.</span> <span id="s2723">He doesn’t know what he is talking about.”</span> <span id="s2724">But this happen.</span> <span id="s2725">So, right now, I don’t think it’s a good, I mean the best thing is to have museum and encourage people... my attorney here sent his son—he’s Jewish—he sent his son at Washington.</span> <span id="s2726">And when he came back, he didn’t speak for one week.</span> <span id="s2727">And the father said, “What’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s2728">He said, “I was shocked.</span> <span id="s2729">What they did to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2730">I was shocked from what I saw.”</span> <span id="s2731">So, I think the most important is to send people there, children, the new generation, for them to see what happened.</span> <span id="s2732">When I did go to Auschwitz, full bus of school kids used to come in Auschwitz to see the crematorium where all the Jewish die.</span> <span id="s2733">And I think this is wonderful, because we should never forget what happened.</span> <span id="s2734">But speaking in the public and explaining things, it’s not enough.</span> <span id="s2735">You have to visualize.</span> <span id="s2736">You have to see things.</span> <span id="s2737">This is why the Museum is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">Q: When did you go to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: Two years ago in March.</span> <span id="s2740">At the anniversary of the death of my other brother.</span> <span id="s2741">I did go with my brother because he show me every place he been.</span> <span id="s2742">Where were the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2743">Where was the, the hospital, or things like this.</span> <span id="s2744">It was, it was very, very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Can you talk more about what that whole trip was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: Well, we left from Paris to Warsaw and Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2747">It was very short, because it’s very close to Paris.</span> <span id="s2748">And we stay in a crummy hotel, because this was the only hotel in Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s2749">We did, uh, Auschwitz is a military camp, military place.</span> <span id="s2750">This is where there all the glasses from the Jewish people who die.</span> <span id="s2751">The clothes, the hair, the shoes, the denture.</span> <span id="s2752">And you see all this exposed behind glass.</span> <span id="s2753">And after this you go in the barrack and wood where they live.</span> <span id="s2754">And I think it is very impressive and it is real.</span> <span id="s2755">The only thing my brother was surprised when we did go the first time and he said, “Something is different.”</span> <span id="s2756">The barrack is the same, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2757">The grass, it was grass, high grass.</span> <span id="s2758">By the time people were there, you didn’t have any grass.</span> <span id="s2759">Why?</span> <span id="s2760">Because they eat the grass.</span> <span id="s2761">So, the little piece of grass on the ground was eat, it was food.</span> <span id="s2762">This is why it was different.</span> <span id="s2763">But otherwise, the whole thing, the concentration camp, I mean the crematorium, everything was... there is a little lake in the middle of the camp, not very big, where they put all the ashes of the dead people.</span> <span id="s2764">Below forty degree in winter time, this lake never froze, because of the grease of the human body.</span> <span id="s2765">And a lot of things like this.</span> <span id="s2766">It is, I think, a place to see.</span> <span id="s2767">I think if I was an American Jew, this is the first place I want to go.</span> <span id="s2768">I want to see what happened.</span> <span id="s2769">But when you say this to Jewish people, they say “I have better place to go.”</span> <span id="s2770">I say, “Good for you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: Was it an important trip for you and your brother to make together?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2773">It was very important to be together.</span> <span id="s2774">For me to see where he was, where did he sleep, how did he live?</span> <span id="s2775">What was the... everything is dead anymore.</span> <span id="s2776">I have a lot of feeling when I go some place.</span> <span id="s2777">There was no feeling, everything is gone.</span> <span id="s2778">The only thing stay is the wall, the cabin, the wood barrack, but everything is gone.</span> <span id="s2779">The spirit is gone.</span> <span id="s2780">But it’s very impressive.</span> <span id="s2781">This is where you see the railroad train would arrive and it stop right there.</span> <span id="s2782">All the Jewish people did go down, the ones going to go to the gas chamber on this right, the one who is going to live a little bit, on the left.</span> <span id="s2783">And, I mean, this is something you have to see.</span> <span id="s2784">And I have to say, I’m very thankful to the Polish government, who are the most anti-Semitic people in this earth, to maintain the camp the way it is.</span> <span id="s2785">It’s very, very important to keep it the way it is, because, like I said, most… a lot of people have to see this.</span> <span id="s2786">But they do a good job.</span> <span id="s2787">And it’s free, the entrance is free.</span> <span id="s2788">And everything is kept the way it was.</span> <span id="s2789">And it’s something to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">Q: Do you have anything else that you’d like to say or to talk about today?</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">A: No, I think we cover most of the path.</span> <span id="s2792">If you think about something later and you want for us to meet again, it will be no problem.</span> <span id="s2793">But I think now, we saw the overall picture and now it’s going to be your job to put this together.</span> <span id="s2794">And it was a very nice interview and I was very happy to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: Well, thank you very much, I was happy, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Conclusion of Interview The “J” is probably a misstated “G”.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 PAGE 16</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">PAGE 16</span></p></body></html>
