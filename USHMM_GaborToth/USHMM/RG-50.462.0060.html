<p><span id="s2">MS: This is a lecture, rather I should say, this is an interview with Leigh Fraser, taken at her home in Ambler, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s3">This is tape one, side one.</span> <span id="s4">The interviewer is Marian Salkin.</span> <span id="s5">Leigh, would you be kind enough to tell us a little bit about your childhood, your life in England, a little bit about your family background, and since it's a very interesting story I know it's going to take us a bit of time.</span> <span id="s6">So, let's put as much into it as we possibly can.</span> <span id="s7">And I know it's going to be of great interest to all of us in the Archive and to students who would be looking at this as well.</span> <span id="s8">And my, so my first question, as I say, is would you please just tell us a little bit about yourself, your family, and your experiences as a youngster in England growing up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">LF: Thank you, Marian.</span> <span id="s10">It's going to be my privilege.</span> <span id="s11">I was a very lucky youngster.</span> <span id="s12">I was born into a very interesting family.</span> <span id="s13">My father was a Royal Navy Officer.</span> <span id="s14">He was a Captain when I was born.</span> <span id="s15">And he made Admiral shortly after.</span> <span id="s16">My childhood was spent in Shanghai, China, and then in Hong Kong, and then in Bombay, India, and in various other places in the Middle East.</span> <span id="s17">I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself because there are some interesting other people in the family.</span> <span id="s18">My mother was a Russian Czarist refugee, and my grandfather was a--her father was a Russian Army General, who was the offspring, the left- hand side of the blanket offspring if you will, of one of the Russian Grand Dukes.</span> <span id="s19">He used the name Romanov, which he would have been entitled to, had he been born legitimately.</span> <span id="s20">My father's, my grandfather's mother was a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s21">She was the daughter of a banker in St. Petersburg.</span> <span id="s22">And my grandfather's father went there to borrow money.</span> <span id="s23">Many of the Russian nobles were so frequently in debt.</span> <span id="s24">He sort of fell in love, from what I gather, with this young lady.</span> <span id="s25">And my grandfather was the result of the liaison.</span> <span id="s26">The family, to the horror of a lot of the Jewish community, so I'm told, struck a bargain that Grand Duke Sergei would, in fact, protect the family.</span> <span id="s27">There was conscription into the Czarist Army for young Jewish boys at the time, which was almost certainly death.</span> <span id="s28">So, Sergei being a man of a little bit more vision, if not very well-trained financially, agreed that he would keep these boys out of the army.</span> <span id="s29">And it was a good bargain all the way around, because he was not only good to the young lady with whom he formed a liaison, he was also good to my grandfather.</span> <span id="s30">He allowed him to visit with his mother, to remain with his mother actually until he was 11.</span> <span id="s31">And then he removed him to complete his education.</span> <span id="s32">The grandfather was going home to his mother regularly for vacations, and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s33">He was not allowed to be circumcised, as a Jewish boy would have been, because his father said, "What was the point in doing that?"</span> <span id="s34">When he was trying to save other boys, what was the point in exposing him?</span> <span id="s35">Because the first order, crude as it may sound, was, "Drop your pants."</span></p> <p><span id="s36">MS: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">LF: So, there is the story of grandfather.</span> <span id="s38">As a result of his experiences growing up and what he saw, and of course he saw Czar Alexander's pogroms, with which he did not agree, and which he fought mightily to keep his men away from, because he did not want to lead men into a Jewish settlement.</span> <span id="s39">His feeling was that it was a terrible thing to do, and he managed to get people sick and have outbreaks of all sorts of things, and never, according to him, took part in a pogrom.</span> <span id="s40">He was a great all-around person.</span> <span id="s41">He was intelligent.</span> <span id="s42">He was a linguist.</span> <span id="s43">He was a good army officer.</span> <span id="s44">And when I was a youngster, he was both my playmate and my mentor.</span> <span id="s45">And this, of course, was in the days before television, and there was no European radio to be had in China.</span> <span id="s46">So it was really important to have someone who could share things.</span> <span id="s47">And Chinese servants were very nice to us, but they certainly weren't very well-informed about anything.</span> <span id="s48">So I had a rather unusual upbringing with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">MS: Could you just to go back a little way, do you know the name of the Jewish family that your great-grandmother came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">LF: He never told me.</span> <span id="s51">He continued to protect them in that regard.</span> <span id="s52">I only know that his mother's name was Rosa.</span> <span id="s53">And he would not tell me any more about the family at all.</span> <span id="s54">She was dead.</span> <span id="s55">The rest of them were dead.</span> <span id="s56">It had been a profound shock to them, and he felt that it would be useless, if the time ever came that I went there, for me to walk up and introduce myself--or for any other member of the family.</span> <span id="s57">He said, "You know, I, at this point, we have to let the dead past be dead."</span> <span id="s58">He was always quoting things.</span> <span id="s59">And I think that he was a great shaper of my character.</span> <span id="s60">My father was home a lot too, and between the two of them I had some pretty tight upbringing.</span> <span id="s61">My mother was fervently, and why, heaven alone knows, but she was fervently Russian Orthodox.</span> <span id="s62">Grandfather was much more phlegmatic about religion in all forms.</span> <span id="s63">He said it was humanity that mattered, and the devil with the form of the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">MS: Was your mother also born in Russia, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">LF: Yes.</span> <span id="s66">She was born in St. Petersburg.</span> <span id="s67">And they left during the Russian Civil War.</span> <span id="s68">And they had quite, after the Czar's shooting, after the Red Revolution, they left during the time, the Czechs were running the trans-Siberia railroad.</span> <span id="s69">And the Whites were fighting, still trying to regain power.</span> <span id="s70">And they apparently got on and off that train and walked miles through the forest.</span> <span id="s71">And grandfather's troops must have liked him, because he had served with the Cossacks, and they came to their rescue on two or three occasions and got them out of the inhabited areas and finally supplied them with horses.</span> <span id="s72">And how the blazes they managed it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s73">But they got themselves out of Russia, and back onto the train.</span> <span id="s74">And then to Harbin, in China.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">MS: [unclear] story.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">LF: Or, in Mongolia.</span> <span id="s77">And then they wound up in Shanghai, which is where my father and mother met.</span> <span id="s78">Grandfather and my father were both voracious readers, and they introduced me to reading at a very young age.</span> <span id="s79">I can remember being able to read when I was four years old.</span> <span id="s80">I can also remember shocking the family by asking what certain words meant that weren't acceptable that kids should know, that I found in newspaper accounts, and getting roundabout accounts of those.</span> <span id="s81">And my father had a brother who was an Episcopal Bishop, not at the time that I was a tiny child, but when we went to England to live.</span> <span id="s82">And he also played a large part in my education.</span> <span id="s83">And it seemed as though I was always getting some do-right type thing said to me.</span> <span id="s84">Grandfather was very fond of quoting Rabbi Hillel.</span> <span id="s85">"If not me, who?</span> <span id="s86">If not now, when?"</span> <span id="s87">And that stuck with me, because it was a statement of personal responsibility more than a question.</span> <span id="s88">And that's one of the things that I've always been noted for, is accepting responsibility for my own actions.</span> <span id="s89">And it was unforgivable in our family not to accept one's own responsibilities.</span> <span id="s90">My father could, absolutely could not stand anyone who lied in any way.</span> <span id="s91">We were very seldom punished for our mini-transgressions.</span> <span id="s92">We got lectures.</span> <span id="s93">But if we lied, then we were punished.</span> <span id="s94">And the earliest thing I remember getting a lecture about was being very rude to a servant.</span> <span id="s95">I told the servant she couldn't tell me what to do.</span> <span id="s96">She was only a servant.</span> <span id="s97">And this is the point at which I think responsibility began to be hammered into me because I was made to think about what I had said, which meant sitting on a straight chair.</span> <span id="s98">And I don't know to this day whether it was ten minutes, ten hours, or ten days, but I sat there seemingly forever.</span> <span id="s99">And then father came into the room and said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s100">And I said, "You made me sit here."</span> <span id="s101">And he said, "What for?"</span> <span id="s102">And I said, "Because I was rude to Chin Tam."</span> <span id="s103">"Oh, that's right.</span> <span id="s104">Now you go and apologize if you've thought about it enough and then come back."</span> <span id="s105">Which I did.</span> <span id="s106">Then he sent me back again to make my bed and pick up my room, which was the subject of contention in the first place.</span> <span id="s107">And at that point, when I returned from the second trip, he said, "Come here."</span> <span id="s108">And I went and stood beside him.</span> <span id="s109">And he said, "Just think about it again, a minute, young lady.</span> <span id="s110">What does Chin Tam do for you?"</span> <span id="s111">And I, "Well, she brushes my hair."</span> <span id="s112">And he said, "And she bathes you.</span> <span id="s113">And she mends your clothes.</span> <span id="s114">And she dresses you.</span> <span id="s115">And she takes you out.</span> <span id="s116">And she loves you.</span> <span id="s117">She does things that your mother doesn't do sometimes."</span> <span id="s118">And I said, "That's true."</span> <span id="s119">And he said, "Do you think you have a right to be rude to her because she is 'only' a servant?"</span> <span id="s120">And I said, "No sir."</span> <span id="s121">And he said, "Well let me tell you about 'only' anything, young lady.</span> <span id="s122">And I want you to remember it.</span> <span id="s123">I want you to remember that people have dignity, all people, whether they sweep streets, whether they empty honey buckets, whether they sell vegetables, whether they scrub floors, or whether they are mighty kings and princes.</span> <span id="s124">They all have dignity.</span> <span id="s125">And you're not supposed to take it away from them by making derogatory remarks.</span> <span id="s126">Do you ever hear anyone around here allowed to call anybody else stupid?"</span> <span id="s127">And I said, "No, sir."</span> <span id="s128">And he said, "Why do you think that is?"</span> <span id="s129">And I said, "Because it's undignified."</span> <span id="s130">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s131">Well, I am well into my sixties, and that conversation took place when I was about four or five.</span> <span id="s132">And I can quote it almost verbatim, so you can guess it really made an impact.</span> <span id="s133">That's the kind of family.</span> <span id="s134">We were happy kids.</span> <span id="s135">We had to--there were five brothers and one sister, and she was not at all well.</span> <span id="s136">Only one of them was younger than me.</span> <span id="s137">We had to entertain ourselves, because there was no radio.</span> <span id="s138">There was no television.</span> <span id="s139">We got books.</span> <span id="s140">We got jigsaw puzzles.</span> <span id="s141">We got crossword books.</span> <span id="s142">We got everything to do something with.</span> <span id="s143">And, when we got bored with those things, we were made to race and chase and run around and get some exercise, and we were also taken out by my grandfather, who taught us to ride.</span> <span id="s144">And that of course was an interesting experience, because he was a magnificent rider.</span> <span id="s145">And he could ride Cossack style.</span> <span id="s146">He could lie alongside the horse.</span> <span id="s147">He could roll underneath the horse.</span> <span id="s148">And he taught us all to do it, to my mother's great chagrin.</span> <span id="s149">She was quite sure that we were all gonna die under the hooves of a pony.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s151">LF: And none of us did.</span> <span id="s152">We continued to move around the world, and the older boys went off to school, and then my sister went home to England to school because she couldn't take the heat of India.</span> <span id="s153">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s154">MS: Your father was on assignment?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">LF: My father was on assignment.</span> <span id="s156">My father was the British Chief of Staff in the Far East during the gunboat days based in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s157">And then we went to Bombay in eastern, in, I'm sorry, on the west coast of India, where he was the commanding officer.</span> <span id="s158">And then we went home to England.</span> <span id="s159">We'd gone home once in the interval.</span> <span id="s160">When I was about four-and-a-half, five, we'd gone home for about a year.</span> <span id="s161">And, I didn't think much of England the first time I went home.</span> <span id="s162">It was a gray place with people with funny color.</span> <span id="s163">Because I was used to yellow people, and brown people.</span> <span id="s164">And I couldn't understand all these gray people and all this rain that we incessantly had.</span> <span id="s165">Nor could I understand the fact that nobody seemed to make much noise in the streets, because the Chinese are very noisy people in their daily life.</span> <span id="s166">And there's always somebody screaming and shouting.</span> <span id="s167">And there are always magnificent smells up and down the roads, and along the Shanghai Bund.</span> <span id="s168">And of course none of those things existed in England.</span> <span id="s169">So [unclear] I got used to the smell of fish and chips and hot pies.</span> <span id="s170">But, I did get one enormous surprise, because the whole family went.</span> <span id="s171">And my grandfather was an opera fiend, an absolute fiend.</span> <span id="s172">And he began to go and line up, so as to stretch his allowance.</span> <span id="s173">We weren't short of money, but he still wanted to be careful with it; he'd go and line up to get gallery seats, and then at some point in the day I would be allowed to get on a bus, or the underground, and go and join him.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">MS: This of course was in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">LF: In England.</span> <span id="s176">And Amah [nanny] would take me, and then she would release me to him at the end of the street.</span> <span id="s177">And I would then stand in line and eat all the forbidden street foods that my mother would have died if she'd known we were doing.</span> <span id="s178">And grandfather and I would then wait and get, go in, and either get our Standing-Room-Only place, or our place in the gallery.</span> <span id="s179">And that was my introduction to opera.</span> <span id="s180">And I thought it was a wonderful, magical world.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">MS: Which it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">LF: And of course he knew all the stories, and all the characters.</span> <span id="s183">So we discussed them endlessly.</span> <span id="s184">And we discussed the various qualities of the singers.</span> <span id="s185">I didn't know much of what I was talking about, but I talked anyway.</span> <span id="s186">And usually fell asleep on the underground going back to my father's London house, or my grandfather's London house as it then was.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">MS: Was your father away from home for long periods of time during...</span></p> <p><span id="s188">LF: Actually he wasn't away from us for long periods of time because he kept my mother with him.</span> <span id="s189">My mother was an intensely nervous person.</span> <span id="s190">I think she never got over her escape from Russia, which was pretty traumatic.</span> <span id="s191">And she was absolutely crazy if he was out of her sight for very long.</span> <span id="s192">And it wasn't until much later, until World War II came, that he was gone from us for long periods of time.</span> <span id="s193">So we spent a lot of time with him, and we sailed, and they went to garden parties and did all the usual social things that happened with overseas postings in those days.</span> <span id="s194">And it was really rather a privileged life, a life that's almost vanished now.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">MS: How did your father meet your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">LF: Oh, that was funny.</span> <span id="s197">That was rather funny.</span> <span id="s198">Mother, and grandfather had this thing about their money might run out.</span> <span id="s199">They did have a fair amount of money, but they had this incredible fear that their money would run out.</span> <span id="s200">And so they began doing the most ridiculous things.</span> <span id="s201">Grandfather was teaching writing.</span> <span id="s202">And he could earn some money doing that.</span> <span id="s203">Mother tried teaching French, but didn't have the patience.</span> <span id="s204">And she spoke excellent French.</span> <span id="s205">Most educated Russians did.</span> <span id="s206">The other skill that she had was that she was a magnificent needlewoman.</span> <span id="s207">And she started embroidering things.</span> <span id="s208">And then she found out that she could make some money by sewing lace on naval officer's uniforms.</span> <span id="s209">The gold trim is called lace.</span> <span id="s210">And it is a very difficult thing to do, and the Chinese never quite got it right, because there's a certain way to pleat the top ring that goes onto a naval officer's uniform and mother was so patient, and so good, that she learned how to do that very quickly.</span> <span id="s211">And she did, she took other sewing on.</span> <span id="s212">She took on menial things, like sewing on buttons and repairing things for the same officers that she was sewing on lace.</span> <span id="s213">And they went back several times prattling about this absolutely gorgeous Russian girl who was doing all this stuff.</span> <span id="s214">And my father had to see for himself.</span> <span id="s215">And he went down to get something mended, and to get some lace sewn on, and was smitten.</span> <span id="s216">And apparently he didn't have too much of a tongue in those days to say what he wanted.</span> <span id="s217">And he kept on going back with various bundles of sewing.</span> <span id="s218">And finally one day she confronted him and said, "I have sewn the buttons on this shirt four times."</span> <span id="s219">And he said, "Oh, not that shirt."</span> <span id="s220">And she said, "Oh yes I have."</span> <span id="s221">And he said, "No, not that shirt."</span> <span id="s222">And she said, "Don't tell me lies.</span> <span id="s223">Here are my initials."</span> <span id="s224">[both laughing] She had sewn her initials behind the button, that she'd previously put on.</span> <span id="s225">So finally he had to say what he was there for, which was of course, her.</span> <span id="s226">And he married her, and the family, of course, was the result.</span> <span id="s227">And I think they were pretty happy together, despite mother's outbreaks of temper.</span> <span id="s228">And she had a terrible temper.</span> <span id="s229">I mean, it was the kind of household where you never knew when my mother was gonna have an outbreak.</span> <span id="s230">And kettles of hot water went flying around, knives got thrown across the room [chuckling] and there were some pretty dreadful scenes.</span> <span id="s231">And later in life I discovered that I had her temper, but I was much more able to control it.</span> <span id="s232">And I also had my father's temper, which was a cold, furious, slow burning rage.</span> <span id="s233">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">MS: Your father, excuse me, your father was, had Scottish descendants?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">LF: That's, my father was pure Scot, on both sides of the family.</span> <span id="s236">His father was Fraser, and, which of course is the name that I've returned to, having both, been both widowed and divorced.</span> <span id="s237">And my grandmother was a Campbell.</span> <span id="s238">And they were both extremely nice people.</span> <span id="s239">Grandmother was extremely insightful, very helpful, and always very concerned with the people that lived around them, and the people that lived on the farm, in England, to which grandfather retired.</span> <span id="s240">And my father's father was an army general officer, a British Army General Officer.</span> <span id="s241">He was an engineer.</span> <span id="s242">And I got to know them best during the years in World War II.</span> <span id="s243">Unfortunately, at the time that they were both coming pretty close to their deaths, because grandfather died a rather lingering death from prostate cancer and bladder cancer, for which there was very little treatment in the 1940s.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">LF: And grandmother also subsequently died from cancer, having valiantly concealed the fact that she was ill, because she was trying to help take care of grandfather.</span> <span id="s246">And they were rather tremendous people.</span> <span id="s247">And grandfather was not always a nice character.</span> <span id="s248">He got pretty drunk at times, which was one way of controlling his pain.</span> <span id="s249">And he wasn't at all nice then.</span> <span id="s250">He'd rant and rave and shout and it wasn't very amusing.</span> <span id="s251">But, grandmother seemed to be able to handle that.</span> <span id="s252">And she had this just enormous streak of humanity.</span> <span id="s253">If someone was sick in our village, she would set off with a basket of food, blankets, medicines, and she might be gone for two or three days.</span> <span id="s254">If it was a sick child, she'd sit up all night so that the mother could get some rest.</span> <span id="s255">If it was a mother that was sick, she'd take over the cooking and the cleaning.</span> <span id="s256">And this was a lady who came from a noble family and didn't have to do that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s257">But, she said that we all have responsibility for other people.</span> <span id="s258">Again, that good old word that runs through our family--responsibility.</span> <span id="s259">So, that pretty well sums up, you know, why I am the way I am.</span> <span id="s260">I skipped over one thing in starting to talk about England.</span> <span id="s261">We spent some time in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s262">Father was posted to Alexandria, Egypt.</span> <span id="s263">And he went there at the end of 1936.</span> <span id="s264">And in the Spring of 1937, my Russian grandfather, Dejya, said that he wanted to take me to Europe.</span> <span id="s265">He could see the storm clouds gathering.</span> <span id="s266">He felt that Hitler was going to precipitate an enormous war, and he knew that we could never go back into Russia as long as the Soviets were there.</span> <span id="s267">But he wanted me to see Europe at first-hand.</span> <span id="s268">And it sounds like a braggart to say it, but I was considered to be an extremely intelligent child.</span> <span id="s269">And I was absolutely bored with normal lessons.</span> <span id="s270">So, they decided that they would give me one gigantic summer long history, geography, and sociological lesson.</span> <span id="s271">And grandfather and I traveled all through Europe.</span> <span id="s272">We went everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">MS: Leigh, how old were you during this summer that you traveled?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">LF: In 1937, that was the summer before I was 11.</span> <span id="s275">I was 11 in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">MS: Yes, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">LF: And I was a big child.</span> <span id="s278">I, people frequently took me for about 12 or 13, and we were never really treated as little children, beyond the nursery stage.</span> <span id="s279">Because we had so many guests coming in and out of the house, and it was part of our social training to come into the room, to behave politely, to take part in the small talk, and in family discussions we were always allowed to represent our own point of view.</span> <span id="s280">We were allowed to say absolutely what we thought about anything, as long as we phrased it politely.</span> <span id="s281">You could not be rude.</span> <span id="s282">We were allowed to swear when we were outside with the horses.</span> <span id="s283">We were allowed to express ourselves in the most earthly terms then.</span> <span id="s284">But not in the house.</span> <span id="s285">And if you were going to take part in a discussion, you were not expected to just argue your point, you were expected to contribute something to it, and to comment on what other people's points of view were, and to try to understand why they had their point of view.</span> <span id="s286">It was exceptionally good training, and I think that that was basically at my father's insistence that we did that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">MS: A very mature type of--experience for a--really a very young adolescent child.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">LF: That's true.</span> <span id="s289">That's true.</span> <span id="s290">Of course children in those days, you know, here we go, 'those days'...</span></p> <p><span id="s291">MS: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">LF: Were a lot differently brought up to children today.</span> <span id="s293">And, lots of children of my age group were never allowed into the drawing room, except on an occasional visit.</span> <span id="s294">That was the difference between us and other children of the day.</span> <span id="s295">But certainly no child was allowed to be rude, or to back answer.</span> <span id="s296">The thing that was the most wonderful thing about it, looking back, is that it gave us such great training in how to behave in almost any situation.</span> <span id="s297">You were literally never at a loss as a young adult because you had all that background behind you.</span> <span id="s298">You knew what was expected of you.</span> <span id="s299">You knew what you had to do.</span> <span id="s300">And, you better learn to be a very good copy-cat in our family because you only got one chance most of the time.</span> <span id="s301">If you didn't behave well, Father took you aside and told you precisely what you had done, and made you feel about an inch high, because he told you he was absolutely disappointed in you.</span> <span id="s302">He thought that you had more intelligence and more breeding than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">MS: He guilt-tripped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">LF: Oh, did he ever!</span></p> <p><span id="s305">MS: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s306">LF: And I don't think that that was such a bad thing, though, because it did make you take stock of yourself continually.</span> <span id="s307">And life wasn't always a free ride either, because there were boxes that arrived every six weeks from England.</span> <span id="s308">They arrived wherever we were.</span> <span id="s309">And some of those boxes were marked The Victoria School.</span> <span id="s310">The Victoria School was a curriculum planning group in London, and they sent out an entire teaching curriculum and books according to the grade levels that the parents had requested.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">MS: I see.</span> <span id="s312">So you were being in a sense tutored at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">LF: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">MS: All through your European and Indian and China experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">LF: That's correct.</span> <span id="s316">There were no real European schools, but most of the fathers took part in teaching us mathematics and practical things.</span> <span id="s317">We got very little in the chemistry, biology thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">MS: The sciences.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">LF: The sciences.</span> <span id="s320">But we got lots and lots of math and we got history on a world scale.</span> <span id="s321">We got geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">MS: Well you were living the geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">LF: And we got all sorts of sociology, world development, and lots of languages, because we were being exposed to languages.</span> <span id="s324">And I suppose among the group of parents that we knew, they spoke about ten languages between the various people.</span> <span id="s325">And there were three spoken regularly in our household, plus whatever the servants were speaking.</span> <span id="s326">And we always picked up some smattering of what they were speaking.</span> <span id="s327">We promptly forgot it when we moved onto the next thing, or retained just a few words.</span> <span id="s328">But by the time I was sixteen and finishing school, I was completely fluent in three languages.</span> <span id="s329">I could read them and write them and speak them, and I could take part in a trilingual conversation, which might begin with Russian, progress to English, back to Russian, and back to French, and then to French, and then back to Russian again, without missing a beat, which was also tremendously useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">MS: I can well imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">LF: Because it teaches you again to be self-possessed and to think on your feet.</span> <span id="s332">And it's also very interesting, because the comments that are made by one national group of people are not the same as those that are made by another national group.</span> <span id="s333">People don't always see things from the same viewpoint.</span> <span id="s334">And the Russians very frequently, even though they were--and we had lots of Russian visitors--even though they were frequently guests and not paying guests either in English households--didn't always like the things that they saw us doing, and didn't like being ruled by the British, even though they were being saved by them--and said so in no uncertain terms, which was pretty shocking to most conventional people.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">MS: You mentioned that in your household and amongst your friends there were many Russians that had left the country, of course, and they were, what were they called, they had a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">LF: Emigrés.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">MS: Emigrés, yes, Russian emigrés, and they were harbored in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">LF: That's right, and many of them who had taken refuge in China usually wound up with one of the English families, or a French family, as a tutor, or a piano teacher, or a governess or something in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">MS: So you had contact with them in [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s340">LF: We had lots of contact with them.</span> <span id="s341">And many of them were very erudite people.</span> <span id="s342">Musical, well traveled, and certainly usually very well-read.</span> <span id="s343">And not at all like the type of Russian emigré that one sees today, who haven't had those privileges.</span> <span id="s344">[beeping sound] That's that half minute calling [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s345">MS: We'll continue this interview in just one moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s347">MS: This is tape one, side two, of an interview with Leigh Fraser, and we will continue now with her experience in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">LF: When we were in Alexandria the year that I was ten, when I was going to be eleven, at the end of October that year, they decided that I'd been such a pest in the home-tutoring sort of classes that we had, and my grandfather proposed to my father that I be allowed to go with him to Europe.</span> <span id="s349">My mother didn't want me to go.</span> <span id="s350">She was very afraid.</span> <span id="s351">Grandfather had a very prescient sense of what was happening in Europe.</span> <span id="s352">He used to refer to Hitler as, "That very bad man who is going to make this world change."</span> <span id="s353">And his argument for taking me was that I should see Europe as it was.</span> <span id="s354">I was considered to be pretty intelligent, and they thought that this might really spark my interest in world history, and that it would also be something that I would remember all my life if the world did change.</span> <span id="s355">And of course they proved to be exactly accurate in that.</span> <span id="s356">So, in the Spring of 1937, just after Easter, we set off from Alexandria and we went to Greece.</span> <span id="s357">And we took a car in Greece, and we drove up through Albania, funny little country on the Aegean.</span> <span id="s358">And then went into Italy.</span> <span id="s359">And that was the first country after Greece.</span> <span id="s360">We didn't spend much time in Greece, and Greece wasn't considered to be tremendously important politically.</span> <span id="s361">But, Mussolini was making an awful lot of noises, and you know, Mussolini was, of course, later known as the "Jackal of Europe".</span> <span id="s362">But for a jackal he was making some very loud noises in the mid-1930s.</span> <span id="s363">And Hitler did, to some extent, model his behavior on Mussolini until he outgrew him, and then began to laugh at him.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">MS: At this particular time, of course you were quite young.</span> <span id="s365">You said you were about ten or eleven, were there any specific antisemitic statements or actions that you could determine or were aware of at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">LF: The only place in Italy that we saw anything like that was when we were in Rome.</span> <span id="s367">And grandfather drew my attention to it.</span> <span id="s368">Despite the fact that grandfather was half- Jewish, he didn't particularly look it.</span> <span id="s369">He was a very tall man.</span> <span id="s370">Now, I don't mean that to sound at all derogatory either.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">MS: No, no of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">LF: But he was a very...</span></p> <p><span id="s373">MS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">LF: Very tall, very Russian-looking man.</span> <span id="s375">He looked extremely Imperial.</span> <span id="s376">And he was very, very imposing.</span> <span id="s377">He was over six feet tall, and he had a habit of making himself look like a giant, particularly if he was outraged about something.</span> <span id="s378">I didn't understand much Italian, but he could manage to get along, and we used a phrase book a lot.</span> <span id="s379">It always seemed as though he had a phrase book in one pocket or another.</span> <span id="s380">But we went around looking at things.</span> <span id="s381">And we got lost one afternoon.</span> <span id="s382">And of course there were an enormous number of Mussolini's Black Shirt people, all over the place, all the time.</span> <span id="s383">And they were extremely nasty.</span> <span id="s384">They were just plain thugs.</span> <span id="s385">That whole Axis bunch were just nothing but thugs, as history later proved.</span> <span id="s386">We somehow in getting lost managed to get into Trastaveri [Trastevere].</span> <span id="s387">Trastaveri is the slum section of Rome, and it's intensely Jewish.</span> <span id="s388">And it's also a lot of other things, too, but that's, of course, where the Jews of Italy, or of Rome, were pretty much driven to, because it was cheap housing and they were being discriminated against.</span> <span id="s389">They were being denied employment, and they were being forced into very sub-standard conditions.</span> <span id="s390">And there were some restrictions about going to school, as I later understood.</span> <span id="s391">There was one episode in which I really wondered whether grandfather was going to make it or not because we saw a man being beaten by some of the Black Shirts on the corner.</span> <span id="s392">And he was an older man.</span> <span id="s393">And grandfather, as I said, could get pretty outraged.</span> <span id="s394">And he went across the street in about four strides, yelling, "Basta!</span> <span id="s395">Basta!"</span> <span id="s396">"Stop!"</span> <span id="s397">And these two that were beating the old man were so shocked that they turned to look and see who was yelling Basta at them, prepared to defend themselves.</span> <span id="s398">And literally, when grandfather began to yell and storm at them, with his rather imposing, somewhat regal appearance, they just fled.</span> <span id="s399">They literally fled.</span> <span id="s400">And I ran across the street from where grandfather had left me, and we picked the old man up.</span> <span id="s401">And he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s402">He was thanking my grandfather, and my grandfather was talking to him.</span> <span id="s403">And they were making out fine, because grandfather had a fair command of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s404">And with the exception of the Russian Jews, most of the Jews of Europe spoke Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">MS: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">LF: I know it's a Germanic language, but it spread almost universally in the Jewish communities.</span> <span id="s407">And we took this man home.</span> <span id="s408">And he hadn't managed to complete the family shopping, which is what he was doing, when these people beat him.</span> <span id="s409">My grandfather stayed with the family to help take care of him.</span> <span id="s410">The woman was sobbing, and the other adult members of the family hadn't come home.</span> <span id="s411">This was the grandfather of the family that these people were beating.</span> <span id="s412">And I took the shopping basket and got my grandfather to write a list of the things that they wanted.</span> <span id="s413">And I didn't know how to speak any Italian, but I went out and did the shopping, and came back with the shopping basket.</span> <span id="s414">I just took one of the little kids with me to show me where to go.</span> <span id="s415">And he explained to everybody that I was carrying the basket and doing the shopping because the Black Shirts had beaten his grandfather.</span> <span id="s416">And I think some of the shopkeepers probably gave us an extra pile of something or other or a few extra pieces of bread, because they were trying to show that they were sorry.</span> <span id="s417">That quarter was practically destroyed in a night similar to the "Night of the Long Knives", during the war.</span> <span id="s418">And of course Mussolini did allow many of the Italian Jews to be deported.</span> <span id="s419">And they had their own little Final Solution.</span> <span id="s420">Excuse the sarcasm, but--That's a pretty terrible expression.</span> <span id="s421">And their lives were not fun in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">MS: This was...</span></p> <p><span id="s423">LF: And the war didn't end for Italy until 1943, '44.</span> <span id="s424">And then of course the Germans kept it going in the north much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">MS: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">LF: Even after the Italians gave in.</span> <span id="s427">So they had a very unfunny almost ten years of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">MS: Were there other places in your experience that summer through Europe that you had a sense of what was happening to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">LF: Yes--The--journeys through the center of Europe weren't terribly remarkable.</span> <span id="s430">They were pretty, they were interesting.</span> <span id="s431">Grandfather, of course, was a very lively companion, and he knew something about almost every place we were going to.</span> <span id="s432">We went to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s433">We went to the mountains in Croatia, to the area where the present conflict has been going on.</span> <span id="s434">We went to Sarajevo and he explained about the assassinations of Grand Duke Ferdinand, and how that had led to the beginning of World War I. And we began to talk about fanaticism because he talked about the Serbian student who had been the assassin at that.</span> <span id="s435">And I think this is where he began giving me my sociology lesson about what was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s436">He wanted me to see Russia, and he took me to the very edges of Europe, without going into Russia, because of course he couldn't go, being a former Czarist.</span> <span id="s437">He would have been killed.</span> <span id="s438">And that would have been the end of me, too.</span> <span id="s439">So, he did take me to Romania.</span> <span id="s440">And after that, into Poland.</span> <span id="s441">And we weren't in Poland long the first time, and we went on up to the Baltic States.</span> <span id="s442">There was a distinct antisemitic feeling in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s443">Not so much in Latvia.</span> <span id="s444">Not so much in Estonia.</span> <span id="s445">But the Lithuanians have some very nasty characteristics as a people.</span> <span id="s446">And there was a lot of Jew-baiting going on.</span> <span id="s447">And there were some restrictions being imposed on the Jews there.</span> <span id="s448">And people were quite fearful, and not very trusting.</span> <span id="s449">And that was one place where we didn't really truly have much fun.</span> <span id="s450">And of course what we were doing up in that area was, grandfather was getting me to the Gulf of Finland.</span> <span id="s451">And, so that I could at least look across the water...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">MS: And to...</span></p> <p><span id="s453">LF: To Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">MS: And see Russia.</span> <span id="s455">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">LF: And, we left before I really understood some of the hateful things that were being said.</span> <span id="s457">And then we went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s458">Poland was ghastly.</span> <span id="s459">We saw lots of things.</span> <span id="s460">I have this wonderful series of photographs in a book by Roman Vishniak about European Jewry as it then was.</span> <span id="s461">And it's frightening to look at those people who didn't have much.</span> <span id="s462">And lots of those photographs were taken in Poland.</span> <span id="s463">People were just, they were so ordinary.</span> <span id="s464">They were bakers, shopkeepers, porters, and porters worked very hard.</span> <span id="s465">They towed huge loads of boxes through the street and harnessed themselves to the carts, like horses.</span> <span id="s466">And they weren't very well-dressed.</span> <span id="s467">And, in the Jewish quarters of the villages, the shtetls, they were not very comfortable.</span> <span id="s468">They lived in dreadful conditions, literally hovels.</span> <span id="s469">Some of them were so poor that their kids didn't have shoes and couldn't go out in the winter time.</span> <span id="s470">And Poland is an intensely Roman Catholic country.</span> <span id="s471">And here are some of my personal prejudices coming out, because for such a so-called "Christian" country, their behavior was remarkably uncharitable.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">MS: Interesting, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">LF: I won't even just say un-Christian.</span> <span id="s474">Un-charitable.</span> <span id="s475">Lacking in all understanding that anyone else could hurt, that they could bleed, that you could hurt them by words, and hurt them by denying them certain places in the natural order of things in a country.</span> <span id="s476">And it was pretty terrible to realize that children, who were the same age as me, were being denied the right to go to school.</span> <span id="s477">Couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s478">The Jewish shopkeepers were being locked out of their shops so they couldn't earn a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">MS: And this was, you saw this happening in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">LF: This was in 1937.</span> <span id="s481">And then, and we stayed very frequently in small inns.</span> <span id="s482">But because grandfather was such a talker, and because he understood people, and because he was trying to show me something, we went into many of the Jewish quarters in the smaller towns.</span> <span id="s483">And then we wound up in Warsaw, which was pretty grim.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">MS: And yet Warsaw was a cosmopolitan city, compared to the shtetls that you witnessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">LF: Supposedly.</span> <span id="s486">Supposedly.</span> <span id="s487">But, there was a very uneasy rubbing of shoulders.</span> <span id="s488">You could feel it.</span> <span id="s489">It was not the usual, "Well, you stay on your side of the fence and I'll stay on my side," or like watching one cat arching its back and trying to scare the daylights out of another one.</span> <span id="s490">It was uglier than that.</span> <span id="s491">There were always gangs of youths around, on the edge of the Polish-Jewish quarters.</span> <span id="s492">And there were invariably some sort of scuffle, or a fight.</span> <span id="s493">And we saw a lot of small degrees of physical violence.</span> <span id="s494">Not organized, official violence, but just generalized nastiness.</span> <span id="s495">An ugly, ugly feeling that one set of people were the haves, and the others were not going to be allowed to have it.</span> <span id="s496">Not that they were have-nots, but they weren't going to be allowed to have it.</span> <span id="s497">Whether they deserved it or not.</span> <span id="s498">And I find it frightening, and found it frightening even then...</span></p> <p><span id="s499">MS: I can understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">LF: That one set of people could determine the future of another set of people, not on an intellectual basis, not on a moral basis, but just on sheer strength.</span> <span id="s501">And what we were seeing was, as far as I was concerned, a morally bankrupt people.</span> <span id="s502">I knew the difference between right and wrong.</span> <span id="s503">And what I was seeing was very wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">MS: Did your grandfather comment about these situations to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">LF: Oh lots of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">LF: Lots of times.</span> <span id="s508">We would go away from one of these things and he'd say to me, "Did you see that?</span> <span id="s509">Tell me what you saw.</span> <span id="s510">Tell me what you thought about it.</span> <span id="s511">Why was it wrong?</span> <span id="s512">What were they doing?</span> <span id="s513">Do you think those people deserve to be treated like that?</span> <span id="s514">Do you think it was right?</span> <span id="s515">Why wasn't it right?"</span> <span id="s516">And he really made me think about it.</span> <span id="s517">"Why was it wrong for that man to push that woman out of his shop?"</span> <span id="s518">We saw a Jewish woman try to go into a shop.</span> <span id="s519">And a man hollered at her that he didn't want any dirty Jews in that shop.</span> <span id="s520">I didn't understand what he was saying, but grandfather did.</span> <span id="s521">And grandfather went up to her in the street, and asked her what it was she was trying to buy.</span> <span id="s522">And whatever it was, she told him.</span> <span id="s523">And grandfather then told her to wait at the corner and he would go and get it for her: And he went into the store, and got it, and came back out.</span> <span id="s524">And I asked him why he did that.</span> <span id="s525">And he said, "Because he doesn't have the right to deny to sell those things if he's in business.</span> <span id="s526">And I wanted to see if he really didn't have the things, because he told her he didn't have what she wanted and he didn't want any of these people in his shop, so rudely put.</span> <span id="s527">But he did have it.</span> <span id="s528">He was lying.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">MS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">LF: And that was just another one of the things that I'd been taught was wrong.</span> <span id="s531">And grandfather, in full view of the man, who came out to watch him, because he was quite a figure to see when he walked around, in full view of the man, walked over and handed the woman the things, and refused her money.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">MS: My heavens.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">LF: And then walked back and spat at the man...</span></p> <p><span id="s534">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s535">LF: Who didn't dare do anything!</span> <span id="s536">I mean, you know, there are some very ugly expressions for people like this man, and one of them begins with "Chicken".</span></p> <p><span id="s537">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s538">LF: And although we chuckle at them, they weren't at all funny, and they were terribly frightening.</span> <span id="s539">Really terribly frightening.</span> <span id="s540">And Germany was even more frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">MS: It would be interesting to hear of some of your experiences in Germany at this period of time, if you can recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">LF: Germany was terrifying at times.</span> <span id="s543">And, I knew, of course, that grandfather was half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s544">I'd been told this.</span> <span id="s545">He had told me bits and pieces about the family.</span> <span id="s546">He told me never to say that in Germany.</span> <span id="s547">Never, never, never, because we would not get out alive, unless we were remarkably lucky.</span> <span id="s548">I was to be exactly what I am, the daughter of a British Naval officer, with my British passport, which makes of course no reference to one's religion.</span> <span id="s549">And of course I wasn't being brought up as Jewish either.</span> <span id="s550">I just knew that I was partly Jewish, and I knew that it was wrong to castigate anyone for what they believe in.</span> <span id="s551">And that has absolutely nothing to do with being Jewish or being Christian or being Hindu or anything else.</span> <span id="s552">That is people's right.</span> <span id="s553">And if they believe in nothing, well then I pity them.</span> <span id="s554">But, he did say that for our safety, I should be very English.</span> <span id="s555">And I should not utter one single word that would make them think in any way that I understood what was going on.</span> <span id="s556">And he himself became very much the Imperial Prince.</span> <span id="s557">I have never seen him so rude to so many people as he was.</span> <span id="s558">He was, he out-Prussianed the Prussians.</span> <span id="s559">He was completely Imperial, utterly demanding, and laying down the law.</span> <span id="s560">And the Germans are strange people in that regard, because if you give them orders, they'll rush to obey them if they think you've got the authority.</span> <span id="s561">And there was no denying this figure of authority.</span> <span id="s562">And people bowed and scraped to him.</span> <span id="s563">But we saw ugly things.</span> <span id="s564">We saw people being dragged off the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">MS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">LF: Hitler's Brown Shirts were everywhere.</span> <span id="s567">There was plenty of evidence of Gestapo, and lots of people looking over their shoulders.</span> <span id="s568">And lots of evidence in Jewish sections of stores being closed rather abruptly.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">MS: And this was even before Kristallnacht and...</span></p> <p><span id="s570">LF: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">MS: The pogroms.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">LF: It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s573">MS: But of course the Nuremberg Laws [Nürnberg]...</span></p> <p><span id="s574">LF: It was a year before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">LF: But it, the, but the Nuremberg Law had been passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">MS: Passed.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">LF: And so Jewish property was being confiscated.</span> <span id="s579">Jews were being denied the right to go about their daily business.</span> <span id="s580">They were being denied the right to go to schools.</span> <span id="s581">Synagogues were being, if not...</span></p> <p><span id="s582">MS: Closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">LF: Well, they were being closed, and those people who looked obviously Jewish were being harassed on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">MS: Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s585">LF: And you know that there are certain facial characteristics in certain parts of Europe that mark you immediately.</span> <span id="s586">And, of course, the Germans made such an enormous mockery of that.</span> <span id="s587">They caricatured the Jew--and I saw those caricatures--as being vile, and as being misshapen, and less than human.</span> <span id="s588">And I couldn't understand this at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">MS: There were posters in many of, in many places, that were publicly displayed, of cartoon versions of the Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">LF: That's exactly right, and I saw those.</span> <span id="s591">And I was kind of horrified by them.</span> <span id="s592">And I asked grandfather why they were putting things like that up because we had books at home that were political cartoons from the 18th century, by a man called Hogarth, William Hogarth.</span> <span id="s593">And these things were more obscene than, and Hogarth could be pretty ugly, and I knew that.</span> <span id="s594">I'd been exposed to that kind of art.</span> <span id="s595">And I knew what political cartooning was.</span> <span id="s596">But these weren't political.</span> <span id="s597">These were hate, pure, unadulterated, ignorant hate.</span> <span id="s598">And I never saw anyone that looked like these cartoons.</span> <span id="s599">They were just dreadful.</span> <span id="s600">They--portrayed these people as being only half-human.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">MS: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">LF: And of course that was their attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">MS: Yes it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">LF: And this is something that was very well explained to me by my grandfather.</span> <span id="s605">And of course my father had told me before we set off that we would be going to Germany, and that I was to obey grandfather implicitly.</span> <span id="s606">And if he told me not to do something, not to say something, I was not to do it.</span> <span id="s607">And grandfather told me, "For your safety and mine, you will not display any sympathy when these things are being done, but we are going to be taking reports back."</span> <span id="s608">And that was one time where I didn't know what was going on with him because I never saw him really do much to help anybody overtly.</span> <span id="s609">But, it seemed to me that he wrote something down every night.</span> <span id="s610">And when we got to the British Embassy, he turned lots of pieces of paper over to people in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">MS: In Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">LF: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">MS: At, to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s614">LF: At the British Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">MS: British...</span></p> <p><span id="s616">LF: Because he had been told to take me there to register me, and to carry a letter from my father.</span> <span id="s617">And he turned lots of pieces of paper over.</span> <span id="s618">And when we left Germany, when I asked him about it, he said, "You didn't see anything of the sort."</span> <span id="s619">And I knew he was telling me a lie, and I couldn't understand that because nobody in our family lied.</span> <span id="s620">But he emphatically denied it and told me that I was mistaken, that I'd got the letter and some other papers muddled up together in my head.</span> <span id="s621">When we left Germany to go back, he ex-...</span></p> <p><span id="s622">MS: To England?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">LF: No, to go back to Alexandria, Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">MS: Alexandria, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">LF: He explained to me then what had happened.</span> <span id="s626">Actually we left Germany and went into France.</span> <span id="s627">And that's when he explained to me, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s628">I did tell you a lie.</span> <span id="s629">But it was very dangerous in Germany.</span> <span id="s630">Very dangerous.</span> <span id="s631">And what I had been doing was noting various events and then handing them over to the British Minister as evidence that this sort of thing was beginning."</span></p> <p><span id="s632">MS: Interesting.</span> <span id="s633">Because you would think that the Ministry itself must have been quite aware of...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">LF: I'm sure they were aware, but father had said that grandfather was acutely observant and had apparently asked him to note the most blatant of the things that we saw.</span> <span id="s635">And to make them aware that it was going on all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">MS: Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">LF: And of course Nuremberg was just such a center of hate.</span> <span id="s638">We only spent about four hours in Nuremberg, and it was like being in a city full of blood.</span> <span id="s639">There were Nazi flags everywhere.</span> <span id="s640">There were Hitler youth groups everywhere.</span> <span id="s641">The people didn't seem to give a damn about anything except this mad, blind obeisance to Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">MS: Was this shocking to your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">LF: It was terrifying to him.</span> <span id="s644">It was absolutely terrifying to him.</span> <span id="s645">He said it was worse than when he'd left Russia, that what was happening when he left Russia was much more organized and sort of committee-based.</span> <span id="s646">He, his feelings in Germany as he expressed them, were that this was a--he used a Biblical word--a Baal-like obeisance to a false god.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">MS: Hmm.</span> <span id="s648">Baal.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">LF: He said, "They've made an icon out of those flags."</span> <span id="s650">And, of course, I knew what an icon or icon was.</span> <span id="s651">And he said, "They're acting as though they are a religious object, and they are representative of this man."</span></p> <p><span id="s652">MS: He was comparing the Hitler approach to the Jews as a, to the Russian approach to the Jews, saying that it was much worse in Germany.</span> <span id="s653">Their reaction to the Jews is much worse than what he had experienced...</span></p> <p><span id="s654">LF: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">MS: In Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">LF: And afterwards when I heard him, I was in the room when he was discussing with my father.</span> <span id="s657">And he said, "What they are doing is far, far worse than the pogroms.</span> <span id="s658">The pogroms were sporadic."</span></p> <p><span id="s659">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">LF: And were inspired only periodically and they were dreadful while they lasted, but they weren't a day-to-day continual occurrence, that doesn't excuse them.</span> <span id="s661">But he said, "What goes on in Germany is insidious.</span> <span id="s662">It's in every bit of daily life.</span> <span id="s663">No schools, no shops, no jobs, miscegenation laws.</span> <span id="s664">It's designed to put an end to a people."</span></p> <p><span id="s665">MS: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">LF: And that was the first time I ever heard that expression.</span> <span id="s667">And I said to them, "How can you end a people?"</span> <span id="s668">And my father said, "There's a word for it.</span> <span id="s669">It's called ‘genocide’.</span> <span id="s670">Go and get a dictionary and look it up."</span> <span id="s671">[sighs] Which of course was always their approach.</span> <span id="s672">Go find something and then bring it to me and I'll talk to you about it.</span> <span id="s673">And when I found it, and came back, and we discussed it, I began to realize that that's what we were seeing.</span> <span id="s674">It was an awful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">MS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">LF: I didn't like the Germans very much at all.</span> <span id="s677">I loved the food that I ate there, because I, you know, I've just, I like peasant-type food.</span> <span id="s678">I always have.</span> <span id="s679">And, but I didn't like them.</span> <span id="s680">They didn't seem to be like people.</span> <span id="s681">They seemed to be like big, stuffed, automatic dolls.</span> <span id="s682">All of them.</span> <span id="s683">All of them.</span> <span id="s684">And there wasn't anything attractive.</span> <span id="s685">Berlin seemed to be full of, even to my eyes, as a child, seemed to be full of uniforms, and full of brittle, artificial, loud people.</span> <span id="s686">Nuremberg, as I said, was like a bath of blood, with these enorm- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s687">MS: This is tape two, side one, of an interview with Leigh Fraser.</span> <span id="s688">And we are continuing our conversation about her experiences in Europe in 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">LF: Well, of course, we did go on from Germany to France, and that wasn't particularly significant.</span> <span id="s690">It was a nice part of the trip.</span> <span id="s691">Politically, as far as this is concerned, I don't remember seeing anything that one could consider very significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">MS: Certainly compared to what you had just experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">LF: And certainly not compared with what I had just experienced.</span> <span id="s694">We had been briefly in Holland.</span> <span id="s695">I had seen nothing bad in Holland, and I had seen nothing in Belgium either.</span> <span id="s696">And when we left to go back to Alexandria, Grandfather abruptly changed our plans.</span> <span id="s697">We went to the south of France and we went from Marseilles on a small freighter, down to the boot of Italy.</span> <span id="s698">And there we were dropped off by that freighter, and we managed somehow from, I think, from Taranto, he managed to pick up something else, which took us across to Alexandria.</span> <span id="s699">And that's how we arrived back in Alexandria.</span> <span id="s700">And then of course began this discussion between my father and my grandfather and I about the trip.</span> <span id="s701">And I began to understand some of the things that had happened.</span> <span id="s702">Because my grandfather had been very emphatic that he hadn't handed anything over to the British Minister all these pieces of paper I thought I saw.</span> <span id="s703">And then during the French leg of the trip, he apologized to me and said he would explain to me when we got back to Alexandria that he had told me a lie but he had told it for our safety because he didn't want me to know anything if I was asked.</span> <span id="s704">When we got back to Alexandria, Egypt, and we began to talk about these things, he explained that I had indeed seen him turn pieces of paper over that documented the ill usage of Jews in Germany, but that it was simply not safe for me to know.</span> <span id="s705">That what I didn't know, they couldn't extract from me if something went wrong, and if they took us prisoner.</span> <span id="s706">And he told me that after the way I had expressed myself in Nuremberg, he could not wait to get me out of Germany.</span> <span id="s707">Because I had literally told him that I thought they were all hideous, over-fat, stuffed dolls and automatons and that I didn't think they had any souls.</span> <span id="s708">And he made the comment to my father, "The greedy little pig stuffed herself with German food and couldn't be bothered to be polite to them."</span> <span id="s709">[both laugh] Which was absolutely true.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">MS: Did he express at any time his feelings about Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">LF: Not while we were in Germany, but he...</span></p> <p><span id="s712">MS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">LF: Certainly did when we got out of the country.</span> <span id="s714">And he didn't have much complimentary stuff to say, and some of it was certainly about his ancestry.</span> <span id="s715">Grandfather was quite colorful sometimes.</span> <span id="s716">Russians make a real art of swearing.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">LF: It's not the same few repetitive bodily function words that one hears in this country.</span> <span id="s719">They just make a real art of describing exactly what they think of the person.</span> <span id="s720">And when he was talking to my father, some of his more colorful soldier expressions came out, and I don't think Hitler would have felt very complimented.</span> <span id="s721">And certainly had he expressed them in Germany, that would have been the end of us.</span> <span id="s722">I've never seen such fanatical people as they were then.</span> <span id="s723">And of course I didn't realize that I was going to see them under different circumstances later.</span> <span id="s724">But what I saw, I didn't like.</span> <span id="s725">I didn't really understand it.</span> <span id="s726">Because I'd never seen people behave like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">MS: And it made an indelible impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">LF: And it made a tremendous impression on me.</span> <span id="s729">And when people talked about them later, during the war, when we were safely back in England--safe except for the bombing--I knew exactly what refugees were talking about when they arrived; when we had contact with people who had come across on French fishing boats and we had contact with the French, free French.</span> <span id="s730">I knew what they were talking about when they talked about Europe being raped, and about the Germans literally disregarding everybody and using everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">MS: What year did the f-, did these first refugees start coming into England, that you can recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">LF: Well, we went home to live, you know, from Alexandria we went to Malta.</span> <span id="s733">And we went home to live during the Munich Crisis of 1938, September 1938.</span> <span id="s734">We made a pretty swift trip from Malta to Toulon, and the French Navy then fed us and assisted us to get to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s735">There were lots of us.</span> <span id="s736">And we had then to catch the train to Paris.</span> <span id="s737">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s738">MS: With you on it, that leg of you journey back to England, do you think there were some refugees in amongst, in, [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">LF: Not on that.</span> <span id="s740">That train was crammed with basically English refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">MS: English nationals.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">LF: English nationals, British nationals, and their immediate family, and a few normal French travelers.</span> <span id="s743">But even they were pushed pretty much off that train.</span> <span id="s744">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s745">MS: Well, were you being asked to return?</span> <span id="s746">Now the war was not that imminent at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">LF: Well, the Royal Navy apparently thought so, because they had literally told us to leave Malta and get home.</span> <span id="s748">Malta could not have sustained the number of us that were there.</span> <span id="s749">You know that the Maltese almost starved during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">LF: Under the German bombardment.</span> <span id="s752">And when we left, about 400 people left, families, extended families, grandparents that were visiting.</span> <span id="s753">You know, because Malta was a very, very active British naval base at the time.</span> <span id="s754">And look at our family alone.</span> <span id="s755">My brother, my grandfather, my mother, my amah [children’s nurse, nanny] and me.</span> <span id="s756">That's five of us.</span> <span id="s757">Now, it isn't too hard to get to 400 when you consider that there were a vast number of Royal Navy families, all of whom had two or three family members going home and sometimes a nanny.</span> <span id="s758">You know, which would be...</span></p> <p><span id="s759">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">LF: The same as our amah.</span> <span id="s761">So, almost every family was leaving in three or more, in a unit.</span> <span id="s762">Well, that can add up very, very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">MS: Where was your sister and your brothers at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">LF: They were in England, in school.</span> <span id="s765">So they were, my older brothers were already in the Royal Navy.</span> <span id="s766">My sister was at school, and one other brother was at school.</span> <span id="s767">And, it was just this pure whack of fate that they had decided to completely educate me, and that I had had this trip, you know, that I wasn't already home in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">LF: And, of course, my younger brother was Mother's baby.</span> <span id="s770">And Mother was not going to be separated from her baby, which he didn't like.</span> <span id="s771">And he was profoundly grateful to get home and be allowed to be a schoolboy.</span> <span id="s772">Because he felt like he was, as he expressed it, a sissy, being kept at Mother's apron strings all the time.</span> <span id="s773">Not that she ever wore an apron.</span> <span id="s774">[both chuckle] And, when we got back to England, we stayed in London for a while.</span> <span id="s775">All of us needed things done to our teeth.</span> <span id="s776">We needed different clothes because we'd been wearing primarily Mediterranean clothing, and none of us had proper English coats and winter clothes and any that we'd had before were certainly out-grown.</span> <span id="s777">So, there were some enormous shopping trips, and of course with a war coming it was determined to buy as much of everything as we possibly could, that would sustain us for a while.</span> <span id="s778">And, Father didn't join us until much later because he had to finish his tour.</span> <span id="s779">There, the family has a house in London, right behind Selfridges, on Oxford Street.</span> <span id="s780">And, the house isn't on Oxford Street, but that's where Selfridges is.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">LF: It's a, the house is actually just off Baker Street, two blocks north of Oxford Street.</span> <span id="s783">And I remember endless trips to the dentist, to go shopping, to go to the opera with Grandfather.</span> <span id="s784">And, it was at that time--in answer to your question--that I began to notice what a tremendous number of accents there were and different languages being spoken.</span> <span id="s785">And I began listening, and asking questions.</span> <span id="s786">And principally asking questions of my grandfather and of my Uncle Tim, my father's brother, who was an Episcopal Rector, a Church of England Rector, which is of course the same thing as Episcopalianism.</span> <span id="s787">And he said, "Oh England's full of refugees, and there are more every day.</span> <span id="s788">They are leaving Germany..."</span></p> <p><span id="s789">MS: In hordes.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">LF: And he said, "Some of them come and stay only a while and if they have money or friends, go on to Canada or to America or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s791">But many of them who do not have much money or anywhere else to go are staying here."</span> <span id="s792">And I said, "Germany was horrid.</span> <span id="s793">Are they all coming from Germany?"</span> <span id="s794">And he said, "Germany and the countries close to it."</span> <span id="s795">He said, "You know what happened that brought you home."</span> <span id="s796">And I said, "Well, I kept on hearing things about crisis, and war, about Hitler and the Prime Minister.</span> <span id="s797">And I'm not sure why the Prime Minister went kowtowing to Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">MS: That was Chamberlain.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">LF: It was Chamberlain, who was of course absolutely the supreme avoider.</span> <span id="s800">You don't get anywhere by pandering, and obeying bullies.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">MS: As history tells us.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">LF: And, we already knew that anyway, but no one had listened.</span> <span id="s803">Absolutely no one politically had listened in England.</span> <span id="s804">I was too young to realize that at that time.</span> <span id="s805">But it only took that experience, and reading daily English language newspapers, and hearing the commentary around the family for me to begin to realize that we were indeed very much in danger of all those fat, overstuffed, doll-like people that I had seen in Germany.</span> <span id="s806">And there was a big steel juggernaut behind all those red flags that we had seen.</span> <span id="s807">And then, of course, we went quite regularly to the cinema.</span> <span id="s808">And in those days, there were newsreels, very up-to-date newsreels, that were changed about twice a week.</span> <span id="s809">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s810">MS: Of what was happening in central Europe and...</span></p> <p><span id="s811">LF: We began to see the Nazi rallies, Hitler ranting and raving from various balconies and podiums.</span> <span id="s812">We began to get translations of Goebbels and his propaganda.</span> <span id="s813">And it became tremendously obvious from the noises our own government was making that they no longer had any faith in Hitler's promises, and that in effect, Chamberlain saying, "Peace in our time," was just empty gabble.</span> <span id="s814">And the man in the street in England was beginning to say that, "That stupid so-and-so's got to go!"</span> <span id="s815">And they weren't complimentary about him at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">MS: And at this time I think Czechoslovakia had already been overrun?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">LF: There had been the Austrian Anschluss and Hitler had made some promises and then of course he just completely marched into the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s818">And it just seemed that all of Europe was being swallowed up in this enormous cancer-like thing that was spreading out from Germany.</span> <span id="s819">It seemed that there was a mouth here that gobbled up this country, and a mouth there that gobbled up that country.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">MS: And it didn't, and it must have sent shock waves through England obviously?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">LF: Oh, terribly, terribly.</span> <span id="s822">And it's true that we're an island, but we're only 21 miles from the coast of France.</span> <span id="s823">And despite all the noise and the bombast, and the British lion’s roar, we weren't ready for war.</span> <span id="s824">We had been sticking to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, the London Treaty of 1930.</span> <span id="s825">We hadn't been rearming.</span> <span id="s826">There wasn't going to be a war!</span> <span id="s827">There were a lot of people who had been crying there was going to be a war, in Parliament, and publicly, in other places.</span> <span id="s828">And they were all being called scaremongers.</span> <span id="s829">And Britain had its own fascist group too, under Sir Oswald Moseley, with his Black Shirts, which was exactly modeled on the European stuff.</span> <span id="s830">They were later interned, and Lord Reedsdale's daughters, the Mitfords, and I know that Americans have heard of Nancy Mitford.</span> <span id="s831">They were a very well-educated family.</span> <span id="s832">Nancy Mitford was an author.</span> <span id="s833">Unity absolutely fell in love with Hitler.</span> <span id="s834">She visited Germany.</span> <span id="s835">I mean, they were just vocally upper-class fascists.</span> <span id="s836">And one of the Mitford girls married Sir Oswald Moseley, and these blithering idiots used to parade up and down behind Nazi flags, jack boots and bands and sieg Heils.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">MS: Right there in, in...</span></p> <p><span id="s838">LF: Right in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">MS: London?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">LF: And there are some intensely Jewish quarters in London, notably in the East End...</span></p> <p><span id="s841">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">LF: Just outside the city is Whitechapel.</span> <span id="s843">And the area where Petticoat Lane is, the famous open-air market.</span> <span id="s844">That's all extremely Jewish.</span> <span id="s845">Bethnal Green, Stepney, those were the areas where Britain's Jews lived.</span> <span id="s846">Not because they were forced into them, not because it was a ghetto, but it was very convenient for trains into London to work.</span> <span id="s847">There was antisemitism in Britain, yes, ugly remarks, stupid things, but very seldom did it escalate into any kind of violence.</span> <span id="s848">It was not condoned by the government, and if anyone was caught committing any overt, punishable act, then they usually got pulled away to the courts, and the courts nearly always came down on the side of the complainant, rather than on the side of the defendant.</span> <span id="s849">It's a pretty orderly country.</span> <span id="s850">And there was, I will say, yes, I've heard antisemitic remarks, but I've also seen Jews occupy places of...</span></p> <p><span id="s851">MS: Very high.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">LF: Great prominence.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">MS: Yes, very high places.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">LF: And I might remind you that there was a great precedent set for that back as far as Queen Victoria, because Benjamin Disraeli...</span></p> <p><span id="s855">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">LF: Of course, was her Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">LF: It's true that people occasionally shunned Jews socially, but they certainly didn't after a few prominent marriages were made.</span> <span id="s859">Lord Mountbatten's wife, Edwina Ashley, was the niece of a converted Jewish banker.</span> <span id="s860">He did convert to Christianity, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s861">MS: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">LF: She had a great fortune from her uncle, who was one of King Edward's friends.</span> <span id="s863">And there was much less remark on an antisemitic basis after that...</span></p> <p><span id="s864">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">LF: Because she had married into the Royal Family.</span> <span id="s866">And it was quite well-known that many of the Royal Family were friendly with politically and banking prominent Jews, the Rothschilds, for example, and they were always treated with respect.</span> <span id="s867">And so was the average Jewish waiter who worked at Lyon's Corner House, or who sold you your sandwiches when you went to the race course, or who drove the London taxi in which you rode.</span> <span id="s868">You didn't see swastikas and hate things.</span> <span id="s869">And no shop windows got smashed.</span> <span id="s870">And when Moseley started his stuff, the police turned out in force.</span> <span id="s871">And he could strut the street and yell all his slogans, but there weren't any Crystal Nights in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">MS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">LF: Thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">MS: Thank God is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">LF: However, that didn't stop what was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s876">And Hitler was very definitely intent on taking over as much of Europe as he possibly could.</span> <span id="s877">And as events later proved, and all the things that we had seen on our trip that promised to be a total nightmare were becoming so.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">MS: It's an amazing thing that you had this experience just prior to everything coming into full bloom, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">LF: I think that it's largely due to the fact that my grandfather thought that it was an experience I should have.</span> <span id="s880">And it later stood me in very good stead.</span> <span id="s881">I didn't realize how much a part that trip was going to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">MS: In your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">LF: In what was going to happen to me later, but it did.</span> <span id="s884">And in actual fact, it played a part in me being selected to go on the trip to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">MS: Well we'll get to that, which should be a very interesting thing to hear...</span></p> <p><span id="s886">LF: And of course--you know, to skip a little bit over what was going on, you know, war came to England, because of the inv-, Hitler's invasion of Poland, and because we stood by the Polish-French Treaty.</span> <span id="s887">And war came to Britain on the 3rd of September, 1939.</span> <span id="s888">And for the, my father was back in Britain by that time, thank God.</span> <span id="s889">I was going to a very nice girls' public, which is private school, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">MS: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">LF: And we were nicely set in the country.</span> <span id="s892">Father was the Third Sea Lord, responsible for naval supply, naval repair, and ship building programs.</span> <span id="s893">And he was in London, but he came home weekends until after the outbreak of war, and then he usually came home about every third weekend after that.</span> <span id="s894">We went to live with my grandfather--my father's father--and my grandmother, on the family farm, where there was plenty of room and an enormous old house.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">MS: Was your mother's grandfather with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">LF: My mother's father was with us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">MS: Well, yes, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">LF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s899">MS: I meant your grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">LF: And life was fairly normal, I think, for, you know, a good part of 1939, until, of course, war was declared.</span> <span id="s901">And then, Father explained to me that he wasn't going to be home very much, that Grandfather Fraser could not run the farm because of his illness, and that Grandmother wasn't strong enough to do it, and there wasn't anybody else to do it.</span> <span id="s902">And he couldn't leave Grandfather Romanov in charge of the farm because he just didn't understand the British workman well enough.</span> <span id="s903">As sympathetic a character as he was, he would have been absolutely awful as far as the British workmen was concerned because he had a very imperial attitude, and they would have told him to go fly it.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s905">LF: So, it was explained to me that instead of being a weekly boarder and coming home every weekend, I was now going to become a day girl, and I was going to ride the bus to school, or go with one of the local businessmen or lawyers or doctors, you know, and catch whatever ride could be arranged for me.</span> <span id="s906">And my curriculum would be changed because I would have to spend more time at the farm.</span> <span id="s907">And I would come home every night.</span> <span id="s908">And, that was the end of childhood.</span> <span id="s909">I was now 12, pushing 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">MS: So you...</span></p> <p><span id="s911">LF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s912">MS: You were taken away from your public school [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">LF: No, I continued to go to the school, but on a, on the basis of being a day girl instead of being a boarder.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">MS: Rather than, O.K., oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">LF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s916">MS: But you remained at the same school.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">LF: I remained at the same school, which had been selected because I had pushed so hard for that particular school because of its academic standing.</span> <span id="s918">My sister was going to a much more socially prominent school, and I didn't give a hoot about it.</span> <span id="s919">I had tried a week there and I had run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s921">LF: And, they had been so scared that they gave in to me and let me go to Cheltenham Ladies, which had a far better academic reputation than where my sister was going, which was more the finishing schools type of place.</span> <span id="s922">And I began a servitude, and I call it that, although it really wasn't, because I had tons of personal freedom, that began in September of 1939 and continued until I joined the Navy in October of 1943.</span> <span id="s923">I began a series of days that, where I got up at 3:30 and was over in the milking sheds before 4 o’clock.</span> <span id="s924">And rushed in, and grabbed something for breakfast, and changed clothes, and threw myself into school clothes, and generally fell asleep, either in the bus or whoever's car I was riding in to Cheltenham, which was where the school was.</span> <span id="s925">And that was a 30-mile ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">MS: Each way?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">LF: No, it was actually about 18 miles each way, so it's...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">MS: 36 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">LF: A 36-mile round trip.</span> <span id="s930">And my curriculum was retailored so that I would have an earlier leaving hour in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s931">I was excused from daily French lessons.</span> <span id="s932">All I had to do was pass the exams and recite.</span> <span id="s933">And I was excused daily math because I was keeping the farm books.</span> <span id="s934">As long as I could bring them in and show that I was bringing them into trial balance I got my math grade.</span> <span id="s935">I still had to do algebra and geometry, to my great chagrin, because I did not like geometry at all.</span> <span id="s936">I kept on with all the other subjects.</span> <span id="s937">And I was in pre-college prep course.</span> <span id="s938">And, school's differently arranged in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">LF: And you usually begin this at about 11.</span> <span id="s941">I was taking Latin, and I was excused another language because of the--French and the Russian proficiency in the household.</span> <span id="s942">And I was excused most of the daily calisthenics things and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s943">That's how they managed to rearrange my schedule because I was getting all of that on the farm.</span> <span id="s944">Heaving feed sacks around and pushing recalcitrant cows around.</span> <span id="s945">And I virtually married a herd of cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s947">LF: 360 strong.</span> <span id="s948">And I oversaw the milking on a daily basis, twice a day, and those cows don't know whether it's Christmas, Easter, Passover...</span></p> <p><span id="s949">MS: They have to be milked!</span></p> <p><span id="s950">LF: Or, Ramadan!</span> <span id="s951">They don't care either.</span> <span id="s952">All they know is, "Moo!"</span> <span id="s953">They want to be milked twice a day.</span> <span id="s954">So, that was the daily routine, and then it was supper and homework and falling into exhausted sleep at 9 o’clock at night, or 9:30 at night.</span> <span id="s955">And sometimes getting up in the middle of the night and prowling the house to make sure that nobody had left any lights on and that we weren't contravening the blackout laws.</span> <span id="s956">Rushing in to see my mother, fighting my mother once a week because she wanted some supplies that weren't obtainable in war-time England, and that nobody was stocking anymore, complaining mightily to my father on the telephone, or when he came home, about the various things that were going on.</span> <span id="s957">And struggling to manage the invoices and all the various things.</span> <span id="s958">And, of course, then there are things like little pigs being born and horses that have to be curried.</span> <span id="s959">Now my Russian grandfather took over all the horses, both the riding horses, and the work horses.</span> <span id="s960">And we were very fortunate because we had four great big Shire horses, Clydesdale type horses.</span> <span id="s961">And, since there was going to be a petrol shortage, it was very, very urgent that we keep the horses, and keep them in good condition.</span> <span id="s962">And he adored horses, so he took over that whole job, which was an enormous job for one man, to feed them, to clean them, to work them, to train them, and to clean up their surroundings and make sure they got their proper care.</span> <span id="s963">And he gave them most of their veterinary care himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">MS: So that was a tremendous help to you of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">LF: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">MS: This had to have been a very large under--I'm not speaking of the undertaking, but the farm had to have been enormous.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">LF: The farm was 580 acres.</span> <span id="s968">And it is spread over orchards which just climb up a chalky hill, which forms part of England's largest northwest to, I'm sorry, southwest to northeast escarpment.</span> <span id="s969">And it forms the western end of that.</span> <span id="s970">And it's called the Cotswolds.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s972">LF: And we had apple and pear orchards that climbed the hills.</span> <span id="s973">We kept sheep up on the hills, later on, which was my doing.</span> <span id="s974">It was a way of getting more meat.</span> <span id="s975">It was also a way of producing wool and putting land that wasn't otherwise arable to use.</span> <span id="s976">We had some woodlands, so there was always wood to be cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">MS: Was, were the products of the farm useful to, in the war effort?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">LF: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s979">We had one of the finest dairy herds in England.</span> <span id="s980">They were Jersey and Guernsey cows.</span> <span id="s981">And every time you see Double Gloucester cheese, you're seeing the milk from our farm.</span> <span id="s982">We had a contract with the Gloucester Dairymen's Association, and our butterfat content from that herd was enormously high, so that was food production.</span> <span id="s983">[beeper going off] Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s984">MS: This is tape two, side two, of an interview with Leigh Fraser which we are going to continue at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">LF: The farm was large.</span> <span id="s986">It was 580 acres.</span> <span id="s987">We had apple and pear orchards.</span> <span id="s988">All of the food production during the war was very severely restricted by the Ministry of Food.</span> <span id="s989">And the kind of labor that we could employ and the way that we could employ people was controlled and governed by the Ministry of Labor.</span> <span id="s990">And I became a very good farm manager very rapidly.</span> <span id="s991">[phone; tape off then on] And I say that a little bit tongue-in-cheek because I had a lot of help from a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s992">The vet was a tremendous help.</span> <span id="s993">He was a family friend.</span> <span id="s994">The county agent.</span> <span id="s995">My grandfather could, both grandfathers, could give me advice while they couldn't physically do anything about it, and fortunately, those workers that were spared to us, who, because they were agricultural workers, were extremely loyal.</span> <span id="s996">And they worked very hard.</span> <span id="s997">The younger men who did go away to the war were very frequently replaced during times of great pressure by their wives.</span> <span id="s998">The women came, and they picked, and they, you know, when it was picking season.</span> <span id="s999">They came for haying.</span> <span id="s1000">They came on other occasions.</span> <span id="s1001">I did some things that were strictly off-the-record at that time, because I would tell the Ministry of Food that I was going to kill a pig, and I would kill three.</span> <span id="s1002">And I would distribute meat around to some of our workers and to some of the elderly people in the village who were darn nearly starving to death.</span> <span id="s1003">Because the rations were dreadful in England at the time.</span> <span id="s1004">Nothing like the things that you're going to hear about camp diets and things like that, but they were pretty dreadful.</span> <span id="s1005">People were limited to a purchase of six to eight ounces of fat per week.</span> <span id="s1006">It varied in what came, what was available.</span> <span id="s1007">Fat comprised butter, margarine, and other cooking fats, principally lard.</span> <span id="s1008">So, when I killed a pig, it wasn't just the meat.</span> <span id="s1009">It was the rendering.</span> <span id="s1010">And I was able to give some of the elderly people who had only one or two ration books and therefore couldn't club their things together to make anything, I was able to give them a little tub of lard so that they could fry potatoes, or make pastry, or even spread it on bread, which some of them did, and then toast the bread.</span> <span id="s1011">I was able to give them all sorts of awful meats from that, things that we didn't eat ourselves in the house, but they did.</span> <span id="s1012">Just as people, you know, certain people in this country eat chitlings, well the country people ate chitlings.</span> <span id="s1013">You didn't throw anything away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">MS: Certainly not in war time, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">LF: We rendered everything down.</span> <span id="s1016">And I used to do the same thing with the cracked eggs from the farm.</span> <span id="s1017">I would get these people to save their scant little bits of vegetable peelings.</span> <span id="s1018">I wasn't allowed to sell the cracked eggs.</span> <span id="s1019">I was supposed to feed them back to my pigs.</span> <span id="s1020">But I wasn't about to do that except for the ones that were badly cracked and had gotten dirt in, when there were people in the village that didn't see an egg.</span> <span id="s1021">So, when I went out with my pony and cart and my clean garbage cans to get the garbage, the wet garbage, you know, for the food peelings and things...</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">LF: For my pigs, then I also took out several boxes of cracked eggs, very carefully propped up so that they, you know, they still had the membrane whole, but they might have a crack, so I couldn't sell them.</span> <span id="s1024">And to each person who was kind enough, according to the number of eggs that I had, and the size of their family, I would dish out two, four, six eggs to them.</span> <span id="s1025">We all tried to help each other in this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">MS: Were you affected by bombings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">LF: We were not directly affected at the farm.</span> <span id="s1028">My grandmother and I came very close to death the second winter of the war because of the 1940 blitz.</span> <span id="s1029">We went up to London for her to get some teeth taken care of, and for me to see the dentist, and the steeple of the church next to us was struck by a falling bomb, and it fell into the house, and the house next door caught fire.</span> <span id="s1030">And it was a toss-up as to whether we were going, we had gone and taken refuge in the basement during the air-raid alert, and it was a toss-up as to whether the water that was being used to put the fire out was going to drown us, or whether we were going to be smothered by the smoke.</span> <span id="s1031">And at one quiet moment during the rescue that I heard and the fire-fighting going on next door, I remembered all the things that I had read about communicating with rescue people.</span> <span id="s1032">And I picked up something, the cellar was filling up with water, and I had Grandmother sitting up on top of a chest-of-drawers.</span> <span id="s1033">And I'd made stairs out of the drawers and was standing in some of those and trying to climb higher and higher all the time, trying to keep dry.</span> <span id="s1034">And I remembered what I'd read about the rescue manuals, and I picked up something and started to bang on the pipes.</span> <span id="s1035">And pretty soon I heard voices hollering, "Is there anybody there?"</span> <span id="s1036">And there were standard things, you banged one for yes, you know.</span> <span id="s1037">And then if they said, "Did you really bang?"</span> <span id="s1038">You banged three times, so that they knew that somebody really was and it wasn't just a falling thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">LF: So I began to do this series of bangs and then they asked how many people were in there, and I banged hard twice.</span> <span id="s1041">And they said, "Repeat."</span> <span id="s1042">And I banged hard twice.</span> <span id="s1043">"Where are you?</span> <span id="s1044">Are you in the basement?</span> <span id="s1045">Bang once, for yes."</span> <span id="s1046">And I banged again.</span> <span id="s1047">"Repeat."</span> <span id="s1048">So I banged again.</span> <span id="s1049">And after about five hours they got us out.</span> <span id="s1050">We were freezing.</span> <span id="s1051">It's cold.</span> <span id="s1052">England's very far north, you know, it's on the same latitude as Labrador, and it was darn cold.</span> <span id="s1053">But they got us out.</span> <span id="s1054">And the most awful night of all, which didn't directly affect us, but affected me profoundly in a spiritual sense.</span> <span id="s1055">The year that we went home, I was confirmed in the English Church.</span> <span id="s1056">And of course that's very similar to the Bat Mitzvah rite.</span> <span id="s1057">It's the same rite of passage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">MS: At approximately the same age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">LF: At approximately the same age.</span> <span id="s1060">I did that in the Fall of 1938, when we went home.</span> <span id="s1061">And, I did it where my uncle at that time was the assistant at the Cathedral Church of St. Michael in Coventry, which of course, is the Cathedral that was destroyed by the German bombs on the night of November the 14th, 1940.</span> <span id="s1062">And we could see fire and smoke.</span> <span id="s1063">Coventry isn't that far from home.</span> <span id="s1064">It's less than 50 miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">MS: From the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">LF: And from the hills on top of the farm, hundreds of people came up out of the valleys and the villages.</span> <span id="s1067">And we stood up on the Old Wool Way, which is where the wool used to be trekked on donkeys during Medieval times, and which goes along the crest of the hills.</span> <span id="s1068">And we stood up there on that ancient road that goes, really goes back to Roman times, and watched the glow and the smoke.</span> <span id="s1069">And of course it wasn't just the Cathedral.</span> <span id="s1070">The whole city was burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">MS: This is Coventry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">LF: Coventry was England's Detroit.</span> <span id="s1073">The motor center.</span> <span id="s1074">That's where the trucks and the tanks were being built.</span> <span id="s1075">And they couldn't stop the raid, even though they knew it was coming, because it would have given away what was subsequently revealed as the Ultra secret.</span> <span id="s1076">They had no other warning.</span> <span id="s1077">And nobody was ever warned of anything they learned on Ultra, which was the German cipher machine, unless they had a second way of confirming it.</span> <span id="s1078">When we finally broke the German codes, we broke it through a captured machine.</span> <span id="s1079">A machine was captured in a raid on France, at great cost of people's lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">MS: Now this is a part of history that I really know nothing about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">LF: So, they literally had to sacrifice Coventry because if they hadn't, they would have given away that they had an Ultra, and the Germans didn't know that we'd broken it.</span> <span id="s1082">They didn't know that we knew, they knew we had the machine, but they didn't think it could be broken, because it was a series of wheels, very intricate code system, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">MS: How did the English obtain this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">LF: It was obtained in a raid on Bruniquel, in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">MS: And that it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">LF: One of the cross-Channel raids that, at the cost of several French resistance people's lives, and several British commando soldiers' lives because it was vital that we get this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">MS: And this was the mechanism...</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">LF: By which they encrypted everything.</span> <span id="s1089">And it was such an intricate thing that when you set one wheel, it set the other five in the machine.</span> <span id="s1090">The machine was a series of wheels within wheels, and that's what did the actual encryption.</span> <span id="s1091">And it was not the kind of code that you could break by mathematical probability.</span> <span id="s1092">And of course, there weren't any computers in those days.</span> <span id="s1093">And the people at Bletchley Heath, which was the computer, I mean, the code-breaking center, were absolutely at their wit's end when that was captured.</span> <span id="s1094">It was a very, very carefully planned raid.</span> <span id="s1095">And I didn't learn about it until I was on Overlord staff.</span> <span id="s1096">And then I knew very little about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">MS: Because it was a top military secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">LF: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1099">So, that's how Coventry came to be the sacrificial city, was because they couldn't give it away.</span> <span id="s1100">If they had another form of intelligence, that would have obviated the Germans suspecting that we had that code, then they could warn people.</span> <span id="s1101">But, it was never used unless they had another confirmation.</span> <span id="s1102">And it was Coventry's bad luck.</span> <span id="s1103">And I don't mean that to sound as lightly as it does.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">MS: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">LF: I was very affected.</span> <span id="s1106">Because I could see myself walking down the aisle in that cathedral, with about 70 other kids, and kneeling in turn in front of the bishop, and reciting our Catechism vows, and then being blessed, and admitted to the congregation.</span> <span id="s1107">And, you know, as a formal member, rather than just a child...</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">LF: Of a family.</span> <span id="s1110">And you literally knelt there and said, "I declare myself a child of God."</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">MS: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">LF: And to see that gorgeous, gorgeous place destroyed, to know that all the voices that had worshiped in there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">MS: Cry and laugh and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">LF: Was, and cried and celebrated weddings...</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">LF: And buried their dead...</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">MS: All that history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">LF: It was pretty terrible.</span> <span id="s1119">The wonderful thing about the new cathedral is that when they built it, they built it right next door and they left the old one standing, after they made the walls safe.</span> <span id="s1120">They left the ruins standing as a perpetual memory.</span> <span id="s1121">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">MS: Really.</span> <span id="s1123">And it's still [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">LF: They, and they, and the old high altar is still there and across the front of it, it has in gold, "Father forgive."</span> <span id="s1125">And then there is a glass screen that links the two.</span> <span id="s1126">And on the glass screen are spectral figures incised, monks and nuns and kings and queens and little people, cobblers and workers and drivers and, you know, all the people that go to make up a great congregation.</span> <span id="s1127">People that have served there, bishops and priests, and they're all in a very stylized fashion.</span> <span id="s1128">It's quite chilling to see it.</span> <span id="s1129">But it's a great reminder, that, you know, that it's still a place of worship.</span> <span id="s1130">And people stroll on the grass.</span> <span id="s1131">They floored it with grass.</span> <span id="s1132">And after the war, to raise the money for the roof, the children of the Church of England went on a nation-wide Hegira.</span> <span id="s1133">The roof nails from the old leaded roof were all welded together.</span> <span id="s1134">And people cut some of them apart and formed a huge cross which was then placed on a wooden platform.</span> <span id="s1135">And that was then carried by the young people.</span> <span id="s1136">And those of us that were in the service after the war were given a few days leave to go and participate.</span> <span id="s1137">And it was carried into every village and hamlet in England.</span> <span id="s1138">And people went round with baskets, collecting money to, you know, as it was carried through.</span> <span id="s1139">It was met, and people prayed and sang hymns and psalms and then it rested in the village churches overnight.</span> <span id="s1140">And then went on to the next village.</span> <span id="s1141">And it was just an endless three-year long progression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">MS: But you had joined it obviously for just a few days, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">LF: And we, yes, each of us joined it for just a few days.</span> <span id="s1144">And took part in the carrying of the cross.</span> <span id="s1145">And all the other nails were cut apart and they were formed into crosses and sold.</span> <span id="s1146">And we had baskets of those to sell.</span> <span id="s1147">And of course people bought them, and sometimes that's all they did, and sometimes they just gave us two or three times the amount that we were asking.</span> <span id="s1148">And people wrote checks.</span> <span id="s1149">And that's how the money was raised for the new roof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">MS: Very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">LF: And that was great to be a part of it, because that was after all the awful stuff that came in between, you know, losing family members.</span> <span id="s1152">And there was hardly a family that we knew that didn't lose somebody.</span> <span id="s1153">And, after all the awful experiences of the camps and seeing Europe devastated, and half of Europe on the hoof looking for the other half...</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">LF: That sometimes didn't exist any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">MS: That's right.</span> <span id="s1157">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">LF: There were no homes to go to.</span> <span id="s1159">There were no families to go home.</span> <span id="s1160">And you needed a spiritual event like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">MS: To restore some faith into your life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">LF: And so something good came out of something bad, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">MS: Yes, yes, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">LF: And it was a very tough time.</span> <span id="s1165">And that went on, of course the, the bombing and we were not directly bombed.</span> <span id="s1166">We had a few stray bombs.</span> <span id="s1167">We had a bit of excitement once when one of the German planes came down on a neighboring farm.</span> <span id="s1168">It had been shot down, and the villagers took the pilot and the crew prisoner with pitchforks.</span> <span id="s1169">[both laugh] Kind of funny, but they [chuckling] marched them through the village in classic fashion, with pitchforks, and with their hands tied behind them with horse ropes and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">MS: And turned them over to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">LF: And turned them over to the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">MS: Police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">LF: And one or two lone policemen who said, "Well, we don't know what to do with this.</span> <span id="s1174">Let you boys better stick around!"</span> <span id="s1175">And somebody, you know, somebody said, "Well, it's time for dinner."</span> <span id="s1176">And I remember the policeman saying, "It's probably time for dinner for them too.</span> <span id="s1177">So if you get something for yourself, you'd better get something for them."</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">MS: Such good feelings towards an enemy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">LF: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">MS: Is pretty amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">LF: You know, more than they showed towards some of our guys, and more than they showed to the people in the camps.</span> <span id="s1182">But they did, they got fed.</span> <span id="s1183">And you know, we had German prisoners on the farm.</span> <span id="s1184">I spoke about that earlier and you asked me to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">LF: Remember to mention it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">MS: Yes, please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">LF: And, we'd had Italian prisoners and then, of course, when the Italians came out of the war, you know, after Mussolini was executed, we began to get German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1189">And the Italian prisoners were taken somewhere else and interned, but not as prisoners.</span> <span id="s1190">I think they were taken to Canada for safety, because there was a promise that they would not be used in any way in the war or endangered anymore.</span> <span id="s1191">And we began to get Germans.</span> <span id="s1192">And I wouldn't like to have anyone believe that I thought they were marvelous, but by and large, they were pretty ordinary lads.</span> <span id="s1193">And I had virtually no trouble with them.</span> <span id="s1194">We had elderly men who were veterans of the First World War, homeguardsmen, as they were called, guarding them.</span> <span id="s1195">Sometimes with only three bullets [chuckling] in their rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">MS: But the Germans didn't know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">LF: The Germans didn't know that, of course, because they had a whole load of dummy cartridges.</span> <span id="s1198">But they were pretty content.</span> <span id="s1199">They were getting fed.</span> <span id="s1200">They were getting fed better than they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">MS: As German prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">LF: As Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">LF: They were not being told a pack of lies.</span> <span id="s1205">They slept in fairly primitive conditions in a Nissen Hut, you know, with wooden bunks, but they had British Army thin, what we call biscuit mattresses, and a couple of blankets, and a place to bathe.</span> <span id="s1206">And, they could do their wash in the stream, because we had a big stream that ran through the property and they could drag buckets of water up and they could wash their clothes and then they could hang them on the trees and the bushes to dry.</span> <span id="s1207">So they were clean.</span> <span id="s1208">They were never louse-infested and typhus-ridden and starved to death.</span> <span id="s1209">They were looked after.</span> <span id="s1210">And when mine came up to help with the milking, as they did every night, they didn't come up in the dark.</span> <span id="s1211">They were not allowed up in the mornings.</span> <span id="s1212">The homeguardsmen didn't want them trotting around the place in the dark, in the early morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">MS: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">LF: So my people did the milking in the morning and then they came to work a bit later, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">MS: How many prisoners of war did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">LF: We had ten at one time, but the average was about six or seven.</span> <span id="s1217">They came, and they worked.</span> <span id="s1218">They ran the machinery.</span> <span id="s1219">They drove the tractor.</span> <span id="s1220">They did all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s1221">They felled wood and cut wood, you know, which we used for heat at home, and which we used to run the dairy boiler.</span> <span id="s1222">And they were given wood to take down to put in their stove to keep their hut warm.</span> <span id="s1223">They were locked in the hut at night, and the home guards patrolled all night.</span> <span id="s1224">Only one or two men, but, you know, and they were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">MS: I think they realized how well they had it, how...</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">LF: But they did realize how well they had it, and at the end of evening milking, I always gave them their cans of milk and told them to help themselves to the cracked eggs because they cooked their own meals down there.</span> <span id="s1227">And they drew their rations on a daily basis from us, and we always gave them a scrupulous amount.</span> <span id="s1228">And if I killed a pig, they got meat.</span> <span id="s1229">Or if I decided that it was a holiday, and you know, if there were going to be some chickens, or I was killing off chickens because winter was coming and I didn't want to use the grain on them, they usually got a chicken or two.</span> <span id="s1230">And they knew it.</span> <span id="s1231">And they would politely thank you.</span> <span id="s1232">And you could tell by the way they looked and behaved, because they were always polite, always.</span> <span id="s1233">I never had trouble until we got the one Luftwaffe Leutnant.</span> <span id="s1234">And, the officers were not compelled to work, by reason of the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s1235">But this one had volunteered.</span> <span id="s1236">And then he began to be a rabble-rouser, and he began to be a nuisance.</span> <span id="s1237">And by this time when we got him, I was in the service.</span> <span id="s1238">I don't think I would have allowed it.</span> <span id="s1239">But, somebody made the decision that it was reasonably harmless.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">MS: Who ran the farm once you went into the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">LF: A young man from a neighboring farm.</span> <span id="s1242">A young man called Llewellyn Gilbert, who, whose family owned a farm down the road.</span> <span id="s1243">As a matter of fact, his father was a nobleman and they had a big place similar to ours.</span> <span id="s1244">And Gilbert had been an officer in one of the guard's regiments and had been wounded in the western desert, in north Africa, and had been invalided out because his wounds were so bad.</span> <span id="s1245">He lost part of a leg, and he walked with the aid of a cane.</span> <span id="s1246">And he had, the sight of one eye was destroyed.</span> <span id="s1247">And his shoulder was very badly injured.</span> <span id="s1248">And he just simply was not in condition to go on as a fighting man.</span> <span id="s1249">And, I had taken him on during the summer that I was 16.</span> <span id="s1250">I was leaving school.</span> <span id="s1251">I wanted to go to college that summer.</span> <span id="s1252">I was tired of the farm.</span> <span id="s1253">I was really, truly tired.</span> <span id="s1254">And I don't want that to sound like a complaint, but I was.</span> <span id="s1255">I was frequently running 14 and 16-hour days.</span> <span id="s1256">And in the summer, sometimes 18-hour days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">MS: A tremendous undertaking for a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">LF: And there were sick people, sick grandparents in the house, and my mother, who was mentally unstable.</span> <span id="s1259">And, of course, I hadn't said anything about it earlier, but in May of 1941, the most awful things befell my family.</span> <span id="s1260">My two oldest brothers were killed on subsequent days.</span> <span id="s1261">One during the German invasion of Crete, while the British were trying to withdraw from Crete.</span> <span id="s1262">He was on the Destroyer Kelly, which was Admiral Mountbatten's ship, then Captain Mountbatten.</span> <span id="s1263">And he was killed on the 23rd of May, and my oldest brother was an assistant navigator on HMS Hood.</span> <span id="s1264">Hood was sunk by the Bismark, in the Denmark Strait, between Iceland and the Canadian coastline.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">MS: A submarine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">LF: No, no, Bismark was German's mightiest warship, and HMS Hood was the pride of the Royal Navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">MS: Oh, [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">LF: She was a battle cruiser.</span> <span id="s1269">No, they were blown apart.</span> <span id="s1270">1400 men were killed with one salvo.</span> <span id="s1271">There were only three survivors.</span> <span id="s1272">And, that happened in the early hours of the morning on May the 24th.</span> <span id="s1273">And on May the 29th, my sister was killed at St. Thomas' Hospital in London where she was a nursing student by this time.</span> <span id="s1274">And she was decapitated, throwing herself across a stretcher, on which two children who had been injured in the previous night's raid were lying.</span> <span id="s1275">She couldn't make it to the basement with them.</span> <span id="s1276">They'd been evacuating the children.</span> <span id="s1277">This was a stray bomb.</span> <span id="s1278">This was not, the Blitz, in effect, was over, but this was one of those hit-and-run raids.</span> <span id="s1279">And, I didn't tell my mother about my brothers.</span> <span id="s1280">My father and I discussed it.</span> <span id="s1281">And we decided since there were no bodies and my mother was pretty unstable anyway that we wouldn't tell her.</span> <span id="s1282">My mother had a heart condition too, which was brought on by some of the privations of she had suffered in Russia, and then having too many children too quickly, which nobody realized was so detrimental to her.</span> <span id="s1283">And she was so wild about my father, I guess, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">LF: Children come when those things happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">MS: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">LF: But anyway, when my sister was killed, we had to tell her, and we decided with the help of the doctor and my Uncle Tim, the one that was the priest, to tell her the whole lot.</span> <span id="s1288">We decided if we were gonna have a scene, we might as well have a major scene.</span> <span id="s1289">And, those things take their toll.</span> <span id="s1290">They take their toll on everybody.</span> <span id="s1291">Everybody in the house was oppressed by my mother's instability.</span> <span id="s1292">I frequently had to cope with things thrown, and stupid requests, I mean, really, truly inane requests.</span> <span id="s1293">Stupid is a terrible word, but it, but they were so ineffably stupid that there was nothing else to call them.</span> <span id="s1294">Demands that we get her things that couldn't be found in all of England, and you certainly weren't going to cross the Atlantic for them, or, ask anyone to send them to you.</span> <span id="s1295">And just overwork, and too long a war, and too much responsibility.</span> <span id="s1296">And I was by that time sick of it.</span> <span id="s1297">And I hated, hated, hated Germans.</span> <span id="s1298">I was ready to go to Germany and take on Hitler, Göring, and Ribbentrop with my bare hands.</span> <span id="s1299">If I could have gone, I would have.</span> <span id="s1300">And that summer, I browbeat and bribed my father into getting me an age waiver.</span> <span id="s1301">I would have been eligible to go into the Wrens, or go into any of the services the following year, when I was 18.</span> <span id="s1302">But I knew he could get me an age waiver, at 17.</span> <span id="s1303">And I had some romantic idea that I was going to go down and run little boats around the harbor.</span> <span id="s1304">And he beat me over the head and shoulders and said he'd get the age waiver for me, if I acceded to doing what he wanted me to do in the Wrens, and that was to become an interpreter, because I had language skills, and any fool could run a boat.</span> <span id="s1305">And I saw the sense of what he was saying, so I went in as what they call a Marked Cadet, which meant that I was entering basic training, which was cut to nine weeks as I went in, fortunately.</span> <span id="s1306">And I entered on my 17th birthday, on October the 25th, 1943.</span> <span id="s1307">I did nine weeks of basic training, came home for about three days and then went straight off to Officer Training School.</span> <span id="s1308">And that was the magnificent number of ten weeks.</span> <span id="s1309">Fortunately, I knew my way through the Navy, so they didn't have to teach me about the Navy.</span> <span id="s1310">And I came out and was immediately assigned to Combined Operations staff as an interpreter because there were so many Norwegians and free French, and there was just always chaos.</span> <span id="s1311">And there was always somebody yelling for an interpreter, to iron out something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">MS: And at this time you were fluent in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">LF: French and Russian.</span> <span id="s1314">I began to pick up smatterings of other people's languages because apparently I've got that kind of an ear.</span> <span id="s1315">I began to pick up smatterings of Danish and Norwegian, enough to intervene when people were coming to an argument because they really didn't understand each other because their command of English, which was sometimes reasonable, just didn't extend to understanding the other person's accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">LF: And so I would jump in, and I would find out if they spoke one of the other languages that I spoke.</span> <span id="s1318">Or, I would listen very carefully to them, in their version of English, and then turn to the other person and say, "This is what he is saying.</span> <span id="s1319">He's saying it differently to what you do, but this is what he is saying."</span> <span id="s1320">And it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">MS: So it worked for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">LF: It worked.</span> <span id="s1323">And that led me to the next job, which was to go onto Admiral Bertram Ramsey's staff.</span> <span id="s1324">Admiral Ramsey was the operational naval planner for Operation Overlord, the liberation of France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">MS: And you were a commissioned officer at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">LF: By that time I was a commissioned officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">MS: At what rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">LF: Well, it would have been the equivalent of a..</span> <span id="s1329">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">MS: First Lieutenant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">LF: No, it would have been the equivalent...</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">MS: Oh, “ensign.”</span> <span id="s1333">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">MS: This is tape three, side one, of an interview with Leigh Fraser, which we are continuing this evening.</span> <span id="s1335">And I'm going to let Leigh take over at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">LF: When we left off before, I hadn't quite answered the question about what my rank was.</span> <span id="s1337">The Wrens use a different nomenclature to the majority of the other forces, and I was officially a Third Officer.</span> <span id="s1338">That would equate with an Ensign in the United States Navy, but we don't have Ensigns in the Royal Navy.</span> <span id="s1339">We have sub-lieutenants and so that would have been my equivalent rank.</span> <span id="s1340">And I had just joined Admiral Ramsey's staff.</span> <span id="s1341">Admiral Ramsey was the Channel Commander in Neptune, which was the seaborne portion of Operation Overlord, the liberation of Normandy, or the invasion into Normandy.</span> <span id="s1342">I spent two days at sea, highly unusual for a woman officer, and that was directly at Admiral Ramsey's urging, because he said that since I'd been part of the bucket brigade, the dirty work, then I should be there to see some of the scrubbing done.</span> <span id="s1343">And so I thoroughly enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1344">It was, I say enjoyed it, but it was awe-inspiring.</span> <span id="s1345">I've never seen so many ships, so many planes, so many people intent on one purpose.</span> <span id="s1346">And, of course, it was a very stress-filled period, because there were hours, literally long hours where things hung in the balance, where we didn't really know whether we had a foothold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">MS: Did you, were you sort of stationed, well, not stationed, but, just sitting out there and watching all these invading forces come through, or were you moving right along with them?</span> <span id="s1348">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">LF: I was on the flagship, HMS Belfast, and my official job was telephone-talker with the French fleet, the French elements of the fleet.</span> <span id="s1350">We had a secondary code which was based on some of the inside jokes that I knew from the French officers.</span> <span id="s1351">There was an official code, but there was also this secondary code in case the Germans started to interrupt and cross our communication lines.</span> <span id="s1352">They weren't prepared, and they didn't, as it happened, but the set-up was there, and that's really why I was along because I have a fairly distinctive voice, I knew these inside jokes, and if we had to move to secondary communication, then that was going to be the key to this being an official communication rather than someone else faking it.</span> <span id="s1353">Anyway, I got through those couple of days.</span> <span id="s1354">And, of course, as everyone knows, the landings were successful, and very shortly after that all the Overlord planning staff were disbanded, with the exception of those people who continued with their operational units.</span> <span id="s1355">I wasn't one of them.</span> <span id="s1356">And people decided that for a youngster, and a fresh-called officer, I'd had enough excitement.</span> <span id="s1357">And I should go and do something much more orthodox for a change.</span> <span id="s1358">So they packed me off to Burfield, which is in the country, outside of London, near the city of Reading.</span> <span id="s1359">And I became a staff officer at the Women's Royal Naval Service Training Establishment.</span> <span id="s1360">And that's where I stayed until a rather momentous phone call, which now has much more to do with the main subject.</span> <span id="s1361">I was relieved on an emergency basis from my normal duties, which were just simply training and administrative duties, on the morning of April the 16th, 1945.</span> <span id="s1362">Someone came yelling and got me off a parade ground, and told me that I was to get down to headquarters right away.</span> <span id="s1363">And when I got down there, they said, "What have you done now, Fraser?</span> <span id="s1364">They want you in London."</span> <span id="s1365">And I said, "I don't know what I've done now.</span> <span id="s1366">But, what do you mean they want me in London?"</span> <span id="s1367">And I was told, "You're going to get a set of orders.</span> <span id="s1368">You are to pack warm clothing.</span> <span id="s1369">You are to take your medical records, and you are to do it right now.</span> <span id="s1370">And we'll have a car waiting for you.</span> <span id="s1371">You've got 45 minutes to pack."</span> <span id="s1372">So, I called a couple of friends of mine and asked them to take care of the rest of my gear, grabbed all the warm clothing that I could find, and all the chocolate and other things that I could grab from other people, because I knew that I was going somewhere, didn't know where I was going, didn't know what they were gonna do about supplying food, and didn't trust it either [chuckling].</span> <span id="s1373">And the chocolate stood me in very good stead in other ways, too, because I rounded up about four pounds of chocolate, which was very scarce in those days.</span> <span id="s1374">But I talked everybody else out of it.</span> <span id="s1375">And I arrived in London, very curious, wanting to know what was going on, and they told me at Women's Royal Naval Service Headquarters to stop asking silly questions.</span> <span id="s1376">They reviewed my medical records.</span> <span id="s1377">They insisted that I get a typhus anti-toxin, and then they said to me, "Now, you get yourself over to War Office."</span> <span id="s1378">And I said, "War Office?"</span> <span id="s1379">And they said, "Well, by way of the Navy, because there are gonna be a couple of Marines and a couple of other people going with you, and a couple of other Naval officers.</span> <span id="s1380">And then you'll go down to the War Office."</span> <span id="s1381">So they dumped me off with my bag, and all my goodies, and I started asking tons and tons of questions, and I had more temerity than most people because it's a fact that I had a fairly prominent father.</span> <span id="s1382">My father was an Admiral and I really wasn't very reticent about asking questions where a green or junior officer would have been.</span> <span id="s1383">I must have been a pretty holy terror, I think.</span> <span id="s1384">We went down to Horse Guard's Parade, which was the big arch, and most people have seen this, where the Trooping of the Color takes place.</span> <span id="s1385">And in the offices behind that big square we were greeted and told to sort of hurry up and wait.</span> <span id="s1386">More reviews of stuff, and people started arriving, and they started giving us coffee and sandwiches, and as we kept on pressing the staff officers, we were told, "You'll find out very shortly."</span> <span id="s1387">And, in the late afternoon they began to brief us on what our mission was.</span> <span id="s1388">That was when I learned for the very first time that we were going to go to a concentration camp, that Bergen-Belsen had been overrun, that the combat unit had requested assistance, that they needed interpreters, that the Royal Army Medical Corps was being alerted and sending some people in another team, that the Royal Army Service Corps, which does all the catering and supplies all the food, was also going to be alerted, that there would be Red Cross people there.</span> <span id="s1389">And after a lot of rather hideous preparation, and a lot of routine stuff, we were then sent out to Northholt, which is an airdrome on the outskirts of London.</span> <span id="s1390">And, that's where we were loaded into a plane and we set off for Germany.</span> <span id="s1391">I didn't know much about where I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">MS: Leigh, I would like to ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1393">Well, you almost answered it.</span> <span id="s1394">At this point in time, when they mentioned that you were going to a concentration camp, did you have any inkling of an idea of what a concentration camp was?</span> <span id="s1395">Had you heard anything about the incarceration of Jews during the time that you were in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">LF: Actually, yes, but not so much from in the service.</span> <span id="s1397">I knew it before.</span> <span id="s1398">I knew it in about 1942, and I knew it mostly from my father.</span> <span id="s1399">Not this particular concentration camp, I just knew about concentration camps in general.</span> <span id="s1400">My father had done some talking with his friends in front of me.</span> <span id="s1401">The British press had reported that there were some centers where people were deported to.</span> <span id="s1402">We were hearing rather hideous stories from refugees and escapees from Europe.</span> <span id="s1403">And some of them had some pretty terrible stories.</span> <span id="s1404">I've got to tell you that officially, there were some really strange remarks made about not believing these, and I quote, "rather wild stories" coming out of Europe.</span> <span id="s1405">When I questioned my father about that, he said, "I think they've got their heads in the wrong place, that these are not such wild stories.</span> <span id="s1406">They're going to turn out to be all too terribly true."</span> <span id="s1407">And I began to watch the press fairly carefully.</span> <span id="s1408">I'd heard about mass shootings too, in this same time frame, but not about any gassings.</span> <span id="s1409">What I'd heard were that truckloads of Jews were being taken out into the countryside, and forced into ditches, and shot in the ditches.</span> <span id="s1410">And I learned about the gas chambers during the afternoon briefings on April the 16th.</span> <span id="s1411">That's when I got official confirmation that there were gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1412">I wasn't the only one who was absolutely aghast.</span> <span id="s1413">There were men who were experienced combat people.</span> <span id="s1414">There were lots of staff people.</span> <span id="s1415">There were people who had seen some pretty terrible things during the course of their life in the service.</span> <span id="s1416">Some of them had been at war in the western desert, and others had been working with refugee organizations, debriefing refugees.</span> <span id="s1417">And some of us, and I was one of them, had driven people to air-fields in the middle of the night, people who were actually resistance people.</span> <span id="s1418">And we were always told never to ask them any questions.</span> <span id="s1419">But we inevitably heard things from them, and heard things from other people that we picked up at those same airports in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s1420">So it wasn't exactly a total surprise that the Germans were doing some pretty terrible things.</span> <span id="s1421">I don't know whether I mentioned this earlier, but I absolutely hated Germans at this stage.</span> <span id="s1422">This was the pressure for me to get into the service.</span> <span id="s1423">I had lost one brother on the 23rd of May, 1941, when the HMS Kelly went down during the German paratroop invasion of Crete.</span> <span id="s1424">I lost another brother on the 24th of May, 1941.</span> <span id="s1425">He was on HMS Hood, which was sunk by the Bismarck, in Bismarck's only foray, before the British fleet caught up with Bismarck and in turn sank her.</span> <span id="s1426">And on the 29th of May, my sister was decapitated by a German bomb while serving as a student nurse in London.</span> <span id="s1427">All of that unhinged my mother, who was not terribly stable anyway, because of the fact that she had been a refugee from the terror, the Red Terror, in Russia, during the Czarist deposition.</span> <span id="s1428">And, my feeling, quite frankly, in all of that time, was that I could have taken on half the German army singlehandedly.</span> <span id="s1429">Just give me a good machine gun.</span> <span id="s1430">So, that was my motivation in joining.</span> <span id="s1431">Hate's not always the best motivation, but it was mine at that time.</span> <span id="s1432">We arrived in Germany late at night, on the 16th of April, and we were bussed to Bergen-Belsen, which was a really infamous, and very large camp.</span> <span id="s1433">It lies between Bremen and Celle, in northwest Germany.</span> <span id="s1434">I didn't know it at that point, but I was going to spend most of the next eight months in Germany.</span> <span id="s1435">I spent about two weeks at Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1436">And later on, on various assignments, I was loaned to the Americans, and I went to Nordhausen.</span> <span id="s1437">I went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1438">I went, finally, to Dachau and then to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s1439">And I went to Ravensbrück at the request of the Russians, who wanted Allied Forces in there so that they knew, that we knew in the West, that they were not making up these things.</span> <span id="s1440">And, I'll talk later about those.</span> <span id="s1441">But the point at hand now, of course, is arriving in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1442">We were all on a bus.</span> <span id="s1443">We had asked some of the soldiers various things, and they had told us some pretty horrifying things.</span> <span id="s1444">And the bus was being driven by a soldier.</span> <span id="s1445">What happened absolutely defies description.</span> <span id="s1446">There was a feeling when we went through the gate, which had the standard Arbeit Macht Frei over it, a feeling of absolute and utter evil.</span> <span id="s1447">There was evidence of bodies outside the gate.</span> <span id="s1448">There were trains on sidings all over the place.</span> <span id="s1449">There were sentries.</span> <span id="s1450">Most of it was blacked out.</span> <span id="s1451">But the bus was being driven by headlights, and I'd come from a blacked-out country, so when I saw full headlights, I knew that the Germans had to be absolutely on the run, which we understood to be the case in England.</span> <span id="s1452">It was like a vision of hell when we went through that gate.</span> <span id="s1453">Just the enormity was absolutely stunning.</span> <span id="s1454">The bus made a right-hand turn, shortly after we went through the gate, and the light swept over what looked like a wall.</span> <span id="s1455">And I caught a couple of things that really--I was sitting right behind the driver.</span> <span id="s1456">I caught a couple of things, and I literally demanded of the bus driver that he stop.</span> <span id="s1457">And I turned and said to the Brigadier General, who was in charge of us, who was sitting across the aisle from me, "Sir, I think we ought to have him back up.</span> <span id="s1458">I don't know if you saw that, but I think everybody ought to see that."</span> <span id="s1459">And he said, "What?"</span> <span id="s1460">And I said, "I think those are bodies."</span> <span id="s1461">So, the Brigadier said to the driver, "Back up into a position.</span> <span id="s1462">Put your lights full on that wall and stay steady."</span> <span id="s1463">It wasn't a wall.</span> <span id="s1464">It was a city block long.</span> <span id="s1465">I mean it.</span> <span id="s1466">A city block long!</span> <span id="s1467">And there were bodies, 15 to 20 feet high, arms, legs, heads, feet sticking out.</span> <span id="s1468">They were all naked, all emaciated, stacked like some sort of an inhuman mural.</span> <span id="s1469">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s1470">And I really think that the authorities wanted us shocked.</span> <span id="s1471">They wanted us shocked so that the next day we would start acting accordingly.</span> <span id="s1472">We did tramp through some barracks that night.</span> <span id="s1473">I've never seen such filth, never, ever seen such filth.</span> <span id="s1474">There were the most grotesque, emaciated figures walking around, shuffling around, I should say, because some of them could barely move.</span> <span id="s1475">There were moans, and groans.</span> <span id="s1476">It was like walking through a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1477">There were people dying.</span> <span id="s1478">There were people incapable of walking.</span> <span id="s1479">There were people crawling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">MS: I want to ask you, when you came in, were you the first to arrive at the, on that scene, or had other soldiers, English soldiers, gotten there prior to your arrival?</span> <span id="s1481">Do you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">LF: The combat units had gone in, and we were there at their request because it was beyond them to cope with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">MS: But how far behind the combat units would you say...</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">LF: We were about 24 hours behind them.</span> <span id="s1485">The combat units really couldn't do much.</span> <span id="s1486">They started yelling for help, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">MS: Yes, [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">LF: I gather that they gave people bread, that they gave people some of their rations and they gave them cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1489">But the filth, they couldn't cope with.</span> <span id="s1490">The officers, quite rightly, would not risk their men, because they couldn't afford to have a combat unit decimated by illness.</span> <span id="s1491">And it was quite obvious from the word go that lots of these people were in the throes of typhus, that they were very, very ill.</span> <span id="s1492">The stench had to be smelled to believe it.</span> <span id="s1493">It was like the Aegean stables.</span> <span id="s1494">You expected these people to topple over.</span> <span id="s1495">It was like moving among the living dead.</span> <span id="s1496">I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so awful in my life.</span> <span id="s1497">One of the questions that was posed to me in preparation for this was could I estimate the number of prisoners and the number of dead, and any near-death that were saved.</span> <span id="s1498">The answers to those are just terrible.</span> <span id="s1499">There were approximately ten to eleven thousand living males.</span> <span id="s1500">There were about 28,000 plus living females, if you can call some of those people living.</span> <span id="s1501">And I don't mean this to sound as bland as it does.</span> <span id="s1502">I've gone through some diaries and some records that I had.</span> <span id="s1503">There were about 13,000 plus unburied corpses lying around.</span> <span id="s1504">We learned that typhus had broken out in February of 1945.</span> <span id="s1505">This was now mid-April.</span> <span id="s1506">You can just imagine the ghastly, ghastly scene.</span> <span id="s1507">About 40,000 plus had been cremated since the outbreak of typhus.</span> <span id="s1508">The, we were told that the furnaces couldn't keep up.</span> <span id="s1509">And even the Kapos, who were usually better treated by the Germans, and who mistreated prisoners themselves, were sickening, and dying.</span> <span id="s1510">And they were much better fed than the average prisoner.</span> <span id="s1511">The living were in that awfully emaciated state that's called cachexia, where they can't absorb any nutriment at all.</span> <span id="s1512">They are right at the door of death.</span> <span id="s1513">Typhus was still rampant.</span> <span id="s1514">There was a lot of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s1515">We lost between thirteen and thirteen-and-a-half thousand people in the next eight to ten days, who were so far gone--this is out of nearly forty thousand living--from these causes.</span> <span id="s1516">The British Red Cross came in to help.</span> <span id="s1517">The Royal Army Medical Corps came in.</span> <span id="s1518">The medics worked terribly hard.</span> <span id="s1519">They deloused people because, of course, typhus is spread by lice.</span> <span id="s1520">They were puffing DDT down people's clothing, and the people who were in the worst rags that we could get any clothes for, we were forcing them to strip off and delousing them and taking their clothes away.</span> <span id="s1521">It was just an endless nightmare, and the death rate finally dropped, if you can call it dropped, to 150 to 200 a day.</span> <span id="s1522">That lasted for about three weeks, and it dropped again.</span> <span id="s1523">When I came back, in late May, from the other camps that I went on to, it was about 100 to 125 a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">MS: Did they set up a hospital...</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">LF: Yes, I'll get to that arrangement in a minute.</span> <span id="s1526">The, by June they had the death rate down to about 50 to 75 a day.</span> <span id="s1527">And again, that sounds terribly callous to talk about it like that, but if you can just imagine what was going on in that camp, they would have all been dead within very short order.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">MS: Had you not been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">LF: Had the camp not been overrun and had help not arrived.</span> <span id="s1530">The camp wasn't exclusively Jewish.</span> <span id="s1531">Most, the majority of the people were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1532">There were no children there.</span> <span id="s1533">There were lots and lots of anti-Nazis and dissenters against the regime.</span> <span id="s1534">There were some male teenagers.</span> <span id="s1535">I saw no family groups whatsoever, and later learned that there were no family groups.</span> <span id="s1536">The, what was going on there was just absolutely so awful, it really does defy description.</span> <span id="s1537">The jobs that were given to the team I was with were not directly concerned with either transportation of these former prisoners, or their care.</span> <span id="s1538">And by the way, they had to be held as prisoners, because of the illness.</span> <span id="s1539">The camp was still locked at night, and I gathered from the combat troops that the Germans that were inside the camp with them had gone on killing people during the 24 hours that they were outside.</span> <span id="s1540">Our troops killed a lot of Germans when they got in.</span> <span id="s1541">My direct duties weren't really involved with transportation or immediate care in providing food or medical care.</span> <span id="s1542">That's not really my job.</span> <span id="s1543">It, inevitably we got involved.</span> <span id="s1544">And I don't mean that to sound as callous either, but I was there for a specific reason.</span> <span id="s1545">I was there to interview, to obtain vital data, to fill out and assist with questionnaires, their names, their date and place of birth, their nationality, the point at which they were seized by the Germans, how they were seized, which other camps they'd been in, whether they had been tortured or beaten, who did it, did they know what had happened to their families, did they know where their families were, if they were still alive, who else was transported with them, any other information that we could obtain from them.</span> <span id="s1546">Because we knew we had a ghastly mess to deal with.</span> <span id="s1547">And someone had to begin with that somewhere.</span> <span id="s1548">And we, our team was ordered, of course, to cooperate in every respect with the medics, and not to really try to plague people who were too sick to answer, but to get those who could to cooperate with us.</span> <span id="s1549">When we went in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">MS: Excuse me, did you find that the prisoners were willing to talk, those that were able to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">LF: There were some strange reactions.</span> <span id="s1552">We actually began to work with them the next morning.</span> <span id="s1553">We drove into camp about seven o’clock in the morning on the 17th of April, in the bus, and the building which was our headquarters had been the former S.S. officers'.</span> <span id="s1554">We were all wearing battle-dress, not dress uniforms, and after dumping, you know, various things, and set-, spending a few minutes setting up a place to return to, you walked out with a clipboard, and a whole supply of pens and pencils.</span> <span id="s1555">And we had been warned to take plenty of handkerchiefs with us, because we were, one, possibly going to have to tie some around our faces, because of the disgusting smells, and two, that they pretty well warned us that no human being could look at this and not weep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">MS: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">LF: When we walked out into the camp area, I was with with other women officers, and we were escorted by four armed male enlisted soldiers, British soldiers.</span> <span id="s1558">We walked through the male section of the camp.</span> <span id="s1559">And, the camp was segregated by male and female.</span> <span id="s1560">We went across the camp.</span> <span id="s1561">The camp is pretty big.</span> <span id="s1562">It's about a mile long by about a quarter of a mile wide, total area.</span> <span id="s1563">We walked most of that quarter of a mile across the camp, and then another quarter of a mile up the camp, I would say, to get to the women's section.</span> <span id="s1564">The male inmates were absolutely gaping when they saw good, strong, healthy women walking through the camp.</span> <span id="s1565">And I might add, we were all wearing side-arms too.</span> <span id="s1566">We'd been ordered to continue to wear pistols.</span> <span id="s1567">Because you just simply didn't know what you were going to encounter somewhere.</span> <span id="s1568">You know, whether there would be Germans hiding among them, whether there would be an attempt to murder us, or to murder other prisoners, and so we were not deprived of our arms, any more than the combat troops had been.</span> <span id="s1569">The prisoners were obv-, the male prisoners were obviously absolutely amazed.</span> <span id="s1570">They gaped, they pointed, and then they acted frightened.</span> <span id="s1571">They were very subdued and very warily curious about us.</span> <span id="s1572">And they began to follow our little group at a distance and were only stopped from doing that by the men who were going to come out and question them, coming out and starting to work in the same fashion that we were going to work when we got into the women's section.</span> <span id="s1573">We walked in with bull-horns and great big printed signs that we'd made on big pieces of cardboard, poster-size pieces of cardboard, in several languages.</span> <span id="s1574">We announced that we were British.</span> <span id="s1575">The cardboard sign said the same thing.</span> <span id="s1576">"We will help you.</span> <span id="s1577">Please come to me if you speak this language."</span> <span id="s1578">And we settled into some tents that were set up for us by the combat people that had wood floors and were equipped with a table and chairs and a wood stove because it was still pretty chilly.</span> <span id="s1579">And the inmates, the women inmates were quite frightened, but they did start edging toward us.</span> <span id="s1580">And they started asking if it was true that we weren't German, that they really were going to be rid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1581">[beeper] Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">MS: This is side two of tape three of an interview with Leigh Fraser, and we will contin-, and Leigh will continue with her story at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">LF: We began to try to talk to the inmates.</span> <span id="s1584">We had a lot of difficulty with them, getting them to look directly at us.</span> <span id="s1585">They were very suspicious of the hot drinks which were brought in immediately by the British Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1586">We had urns of tea and urns of hot milk, and packets of chocolate, and cocoa, and small sandwiches and cookies and rolls and that sort of thing brought in.</span> <span id="s1587">And they looked at those things, and you could see them salivating, but they wouldn't take them.</span> <span id="s1588">And we kept on urging them on them, and they would only take them after they saw us reach out.</span> <span id="s1589">It dawned on a couple of us that they were afraid, that they thought maybe it was poisoned food.</span> <span id="s1590">And we said, "No, no, no, this is fine-look."</span> <span id="s1591">And we started taking things and biting into them, and going and pouring ourselves drinks.</span> <span id="s1592">And while we were doing it, asking them, "Will you have tea?</span> <span id="s1593">Will you have chocolate?</span> <span id="s1594">We need to talk to you.</span> <span id="s1595">We're going to talk to you in groups at first.</span> <span id="s1596">And we're going to ask you a few questions.</span> <span id="s1597">And those of you who are willing to write, we'll help you with the papers, but we want you to help us.</span> <span id="s1598">Because otherwise it's going to take forever."</span> <span id="s1599">And they were quite fearful.</span> <span id="s1600">They went on doing this for weeks, I might tell you.</span> <span id="s1601">They got into the rooms, and they sort of shrank back against the wall and made themselves as small as possible, and fidgeted, and they all hung their heads.</span> <span id="s1602">They absolutely didn't want to look people in the face.</span> <span id="s1603">They were made so often to stand with their heads bowed and yelled at so frequently that this was ingrained now to behave like this.</span> <span id="s1604">The first group of women that I still started talking to, were all French and French-German-mixed.</span> <span id="s1605">They were from the Alsace-Lorraine area.</span> <span id="s1606">And I had a few Belgians in that group.</span> <span id="s1607">They, I think I had about 18 or 19 in the first group.</span> <span id="s1608">It wasn't quite 20, I know.</span> <span id="s1609">And they all helped with their questionnaires.</span> <span id="s1610">They were absolutely amazed of it later on, in the middle of the day.</span> <span id="s1611">The food trucks rolled in with Royal Army Service Corps people with them.</span> <span id="s1612">They had, they came rumbling into the camp at noon and they had great big pots of hot soup.</span> <span id="s1613">They had bread, and milk, and more hot drinks.</span> <span id="s1614">And this is just a measure of how these people didn't know, you know, the inmates didn't know what they were allowed to do and how to behave with us because, while we'd gotten them a little bit loose, and gotten them to answer a few questions and fill out their papers, they still weren't sure how much they could get away with, how they were going to be allowed to behave.</span> <span id="s1615">And one of the women looked at me, and she said, "Mademoiselle, est-ce-que permitez de manger devant vous?</span> <span id="s1616">(Is it allowed to eat in front of you?)"</span> <span id="s1617">And, I laughed a little bit, and I said, "C’est en man.</span> <span id="s1618">Je mange aussi.</span> <span id="s1619">C’est il vous permitez."</span> <span id="s1620">You know, "If you'll allow me to, I'll eat with you."</span> <span id="s1621">And this one woman giggled, and then there were a couple of little weak laughs from the others, and then, and only then, would they start dipping their spoons into their bowls and eating.</span> <span id="s1622">And they ate like wolves.</span> <span id="s1623">The food disappeared, and we noticed over the following weeks, that whenever it was time for food, boy, they weren't very far from the Mess.</span> <span id="s1624">They were right there with bowl and tray in hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">MS: There was a, it was noted that amongst the liberators that many times the prisoners were given food, of course, in all good meaning, and because they were so emaciated, that it created terrible pro-, digestive problems.</span> <span id="s1626">And some of them even died, as a result of being given chocolates and fats and things that their bodies couldn't absorb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">LF: That's absolutely correct, and that's exactly why our group had gone in there with soup for them.</span> <span id="s1628">We gave them very plain cookies, things like graham crackers and plain wheat cookies and didn't give them a lot of sweet stuff.</span> <span id="s1629">And the soup was basically, the first day, it was bread and hot broth, rather than soup, or a pureed soup, which doesn't require so much digesting.</span> <span id="s1630">There was a lot of effort made to gradually feed.</span> <span id="s1631">There were, the first few days there was very little really truly solid food supplied.</span> <span id="s1632">Oatmeal was one of the favorite things at breakfast, and, of course, these people took a lot of comfort in hot, comfort-type foods because what they'd been fed was absolutely ghastly.</span> <span id="s1633">They'd been living on about six or seven hundred calories a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">MS: If that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">LF: If that.</span> <span id="s1636">And the food that we were giving them was basically designed to be nourishing but not to overload them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">MS: So it was definitely monitored then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">LF: That had been pretty carefully thought out, I think.</span> <span id="s1639">One of the other things that amazed all of the prisoners was that we always asked them, "Will you please do this?</span> <span id="s1640">Will you please sit down?</span> <span id="s1641">Thank you very much."</span> <span id="s1642">You know, to, "We'll talk to you again.</span> <span id="s1643">We'll talk some more about this.</span> <span id="s1644">I have the information I need for now, which I have to get into data, but I will talk to you again."</span> <span id="s1645">And there were some remarks about, "Oh, well, will it do any good?"</span> <span id="s1646">And, to which we could only answer, "We don't know.</span> <span id="s1647">We are trying.</span> <span id="s1648">We are, you're going to have to be kept here for a while, because the war isn't really over yet."</span> <span id="s1649">And it wasn't, of course.</span> <span id="s1650">"They're still fighting.</span> <span id="s1651">You can't go wandering out there.</span> <span id="s1652">And some of you aren't well.</span> <span id="s1653">You've got to get better.</span> <span id="s1654">We've got to get those creatures off you."</span> <span id="s1655">The lice, because they were all scratching.</span> <span id="s1656">Oh!</span> <span id="s1657">We lived in terror of becoming lousy ourselves, I might tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">MS: So, in other words, it was difficult to set up sanitary facilities for these people almost immediately.</span> <span id="s1659">It had to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">LF: Because there really weren't any adequate sanitary facilities at the base.</span> <span id="s1661">We brought in a lot of field toilets, and the, we forced the German guards, those of them that were left alive, to start digging latrine trenches too.</span> <span id="s1662">And we also made the German guards start moving corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">MS: Where were the corpses taken?</span> <span id="s1664">Were they buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">LF: They were buried, in mass graves.</span> <span id="s1666">And lots of lime spread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">MS: On this, on the site of Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">LF: That's correct.</span> <span id="s1669">And in fairly short order, as soon as UNRRA, the United Nations Relief Organization, came in and as soon as quonset huts could be delivered, we burned the camp.</span> <span id="s1670">But we had to have somewhere to shelter them.</span> <span id="s1671">Northern Europe is pretty cold into the spring.</span> <span id="s1672">And you couldn't just simply take them and put them outside.</span> <span id="s1673">They were dying like flies anyway, and they would have died in greater numbers with no shelter whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1674">But the, you couldn't clean those buildings up.</span> <span id="s1675">You could not clean them up.</span> <span id="s1676">And when we got there, there were dead in the bunks with the living.</span> <span id="s1677">Everything was crawling with lice.</span> <span id="s1678">We literally, the women that I was with, to help keep ourselves clean, shaved our bodies of all body hair, because we realized that that was one way of being able to keep ourselves from being contaminated with the lice that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">MS: Your head as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">LF: No, we didn't shave our heads, because the lice that carry the typhus are primarily the ones that are on the body.</span> <span id="s1681">The pediculidae that are on the head are not quite so bad.</span> <span id="s1682">But, the body harbors both kinds.</span> <span id="s1683">We literally shaved our underarm and pubic hair in an effort to keep ourselves from becoming contaminated.</span> <span id="s1684">And we were extremely scrupulously clean and we examined each other minutely for bites and things like that when we cleaned up at night.</span> <span id="s1685">And we always dumped all of our clothes that we'd been wearing, before we went into our barracks, we dumped our clothes and went straight through the showers, and then put on clean clothes.</span> <span id="s1686">You hate to treat people as though they're poisonous to you, but, in fact, those people were dangerous to us because if we picked up those infections, we would have been subject to the same things, except that, of course, we were stronger and would have been more resistant.</span> <span id="s1687">So we were ordered by the medics to take a lot of precautions and we just hit on a few extra ones for ourselves.</span> <span id="s1688">The, there were guards in the camp that had been taken prisoner.</span> <span id="s1689">They'd been held prisoner by the British troops and they were also holding the Kapos prisoner.</span> <span id="s1690">They, and lots of them started trying to get among the prisoners and hide themselves among the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1691">But it was a dead giveaway because they had such well-fed looks to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">MS: They didn't look like the emaciated prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">LF: And the prisoners were pretty darn good at picking them out, too.</span> <span id="s1694">I mean they, there would be a sudden outcry and you'd find somebody being ousted from a group and people would be there identifying this person as either a prisoner or a particularly horrible Kapo.</span> <span id="s1695">And there were some pretty notable scoundrels among this group.</span> <span id="s1696">I don't know if the name Joseph Kramer means anything to people, but he was the Commandant of the camp.</span> <span id="s1697">The British hung him later.</span> <span id="s1698">The infamous Irma Grese, who was one of the S.S. women there, was also there.</span> <span id="s1699">And she was absolutely obnoxious.</span> <span id="s1700">Not many of the S.S. women were anything to be proud of as women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">MS: How come they didn't flee the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">LF: Where were they gonna go?</span> <span id="s1703">There was a war going on outside.</span> <span id="s1704">And, once the camp was overrun, they were pretty well held prisoner.</span> <span id="s1705">And it didn't take very much to separate people like them because the prisoners started pointing them out.</span> <span id="s1706">The combat troops had been through the camp, literally, had been through the camp, and had grabbed off some of the guards, but couldn't get them all.</span> <span id="s1707">That's why some of the killings went, but they actually didn't try to get into the camp and do anything other than cursory contact with the inmates in that first 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1708">They just weren't able to.</span> <span id="s1709">They didn't have the facilities to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1710">They, the worst of the whole thing is that two miles away, there were warehouses full of food that belonged to the camp.</span> <span id="s1711">There was about 800 tons of food, all neatly inventoried with total Germanic thoroughness.</span> <span id="s1712">And there was a bakery that was capable of putting out about 60,000 loaves a day, which the Royal Army Service Corps promptly put into operation, and which the better-conditioned of the prisoners were asked if they would like to work in there.</span> <span id="s1713">And they were, we couldn't pay them, but we could give them extra food.</span> <span id="s1714">And we were content if they wanted to come and work for two or three hours, because it helped to move the food supplies.</span> <span id="s1715">And this was an enormous logistical problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">MS: Did you get--responses from them?</span> <span id="s1717">Did, I'm sure they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">LF: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1719">When they found out that it was to bring food into the camp, and we explained this very, very carefully, they were very, very good about it.</span> <span id="s1720">And we didn't try to say, "You have to."</span> <span id="s1721">We simply said, "If you can help, we will transport you in trucks.</span> <span id="s1722">You don't have to walk that distance."</span> <span id="s1723">Because normally they were marched back and forth from their work assignments.</span> <span id="s1724">There were no such luxuries as being transported in any way.</span> <span id="s1725">And, they were pretty darn good about being cooperative about stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1726">Once they found out, and it only took about 24 hours for them to realize that we absolutely meant it because they saw the Red Cross people coming.</span> <span id="s1727">They saw us sending stretcher parties through the camp looking for the worst.</span> <span id="s1728">They saw us setting up intravenous.</span> <span id="s1729">They saw those of us that worked with them on the questionnaires also did a lot of volunteer work at night.</span> <span id="s1730">We went to the hospitals.</span> <span id="s1731">We spoon fed people.</span> <span id="s1732">We washed people.</span> <span id="s1733">We held hands with the dying.</span> <span id="s1734">We tried to write down their names and assure them that we would try to get word to anyone that was looking for them.</span> <span id="s1735">It was really heart-rending.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">MS: [sighs] Oh, goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">LF: I mean, you could sit in a ward and in the space of an hour half a dozen people would die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">MS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">LF: They were just beyond help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">MS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">LF: And whatever was being done for them, it wasn't being done soon enough.</span> <span id="s1742">And there wasn't anything you could do to help them.</span> <span id="s1743">And, it was a feeling of utter despair some of the time.</span> <span id="s1744">The, my, I worked, as I said, mostly with the women.</span> <span id="s1745">And I began to get responses from the women about who had been cruel and who had done various things to them.</span> <span id="s1746">And we took them by truck over to a building where we were holding the S.S. women, and we very carefully kept two large tables and a couple of armed guards between them and the S.S. women.</span> <span id="s1747">We got them to sit down and made the S.S. women file in so that they could pick them out and tell, you know, point out which ones had done various things to people.</span> <span id="s1748">And, I made up my mind at some point in the first hour or so that I was going to be as nice as I possibly could, but firm with the inmates.</span> <span id="s1749">And that if I was going to have any contact with these questions and pointing out of the S.S. women, that I was going to use the same intimidating tactics that I was beginning to hear about, on them.</span> <span id="s1750">And I began to yell almost as soon as the S.S. women came in.</span> <span id="s1751">And I was probably the most aggressive of the four women officers on my initial team.</span> <span id="s1752">I, when they filed in they were acting kind of nutty and, as if they didn't know what was expected of them and trying to cover up their faces.</span> <span id="s1753">And I started screaming, "Wergehen Sie?</span> <span id="s1754">(Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1755">What do you think you're doing?"</span> <span id="s1756">And, "Raus!</span> <span id="s1757">Raus!"</span> <span id="s1758">Which means, "Hurry up!</span> <span id="s1759">Hurry up!"</span> <span id="s1760">Schnell!</span> <span id="s1761">Mach schnell!</span> <span id="s1762">(Move it!)"</span> <span id="s1763">And, pushing them into the place where they should stand.</span> <span id="s1764">And, I noticed when I turned around and I did this for effect, and I noticed when I turned around that there was first of all a slight stunned look on the faces of the women prisoners, you know, the women inmates, and then there were some little giggles, and some slightly smug little smiles.</span> <span id="s1765">And I made the comment to my French group, "A little of their own medicine will do them good."</span> <span id="s1766">And I noticed that it had an immediate effect, and when I told the men officers that at the morning breakfast, which is where we used to get together to talk about these things, they, it turned out, that I wasn't the only one that had had this idea.</span> <span id="s1767">It was sort of an almost simultaneous idea.</span> <span id="s1768">The S.S. women had been absolutely unspeakably brutal.</span> <span id="s1769">They had beaten people indiscriminately with whips and clubs and all sorts of implements.</span> <span id="s1770">They kicked them.</span> <span id="s1771">They'd broken people's bones.</span> <span id="s1772">They'd force prisoners to urinate in buckets and then they'd thrown the buckets of urine over them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">MS: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">LF: And of course these people had no way to clean themselves, so they had to go around in these stinking clothes.</span> <span id="s1775">They burned them with cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1776">They tripped them over.</span> <span id="s1777">They screamed at them day and night.</span> <span id="s1778">They shot some in cold blood for no reason, that they didn't move fast enough.</span> <span id="s1779">And, there were just, just incredible stories about some of the stuff that they did.</span> <span id="s1780">And, as I said, Irma Grese, who was known as "The Bitch of Belsen" and that's literally what was put in the paper about her, was among these women.</span> <span id="s1781">She was hung by the British after the trials.</span> <span id="s1782">She was probably the most brutal of the whole bunch.</span> <span id="s1783">And, I had another encounter with another brutal one later on at Buchenwald, Ilse Koch, Mrs. Lampshades.</span> <span id="s1784">She was the wife of the former Commandant and she had remained in the camp after he had gone.</span> <span id="s1785">And she had had tattooed skin removed from dead inmates and tanned and made into lampshades.</span> <span id="s1786">And she would, we literally called her "Mrs. Lampshades".</span> <span id="s1787">We adopted a, for psychological reasons, we adopted marching the S.S. guards around in leg irons, publicly, when we moved them from one place to another or when we were bringing them in for identifications.</span> <span id="s1788">We denied them all but the plainest food.</span> <span id="s1789">We would give them only cold water to drink.</span> <span id="s1790">Some of the people who smoked would smoke deliberately in front of them and then refuse them cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1791">Anything to torment them, without actually being as physically brutal as they had been.</span> <span id="s1792">But we did our darndest to convey to them that they, this was not a holiday camp for them.</span> <span id="s1793">And, we gave them one blanket each, and we kept them in unheated barracks.</span> <span id="s1794">We frankly didn't give a darn whether they had pneumonia or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">MS: If they died, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">LF: If they died, well, it was only what they'd been inflicting on other people.</span> <span id="s1797">We isolated them for disobedience.</span> <span id="s1798">We didn't do anything absolutely directly physical to them, but we certainly didn't make life easy for them.</span> <span id="s1799">We found that they got a lot less arrogant in the face of this.</span> <span id="s1800">I got the reputation for being a holy terror for being so young.</span> <span id="s1801">And, I frankly didn't care.</span> <span id="s1802">There's a great element of my father's ruthlessness in me.</span> <span id="s1803">He could be pretty ruthless, and I'd learned it very well.</span> <span id="s1804">All of this of course had a pretty darn good influence on our inmates, who were kind of glad to see them getting treated in this fashion.</span> <span id="s1805">The food and the medical supplies, as I said, were supplied by the British Army.</span> <span id="s1806">And some of the rations that came in later were American.</span> <span id="s1807">We put up field kitchens, base hospitals, which were at first tent hospitals.</span> <span id="s1808">And later were UNRRA quonset huts which the British call Nissen huts.</span> <span id="s1809">We did what we could, I think, given the circumstances.</span> <span id="s1810">We, the first thing was to get everybody deloused.</span> <span id="s1811">The second was to find clothes and try to get them clean.</span> <span id="s1812">And that was when there was another awful shock.</span> <span id="s1813">When we said "Showers," they had fits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">MS: Oh, I can well imagine!</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">LF: They had fits!</span> <span id="s1816">And we, of course, knew that we had to get them clean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">MS: Did you understand why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">LF: We understood why.</span> <span id="s1819">Oh yeah, we understood why.</span> <span id="s1820">And, what we were doing was taking them over in large groups, and lining them up and using the S.S. showers.</span> <span id="s1821">And we literally went in with the first groups.</span> <span id="s1822">One of the girls didn't want to get undressed and she went in in a swimsuit.</span> <span id="s1823">I went in naked with them.</span> <span id="s1824">And some of the nurses that came later and some of the Red Cross volunteers did this too.</span> <span id="s1825">And the word got out that they really were showers.</span> <span id="s1826">It was soap and water and people came out of there alive, and, you know, with their hair wet and were actually given towels, and that it was hot water.</span> <span id="s1827">And, after about the first two days there wasn't much more of this, you know, that we're not going in there and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">MS: Fear, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">LF: The fear.</span> <span id="s1830">But, you did have to do some pushing and shoving, and I'll tell you, we did literally have to do some pushing and shoving to get them into the showers the first couple of times.</span> <span id="s1831">I spent [chuckling] an awful lot of time in the showers, I want to tell you!</span> <span id="s1832">But you had to get them clean!</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">MS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">LF: They were incredibly dirty, incredibly dirty.</span> <span id="s1835">They didn't look like people.</span> <span id="s1836">I'm sorry to say that.</span> <span id="s1837">I don't mean to insult them.</span> <span id="s1838">It wasn't their fault.</span> <span id="s1839">But they were pretty grim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">MS: Well, they were treated as animals...</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">LF: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">MS: For so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">LF: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1844">And, so the, you know, the fresh food and the soup and the gradual feeding and the cleaning them up was all well under way within very short order.</span> <span id="s1845">Within a week there was reasonable order there.</span> <span id="s1846">They were still living in those horrible barracks, but the medical teams had been through and had, we'd literally on a fine day turfed everybody outside.</span> <span id="s1847">Nobody could stay in the barracks.</span> <span id="s1848">We'd throw everybody outside.</span> <span id="s1849">And they would go in and fumigate.</span> <span id="s1850">They'd close up everything with cardboard and plastic and whatever they had.</span> <span id="s1851">And they would set off fumigating bombs and DDT all the bunks.</span> <span id="s1852">And then again able-bodied prisoners were asked to sweep things out, and to try to get it clean.</span> <span id="s1853">But of course, all those lice, they live in the crevices, and they get back on the people's bodies.</span> <span id="s1854">So, the delousing process was not just a one-time process.</span> <span id="s1855">And, when we persuaded some of them to start shaving their body hair we began to get an effect too.</span> <span id="s1856">And the medics said that we'd had a good idea and yes we should put that into effect.</span> <span id="s1857">And, the burial details of course went on forever and ever and ever, using the former guards and Kapos.</span> <span id="s1858">No inmate was ever asked to help with the burials.</span> <span id="s1859">We felt that that was entirely too much for them.</span> <span id="s1860">And, the barracks were burned on the first occasion that I came back, after I'd been to Nordhausen and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1861">The inmates stood around cheering when we burned those barracks.</span> <span id="s1862">We literally had the huts put up, had them moved in, and one of the conditions was, "You go take a shower.</span> <span id="s1863">We will now give you another delousing.</span> <span id="s1864">We will give you clean clothes.</span> <span id="s1865">And you will never go back into those again.</span> <span id="s1866">You will go into a clean barracks."</span> <span id="s1867">And they complied--even the most reluctant of the people to go to the shower--complied when we explained that at the end of that there was going to be an enormous fire.</span> <span id="s1868">We were going to burn the camp.</span> <span id="s1869">And we burned the whole darn camp.</span> <span id="s1870">It was an amazing sight.</span> <span id="s1871">And the former inmates stood around cheering.</span> <span id="s1872">Now they were Displaced Persons.</span> <span id="s1873">They were no longer concentration camp prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">MS: Could they leave at this point in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">LF: They could leave.</span> <span id="s1876">We counseled them not to.</span> <span id="s1877">Of course, VE Day came at the beginning of May, May the 8th.</span> <span id="s1878">We counseled them not to.</span> <span id="s1879">Some of them did.</span> <span id="s1880">We gather that some of them died.</span> <span id="s1881">And some turned back after a couple of days out, they found there was nowhere to go for food...</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">MS: They came...</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">LF: That there was a lot of brutality out there.</span> <span id="s1884">The roads were full of people.</span> <span id="s1885">There were escaped Germans.</span> <span id="s1886">There were other refugees.</span> <span id="s1887">There were Germans from the cities, themselves on the run.</span> <span id="s1888">It was like a zoo.</span> <span id="s1889">It just simply wasn't safe.</span> <span id="s1890">But you couldn't tell them, "No, you can't go," because they were not our prisoners.</span> <span id="s1891">We were there to help them.</span> <span id="s1892">We did counsel them that it was tough out there, that we couldn't always continue to help them and that somebody might hurt them.</span> <span id="s1893">And we gathered that some of them in their first attempts to get away, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">MS: At the hands of other, of Germans, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">LF: We don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">MS: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">LF: We--know that people did stupid things and got themselves run over a couple of times by army vehicles, by, you know, just simply because they weren't accustomed to watching out for themselves.</span> <span id="s1898">We believe that there were some clashes between them and Germans walking around the countryside.</span> <span id="s1899">We really didn't know what was going on once they got away from us, and we were an Army group, but we kept explaining to them over and over and over again, "You're not our prisoners.</span> <span id="s1900">We're here to help you.</span> <span id="s1901">We'll do our best, but please listen to us.</span> <span id="s1902">It's not safe out there."</span> <span id="s1903">If they said they were going, you just had to throw up your hands and let them take a couple of loaves of bread and whatever they could carry with them, and give them a blanket and wish them well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">MS: It'd be interesting to hear the stories of some of those people that did leave, and how they progressed.</span> <span id="s1905">I'm sure in the Archive somewhere there must be...</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">LF: There's got to be something, Somewhere, but--It was--pretty awful, you know, having worked with them.</span> <span id="s1907">But you could also understand their impatience to be gone.</span> <span id="s1908">Then you also had to explain to them that the countries they came from sometimes didn't exist any more, that there was absolute chaos.</span> <span id="s1909">It was easier to deal with the ones who were from the West, from France, from Belgium.</span> <span id="s1910">You know, you could tell them that there was someplace for them to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Tape four, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">MS: Tape four, side one, of our interview with Leigh Fraser, and we will continue at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">LF: The next thing that you wanted an answer to was, did the effect of seeing the prisoners have an affect on my fighting in the war?</span> <span id="s1914">I suppose that's a pretty standard question for all of us that were involved in things like this.</span> <span id="s1915">At this point, this was my war.</span> <span id="s1916">I was not a member of a fighting unit any more, I had been during the invasion.</span> <span id="s1917">My war at this point was to do this job as humanely and as kindly as I could, to get information, to help relocate people, to find out if they had any relatives or friends left alive, to see where we could send them when they were strong enough.</span> <span id="s1918">And I have to say that each terrible story that I heard really fueled my ability to deal with the next appalling recital.</span> <span id="s1919">I was 19.</span> <span id="s1920">I, in fact, I wasn't 19.</span> <span id="s1921">I was 19 at the end of that summer.</span> <span id="s1922">I cried.</span> <span id="s1923">I prayed.</span> <span id="s1924">I vomited.</span> <span id="s1925">I lost about 15 pounds.</span> <span id="s1926">I began to look like one of the prisoners myself at one point because my face started taking on a very gaunt look.</span> <span id="s1927">I worked in the evenings as a volunteer at the hospital.</span> <span id="s1928">Life got so mixed up that it took on an almost surreal quality.</span> <span id="s1929">And I was very, very deeply affected.</span> <span id="s1930">I was very aware of the fact that under the Nuremberg race laws, had I been there, had I been one of the people herded into those camps, I would have been either a candidate for slave labor or a candidate for the ovens because of the fact that my grandfather was half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1931">And so, that gives me a strong element, and it was enough under the Nuremberg race laws.</span> <span id="s1932">And I've always had this incredible feeling that an accident of birth changes a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1933">And of course, the accident was that my father was British, and I was a British subject and not a prisoner in Europe.</span> <span id="s1934">[sighs] And you can't see that kind of thing and realize that, without being just deeply shaken and deeply affected by it, because there were girls that were close to my age among those women.</span> <span id="s1935">And they'd never had the personal freedoms.</span> <span id="s1936">They'd never had the chance to put on a lipstick, to kick up their heels, to go to a dance, to laugh at a boy, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1937">It was just, just all the simple things that make living worthwhile that had been denied to them just by an accident of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">MS: About, amongst your interviews, were many of the inmates there for long periods of time?</span> <span id="s1939">Or had they been shuttled from one camp to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">LF: Some of them had been shuttled from one camp to another, particularly toward the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1941">The Germans were just ferrying people around the countryside like mad.</span> <span id="s1942">And I don't think it mattered too much to them whether they killed them, whether they didn't arrive whole, or where they got them, as long as they got them away from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1943">I don't know why the urgency to get them away from the Russians, but they seemed to have that going on a lot of the time.</span> <span id="s1944">And, then there were some other things that will come out much later that are peculiarly horrible too.</span> <span id="s1945">You wanted also to know what the reaction of other people was.</span> <span id="s1946">You know, did I talk with anybody else, or do I remember what their reactions were.</span> <span id="s1947">Some of the things that come to mind are the first soldiers that we met at Bergen-Belsen, the ones that drove the luggage truck, and the bus that we were on, and took us to the billets [quarters].</span> <span id="s1948">I remember saying to one of them, "What gives?</span> <span id="s1949">What's the skinny?"</span> <span id="s1950">You know, what sort of a story is there to this?</span> <span id="s1951">And, one of them said to me, "Well, Miss, it's like the Black Death.</span> <span id="s1952">There's tons of bodies.</span> <span id="s1953">It stinks."</span> <span id="s1954">These were very ordinary working guys, just soldiers.</span> <span id="s1955">We don't call them GIs.</span> <span id="s1956">We call them Tommys.</span> <span id="s1957">And they're usually about as outspoken as most men in those circumstances.</span> <span id="s1958">And they'd say things like, "It's a bloody shame.</span> <span id="s1959">The damn Germans never gave them a chance.</span> <span id="s1960">The poor devils, they're dying by the heaps."</span> <span id="s1961">These are things I remember that were literally said.</span> <span id="s1962">One of the most pugnacious of them, a man from the north of England, with a very strong north of England accent, said to me, "We ought to do it to them, the S.S. bastards."</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">MS: Shame we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">LF: And, we heard them called swine, German swine, repeatedly, by the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1965">And they made some pretty pertinent comments about where they'd put their rifles and where they'd put their bayonets [chuckling] if they caught up with them.</span> <span id="s1966">And a lot of it had to do with the human hind end I might tell you.</span> <span id="s1967">Every morning, the team that I was on--this was 40 people initially and we were joined by a few other people a little bit later--ate a working breakfast at 6:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1968">We considered that to be the best time to have a staff meeting, because once we got started, there was no stopping.</span> <span id="s1969">There was no saying, "We'll be here at 12 o’clock.</span> <span id="s1970">We will be here at 1 o’clock."</span> <span id="s1971">So we ate breakfast together every morning.</span> <span id="s1972">That's when we compared cases, exchanged lists of things that we’d found out.</span> <span id="s1973">Every day two or three of us took about five minutes of that time to discuss the worst stories with the entire team, to ask them what they were running across, and how they would advise us, faced with certain things.</span> <span id="s1974">Because it was a learning experience for all of us.</span> <span id="s1975">None of us were experienced interviewers.</span> <span id="s1976">Nobody ever had to face this before.</span> <span id="s1977">And it was a question of play it by ear.</span> <span id="s1978">We were a group of rank amateurs, doing the best we could, with a real cesspool.</span> <span id="s1979">And by that, I don't mean the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1980">I mean the whole mess.</span> <span id="s1981">By the end of the week, almost everybody on the team had had a turn at the breakfast meetings.</span> <span id="s1982">I don't believe I ever saw a group of people who became quite so close-knit because we were all going through awful experiences with these people, listening to their stories.</span> <span id="s1983">Every one of the men on the team at one point or another choked up or cried when he was trying to tell his story.</span> <span id="s1984">All of the women, the four of us, cried, and beat our hands on the walls, sometimes pounded the table.</span> <span id="s1985">I smashed a glass one day.</span> <span id="s1986">I was holding a glass of orange juice while I was talking, and I banged it down on the table to give emphasis to something and cut my fingers--and still have the scars on my fingers to this day!</span> <span id="s1987">The blatant cruelty, the stories we were hearing, made you so despondent and the death rate, of course, was appalling to us.</span> <span id="s1988">We raved about things that we were seeing and the things that were happening.</span> <span id="s1989">And then we were joined by some of the medical group at those breakfasts.</span> <span id="s1990">And I remember the chief medical officer yelping at the end of about the third or fourth day that he was there and saying, "We'll lose the whole bloody lot if we don't get some more help!"</span> <span id="s1991">Because the death rate was so horrible and he was just at his wit’s end what to do next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">MS: Could I interrupt with one question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">LF: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">MS: At this point in time, how many English would you say were in the camps helping with all these enormous duties that had to be handled?</span> <span id="s1995">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">LF: Within a week or so, we had about 60 Red Cross volunteers.</span> <span id="s1997">We had a couple of hundred men in the food group and the medical group combined, all that could be spared.</span> <span id="s1998">We had a medical officer.</span> <span id="s1999">We had trained medical personnel.</span> <span id="s2000">The medical officer, of course, is an M.D.</span> <span id="s2001">We got another one after a couple of days, but two doctors among all that mess?</span> <span id="s2002">And, you know, a whole bunch of trained, what amounted to what you’d call, corps men.</span> <span id="s2003">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">MS: No nurses?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">LF: No nurses...</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">MS: At this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">LF: No nurses in the first week or so.</span> <span id="s2008">When I went, some nurses at first had just arrived.</span> <span id="s2009">We had some nurses from the Red Cross because the British Red Cross does have nurses working with it too.</span> <span id="s2010">And they were volunteers.</span> <span id="s2011">When I came back, there were more nursing personnel there.</span> <span id="s2012">I think this medical officer had raised absolute and particular hell to get more help.</span> <span id="s2013">He was a very outspoken Scotsman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">MS: So all in all there were just a few hundred people in there helping the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">LF: Helping thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">MS: Thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">LF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">MS: So that's why you were really understaffed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">LF: And then our group, and a few soldiers who had been left behind, basically walking-wounded soldiers, who had been left behind to help guard and to take care of a few things, everybody was playing this by ear.</span> <span id="s2020">You know, this was the first camp overrun by the West; and a few days later, Buchenwald, you know, by the Americans.</span> <span id="s2021">There were so many of these camps, and it was just an absolute nightmare for the people in the camps; it was a nightmare for all of us as we overran them because we had no experience in dealing with this degree of casualties, with people who didn't speak our language, with people, or, or, we didn't speak their language, with people who hadn't been fed, who were in such incredibly filthy conditions.</span> <span id="s2022">It was a monumental task.</span> <span id="s2023">It was like trying to scrub an elephant with a toothbrush.</span> <span id="s2024">I know that that's making fun of it, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">MS: Oh, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">LF: It's a similar level of task in lots of ways.</span> <span id="s2027">We all worked extra hours beyond our jobs, those of us that were the interview and intelligence team.</span> <span id="s2028">We did all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s2029">We worked in the hospitals.</span> <span id="s2030">Some of us worked over in the food area.</span> <span id="s2031">I chose to work in the hospital because I'd had some experience with helping with sick people at home and my best friend's father was a doctor.</span> <span id="s2032">So I had a little bit of training.</span> <span id="s2033">I could be of some use.</span> <span id="s2034">And we bathed some of the sickest, I was bathing one woman and she died under my hands while I was bathing her.</span> <span id="s2035">And you feel so defeated.</span> <span id="s2036">I mean, she was terribly sick.</span> <span id="s2037">And I had rolled her up in a sheet to roll her across the bed, and then pulled the sheet off her back so that I could bathe her back.</span> <span id="s2038">And went to roll her back again to dry her on another sheet and put her back into the clean bed, and she expired as I did that.</span> <span id="s2039">And I'd been as gentle as I could possibly be with her.</span> <span id="s2040">And you don't blame yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">MS: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">LF: But you feel so terrible that this poor soul never got a chance to know freedom again.</span> <span id="s2043">And that was repeated on, I saw guys come out at night, guys that were on our team come out at night crying because they'd lost ten or twelve people in the area where they'd been working.</span> <span id="s2044">And we were--we were losing people like flies.</span> <span id="s2045">And you felt so helpless.</span> <span id="s2046">You know, why did they have to die now?</span> <span id="s2047">When we'd liberated them.</span> <span id="s2048">You know, wasn't it possible to help them to hang on somehow?</span> <span id="s2049">And I didn't know much about this kind of starvation until then.</span> <span id="s2050">And it was an awful lesson.</span> <span id="s2051">We held hands with people.</span> <span id="s2052">We spoon-fed them.</span> <span id="s2053">You tried to get them to understand what was being done.</span> <span id="s2054">Sometimes all you could do was explain what the doctors were saying and what needed to be done and why they had to have this needle in their arm.</span> <span id="s2055">They didn't understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">MS: For intravenous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">LF: For intravenous.</span> <span id="s2058">They were feeding them dextrose [sugar water].</span> <span id="s2059">They were trying to get rid of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s2060">They were shooting them full of a drug called M and B, which was the standard treatment for TB then.</span> <span id="s2061">It was just, you know, really a tough situation.</span> <span id="s2062">And they didn't know what was being done to them.</span> <span id="s2063">And we tried to explain some of that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">MS: I'm sure they must have been very...</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">LF: Because most of the medics didn't have any knowledge of their languages either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">MS: They must have been terribly frightened people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">LF: Oh, I think that they were absolutely terrified and, you know, to see them die in such terror.</span> <span id="s2068">When you walked into the room, you'd have to, some of them, their vision was beginning to go because they were so close to death.</span> <span id="s2069">And you'd have to get right over them and say, "Britisher.</span> <span id="s2070">Britisher."</span> <span id="s2071">So they'd know it wasn't the Germans coming at them again.</span> <span id="s2072">And keep on repeating that they were in a hospital, that there was a doctor, and that they would, we were trying to care for them.</span> <span id="s2073">And, I remember one night trying to explain this to three or four women and then another woman fell dead right beside me.</span> <span id="s2074">Just fell off the chair.</span> <span id="s2075">Some of them had gone through so much that their hearts just gave out under the privation.</span> <span id="s2076">Anyway, this just kept on going on and it was about as bad as it could be, I think, and about the fifth day we were there, a group of padres came in, chaplains, eight of them.</span> <span id="s2077">Two of them were Church of England and the other half a dozen were rabbis.</span> <span id="s2078">And they all had assistants with them.</span> <span id="s2079">We had put out calls.</span> <span id="s2080">The very first day we were there, the boss started asking what else do we need, what else do we need?</span> <span id="s2081">And we gave him just tremendous lists of things that were needed, and we said that the people were asking all kinds of questions and that people were asking about services and could they be allowed to have services again, this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s2082">And, we needed Jewish prayer books.</span> <span id="s2083">We needed scriptures.</span> <span id="s2084">We needed to set up something to give them some spiritual comfort.</span> <span id="s2085">We needed this, we needed that, we needed just everything.</span> <span id="s2086">Imagine starting life from scratch.</span> <span id="s2087">You're standing there naked, and you go to think about everything you need.</span> <span id="s2088">And this is the position that these people were in.</span> <span id="s2089">I mean this is what we were trying to tell, you know, that we need things.</span> <span id="s2090">But we also need people that can deal with some of the things that they need.</span> <span id="s2091">And, this group of chaplains came in, and the majority of them were comparatively young.</span> <span id="s2092">They were forty at the most.</span> <span id="s2093">You know, forty years old, at the most.</span> <span id="s2094">And, they all had two or three assistants who helped them with services, who also helped them with other duties.</span> <span id="s2095">And, they not only did their jobs as religious, they did other things.</span> <span id="s2096">They emptied bed pans.</span> <span id="s2097">They washed people.</span> <span id="s2098">They sat with them.</span> <span id="s2099">They organized services.</span> <span id="s2100">Sometimes they'd even go among the people that were better, you know, that were not in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2101">They spent a lot of time at the hospital, but they also went out among the other people, and they tried to organize them into singing folk songs and telling little stories and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">MS: Lift the morale...</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">LF: They were really pretty wonderful about this.</span> <span id="s2104">And joking with them, and then of course, they said Kaddish for the dying and the dead.</span> <span id="s2105">And they were really great.</span> <span id="s2106">I mean, I have seen them literally two guys that were both chaplains, rolling over a man who was covered in his own excrement, who was dying, and just sponging him down, as if they were just simply, it was a routine job.</span> <span id="s2107">And it wasn't what they were trained to do, but they'd do it.</span> <span id="s2108">And then they'd make jokes, crazy, corny jokes.</span> <span id="s2109">And they did a lot for us too, because we needed help.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">MS: You needed your spirits lifted as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">LF: And, you got to the point where you'd make some pretty raw jokes sometimes.</span> <span id="s2112">Even at the expense of the inmates because it was all so tragic that if you didn't find something to laugh at...</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">MS: You'd probably have a nervous breakdown, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">LF: I mean, I remember one woman asking me if the soup was kosher one day and I said [chuckling], "Who in the hell cares?"</span> <span id="s2115">[laughing] You know, something to that effect.</span> <span id="s2116">I said, "Did you ask the Germans if what they gave you was kosher?"</span> <span id="s2117">And she said, "Oh, well they didn't give us any meat."</span> <span id="s2118">[both laughing] And I said, "Well they were kosher cows, I'm sure!"</span> <span id="s2119">You know, [laughing]...</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">MS: Poor soul.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">LF: And of course they were being careful about that.</span> <span id="s2122">They weren't bringing pork products in.</span> <span id="s2123">I shouldn't say that entirely because there was some Spam brought in and [laughing] heaven alone knows what Spam was.</span> <span id="s2124">But by and large, you know, what they were getting was beef broth, chicken broth, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s2125">And even the Spam could be blessed and made kosher at this point I think!</span> <span id="s2126">[both laughing] You know?</span> <span id="s2127">Anyway, this is the kind of thing that was happening, and it was just an incredible mess.</span> <span id="s2128">I stayed at Belsen for that couple of weeks, and then I went on to Nordhausen and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2129">And I was only gone about a week on that assignment, with a couple of other people, to help the U.S. forces, to help them set up some similar systems.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">MS: Also for interviewing and the inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">LF: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s2132">For the interviews, and of course they had their own field hospitals, and they were setting up things and the American Red Cross was there and you didn't really stay around long enough to find out what was going on.</span> <span id="s2133">There didn't seem to be much difference when we went to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2134">It sure didn't seem to be much different to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">MS: Was that as large a camp do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">LF: I don't think it was quite as big a camp.</span> <span id="s2137">It was still incredibly dirty, and the bad conditions were overwhelming.</span> <span id="s2138">There wasn't typhus there, thank heaven, not at Buchenwald, not when I was there.</span> <span id="s2139">But I couldn't, you know, there was, by no means could you call it a resort, or anything resembling it.</span> <span id="s2140">And I went back to Bergen-Belsen at the end of that week, and stayed another four or five days, that time just compiling data.</span> <span id="s2141">But I walked out into the camp several times and talked to the women that I'd been talking to before and told them that I was back and that we were trying to do things and that I was gonna go away again, but I'd be back again.</span> <span id="s2142">And, asking them if the other people were taking care of them.</span> <span id="s2143">Because you felt very responsible for them when you started asking them all these personal questions.</span> <span id="s2144">And you could see that sometimes, when you asked them the personal questions about what had happened to their families, that it was very painful for them to answer, just nightmares.</span> <span id="s2145">And it was nothing to hear one after another, "Gone, all gone.</span> <span id="s2146">They kept me.</span> <span id="s2147">They killed the others."</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">MS: What, how was your material being handled once you had the interviews with these people?</span> <span id="s2149">What was the final disposition of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">LF: Well, a lot of the stuff and particularly the barbarous stuff, was used in the War Crimes trials.</span> <span id="s2151">But a l-, almost all of the information of, about personal data...</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">LF: Was supplied to the International Red Cross, which set up clearing-houses...</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">MS: Oh right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">LF: To try to get--And later in the UNRRA camps, huge notice boards appeared.</span> <span id="s2156">And there were places that they could go to get information.</span> <span id="s2157">People scanned the notice boards, and we provided notice boards too, right away, and lots of scrap paper and pencils, so that people could start writing their names, and the name of the town they came from.</span> <span id="s2158">And you'd try to get these town people into groups to support each other.</span> <span id="s2159">And there were screams of recognition sometimes, you know, and cries and yells, and they became their own little family units.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">MS: In other words, an inmate would find another inmate in the same camp who...</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">LF: That they didn't even know was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">MS: Was a neighbor or friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">LF: Because, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">LF: Because they were all so dirty, and they were herded and regimented but now all of a sudden there was some freedom to stroll around, and they did.</span> <span id="s2166">They strolled up and down the streets endlessly, looking, and talking to people, and then occasionally, there'd suddenly be a hubbub and a yell and a scream and you'd know that somebody had found someone...</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">MS: Found someone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">LF: That they knew, or that they knew of, in some way.</span> <span id="s2169">Anyway, I, you know, after these little trips to the other camps and then back, I went off again.</span> <span id="s2170">And I went to Dachau, which was a nightmare all its own.</span> <span id="s2171">I went then on loan to the Russians.</span> <span id="s2172">I got a look at Auschwitz, and then I went to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2173">Much later I saw Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s2174">But Ravensbrück, Ravensbrück was disgusting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">MS: Worse so than what you had witnessed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">LF: Not so much in physical conditions, but the stories.</span> <span id="s2177">[takes a deep breath] Oh!</span> <span id="s2178">It chills my blood.</span> <span id="s2179">I've got goose bumps on my arms thinking about Ravensbrück and the stories.</span> <span id="s2180">There was a woman doctor there, a German woman doctor, had been.</span> <span id="s2181">She was a prisoner, not a prisoner of the Germans, but by this time the Russians had made her a prisoner.</span> <span id="s2182">Her name was Herta Oberhauser.</span> <span id="s2183">She was a volunteer.</span> <span id="s2184">She volunteered to go and work in the experiments.</span> <span id="s2185">She was the most sadistic bitch I've ever run across in my entire life, and I don't apologize for using that word--it's not bad enough.</span> <span id="s2186">She took part in the medical experiments.</span> <span id="s2187">She took muscles out of people, parts of their limbs, vital organs.</span> <span id="s2188">She conducted forced sterilization on women who were then put into Wehrmacht and S.S. brothels.</span> <span id="s2189">All this without anesthesia.</span> <span id="s2190">She infected them with tetanus and gangrene.</span> <span id="s2191">She rubbed sawdust and dirt and ground glass into open wounds.</span> <span id="s2192">This woman was a creature.</span> <span id="s2193">I mean, a creature.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">MS: Did she admit to this in testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">LF: She pled, "Not guilty."</span> <span id="s2196">She said that she was ordered to do it.</span> <span id="s2197">She was given 20 years at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s2198">I went back to the trials.</span> <span id="s2199">It was one of the later duties that I was given.</span> <span id="s2200">She was released.</span> <span id="s2201">The Nuremberg trials, of course in 1946, '45, '46; after '46 they began.</span> <span id="s2202">She was released in 1952.</span> <span id="s2203">That means that, at a maximum, that woman served about six years, and the year that she was held prior to the trials.</span> <span id="s2204">She was released by an American Department of the Army civilian called John McCloy, who succeeded General Lucius Clay, as the American Commander in Germany.</span> <span id="s2205">I've got lots of stories about the things that both the Americans and British did that were inept.</span> <span id="s2206">But this is a notable one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">MS: Was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">LF: By 1958, she had gone back to practice in Germany.</span> <span id="s2209">The German government had given her a pension as a returning P.O.W., and given her a grant to set up a practice.</span> <span id="s2210">And I tracked her down, along with someone who was writing a book, because I was so appalled.</span> <span id="s2211">And she was literally in practice, in family practice, in Germany, with the help, and she was at a place called Itzehoe, in Schleswig-Holstein.</span> <span id="s2212">Can you imagine, after all that?</span> <span id="s2213">That was only one.</span> <span id="s2214">That was one woman who did things to lots of people.</span> <span id="s2215">I saw people there, talked with people, who were so disfigured from the things that they had done.</span> <span id="s2216">It was estimated that about 1,000 women died in those experiments.</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Tape four, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">MS: This is tape four, side two, of an interview with Leigh Fraser, and we will contin-, she will continue her story at this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">LF: I don't know how acceptable it is to people to hear some of the stuff that they did to women in Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2220">The French called it L’enfer de femme, hell for women.</span> <span id="s2221">There were lots of French resistance women there.</span> <span id="s2222">There were also some British women there, and quite a few Jewish women.</span> <span id="s2223">Most of them had been either Resistance or they had really done something.</span> <span id="s2224">A couple of the Jewish women that I met had literally murdered S.S. officers and were sent there as punishment and were used in these experiments as part of their punishment.</span> <span id="s2225">Ravensbrück had a unique way of killing people.</span> <span id="s2226">That's the first thing that comes to mind.</span> <span id="s2227">Most of the people that were at Ravensbrück were there because they were in what was called the Nacht und Nebel, Night and Fog programs.</span> <span id="s2228">They were to be disappeared and never heard from again, and nobody was to know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s2229">And the Germans had a euphemism for killing people that was called “special treatment”.</span> <span id="s2230">Special treatment in other camps usually meant being shot or going to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s2231">In Ravensbrück, if they weren't getting a whole shipment ready to send somewhere else, they stuck them in the dentist's chair.</span> <span id="s2232">And the dentist's chair, once they got them into the chair, they could push a button, and manacles and leg irons came out and clamped around them, and a thing came around their necks.</span> <span id="s2233">It was a very ingenious device.</span> <span id="s2234">And they were held immobile in that chair and generally their blouse was ripped open, and they were injected into the heart to kill them.</span> <span id="s2235">Those last few moments while all this was being done must have been absolutely terrifying for them.</span> <span id="s2236">And it was generally cyanide directly into the heart, which is a peculiarly horrible death.</span> <span id="s2237">I've talked to women that were survivors of Wehrmacht and S.S. brothels.</span> <span id="s2238">They had been forcibly sterilized, usually without anesthesia, and incredible things were done to them.</span> <span id="s2239">And I know it's not really acceptable to talk about people's sexual practices, but somebody should know what they did.</span> <span id="s2240">They forced these women into brothels.</span> <span id="s2241">They were literally used like animals sexually.</span> <span id="s2242">They were tied up in peculiar positions and abused by the men who used them.</span> <span id="s2243">Some of them had their teeth pulled and were forced into continued oral sex.</span> <span id="s2244">And the teeth were pulled so that they couldn't bite those tender German parts.</span> <span id="s2245">[sighs] There were girls who, two girls hung themselves while I was there.</span> <span id="s2246">They were sisters.</span> <span id="s2247">And three days later, their grandmother, who was also a prisoner there hung herself.</span> <span id="s2248">These two girls had been forced to be brothel inmates.</span> <span id="s2249">They had been so misused.</span> <span id="s2250">And the grandmother told me the story when I was interviewing her.</span> <span id="s2251">She was forced to be a maid in the brothels, and these poor girls were literally strapped into a chair so that they could be neatly used by the Germans.</span> <span id="s2252">And this poor lady went along with a bucket, and something resembling a dish mop, and mopped them up so that the next German would have a nice, clean place to go.</span> <span id="s2253">There aren't any polite expressions for this.</span> <span id="s2254">They were just there to be used.</span> <span id="s2255">And they were mortified.</span> <span id="s2256">They were absolutely shamed.</span> <span id="s2257">And that's why the girls hung themselves.</span> <span id="s2258">And then the grandmother hung herself a couple of days later.</span> <span id="s2259">She had been...</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">MS: Once they were set free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">LF: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">MS: Oh God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">LF: They both hung themselves in the bathroom, and the grandmother hung herself in the barracks.</span> <span id="s2264">She had mourned and cried, and then she just couldn't take it anymore, and that was all that was left of one family.</span> <span id="s2265">And, I can just imagine that woman.</span> <span id="s2266">She was in her 50s, and these girls were about 18, 16, 17, 18, somewhere in that.</span> <span id="s2267">And she'd been forced to watch this for a couple of years.</span> <span id="s2268">And they were pretty girls.</span> <span id="s2269">Very pretty girls.</span> <span id="s2270">So I imagine that they were in a great deal of demand.</span> <span id="s2271">Other things got done to them too.</span> <span id="s2272">Sexual torture was a favorite game with the Germans.</span> <span id="s2273">They used electrodes, and they were very fond of putting electrodes on people and then stimulating them to find out how much pain that caused.</span> <span id="s2274">And that was also part of the medical experiments.</span> <span id="s2275">There were just people there who had scars, who had part of a leg muscle gone, part of an arm gone.</span> <span id="s2276">One woman had her breast literally sliced into ribbons and left on her body to see if she'd get an infection.</span> <span id="s2277">And there were people that were going to need all kinds of plastic surgery to look normal again because their faces had been disfigured in experiments and some of them had been burned with acid.</span> <span id="s2278">These people were diabolical, the Germans, absolutely diabolical.</span> <span id="s2279">There was no need for this.</span> <span id="s2280">It, I talked a lot with the professor who gave, Professor Keith, who gave evidence at the Nuremberg trials because of the fact that I'd been an interviewer.</span> <span id="s2281">And he said there was no earthly reason for these kinds of things to be done, that it served absolutely no medical purpose whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2282">And that it was unconscionable.</span> <span id="s2283">And then I had an absolutely terrible personal experience the second day that I was there.</span> <span id="s2284">I was walking down a corridor and someone called my name.</span> <span id="s2285">And I couldn't imagine who would be calling me by my first name because most people called you by your rank and your last name.</span> <span id="s2286">But I kept hearing this rather thin voice.</span> <span id="s2287">And I finally stopped and turned back and started walking back down the corridor saying, "Who's calling me?</span> <span id="s2288">This is Leigh Fraser.</span> <span id="s2289">Who is it that's calling me?"</span> <span id="s2290">And a voice said, "In here."</span> <span id="s2291">And I walked in, and I did not recognize the person sitting in there.</span> <span id="s2292">It looked like a woman who was in her 40s, and who was so beaten up, literally beaten up.</span> <span id="s2293">Her face was almost unrecognizable.</span> <span id="s2294">Her nose had been broken.</span> <span id="s2295">She had a broken arm which had been set by our people.</span> <span id="s2296">She had, it proved later, scars on her back from where she had been burned with a poker.</span> <span id="s2297">She was a friend's sister, and she had been dropped into France because she spoke fluent French.</span> <span id="s2298">She had been dropped into France to work with one of the Maquis réseau, [Maqui’s network], the resistance groups, and had been betrayed.</span> <span id="s2299">The whole group had been betrayed.</span> <span id="s2300">And she...</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">MS: She was an English girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">LF: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2303">We had a lot of agents working in France, and a lot of them were women.</span> <span id="s2304">And the Germans had taken her in France.</span> <span id="s2305">They had beaten the living daylights out of her.</span> <span id="s2306">They were terrible at this sort of thing.</span> <span id="s2307">And then she had been shipped to Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2308">And, in a scuffle, one of the guards there broke her arm, just to add insult to injury.</span> <span id="s2309">She was 28 years old, and she looked much more than 40.</span> <span id="s2310">And I happen to know that that woman survived.</span> <span id="s2311">She didn't, she's not alive now.</span> <span id="s2312">She didn't live a long life.</span> <span id="s2313">She died in her 50's.</span> <span id="s2314">I'm sure a lot of it had to do with what she suffered there.</span> <span id="s2315">But I know that she underwent 17 operations to restore her face and her appearance.</span> <span id="s2316">Every bone in her face had been broken at some point during the Gestapo beatings to try to get her to give more information to them.</span> <span id="s2317">They had burned her spine with a hot poker.</span> <span id="s2318">They had set fire to pieces of wood under her toenails.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">MS: God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">LF: And it's no wonder that I didn't recognize her because what faced me was a very misshapen person.</span> <span id="s2321">And I had been in school with her younger sister.</span> <span id="s2322">That's how she knew me.</span> <span id="s2323">Because I asked her, and she said, "Somehow, I knew.</span> <span id="s2324">I'd seen you play hockey on the same team as my sister.</span> <span id="s2325">There was something about the way you went down the corridor, and just as you got out of sight, I remembered your name."</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">MS: Mmm.</span> <span id="s2327">What an amazing story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">LF: I telephoned her family and told them that we'd found her.</span> <span id="s2329">[pause] Her father was a lawyer, and this was an incredibly brave person because she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2330">She didn't have to go.</span> <span id="s2331">We didn't ask Jewish volunteers to be dropped into Europe.</span> <span id="s2332">In fact, we discouraged them, but she wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">MS: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">LF: Lori Gorkoff.</span> <span id="s2335">And her sister was in school with me, as I said.</span> <span id="s2336">Her sister Sheila was in school with me.</span> <span id="s2337">Her father was a lawyer in London, and her mother had been a university professor.</span> <span id="s2338">Her mother had been killed in the bombing, and that was her motivation to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">MS: Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">LF: And I remember when Sheila's mother was killed, because it was about a week before my sister was killed.</span> <span id="s2341">Her mother was driving an ambulance.</span> <span id="s2342">She was a volunteer.</span> <span id="s2343">And that had been Lori's motivation to go and fight Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">MS: What happened...</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">LF: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">MS: What happened to her from the time that you spoke with her?</span> <span id="s2347">Was she sent out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">LF: I raised absolute and utter Cain...</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2350">LF: About finding her in the condition that she was in.</span> <span id="s2351">We had half a dozen other British women, and I raised absolute hell with the Soviets that night.</span> <span id="s2352">And by sheer force of words, I made them let me communicate with my old unit and Colonel Draper, who was just an absolute whiz at doing things, and to whom I talked.</span> <span id="s2353">I got on the telephone to London, and they exerted a lot of pressure.</span> <span id="s2354">And two days later, an RAF plane came to Templehof.</span> <span id="s2355">And I went with them, in the truck, down to Templehof, from Ravensbrück, which is north of Berlin.</span> <span id="s2356">I went with them, down to Templehof , and they were flown out.</span> <span id="s2357">There was one notable woman prisoner who is Odette Churchill.</span> <span id="s2358">There have been books written about Odette.</span> <span id="s2359">And it was, I had told Draper this when I called him.</span> <span id="s2360">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">MS: Was she in this group too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">LF: Yes, she was in this group.</span> <span id="s2363">And he used that for leverage to get them out.</span> <span id="s2364">Because the Germans had been led to believe that she was a relation of Winston Churchill.</span> <span id="s2365">She wasn't.</span> <span id="s2366">There was just a coincidence in name.</span> <span id="s2367">But they'd been led to believe that.</span> <span id="s2368">And, so they came and got her.</span> <span id="s2369">And they got the others, of course, at the same time.</span> <span id="s2370">And the man who operated on Lori was a man called Archibald Makindeau, who had been treating RAF pilots whose faces had been horribly burned.</span> <span id="s2371">And he made a pretty good job of Lori's face.</span> <span id="s2372">At least, you could tell it was her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">MS: Hmm.</span> <span id="s2374">Did you have occasion to meet her again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">LF: Oh yeah, I saw her when I went back to London.</span> <span id="s2376">She could not tell her family about what Ravensbrück was like.</span> <span id="s2377">I spent several hours with them, and I had an awful time explaining to her father and her sister what had been going on.</span> <span id="s2378">If it was awful for me, imagine how awful it was for her to be there, and she had been there three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">MS: Three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">LF: Now, they were not worked to death at Ravensbrück.</span> <span id="s2381">They were just very, very brutally treated.</span> <span id="s2382">And somehow, some of them hung on.</span> <span id="s2383">And then there were certain people like Odette Churchill that were sort of more or less held as hostages, and treated slightly better than the others.</span> <span id="s2384">But only slightly.</span> <span id="s2385">And, I don't know whether we're going to have time to get all of this one on, but the last question I think we're going to have time for today was, how, in my own mind, did I explain the German decision to set up the camps?</span> <span id="s2386">The first thing is money.</span> <span id="s2387">The Nazis needed money to finance all their plans.</span> <span id="s2388">It's a very tough question.</span> <span id="s2389">There's not a single answer to why they did this, but the first thing is money.</span> <span id="s2390">And we also need to remember that Hitler was a total psychopath with a very low-life following.</span> <span id="s2391">The people that glued themselves to him at the beginning were not intellectuals.</span> <span id="s2392">They were essentially what we today call "white trash".</span> <span id="s2393">And, really, thugs, bullies.</span> <span id="s2394">Some of them were homosexual despite the fact that they prosecuted and imprisoned homosexuals, some of them were.</span> <span id="s2395">They were frequently uneducated.</span> <span id="s2396">They were despised by the old Prussian officer class.</span> <span id="s2397">They needed some scapegoats.</span> <span id="s2398">They needed objects of hatred.</span> <span id="s2399">They also needed money, very quickly.</span> <span id="s2400">German Jews, unlike the poor Jews from eastern Europe, had possessions.</span> <span id="s2401">They were often intellectually brilliant.</span> <span id="s2402">They owned property.</span> <span id="s2403">They were industrious.</span> <span id="s2404">They were frugal.</span> <span id="s2405">They were accomplished people.</span> <span id="s2406">They were also a threat to the Nazis in a very subtle way.</span> <span id="s2407">I think in time they would have provided a very strong objection to the lack of moral and spiritual fiber to the bankrupt personalities of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2408">You can't adore the swastika and then bow down before the ark and the scriptures.</span> <span id="s2409">The two just are not compatible in any way.</span> <span id="s2410">You can't do those things in equal measure.</span> <span id="s2411">And the German industrialists who backed Hitler, and they did, saw a chance to grab off Jewish property, to make a lot of money very quickly.</span> <span id="s2412">And I'm speaking of some pretty well-known names.</span> <span id="s2413">I'm talking about Thyssen, the steel magnate, Krupps, who I'll talk about later on because he was an incredible sadist, as well as being horrendously greedy.</span> <span id="s2414">I'm talking about I. G. Farben, Bosch, they, the people who make car ignition parts, BMW.</span> <span id="s2415">They were, none of them had clean hands.</span> <span id="s2416">When you read into what happened in Germany and who used the slave labor, these are the people who used the slave labor.</span> <span id="s2417">So the Jews made them rich in more than one way.</span> <span id="s2418">Because they took their property and got it at fire sale prices, and then worked them to death, literally worked them to death.</span> <span id="s2419">So, that's partly how I explain the camps.</span> <span id="s2420">Ausgerottet is what the Germans called it.</span> <span id="s2421">Kill them off.</span> <span id="s2422">Endlösung came later, Final Solution.</span> <span id="s2423">The evil genius behind the camps wasn't as much Hitler because Hitler didn't have a very strong stomach.</span> <span id="s2424">It was Himmler.</span> <span id="s2425">Heinrich Himmler.</span> <span id="s2426">He absolutely slavishly adored Hitler.</span> <span id="s2427">He'd do anything for him.</span> <span id="s2428">And it was he who made it possible for the industrialists to have their wish in return for their backing.</span> <span id="s2429">Two wonderful Aryans.</span> <span id="s2430">Take a look at photographs of the two of them.</span> <span id="s2431">Himmler, weak, short sighted, anything but a figure of an Aryan.</span> <span id="s2432">Hitler the same way.</span> <span id="s2433">If you saw him without the trappings, those awful cartoons portraying the Jew as a monster, you could have put Hitler's face into some of those very neatly if you took off the toothbrush mustache.</span> <span id="s2434">He wasn't an attractive man at all.</span> <span id="s2435">That's my feeling about what happened with the camps.</span> <span id="s2436">It's possibly oversimplified.</span> <span id="s2437">It's the only explanation I can find, after years and years of reading and thinking and reviewing in my mind.</span> <span id="s2438">All in all, I have to say that this was one of the most horrifying experiences, other than being in it oneself.</span> <span id="s2439">Being a member of that team was one of the most horrifying experiences I ever believe a human can go through.</span> <span id="s2440">And there's not one single person that I know of, that was on that team, who wouldn't agree with me.</span> <span id="s2441">Nobody felt callous about it.</span> <span id="s2442">Everybody that I know that's still alive, and some of them were a lot older than me so some of them are gone, but everybody that I know that's still alive, feels much as I do.</span> <span id="s2443">From different motives sometimes, but they still say it was the worst thing that ever happened to them, outside of their own personal disasters.</span> <span id="s2444">We weren't part of a regiment, so there wasn't really any history.</span> <span id="s2445">I don't know exactly what the army did with their histories, the British Army.</span> <span id="s2446">So we didn't have a lasting entity as a unit.</span> <span id="s2447">So, we didn't write any history.</span> <span id="s2448">I've discussed the, you know, those experiences with a lot of people.</span> <span id="s2449">And some of us later on were loaned to the War Crimes trials, tribunals, both the individual British ones, and the Nüremberg trials.</span> <span id="s2450">I was part of both.</span> <span id="s2451">And, I'd like to talk about the trials and my very bitter feelings about the ending of our work, and what happened after the trials, a little bit later on.</span> <span id="s2452">I've known a lot of people who were involved with concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2453">I didn't have any idea, until we started amassing all the evidence for the trials, just how many camps there were.</span> <span id="s2454">Even having been involved with these few camps, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s2455">I mean, I saw the remains of Treblinka, which, of course, was destroyed by the prisoners themselves.</span> <span id="s2456">And I saw some of the satellite camps around Dachau, and around Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2457">And, the man that I referred to just now, Colonel Draper, was the man who brought Rudolf Höss, the Commandant of Auschwitz to commit himself to telling the story of what had happened, got him to admit the crimes that had been there.</span> <span id="s2458">Jerry Draper was just tremendous.</span> <span id="s2459">He was a lawyer, and he was very, very good at getting that sort of thing out of people, and he just tracked him and got him to tell the story.</span> <span id="s2460">I know one or two people who are former prisoners, survivors, Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s2461">And, I had a sister-in-law--she's now dead--who was at Dachau.</span> <span id="s2462">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">MS: As a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">LF: As a prisoner, and at Belsen.</span> <span id="s2465">And I found her on my second trip back to Belsen.</span> <span id="s2466">I was having problems with a group of Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s2467">My sister-in-law was Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">MS: Married...</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">LF: Her father was a linguist, and an anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s2470">He was anti-Horthy, the dictator, Admiral Horthy.</span> <span id="s2471">All of Zanna's family--her father was shot--all the rest of the family were shipped, and she was the only survivor.</span> <span id="s2472">And when I was on the War Crimes Trials Commission staff, I had gotten her a job.</span> <span id="s2473">She spoke five languages.</span> <span id="s2474">When I first saw her, she looked like a skinned rabbit.</span> <span id="s2475">She was a small woman, and she was very, very, painfully thin.</span> <span id="s2476">I begged and borrowed clothes from people and got her dressed.</span> <span id="s2477">And got people to help cut her hair, and got lipsticks and toothbrushes and things like that for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">MS: What camp did you find her in again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">LF: I found her in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2480">And when I was on the War Crimes Trials, Tribunal staff, I had literally tracked her through the UNRRA camps, and then said that she would be useful to us because of her linguistic ability.</span> <span id="s2481">She could translate anything at sight, and speak five languages.</span> <span id="s2482">And I talked the British Commission into giving her a job.</span> <span id="s2483">And that later led to my brother getting her her papers.</span> <span id="s2484">Because my brother came to see me when I was working in Germany on the second trip there.</span> <span id="s2485">And he just went nuts about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">MS: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s2487">[chuckling] I was a little confused about the relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">LF: No, no, he...</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">MS: It was after...</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">LF: He married her afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">MS: This was your third brother, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">LF: This was, yeah, this was my brother who died three years ago.</span> <span id="s2493">It was his wife.</span> <span id="s2494">She was a really special person.</span> <span id="s2495">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2496">MS: Well when you met her in Bergen-Belsen, of course, she was a stranger to you and you didn't have any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2497">LF: Complete stranger, and I was having problems.</span> <span id="s2498">We had a very rowdy element among some of the Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s2499">They could fight like a bunch of cats.</span> <span id="s2500">And I waded into a bunch of them one night.</span> <span id="s2501">I'd been talking to some other people and it was after work hours and I was, all of a sudden this big scuffle broke out, and I waded into it and started trying to separate them.</span> <span id="s2502">And, I'd been taught how to separate women when they scrap.</span> <span id="s2503">And I had literally dumped a couple of them on the ground, and was yelling at the others, but not having much impact.</span> <span id="s2504">And was on the point of drawing my revolver and firing it into the air, you know, to get some help, and all of a sudden this little "virago" [virile woman] appeared and started screaming at these women.</span> <span id="s2505">And yelling blue and bloody murder at them, and they must have decided that she meant whatever it was that she was saying.</span> <span id="s2506">And she got them quieted down.</span> <span id="s2507">And then she turned to me and in perfect English said, "I don't think they'll give you any more trouble."</span> <span id="s2508">[both laugh] So, that was a bit strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Tape five, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">MS: This is tape five of an interview with Leigh Fraser.</span> <span id="s2511">The date is November the 9th, 1993, and we are continuing this very interesting interview of Leigh's experiences in Europe, and she's going to continue at this point with her work with some of the War Crimes trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">LF: I think a lot of people don't know what happened with some of the more prominent people who were being held in the concentration camps toward the end of the war.</span> <span id="s2513">There were groups that were known as "Honor Prisoners", and many of them were kept in rather strange environments.</span> <span id="s2514">Some were kept at Dachau.</span> <span id="s2515">The principal place, however, where they were kept, was Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s2516">And Flossenbürg had very few Jewish inmates.</span> <span id="s2517">Flossenbürg was the place where after the July the 20th, 1944 plot on Hitler's life, Count Klaus von Stauffenberg, who placed the bomb with which they tried to kill Hitler, was executed, along with Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and many other people.</span> <span id="s2518">They were hung in an empty shed at Flossenbürg with piano wire.</span> <span id="s2519">[in April 1945].</span> <span id="s2520">That led to a wholesale purge-type operation, and one of the things that I am privy to is what happened to Claus von Stauffenberg's family.</span> <span id="s2521">I'm not suggesting that one should have a lot of sympathy for the Germans in general because of what they were allowing to happen.</span> <span id="s2522">But there were people who were pretty decent and who'd had enough of Hitler, and this was one of those families.</span> <span id="s2523">Because of Claus'--who was a Wehrmacht officer--participation in the plot, the whole von Stauffenberg family was taken.</span> <span id="s2524">This included his wife, sisters, brothers, grandparents, the wives and children of the brothers, cousins, all sorts of innocent people, down to the babies of the family.</span> <span id="s2525">And they were shuffled around along with a group of other people, and eventually lumped in together with people like Kurt von Schuschnigg, rather, the former German, ah, Austrian Chancellor, who together with his wife was held.</span> <span id="s2526">There were other people: Pastor Niemöller, Stalin's nephew, various French officials.</span> <span id="s2527">And these people, comprising a group of about 150 people, were shuffled all over the place in the last months of the war, by the Germans, classified as "Honor Prisoners", not beaten and flogged on a daily basis, but they had been tortured when they were first taken.</span> <span id="s2528">And better fed than most of the prisoners, but they were being guarded by the S.S., the Liebstandarte.</span> <span id="s2529">And they were going to be used as pawns in negotiations in German surrender.</span> <span id="s2530">They were shuffled all over the place and were eventually liberated through the courage of a Wehrmacht officer up in the Alto Adige which is part of the high Tyrol.</span> <span id="s2531">They were marched, trained, and marched again, all over southern Germany, into the Alpine redoubts.</span> <span id="s2532">And they suffered horribly.</span> <span id="s2533">Some of the survivors died from tuberculosis afterwards, from some of the privations that they suffered.</span> <span id="s2534">And I think this is basically an illustration that the Nazi Party didn't give a damn.</span> <span id="s2535">They felt that these people were pawns, but the S.S. who were guarding them had instructions to liquidate them during the negotiations.</span> <span id="s2536">Sometimes in front of the negotiators if they couldn't get what they wanted.</span> <span id="s2537">Fortunately it didn't come to that much of a head, and this particular Wehrmacht officer apparently stuck his neck out and got the S.S. to give up and disappear because they were afraid for their own skins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">MS: How did you gain this information, Leigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">LF: I gained this information from members of the von Stauffenberg family themselves, from General Blumentritt's nephew, who was also held in a similar group.</span> <span id="s2540">Blumentritt was one of the officers in the Normandy invasion on the German side.</span> <span id="s2541">And I met some of these people.</span> <span id="s2542">I met Blumentritt's nephew, for example, when I was on NATO staff after Germany entered NATO.</span> <span id="s2543">And when you heard some of these stories from the Prussian old guard--and you have to understand, I don't really like Germans particularly anyway--and I've only got to hear their accent to go berserk.</span> <span id="s2544">But, when you hear these stories you realize that there were some immense struggles among those people, and that they were concerned with their country and not with the Nazi Party.</span> <span id="s2545">And, when they started telling these stories of what had happened to some of their relatives, there was very real distress.</span> <span id="s2546">And I did meet a number of the people in the von Stauffenberg family.</span> <span id="s2547">Both of Claus von Stauffenberg's parents died from the privations that they suffered.</span> <span id="s2548">They, their health was just undermined in being shuffled around in inadequate clothing and in dreadful conditions.</span> <span id="s2549">Perhaps not similar to the horror stories of the camps that we've talked about, but still, not nice by any means.</span> <span id="s2550">And from there, I think we ought to go to the retribution that was exacted in some instances.</span> <span id="s2551">The first example that I can give you is that I was involved in the Bergen-Belsen trials, which were held by the British and which lasted approximately two months, in the fall of 1945.</span> <span id="s2552">The S.S. and some of the Kapos from Bergen-Belsen were tried, and several of us who had been on the interviewing teams gave evidence.</span> <span id="s2553">Several prisoners, former prisoners, gave evidence, and there were some convictions.</span> <span id="s2554">There were approximately 40 depend- defendants.</span> <span id="s2555">There were about nine people sentenced to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">MS: Was the Commandant of the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">LF: The camp Commandant was sentenced to death, Josef Kramer.</span> <span id="s2558">And Elisabeth Volkenrath, who was one of the S.S. guards, really belligerent, extremely unpleasant woman, with whom I had a couple of shouting matches in the early days at Bergen-Belsen, was sentenced to death.</span> <span id="s2559">And so was Irma Gries, the woman I referred to before who was known as the "Bitch of Belsen", and who thoroughly deserved it.</span> <span id="s2560">They were hung.</span> <span id="s2561">There were other people that were sentenced to fairly lengthy prison terms, and they served most of them, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s2562">Because there they were sentenced early in the game, and before the War Crimes Trials Clemency Boards got into the act in the '50s, and before people felt confident enough to start applying political pressure.</span> <span id="s2563">Among them was the chief Kapo at the camp.</span> <span id="s2564">And I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s2565">It's documented somewhere.</span> <span id="s2566">And, this Polish woman, who was known as Stemma the Flogger.</span> <span id="s2567">She was one of the Kapos.</span> <span id="s2568">They, you have to understand that the Kapos were just incredible people.</span> <span id="s2569">They were almost like robots.</span> <span id="s2570">They were so intent on saving themselves that they just literally numbed themselves to the suffering of their fellow prisoners.</span> <span id="s2571">They didn't give a hang.</span> <span id="s2572">They didn't give a hang.</span> <span id="s2573">Periodically, in most of the camps, the Kapos who got too "uppity", to use that good old American folksy expression, were wiped out.</span> <span id="s2574">But, those of them who served well, usually managed to find somebody who saved their neck.</span> <span id="s2575">And Kramer was the kind of guy who liked to have a lot of loyalty.</span> <span id="s2576">And he kept his Kapos longer than a lot of the camp Commandants did.</span> <span id="s2577">And I must say that the evidence that I saw at Belsen, and what the inmates told me, bore out that these people lived a very privileged life for prisoners--the Kapos I'm talking about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">MS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">LF: The trials were unbelievable because, every one of those people that were, that was on trial, lied like a bandit.</span> <span id="s2580">In all the War Crimes trials that I saw, including the A trials at Nuremberg, only one person ever pleaded guilty, and that was Albert Speer.</span> <span id="s2581">The rest of them didn't do it, didn't see it, weren't there, shifted the blame to somebody else.</span> <span id="s2582">And, somebody once said, one of the prisoners sarcastically said, "This Hitler must have been some kind of guy.</span> <span id="s2583">He ran the country, built the munitions, and fought the war, and not one damn German helped him."</span> <span id="s2584">[chuckles] And that's really rather ironic.</span> <span id="s2585">But that's what you got all the time.</span> <span id="s2586">"I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s2587">I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s2588">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s2589">It was exaggerated.</span> <span id="s2590">It's a lie."</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">MS: Wasn't there evidence to refute that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">LF: Oh, there was plenty of evidence to refute it.</span> <span id="s2593">And this of course is how the sentences were obtained.</span> <span id="s2594">But, they were so damned arrogant, the Germans and their Kapo henchmen, that they felt that they could "BS" their way out of these heinous charges.</span> <span id="s2595">They were so used to having their way.</span> <span id="s2596">Remember, that they had been ruling the roost.</span> <span id="s2597">Remember, too, that concentration camps had been in existence since 1933.</span> <span id="s2598">That was the first published thing, in the Munich equivalent of The Illustrated News.</span> <span id="s2599">There were pictures published, as I later discovered.</span> <span id="s2600">They thought they didn't owe anybody any explanation for what they did because they were doing it for the German Reich.</span> <span id="s2601">And therefore, they were entitled to do any damn thing they pleased.</span> <span id="s2602">You have to see some of the files when they sent people to their deaths.</span> <span id="s2603">Not the numberless thousands who got off the trains and went straight to the death camps without really being any more than just a herd.</span> <span id="s2604">But, the people they held for a while all had a file, a very carefully numbered file.</span> <span id="s2605">And, when they were finally sent [sneezes] [excuse me], after being held, when they were finally sent to their deaths, their death sentences always read, "To Special Treatment By Order of the Führer's S.S." The Führer's the Chief of the S.S. Because that's exactly what the word Führer means.</span> <span id="s2606">So, they felt that they had the right to do this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">MS: When you say that special people had files, of course not every victim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">LF: Not every victim had files, but there certainly were some very well-recorded files.</span> <span id="s2609">And everybody that got a concentration camp number had a file.</span> <span id="s2610">They didn't tattoo the crowds of people who had just got off the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">MS: It was, the crowds were too immense.</span> <span id="s2612">The [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">LF: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">MS: For, it was just too overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">LF: That's why you hear every number imaginable, between six million and nine million.</span> <span id="s2616">I think if the truth is told, that the nine million figure, all together, is probably somewhere close to the truth.</span> <span id="s2617">I think it has to between nine and ten million people, of whom approximately six million were Jewish.</span> <span id="s2618">I don't believe that there is any way that one can ever reconcile those numbers because of the enormous destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">MS: It’s impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">LF: And because of the lack of documentation of some of the tribal qualities of the Gypsies, for example, and the nomadic life, and the somewhat disorderly village life of Middle Europe.</span> <span id="s2621">There were lots of people who were so ignorant that they didn't necessarily register their children's births.</span> <span id="s2622">So who knew whether a family went to their deaths with six or eight children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">MS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">LF: And in the German mind, who cared?</span> <span id="s2625">Because nobody really did care.</span> <span id="s2626">Just get rid of them, the flotsam.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">MS: Absolutely tragic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">LF: To return briefly to the Belsen trials, I'm a fairly religious person most of the time.</span> <span id="s2629">I'm not a maniac about it, but I really do believe that there is a Supreme Being.</span> <span id="s2630">And I begged God to forgive me for my feelings, as I sat listening and giving evidence a couple of times.</span> <span id="s2631">I took an immense glee in staring down some of the people that I knew had committed heinous things at Belsen.</span> <span id="s2632">And, when the death sentences were passed on some of them, and the prison sentences on the others, I couldn't even find any pity at all.</span> <span id="s2633">I couldn't even pray to God to forgive me for my feelings.</span> <span id="s2634">I was so absolutely stunned at the enormity.</span> <span id="s2635">That was the first time that we got all the figures together of all the things in that courtroom.</span> <span id="s2636">And it was absolutely terrifying to listen to one story after another, and to see one pile of documents after another, brought on in little wheeled carts, and to hear one interpreter/interviewer after another get up and say, "There are 800 files in this cart.</span> <span id="s2637">There are 1300 files in this cart.</span> <span id="s2638">I attest to the fact that I've looked at all of them and that every one of them bears notations that I made while interviewing prisoners."</span> <span id="s2639">And then a particular prisoner would be called up.</span> <span id="s2640">You would be asked to name a prisoner and you would call up a prisoner who would attest to particular events.</span> <span id="s2641">It was just terrifying to see these mountains of paper that attested to the systematic killing and torture of people.</span> <span id="s2642">And there was no way that you could find, or at least I couldn't find, any pity at all.</span> <span id="s2643">And I was pretty terrified by the depths of my own emotions at that time.</span> <span id="s2644">I wa-, I still cringe, nearly 50 years later, I still cringe when I hear a German accent.</span> <span id="s2645">And I'm very well aware of the long-buried feelings and the troubles that lots of the prisoners have carried with them, the former prisoners have carried with them, through their lives.</span> <span id="s2646">After everything I've said about all of this, I've got some very condemnatory remarks to make about both the British and the American governments.</span> <span id="s2647">I think that both countries did an absolutely abominable job of convicting all but a very few of the German Nazi criminals who killed almost everybody that opposed them.</span> <span id="s2648">It was considered to be cheaper by the British not to bring some to trial.</span> <span id="s2649">It was a lot more expedient for the Americans to use the T-squads, which they used to whisk thousands of scientists out from under the noses of the Russians.</span> <span id="s2650">They whisked them and their families, at fifteen minutes' notice.</span> <span id="s2651">People like Werner von Braun, who was the most famous of them, they were going to be useful to this country.</span> <span id="s2652">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">MS: What do you mean by T-squads?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">LF: They had these squads where they had a special sign with a big red "T" on their helmet, and they had authority to find a scientist and his family who was on their list, their want-list, and no one could stop them from requisitioning transportation, facilities, feeding, and to get these people out.</span> <span id="s2655">And some of them were packed and gone within fifteen to thirty minutes of being found, and whisked out of the country so that the Russians wouldn't get them.</span> <span id="s2656">And many of them went on to become American citizens in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">MS: And these people were all part of the Nazi war machine?</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">LF: Lots of them were at Peenemünde, where they were developing the rockets, the V-1 and the V-2 rockets.</span> <span id="s2659">And I can attest to the fact that those rockets and the buzz bombs devastated London, as many American servicemen who were there will tell you; the populace went around listening to those drones, which the V-1s were.</span> <span id="s2660">And you waited until the engine cut out and you'd dive for cover.</span> <span id="s2661">Fortunately, I was out of England during some of that time.</span> <span id="s2662">But that started right after the invasion, in June of 1944.</span> <span id="s2663">By mid-June they were in operation and almost the entire south coast had to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s2664">Hospitals, schools, orphanages, so as to get loads of people away from them.</span> <span id="s2665">The V-1s were bad enough.</span> <span id="s2666">You could hear them coming and they terrified you, especially when the engine cut out.</span> <span id="s2667">The V-2s were worse.</span> <span id="s2668">A V-2 could decimate a city block.</span> <span id="s2669">And these people that I'm talking about, who were rescued by the T-squads and whisked into this country, had been doing that.</span> <span id="s2670">They had been...</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">MS: They were the scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">LF: Experimenting.</span> <span id="s2673">They were the scientists.</span> <span id="s2674">They were the people who developed these things, and they were the people who were going to be useful to this country.</span> <span id="s2675">And apparently the plans were long and well-laid to bring them out because it was a very efficient machinery.</span> <span id="s2676">And I personally saw that work on lots of occasions.</span> <span id="s2677">I think it's criminal.</span> <span id="s2678">These people killed my countrymen.</span> <span id="s2679">They aided in the killing of others.</span> <span id="s2680">They supervised slave labor.</span> <span id="s2681">And then they were brought to America and given a privileged life, helped to get their citizenship outside the normal framework.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">MS: What was the political reason behind this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">LF: To get them away from the Russians, because the Russians were going to be such a threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">MS: Don’t you think the Russians would have killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">LF: Oh, the Russians didn't kill them.</span> <span id="s2686">They took them and used them and they put them in servitude and used them, those that they got.</span> <span id="s2687">This was the early part of the Space Race and the ICBM rockets.</span> <span id="s2688">This was the foundation for all of that terror that we went through during the years of the Cold War.</span> <span id="s2689">And, the U.S./U.S.S.R. stand-offs.</span> <span id="s2690">So, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">MS: So it was simply a race between the two nations to shelter these scientists.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">LF: That's correct.</span> <span id="s2693">That's correct.</span> <span id="s2694">As I said, many of them were given U.S. citizenship.</span> <span id="s2695">There were supposedly de-nazification programs in operation.</span> <span id="s2696">They were an absolutely ludicrous joke.</span> <span id="s2697">Within months, many of them were reinstated, approved by the occupying forces because they felt they needed them.</span> <span id="s2698">They were the only people who knew how to run this or that or the other aspect of the country.</span> <span id="s2699">There was a lot of pressure from various groups.</span> <span id="s2700">We had an M.P., a Member of Parliament in Britain, called Victor Galance, who was totally opposed to the War Crimes trials and who made enormous fusses.</span> <span id="s2701">Another name, that I have no hesitation in mentioning, is that of Antony Eden, who went on to become the Prime Minister in a Tory government.</span> <span id="s2702">Antony Eden was for years a pro-Arabist.</span> <span id="s2703">He was extremely gentlemanly, but he was also extremely gentlemanly in his antisemitism.</span> <span id="s2704">There was absolutely no one who knew anything about government who didn't understand that very clearly.</span> <span id="s2705">And he put an enormous amount of pressure on the coalition government that Britain had.</span> <span id="s2706">And even though a Labor government was developed immediately after the war in Britain, when Britain became somewhat Socialist, he still exerted a lot of influence.</span> <span id="s2707">And he and his cohorts were among the prime movers at stopping the whole process of severity in the trials.</span> <span id="s2708">They were also very instrumental in something that doesn't even really directly relate to this, but relates to the plight of all those numberless thousands afterwards, in trying to keep people out of Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">LF: And you know that there was a great deal of pressure there, which is an entirely different subject.</span> <span id="s2711">And to go back to the whole de-nazification thing.</span> <span id="s2712">It was such a horrible joke.</span> <span id="s2713">The S.S. were helped to escape from Germany by the Vatican, by the Perón government in Argentina.</span> <span id="s2714">Many of them sailed from the port of Genoa under a program which was known as the Kameradenverein [phonetic], which was a, an internal S.S. quasi-welfare society to look after each other.</span> <span id="s2715">I can take you within ten miles of this house and show you where a former S.S. officer lives, who lived in Argentina, who joined the Argentine Air Force, and then came into this country.</span> <span id="s2716">He was a doctor, a graduate of the University of Vienna.</span> <span id="s2717">After serving with the Argentine Air Force, he came into this country and was in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the chimpanzee program which was the pre- Man in Space program.</span> <span id="s2718">He is retired as a U.S. Navy civilian, drawing a pension from people in this country.</span> <span id="s2719">And he's only one.</span> <span id="s2720">I can take you directly to that house in very short order.</span> <span id="s2721">I know his name.</span> <span id="s2722">He's listed in the telephone book.</span> <span id="s2723">He's not alone.</span> <span id="s2724">There are hundreds of people in this country who participated in similar ways.</span> <span id="s2725">Dozens of U.S. citizens were former S.S. employees.</span> <span id="s2726">Demjanjuk was only one of many, many Kapos who got away and who got into this country one way or another.</span> <span id="s2727">Lots of them emerged in the UNRRA camps and managed to get themselves classified as victims, displaced persons, and that's how they got here.</span> <span id="s2728">They were able to establish a new life with the connivance of this government.</span> <span id="s2729">And there were so many pressures brought on them.</span> <span id="s2730">Everybody thinks that McCarthy was so bad about the Communist trials in the '50s.</span> <span id="s2731">Very few people realize that McCarthy did his best to screw up the Nuremberg trials too, and brought a hell of a lot of pressure there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">MS: I was not aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">LF: He was a member of the German-American Bund!</span> <span id="s2734">He was a Senator from Wisconsin, he was a Congressman from Wisconsin in those days.</span> <span id="s2735">Wisconsin is heavily German.</span> <span id="s2736">Milwaukee was almost exclusively German.</span> <span id="s2737">I know a couple of retired U.S. Air Force officers whose mothers wrote to them all during the war in German.</span> <span id="s2738">That didn't make these guys bad citizens, but it certainly proves that there was a very strong unity in the German community.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Tape five, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">LF: See, so many people don't know some of this stuff.</span> <span id="s2741">To begin with, people don't read.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">MS: This is tape five, side two, of an interview with, we are continuing our interview with Leigh Fraser at this moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">LF: It's true that there were trials.</span> <span id="s2744">And it's true that the Allies hung a few people and imprisoned a good many others.</span> <span id="s2745">I think that a lot of people don't realize that those sentences were meddled with under political pressure, sometimes internal, McCarthism I'm talking about and also later, under international pressure.</span> <span id="s2746">Almost everybody had their sentence commuted, and nearly all of them were free by the mid-fifties, '56, '57, '58, except people like poor, mad old Hess, who was being held as a Russian political pawn in Spandau, and Admirals Doenitz and Raeder and Albert Speer, who were being held for twenty-year sentences.</span> <span id="s2747">And most of them served their full sentence, weren't released till '66.</span> <span id="s2748">They were the exception rather than the rule.</span> <span id="s2749">The horrible thing is that the same bankers ran the banks in West Germany.</span> <span id="s2750">The same industrialists made millions of marks during the West German redevelopment period.</span> <span id="s2751">And if you look at the names, they'd make you sick because these are the same people that employed all those millions of slave laborers that they worked to death.</span> <span id="s2752">And the thing that I want to finally comment on is a man who I consider to be probably the prime murderer of slave laborers, Lager prisoners, of all time.</span> <span id="s2753">And that is Alfred Krupp.</span> <span id="s2754">I consider him to be the worst of the world's mass murderers.</span> <span id="s2755">Today, all these years later, still no one's ever been able to figure out exactly how many concentration camps served his empire.</span> <span id="s2756">We know that he failed to make a go of the big detonator factory that he built at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2757">He actually complained to the camp Commandant, Rudolf Höss, that, "Höss's S.S. men gassed too many for me to be able to obtain enough labor."</span> <span id="s2758">And that's a quotation, direct quotation from him.</span> <span id="s2759">Krupp fed his workers one meal in their twelve-hour work day.</span> <span id="s2760">It was known as Bunkersuppe, and it was a 350-calorie bowl of greasy water, with pieces of vegetable in it.</span> <span id="s2761">It was the only meal those people got all day.</span> <span id="s2762">They were marched five to six miles, that's approximately an hour-and-a-half for a healthy person to walk.</span> <span id="s2763">Then they worked twelve hours.</span> <span id="s2764">And they weren't just beaten by their guards.</span> <span id="s2765">They were beaten by their fellow German workers because remember, that lots of these people were also Germans who happened to be Jews.</span> <span id="s2766">But they'd been deprived of their citizenship, of course.</span> <span id="s2767">And then they had to march back again, to their concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2768">And dear Mr. Krupp, in his factory at Essen, stood up in his windows and watched them marched in every day and watched them marched out.</span> <span id="s2769">The conditions were so bad in his factories that even the Nazi doctors complained about them.</span> <span id="s2770">So that says something, because they were not notorious for being very humanitarian themselves.</span> <span id="s2771">But they complained about the inhuman conditions.</span> <span id="s2772">And he was such a sadist that he used to stand there and grin as they marched them in.</span> <span id="s2773">There are photographs that were shown of him at the trials doing this.</span> <span id="s2774">One of the secretaries that was employed at the Essen Works testified at the Nuremberg trials that he kept a cupboard-sized basement cage.</span> <span id="s2775">It was used as a place of punishment.</span> <span id="s2776">And almost anything could get you punishment.</span> <span id="s2777">And in the winter weather, which gets pretty darned awful in Germany, these people were placed in this basement cage, [cupboard], and cold water was poured in.</span> <span id="s2778">The secretary worked on the fifth floor, and she said you could hear the screams on the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s2779">That's only one little story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">MS: This was all brought out at, in the Nuremberg trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">LF: It was brought out in the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s2782">This was actual testimony at his trial.</span> <span id="s2783">In April of 1945, with the Allied armies banging at Germany's gates, and sometimes already in Germany, he didn't want to be caught using slave labor.</span> <span id="s2784">So he packed up 520 women onto a train at Bochum, outside Essen, where they joined 1500 men from another one of his camps, or his factories.</span> <span id="s2785">Five of the women escaped, and all five testified at his trial.</span> <span id="s2786">That train went to Buchenwald, where the Commandant refused the shipment.</span> <span id="s2787">Refused these slightly more than 2,000 people, saying, and I quote, "It's too late to murder another 2,000 people today."</span> <span id="s2788">The train was then sent north to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2789">The next day Bergen-Belsen was liberated.</span> <span id="s2790">All of the people on that train were ill-treated and starving, but none of them were gassed or shot.</span> <span id="s2791">One of the few times that everything went right, if you could call that right.</span> <span id="s2792">Krupp was sentenced to 12 years in Landsberg for employing slave labor.</span> <span id="s2793">The sentence was passed on June the 30th, 1948.</span> <span id="s2794">He didn't even blink at that sentence until the judge ordered him, in the second part of the sentence, to forfeit all his possessions.</span> <span id="s2795">He turned absolutely white then and nearly fainted.</span> <span id="s2796">Now you have to remember, we are talking about a man who was a billionaire.</span> <span id="s2797">That part of his sentence was reversed when the United States wanted the Germans to join NATO in late 1949--a little bit more political expediency.</span> <span id="s2798">They exerted a ton of pressure, the Germans did, to release him and his fellow industrialists as a price for joining NATO.</span> <span id="s2799">They were released.</span> <span id="s2800">So, the Germans got their way again.</span> <span id="s2801">Krupp, along with Fritz Thyssen, from the German Steel Industry, the I. G. Farben directors, Herman Bosch, the people that make the spark plugs and car parts, some of the BMW directors, were very well-treated at Landsberg.</span> <span id="s2802">Krupp even was given a special room to use for Krupp Directors’ Meetings, furnished luxuriously with things sent from the Krupp factories.</span> <span id="s2803">He was released on the 3rd of February, 1951.</span> <span id="s2804">And I followed this, because I was assigned to NATO in 1950.</span> <span id="s2805">And I started tracking a lot of this stuff.</span> <span id="s2806">His possessions were restored to him at that time.</span> <span id="s2807">That order was signed by a man called John McCloy, who was a high-ranking U.S. Army civilian, who was the successor to General Lucius Clay, who'd been the Commandant, the American Commandant in Germany.</span> <span id="s2808">John McCloy was a representative of the Secretary of the Army, the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s2809">I'm just about at the end.</span> <span id="s2810">This is a dreadful epitaph.</span> <span id="s2811">It's absolutely terrible.</span> <span id="s2812">We didn't do anything to save them before the war when we knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s2813">I know some of us tried to help those that were left alive when we went into those terrible camps.</span> <span id="s2814">But I still think that our governments betrayed survivors.</span> <span id="s2815">And they betrayed those of us who were there, who liberated them, who tried to help them.</span> <span id="s2816">I really honestly believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">MS: It's an unbelievable ending to a period of history that is indescribable in its horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">LF: It says some pretty awful things about political pressure, doesn't it?</span> <span id="s2819">And expedincy.</span> <span id="s2820">Look at the list of the people.</span> <span id="s2821">Who ran the Deutsche Bank for years?</span> <span id="s2822">Herman Obs [phonetic].</span> <span id="s2823">The Deutsche Bank is the biggest bank in the world.</span> <span id="s2824">Herman Obs was the Nazi banker.</span> <span id="s2825">Tons of those people came back to positions of power.</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">MS: And were never indicted for any...</span></p> <p><span id="s2827">LF: Well, they were tried.</span> <span id="s2828">Some of them were tried.</span> <span id="s2829">Some of them were denazified and let go.</span> <span id="s2830">But Obs was never tried.</span> <span id="s2831">I don't know how far one carries the retribution for what a nation does.</span> <span id="s2832">I don't know whether you can say that the banker didn't know, and excuse it on those grounds.</span> <span id="s2833">But I do know that the American administration in Germany was about the blindest, stupidest thing that you can imagine, as far as these people were concerned.</span> <span id="s2834">And I also know that my own government, the British government, just plain didn't want to get involved in a lot of this because Britain was broke after six years of war and just couldn't stand the expense of prosecuting it.</span> <span id="s2835">We should have passed all that on to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2836">They've been far more prosperous than they've deserved to be.</span> <span id="s2837">And then, damn it, we gave them Marshall Aid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">MS: It really doesn't make very much sense.</span> <span id="s2839">And maybe it was a fear of another Versailles Treaty-type of treatment that they were trying to avoid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">LF: I think there's a very real fear of that, and I do think that the seeds for what happened in Germany in World War II were sown in the greed of the Versailles Treaty.</span> <span id="s2841">When I first went to college, one of my first two degrees was a degree in history, and it was a pretty wide-flung history.</span> <span id="s2842">One of the things that we studied was post-World War I Europe and its economic crisis.</span> <span id="s2843">And I do think that there was a lot of greed exhibited in the reparations program.</span> <span id="s2844">The French were particularly rapacious.</span> <span id="s2845">Lots of things were brought to this country.</span> <span id="s2846">Lots of things were also brought to this country after World War II.</span> <span id="s2847">People don't realize that.</span> <span id="s2848">There's a floating crane down in Philadelphia that was brought all the way across the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s2849">A crane!</span> <span id="s2850">An enormous crane, that was part of the Hamburg docks.</span> <span id="s2851">Countries do strange things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">MS: What point did that serve?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">LF: They wanted the crane, and it's still in use today.</span> <span id="s2854">It is an engineering model.</span> <span id="s2855">I don't know what's going to happen to it when they close the shipyard down there.</span> <span id="s2856">But what's the point in doing something like that and then turning around and giving them millions of dollars in aid?</span> <span id="s2857">We give with one hand and we take away with the other.</span> <span id="s2858">We condemn them and then we don't punish them.</span> <span id="s2859">Or, we partially punish them and then pat them on the head and say, "I'm sure you'll be little, good little boys in the future."</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">MS: It probably was a fear that they, that if they punish them too severely they'll have repercussions again in the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">LF: In the mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">MS: Who knows?</span> <span id="s2863">I, it could, I could be all wrong of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">LF: In the meantime, as far as I'm concerned, the ashes of close to 10 million people call out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">MS: [sighs] Very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">LF: And when I think about the scenes that I described last time, in Belsen, and I think about hundreds of people dying daily in the middle of freedom, that we couldn't stop, I wonder why we did some of the things we did, what people were thinking about.</span> <span id="s2867">And it wasn't the little people who were on the scene that were making these decisions.</span> <span id="s2868">These decisions were coming off high-level government desks.</span> <span id="s2869">Pressure was being exerted by Congressmen and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s2870">And it's another one of those, well, "Let's get on with it, that's another chapter behind us."</span> <span id="s2871">But all of life was gone for those people.</span> <span id="s2872">And it was, it smacks so much of, "Sweep them under the rug.</span> <span id="s2873">Who cares?"</span> <span id="s2874">And I'm talking about all of them, the political detainees, the Gypsies, the resistance people, the people whose only crime was in being Jewish, if that's a crime, and that's pretty sarcastic, I know.</span> <span id="s2875">And it's not meant to be unpleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">MS: I understand Leigh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">LF: And it could so easily have been any of us.</span> <span id="s2878">That's the terrifying thing.</span> <span id="s2879">I think I told you at the beginning that I was brought up in a very thinking family.</span> <span id="s2880">And I can't help but think about Hillel again, "If not me, who?</span> <span id="s2881">If not now, when?"</span> <span id="s2882">And the who and the when never came for those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">MS: And there's a big question mark for the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">LF: And it's a big, big question mark for the future.</span> <span id="s2885">And you'll remember, we looked at those photographs of Europe as it used to be.</span> <span id="s2886">Dirty, muddy, poor, but showing signs of people being happy together.</span> <span id="s2887">It might not be the way that we'd live, in the houses that we have today, and in the standards of this country, but it was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">MS: It's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">LF: And that's, every day something that I can't help but feel very, very grateful for.</span> <span id="s2890">I don't like to bring these memories out very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">MS: They're very painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">LF: They're dreadful.</span> <span id="s2893">After the last taping, I had real trouble sleeping for a couple of nights.</span> <span id="s2894">And I've dragged out bits and pieces of diaries and looked at them, and every time I think about that period, I can't think about it for very long without crying.</span> <span id="s2895">I don't bring those thoughts out very often any more.</span> <span id="s2896">I just hope that people believe what they've heard.</span> <span id="s2897">I hope that when people go around and talk about this, or when scholars dig into this and print things, that somehow we'll make future generations believe that this was evil.</span> <span id="s2898">And that they'll see that it doesn't happen again.</span> <span id="s2899">That's the whole point I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">MS: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s2901">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">LF: For our grandchildren, for the generations after them, because we've lived through a pretty tense period since.</span> <span id="s2903">The last thirty to thirty-five years have been pretty awful with the constant threat of maybe two major nations going at each others' throats again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">MS: With nuclear bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">LF: And the consequent price for mankind, not just for then, but for years to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">MS: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">LF: And I'm terribly troubled when I see some of the magazine articles, and the photographs of some of the wilder groups, the Aryan Nation and the Skinhead groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">MS: That are resurfacing today, yes.</span> <span id="s2909">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">LF: And I hear the awful stories that they don't believe that this ever happened, that it was all made up.</span> <span id="s2911">When I hear that, I wish I could take them by the hand and whisk them back to Germany in April of 1945 and propel them forcibly through those camps.</span> <span id="s2912">And maybe leave them there for a week or two, to be kicked and screamed at, and starved, and see if they felt so easy about it in their minds afterwards.</span> <span id="s2913">Because I've had a couple of confrontations of that type.</span> <span id="s2914">I have a son who lives in Oregon, and there are a couple of groups in Oregon who are absolutely out of their minds.</span> <span id="s2915">And I've seen them at rallies.</span> <span id="s2916">I've also worked in Skokie, Illinois, in my profession.</span> <span id="s2917">And Skokie is loaded, loaded, with Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s2918">It's hard to go into a store--I worked in Skokie in the '70's for about four months--it's really hard to go into almost any major store or even a small store in some neighborhoods, and not hear the accents of middle Europe, not to catch a glimpse of a tattooed arm.</span> <span id="s2919">And you begin to realize that here are some of the people that we were able to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">MS: And you can understand their anger when the Ku Klux Klan opted to march in Skokie.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">LF: I can understand that anger.</span> <span id="s2922">I can understand why they go absolutely rampaging mad when they see the Aryan Nation pictured on the front of a paper, saying that none of this stuff ever happened, or that Hitler didn't go far enough.</span> <span id="s2923">And it's also enough to make you sick, if you go back into Germany, and Germans still insist that it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s2924">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s2925">And there are lots of them that will insist that.</span> <span id="s2926">Now I've met a number of German officers, during the time that I was in NATO, who will talk about it, and who will admit that there was a lot of wrong.</span> <span id="s2927">But in general, that populace has put its head in the sand like ostriches.</span> <span id="s2928">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s2929">Dachau didn't happen.</span> <span id="s2930">The village is a mile from the camp!</span> <span id="s2931">People from the camp were walked into there.</span> <span id="s2932">They worked in the shops.</span> <span id="s2933">They cleaned the streets.</span> <span id="s2934">They did everything.</span> <span id="s2935">Goebbels thundered in the Sport Palast at Nuremberg to the Germans, and asked them if they wanted total war.</span> <span id="s2936">And they thundered back, "Yes!"</span> <span id="s2937">They didn't have total war until the last few months, because while the rest of Europe, western Europe, including my own country, gave up its domestic help, while this country went to its "Rosie the Riveters", and we had in Britain "Call up" for women after the age of 18 to be directed into essential employment or the services, the Germans didn't give up their maids.</span> <span id="s2938">They didn't give up their easy way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">MS: All through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">LF: All through the war.</span> <span id="s2941">Why should they?</span> <span id="s2942">They had slave labor.</span> <span id="s2943">[pause] There are actually pictures around of convicts, as they referred to them in Dachau, you know, in the village...</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">MS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">LF: Painting people's houses as late as 1944.</span> <span id="s2946">Painting private houses.</span> <span id="s2947">There are documented cases of people, a school teacher, from one of the nearby schools, asking if people came to look at the castle.</span> <span id="s2948">"We don't see many American tourists here.</span> <span id="s2949">You came to look at our beautiful castle?"</span> <span id="s2950">That question was asked once of a Turkish journalist called Niren Gune, [?]</span> <span id="s2951">who lives today in New York.</span> <span id="s2952">Gune was taken prisoner by the Germans, discredited, and was a prisoner at Dachau.</span> <span id="s2953">And he and his American wife were actually asked that by a German school teacher about twenty years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">MS: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">LF: And not wanting to offend the teacher and her little girls, "Yes, of course, we came to see your beautiful castle."</span> <span id="s2956">And it's very well-documented that Gune was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s2957">He was about the only Turk that they held.</span> <span id="s2958">My landlady, who was a nice lady, in Nuremberg, I don't really believe knew any of this.</span> <span id="s2959">Her husband had been a professor.</span> <span id="s2960">He was called up into the Volksturm.</span> <span id="s2961">That was the ragtag army that the Germans pulled together at the end of World War II out of old men, university professors, little boys.</span> <span id="s2962">And he was killed.</span> <span id="s2963">You know, this was the last defense of Germany.</span> <span id="s2964">And she was very suspicious of me for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s2965">And we had a couple of conversations.</span> <span id="s2966">She was not an ignorant woman.</span> <span id="s2967">And she told me that she lived in terror when they had the big rallies because there were such rampages and such drunken parties among the Nazis afterwards.</span> <span id="s2968">But she said, other than a few early articles that she had seen in the newspapers about concentration camps being established, she had no idea.</span> <span id="s2969">And my experience with that woman leads me to believe that she may have been one of the few who didn't have any idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">MS: Well many claim that, but it doesn't seem...</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">LF: It's not possible when they lived within two or three miles of a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">MS: But you feel it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">LF: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">MS: It could have happened if they were at greater distances?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">LF: If they were at greater distances, yes, because there was such a censorship of, you know, information in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s2976">I believe that if you lived more than five or six miles from a concentration camp, you might not know.</span> <span id="s2977">Unless it was a death camp, with a chimney going, and then the whole countryside knew.</span> <span id="s2978">But there were more than 200 small concentration camps, as well as the big ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">MS: There were over 400.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">LF: I know there were over 400 all together.</span> <span id="s2981">But, the small ones, the little satellite camps, were just everywhere.</span> <span id="s2982">There were about 30 camps all the way around Essen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">MS: They must have seen marches between the camps, and between the slave labor factories and the camps where they were returned to each night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">LF: Yeah, because these people weren't marched down special roads.</span> <span id="s2985">They were marched down the ordinary highways.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">MS: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">LF: And always under guard, and they looked ragged.</span> <span id="s2988">They looked underfed.</span> <span id="s2989">And surely nobody can believe that that many people are really prisoners for good reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">Tape six, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2991">MS: This is tape six of an interv-, or our interview with Leigh Fraser.</span> <span id="s2992">It will be our concluding tape, and this is being recorded on November 9th, 1993.</span> <span id="s2993">And we'll just continue very briefly at this point.</span> <span id="s2994">Leigh, I do want to thank you so much for your interview.</span> <span id="s2995">It's really invaluable, because there are not many people that we have recorded in the Archive that have had the vast experience with the concentration camps, with the trials, with the war itself, and for this we are very, very appreciative.</span> <span id="s2996">I think there's just a little more that you would want to tell us perhaps about a relative who was very helpful in harboring some children in France.</span> <span id="s2997">And perhaps that will conclude our interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">LF: All right.</span> <span id="s2999">I think I told you at the beginning that my mother was Russian.</span> <span id="s3000">And various of her relatives escaped from the early Revolution when the Reds took over.</span> <span id="s3001">And one of the people who escaped was my mother's cousin.</span> <span id="s3002">Her name was Irina Galitzyna.</span> <span id="s3003">Galitzyna is a very old, noble, Russian name.</span> <span id="s3004">She became a very well-known dress designer.</span> <span id="s3005">She was actually Princess Irina Galitzyna.</span> <span id="s3006">She died last year, in September of '92, and she was '93 years old when she died.</span> <span id="s3007">She lived in the environs of Paris all during the German occupation because that's where she had gone.</span> <span id="s3008">She had just about had it with everything by the time the Germans came to Paris, and the first thing they tried to do was dispossess her of this small chateau that she owned out at Chatou, which is on the outskirts of Paris.</span> <span id="s3009">She told the German Colonel he could go to hell.</span> <span id="s3010">She wasn't moving again.</span> <span id="s3011">She'd been dispossessed by Communists.</span> <span id="s3012">She was damned if she was gonna be dispossessed again by Fascists, and that he could either take her and shoot her or he could hang her from the trees at the entrance if he wanted to warn the rest of the population.</span> <span id="s3013">Otherwise she was staying put.</span> <span id="s3014">And, from what I can gather, he bowed and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s3016">LF: And she was quite a spitfire, so I can just imagine this scene.</span> <span id="s3017">I lived with her when I was stationed in Paris, in the '50s.</span> <span id="s3018">And I witnessed some God-awful rows about other things [chuckling] so I can imagine her doing this.</span> <span id="s3019">Last year, she summoned several of us to Paris because of something else that happened in the family.</span> <span id="s3020">We had a relative that emerged from the Soviet Union and, with his family, and she wanted us all to talk.</span> <span id="s3021">And in that period of time, I was helping her sort some things, and we were talking about my mother and various things.</span> <span id="s3022">And we were looking for something she wanted to give me.</span> <span id="s3023">And in a drawer in which we were looking, I found what was obviously a metal box.</span> <span id="s3024">And I popped it open and there was a medal of the Legion d'Honneur, [Legion of Honor], from France.</span> <span id="s3025">And I said, "Oh look!</span> <span id="s3026">What's this?"</span> <span id="s3027">And she looked at it and grabbed it out of my hand, and said, "Oh, the government gave me that several years ago."</span> <span id="s3028">And I said, "What for?"</span> <span id="s3029">And she said, "Oh, a little scheme I had during the war which worked very well."</span> <span id="s3030">She said, "You know, the Nazis were deporting the Jews in great numbers, and we had a lot of children around that we were trying to save."</span> <span id="s3031">And she said, "It came to my attention that they had masses of people down in the Velôdrome d’Hiver, which is a big skating rink in Paris, and that they were transporting the children to Germany.</span> <span id="s3032">And we knew that they were trying to do another shipment."</span> <span id="s3033">And she said, "I still have a lot of staff coming and going here because I'd moved most of my sewing operations out here, my dress-designing business.</span> <span id="s3034">So, I had people bring their children and bring an extra child, and for months, I had about 60 Jewish children in the attics and in the barns.</span> <span id="s3035">I grew vegetables in the barns under lamp light.</span> <span id="s3036">I kept them until we could get them safely away somewhere else.</span> <span id="s3037">And that's what that has to do with."</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">MS: And she was honored by the...</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">LF: And she was honored...</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">MS: By...</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">LF: By the French government for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">MS: But did she give you any other information other than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">LF: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">MS: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">LF: Not really.</span> <span id="s3046">And when she wanted to tell you something, she told you.</span> <span id="s3047">And if she didn't want to say any more, then she usually shut up.</span> <span id="s3048">And even her daughter didn't know very much about this.</span> <span id="s3049">Her daughter said she remembered kids being there, but she didn't remember what for.</span> <span id="s3050">And her daughter is a little bit younger than me, about five years younger than me, so she may not really have taken much notice of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">MS: That's very interesting.</span> <span id="s3052">I wish that there was more...</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">LF: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">MS: That we knew of the story, but that will...</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">LF: She died shortly after I came back from the trip, so there's very little more that I can find out.</span> <span id="s3056">I doubt very much if her daughter really knows any more to add to it.</span> <span id="s3057">But, I did ask her why she did it.</span> <span id="s3058">And, she gave one of her eloquent shrugs and said, "Who else was going to do it?</span> <span id="s3059">And I hate damn Germans anyway."</span> <span id="s3060">And I said to her, you know, "Weren't you afraid when you told them they couldn't have your house?"</span> <span id="s3061">And she said, "Yes, but they didn't know it!"</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">MS: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">LF: And, I think that was probably her attitude with the children too.</span> <span id="s3064">They're too stupid to count the number that come in and go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">MS: And this was right on the, in, on the outskirts of Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">LF: On the outskirts of Paris, about fifteen miles from the center of Paris, in the village or suburb of Chatou.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">MS: Well, Leigh, thank you very, very much for everything that you've contributed to the Archive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">LF: I hope it isn't in vain.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">MS: Oh, I..</span> <span id="s3070">.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">LF: I hope somebody pays attention, not just to what I've said, but to what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">MS: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">LF: And if any one word, make sure that people carry the message, and that these sorts of things never happen again.</span> <span id="s3074">If we can do one thing by passing the word around about this to eliminate that kind of racial hate, then it will have served its purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s3075">MS: Well, it was very eloquently said, and thank you again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">LF: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A song about women who worked in U.S. munitions factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">LEIGH FRASER [1-1-]</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">LEIGH FRASER [1-1-]</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">PAGE 39</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">LEIGH
