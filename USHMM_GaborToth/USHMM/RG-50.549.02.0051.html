talking about -- I di -- basically from the beginning of the German occ -- occupation in the Netherlands, when you went into hiding, and the [indecipherable] a short description of that time, and then we’ll go into the post-war experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: The -- Well, as you probably know, Holland was invaded in May 1940, when I lived with my father and my mother and my two brothers, who are eight and 10 years younger than I -- than -- than I am, in a little town called Delft, in Holland.</span> <span id="s19">And my father was all his life a musician, and had recently opened a little clothing store, to see if he could get away from the -- th -- wi -- away from the music.</span> <span id="s20">On the 10th of May, two days after my 14th birthday, the Germans suddenly -- I looked out the -- out the window, and there was all German planes and paratroopers in the sky.</span> <span id="s21">And five days later, we were, of course -- the Dutch government ran away, the queen ran away to London, and we were an occupied country.</span> <span id="s22">And it didn’t worry us too much, because the -- the war was going to be over anyway very soon, we all knew that, and the Germans would never do in Holland what they had done in Germany, to the German Jews.</span> <span id="s23">But, pretty soon, of course, we began to find anti-Semitic ordinances in the -- in -- in the -- in the paper, and things progressed rapidly.</span> <span id="s24">Two years later, 1942, after I couldn’t go to school any more, and we were all wearing yellow stars on our clothing, two years later, in October 23rd, 1942, we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s25">We were actually all set to go on the trains to what the Germans euphemistically called work relief, in Germany.</span> <span id="s26">We were all set, we had our backpacks ready, but my grandfather, who happened to come over fo-for a visit from Amsterdam, warned us that -- warned my parents that we -- we might not at all be going to work in Germany, that the Germans were lying, that there were rumors going around, and although no one knew where -- where we were yes going, he said don’t ever go.</span> <span id="s27">It seems to have made a deep impression upon my parents, because at some point, they decided we’re not going to go on those trains, like most of the Jew -- Dutch Jews, and we were going to go into hiding, although we had no places prepared.</span> <span id="s28">So, as I said, on the 23rd of October, 1942, we walked -- in the morning we walked out of our home, and never to return to that same house again.</span> <span id="s29">And that night my family spread around.</span> <span id="s30">My na -- They -- My -- My parents went one way, and my brothers went another way, I didn’t know where they went.</span> <span id="s31">And I was left, for awhile, in that -- with our friends where we had walked to, in the suburbs of Delft.</span> <span id="s32">I stayed there for a little while.</span> <span id="s33">And from there I went to -- first address in Utrecht, two old ladies who took me in, but very soon got scared, and I had to go.</span> <span id="s34">My mother, who is -- really became the -- the hero of this -- of our hiding story -- of our wartime story in general, was the only one who traveled on trains, and she went around finding places for all of us.</span> <span id="s35">She fou -- She decided that -- She suggested that I would bleach my hair and pretend to be a Christian boy, and work as a stable boy, s -- go find work on a sta -- as a stable boy on a Dutch farm.</span> <span id="s36">She then found a little farm somewhere, little farmer who had five cows, dairy farm, and that’s where I went to work.</span> <span id="s37">That was my first farm, and it was absolute hell.</span> <span id="s38">I was this Jewish city kid, and I was supposed to go out at five o’clock in the morning, in the pouring rain, and -- and milk cows, and so, and I did.</span> <span id="s39">I -- I learned all that.</span> <span id="s40">I walked with bleeding feet i-in -- in wooden shoes, and -- very -- well, I don’t know how long I was there.</span> <span id="s41">My guess is -- My guess is maybe -- oh, maybe -- maybe a half a year, I -- I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s42">The chronology is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but anyway, I -- I decided to give myself up to the Germans.</span> <span id="s43">I couldn’t stand the -- the fear of being maybe discovered, and the loneliness.</span> <span id="s44">I was all by myself.</span> <span id="s45">I was 16 years old, and I decided that I couldn’t stay in there, I would give myself up.</span> <span id="s46">I figured, sooner or later, the Germans are going to find me anyway, and -- but my mother again, it’s always my mother in this story, who came to visit me sometimes, secretly, we would meet somewhere in the fields, talked me out of it, and said she would try and find another place for me.</span> <span id="s47">And she found, through a whole long story that I can’t go into now, but she found a police officer called Oskam, was his last name, O-s-k-a-m, who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer, came from a completely Nazi family, and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the underground, and was hiding about 30 Jewish men, women and children, in the little village not too far from Utrecht.</span> <span id="s48">And my mother had asked him if he would know a place for me, and I talked with him, and he said, “I have a place for you, but it’s very dangerous.</span> <span id="s49">You will not be able to leave there, and you will not be able to see any members of your family.</span> <span id="s50">Do you still want to go there?”</span> <span id="s51">And I said, well -- I figured everything was better -- anything was better than being isolated by myself on a farm.</span> <span id="s52">And he -- when I said yes, I would like to go there, he took me to a -- a hut in the middle of the woods, where he left me with seven Dutch Resistance men, mostly -- they were mostly of the -- what shall I say?</span> <span id="s53">The m -- More intellectual class o-of Dutch people.</span> <span id="s54">They didn’t look like what you would think of partisans, or anything, didn’t wear machine guns, or an-anything like that, but they had built this hut.</span> <span id="s55">And I stayed there from -- my guess is August 1943, until -- the exact date is 29th of December, 1943.</span> <span id="s56">I was the only Jew, I was the youngest, I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then, and let’s see, the men would go out at night and raid police stations, and -- and ci-city halls, and -- and break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards, and -- and official German stamps, and -- and weapons.</span> <span id="s57">And so we were sort of a center, people would stop in, a-and take away weapons, and -- and -- and papers, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s58">I should go just -- because it will relate to later on in this story, I should mention that one day two men were brought in, one who claimed to be a Canadian, and one who claimed to be an Englishman, and claimed to have been on a raid in -- in the -- in the Royal Air Force, on a ra -- in on a raid to Germany, and were -- their bomber was shot down, and they bailed out, and they wound up in the -- and the Resistance got them before the Germans got them, and they brought them into our hut.</span> <span id="s59">So here were these two men, and I was assigned to interview them, because I spoke English well.</span> <span id="s60">I don’t quite know why, but I think I have a hint of why.</span> <span id="s61">My parents had lived in the United States for three years, in 1929 to 1932.</span> <span id="s62">So I interviewed these men, and found out that they were not German spies, but they were a bona fide RAF people.</span> <span id="s63">They w -- They -- They spent awhile with us in the hut, but eventually they were smuggled out by the Resistance, through Belgium, through France, and Spain, and I guess Portugal, and -- and smuggled back to England.</span> <span id="s64">I don’t know if they ever flew again, I will find that out in -- in August.</span> <span id="s65">There’s a -- There’s a story connected with that.</span> <span id="s66">On the tr -- In December, towards the end of the -- 1943, we got a message, somehow another, an intercepted message that the Germans had become suspicious of the -- of the area, the woods where we were.</span> <span id="s67">We were -- We were in the -- in the middle of a small parcel of woods.</span> <span id="s68">In Holland, you don’t really have forests.</span> <span id="s69">These were planted parcels of woods, rectangles, one after another, about four or five, and they had the very dense undergrowth of evergreens.</span> <span id="s70">You couldn’t walk through them, you would have to smash your way through -- through the undergrowth, however, we had a secret path to the hut.</span> <span id="s71">As I said, in December, the men in the hut got the message that the Germans had become suspicious, and we were -- they then decided we should set out guards, and so a companion and I drew the lot for the 29th of December, I think four to eight A.M. watch, standing right inside the periphery of the -- in the woods.</span> <span id="s72">Now, on the -- on the -- on the woods, in -- within the first line of trees, and that’s where we saw the Germans coming, in the half dark, and it was, of course, traumatic, because I realized they had come to kill me.</span> <span id="s73">I was very tempted to run away, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s74">The both of us ran back into the hut, warned the men.</span> <span id="s75">There was a total confusion there, cause they were sleeping in the bunkbeds, and we pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, “It’s a raid, get up.”</span> <span id="s76">And when -- when we saw that they were all out of the bunkbeds, we ran, and we ran to the edge of our parcel of wood -- of woods, and as I always say when I -- when -- when -- when I looked to the left and to the right, it seemed to me the Germans were coming around the corners of the woods, and I feared that nobody that we had left behind, would survive.</span> <span id="s77">We then jumped across the dirt road, into the next parcel of woods, and crashed through, and we ran and ran and ran and ran, until we wound up in a city called Hilversum, which you probably have heard about, it’s the center of Dutch radio -- radio transmitter.</span> <span id="s78">And I can’t go into the details now, but somehow another, we wound up at night in the woods again, about five miles away from where the hut was, because that was the spot where we were supposed to reassemble in case of a raid.</span> <span id="s79">It had been previously agreed upon.</span> <span id="s80">And my buddy and I, my -- my partner and I waited there in the dark.</span> <span id="s81">We had guns, we had nine millimeter Mauser, and we had them at the ready, because we didn’t know if the men would have been tortured to reveal the place that the Germans would -- might come and -- and ser -- I had pretty well decided then that -- that if they would come, that I would defend myself, I would -- I would try to kill, and be killed, probably, in a short gunfight.</span> <span id="s82">So, I was all prepared to die.</span> <span id="s83">It was very quiet, and then after awhile I did hear some noise coming through the woods, sounded like old metal rattling away, and thumping over -- wh-wheels on the dirt, and this bicycle rattled in the little clearing, and with a little flashlight somebody was shining ahead of it.</span> <span id="s84">And we didn’t know who it was, we were ready to -- to -- to shoot.</span> <span id="s85">But nothing followed, and then we approached with drawn guns, and found out that it was not the Germans, and it was neither one of the men, it was my mother, who had heard about the raid, and had decided immediately to rescue us.</span> <span id="s86">Well, I think most of that escape, and so on, and my mother’s part in that is probably in the -- in the video interview.</span> <span id="s87">We escaped.</span> <span id="s88">My buddy -- My mother gave the old bicycle to my -- my friend, my -- my partner, and she gave him also the little flashlight, and he peddled away into the darkness, he said he knew a place where to hide.</span> <span id="s89">And my mother and I pretended to be lovers, and as we approached the German guard, we talked very loud, and we giggled, and we -- you know, with -- with terror in our hearts, but we put our arms around each other, and we made kissing sounds, and the -- and the German guard whom we approached seemed to want to stop us for a second, but he didn’t, and we walked by him, and as I always say, to live another day in [indecipherable] of that circle of death.</span> <span id="s90">After that I was close to a nervous breakdown, I needed help.</span> <span id="s91">Two -- Two older people, two Dutch people who lived in a very nice mansion, put me up in a room, very peaceful room overlooking a gorgeous garden, and there I s -- recuperated slowly, I stopped shaking, and I became very religious, I found a Bible, and for the first time read something about the Jewish history, and became devoted to it, and for the rest of the war, tried to be a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s92">When I felt strong enough again, I left that place, and I got myself a new pair of wooden shoes, and I went out and found a new farm, now in a better part of Holland.</span> <span id="s93">And in the more eastern part, where the farms are bigger, and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work this time as a real farmhand.</span> <span id="s94">By then I seemed to have had enough experience to work with horses, and plow, and -- and of course I had bleached my hair again, and matter of fact, I had the chutzpah to go and register myself with my false identity card in -- in the town hall, to allay suspicion.</span> <span id="s95">It worked pretty well, I -- I wasn’t -- I worked on a couple of farms.</span> <span id="s96">The farmers were happy with me.</span> <span id="s97">Of course, every second was always a challenge if anyone approached the farm.</span> <span id="s98">It was like, this is maybe it.</span> <span id="s99">In May, 1944, my mother, coming back on the train from visiting my brother Fred, my youngest brother who was sick, was -- she had managed to put in a hospital in the south of Holland.</span> <span id="s100">On the way back, she ran into a expert on the train, German -- a Gestapo expert on the train, zeesha hites a deest expert, probably, and he immediately recognized that she had a falsified identity card, and he arrested her.</span> <span id="s101">And she -- And he put her into a -- into a separate compartment in the train, where she was guarded by a Dutch policeman on the way to Amsterdam, and that she later tells him -- I’m not quite sure any more at this point, by the way, let me interrupt myself here for a second.</span> <span id="s102">I’m not quite sure how much of this is in the videotape.</span> <span id="s103">I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s104">I’m quoting here things that my mother and my father said in interviews conducted -- audio interviews conducted by my brother Fred.</span> <span id="s105">My brother Fred conducted audio interviews with the whole family, my father, my mother, myself, my brother Ott, my cousins, my wife.</span> <span id="s106">I have a tray with audio interviews, with the voices of my parents and everyone, and he later also transcribed it in book form, together with his son.</span> <span id="s107">Now, all that, I think happened after the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview.</span> <span id="s108">So, I don’t know, you can ask me later on it -- if it’s not clear, I can go back to it.</span> <span id="s109">As my mother said -- now I go back to what my mother as -- she was arrested, as my mother later on told in interview with my brother Fred, she ate all the paperwork that was in her -- in her handbag, so the -- so that there was -- sh -- and she swallowed it.</span> <span id="s110">So by the time that she got to the interrogation in Amsterdam, when they ask her what her real name was, she lied, and she said that her name was Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, which was her maiden name.</span> <span id="s111">She never mentioned her -- her married name.</span> <span id="s112">And since she didn’t have any other papers, except her false identity card, they wrote it down, and as she said, a-as a -- out of the blue sky she added, “And you have no right to keep me here, because I’m an American citizen.”</span> <span id="s113">I don’t know if that’s in the -- in the video interview, either.</span> <span id="s114">In any case, she was sent to -- to Westerbork, Dutch camp, and from there she was sent to Bergen-Belsen, which we didn’t know, of course.</span> <span id="s115">When I somehow heard that my mother had been arrested, I found my father and my two little brothers in a little cottage together, in the -- not too far from Arnhem, in Holland, where -- that little cottage my mother had rented just before she was arrested, in order to be a -- a -- just a week together with her husband and her two little sons.</span> <span id="s116">And of course, for her this didn’t work out, but my father had gone there, and my two little brothers were there, and I found them there, and I decided that rather than work on the farm, my father would need help to survive in hiding with my two little brothers.</span> <span id="s117">So I quit the farm, and bicycled over to this little cottage, and that’s where we spent the last winter of the war.</span> <span id="s118">Together with my two brothers and my father, we begged, borrowed and stole whatever we could to survive, and thus we reached the spring of 1945, when we were liberated by the Canadian army, and where -- I really should say this part of your interview ends, because it was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s119">Many surprising things happened after that.</span> <span id="s120">If you want me to just go on with this now, or do you want to take a break?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Well I -- I am curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered in many different places, and your mom would -- would travel [indecipherable] and I’m sure it’s -- what [indecipherable] look like.</span> <span id="s122">How much do you know what the other members of your family were doing, where they were, did you [indecipherable] see them from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: It’s very interesting question, and -- and as I go out speaking a lot to schools and so on, that question always comes up, people ask, “How did you know where your father was?”</span> <span id="s124">An-And I usually don’t have an answer for this.</span> <span id="s125">I can tell you this, I did not know in the very beginning where my father and mother were, until the raid on the hut, when I spent one night after the raid, after my mother and I escaped out of that -- out of the woods there, I spent one night at their hi -- their hiding place, which was in Soest, in Holland.</span> <span id="s126">So then I knew where they were.</span> <span id="s127">My brothers, I never knew.</span> <span id="s128">But there was a little time, which I don’t remember too clearly, when my brother Ott, my middle brother, s -- came to the farm where I worked, and this was my little brother who came from the city, and who needed to be fattened up a little bit, and -- of course, he was also in hiding, but -- and he spent some time with me on this farm, I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s129">From -- From his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or maybe even a month.</span> <span id="s130">I thought it was only a week.</span> <span id="s131">So, that period, I knew where my brother Ott was, he was with me.</span> <span id="s132">But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944, until the liberation 1945, my father, my two brothers and I were all together.</span> <span id="s133">Some of the communication was achieved through my grandfather’s second wife.</span> <span id="s134">My grandfather lived in Amsterdam, my grandmother had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish woman, and had a daughter by her.</span> <span id="s135">And I think that daughter, who was not Jewish, at least she was half Jewish, did not wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to send some messages around, and I think it must have been through her that I found where my father and my two little brothers were hiding in that little summer cottage.</span> <span id="s136">That’s as best as I can tell you.</span> <span id="s137">Course we had no phones, we didn’t write letters, was -- we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s138">And -- So sometimes it -- I just -- it’s all conjecture, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: How much were you aware of what was going on in the country, or with the war, or -- or in terms of what and where, with interest to Jews?</span> <span id="s140">How would -- How would you get your information?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: The minute that we went underground, of course, we were isolated from the rest of the population of the world, you could say.</span> <span id="s142">But here and there, you would pick up an illegal piece of newspaper.</span> <span id="s143">You know, there were -- there were illegal newspapers that consisted usually out of two or four pages, badly printed, and sometimes you would find -- find one of those, or somebody would ha-hand you one of those.</span> <span id="s144">During my time in the Resistance hut, of course I found out more, because the men listened to the BBC, and we had a map there, and we charted the progress of the Russians and whatever else was happening.</span> <span id="s145">And we knew about the -- the bombardments in Germany and so on.</span> <span id="s146">So, at that time, I was pretty well aware of where the -- where the Germans stood, and where the Russians were, and where the English were, and the Americans, and so on, and so forth.</span> <span id="s147">But after the raid, when I went back to the farm, I was totally isolated.</span> <span id="s148">The farmers had -- they would talk about the war, but they -- they didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s149">What we could see were, of course, a thousand B17 bombers flying over almost every day, and by night we heard the English, a thousand planes going overnight.</span> <span id="s150">We knew there was enormous bombardments.</span> <span id="s151">And I had several interesting -- interesting happenings at one time.</span> <span id="s152">A liberator bomber came down right around the corner from the farm where I worked, and that was the time my brother Ott was there, it seems, because he, in detail, describes how that plane came down, and how we ran there, and -- and how we found a little piece of -- of Plexiglas, little piece of -- from one of the -- one of the windows of the bomber, or the -- we -- we savored it like a piece of -- this was a piece of freedom.</span> <span id="s153">That was one.</span> <span id="s154">On another farm -- this must have been already in the summer of ’44, a Messerschmidt 109 was shot down, and crashed right into the ground, right near by the farm where I worked, there’s -- there was another farm.</span> <span id="s155">And I don’t where I had the chutzpah, that I -- I was devoted to flying and -- and planes before the war, already.</span> <span id="s156">I loved planes, and build model planes.</span> <span id="s157">Anything that would -- flew was to me, was fascinating.</span> <span id="s158">And here was a Messerschmidt 109 lying pretty much undamaged except for it’s gear and so on.</span> <span id="s159">I-It’s propeller bent, and -- and there was a German on guard there, just a soldier guarding the -- the plane there.</span> <span id="s160">And I approached on bike, and I asked him if I could take a look, and he said, yeah, that’s all right, and I actually walked around the God damn plane, and touched it, and [indecipherable] all fascinating.</span> <span id="s161">How did I get onto that?</span> <span id="s162">Oh, you asked me about what I knew about the war.</span> <span id="s163">During our ha -- last hiding, with my two brothers and my father, in the little summer cottage, we found out nearby, about a five minute walk through the fields, there was a big mansion type house, and in that house lived a whole collection of people, young and old.</span> <span id="s164">Later on, we found that several of them were in hiding themselves.</span> <span id="s165">But, they listened every day to the BBC radio.</span> <span id="s166">So, some might say the fall of 1944, until the liberation, we knew pretty well what was going on because of the evening -- in the evening we would go there, and we wouldn’t listen ourselves, but somebody would go up and listen in the attic, where they had a radio hidden, and they would tell us, “The Russians are right near Berlin,” you know, “and the -- the invasion is going well.”</span> <span id="s167">By this time, of course, the sixth of June, 1944, the allied invasion of France, we knew it was happening.</span> <span id="s168">And then, of course, we had gone to Arnhem, which was not too far away, the disastrous attempt from the English to -- with paratroopers to capture the bridges, and being wiped out, and we thought we would be free then.</span> <span id="s169">So anyway, that much we knew.</span> <span id="s170">Arnhem, we didn’t know the disaster, although it was only a half an hour away from us, we heard all -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ed Lessing.</span> <span id="s172">This is tape one, side B.</span> <span id="s173">We were just discussing again, your ex-experiences during the war, and you were mentioning the -- the various places that you were in hiding, and one question I wanted to ask is, how many of the places where you hid, how many knew that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: The very first place, two old ladies, knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s175">The next one on the farm, the first farm, dairy farm, they did not know.</span> <span id="s176">In the Resistance hut, of course they knew I was a Jew, and weren’t too happy about it, by the way.</span> <span id="s177">After the Resistance hut, when I started going back to farming, on several farms, I registered as a -- as a -- as an Christian.</span> <span id="s178">And then we come to -- there are little pieces in between that I don’t even want to go -- where I was a week , or I was a week and a half, or two weeks.</span> <span id="s179">I was with my aunt in The Hague for -- for two weeks or something, and of course she knew was -- I was Jewish, but -- and then we come to the fall of 1944, when I joined my father and my two brothers, and there’s no question, of course, there.</span> <span id="s180">So, the only places where people didn’t know that I -- that I was Jewish, was on the farms where I worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And again, you mentioned how your mother sort of set everything -- everything up, did a lot of the arrangements.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Especially in the beginning.</span> <span id="s183">Not for me later on, I found -- after the raid on the hut, I found my own farms.</span> <span id="s184">I was -- I would say I worked there, and w -- I’m not quite sure why I left to go from one farm to another.</span> <span id="s185">I probably thought that it was safer to not stay too long in one place.</span> <span id="s186">It’s very hard to explain the intensity of -- of the deceit you had to practice.</span> <span id="s187">Your -- Your whole mind was set on deceit.</span> <span id="s188">What -- What hint could a farmer, let’s say, get from me that I was not who I said I was, you know.</span> <span id="s189">Wa -- My -- My mind was constantly at work, so that I probably decided that it was not a good idea to stay too long in one place, because eventually something escapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: What sort of things do you remember, were you worried that would give you away?</span> <span id="s191">Something you would say, or the way you act?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: I’m not quite sure at this point.</span> <span id="s193">See, this was a 24 hour a day, seven days a week comedy you played.</span> <span id="s194">This is like being on stage, practically 24 hours a day, every day, even when y -- when you went to sleep, you had to watch out that somebody wouldn’t hear you dreaming, or something, and say something.</span> <span id="s195">I had a false name.</span> <span id="s196">I might, by mistake, whisper my own name in my sleep or something, or s -- tell about my mother.</span> <span id="s197">I didn’t have a mother, you know, and the mother and father had died years ago in bombardments, both of them.</span> <span id="s198">I mean, the stories that you made up, to -- in order t -- tho -- it was a whole -- i -- this was a whole false lifetime of history.</span> <span id="s199">Where did you come from, did you have family?</span> <span id="s200">Where did you live?</span> <span id="s201">How come you’re working on a farm?</span> <span id="s202">You’re from the city.</span> <span id="s203">How come you work so well?</span> <span id="s204">You know.</span> <span id="s205">Why -- We’ve had city boys here, they -- they never worked that well, they didn’t know how to go plow a field with a horse.</span> <span id="s206">How come you know?</span> <span id="s207">You know, this kind of stuff, and what is he thinking?</span> <span id="s208">Is he talking with his neighbors about this guy we have from the city, who works so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: And was that a time where farmers may have been suspicious, that -- since that sort of thing was happening, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s211">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s212">You see, in Holland, a Jew would stand out like a -- how do I say that?</span> <span id="s213">A mouse on a billiard table.</span> <span id="s214">I could instantly recognize if I saw another Jew someplace in Holland.</span> <span id="s215">And I’ve seen some on the -- on the railroad station, once, when I was waiting for my mother to show up, and -- and I saw a man, and I immediately recognized this guy is -- is a hidden Jew, you know.</span> <span id="s216">So, I thought, why don’t the other recognize me, maybe, you know?</span> <span id="s217">The -- The skill and deception was like -- it was like a spy story, spy who could construct a whole false -- false background, you know?</span> <span id="s218">It was like -- And you had to make sure that you didn’t slip up anywhere, not a street address, not where you were 10 years ago, not where your father and mother had died.</span> <span id="s219">You know, you know, this kind -- not show any dislike of big chunks of -- of bacon, or ham being put on your -- you know, not the nice bacon that we get, with slices like a half inch thick, you know, it’s with all the fat on it, and farmers gleefully ate.</span> <span id="s220">And I ate them, and I said in my head, I said -- asked God for forgiveness that I had to do this.</span> <span id="s221">But all that was a -- it’s like being onstage, and it’s very, very tiresome, you know?</span> <span id="s222">So anyway, it’s hard to -- very hard to explain what -- what it took to stay out of the clutches of the Germans.</span> <span id="s223">And I -- There was a second time when I almost -- almost got caught.</span> <span id="s224">The first time was, of course, the raid on the hut, second one was later on when my -- when we all lived in that little cottage, and I -- we went every day to get some food in the village.</span> <span id="s225">There was a central kitchen then, food being scarce, and all that.</span> <span id="s226">And all of a sudden I ran into a German on this dirt road leading to the village.</span> <span id="s227">I was on this crummy bicycle that we had, and -- and this German stopped me, and wanted to see my identity card.</span> <span id="s228">I was lucky, he was -- I th -- I have no idea w-what he was.</span> <span id="s229">You see, this is another part, to immediately gauge, if you saw a German, what kind of a German is this?</span> <span id="s230">Is this just a -- a -- Wehrmacht soldier?</span> <span id="s231">He doesn’t know shit from shinola, you know, he doesn’t know about Jews, or identity cards.</span> <span id="s232">But, I once ran into an SS man, and that’s a separate story.</span> <span id="s233">But -- But this guy questioned me, and I couldn’t figure out -- he was not SS, he didn’t have the SS on his -- on his collar, and yet, he seemed to intensely question me, you know?</span> <span id="s234">And I just said that I lived -- that I was a farmer’s [indecipherable] farmer here down the road.</span> <span id="s235">I was on -- on a -- and could see him swaying back and forth.</span> <span id="s236">But what the hell he would have done, I have no idea, because this was -- we’re talking now, probably late fall 1944, when -- when everything was already in disarray for the Germans.</span> <span id="s237">Any case, that was a moment when everything sort of tightened up, and you stood there, and you said, is it going to go right, or is it going to go wrong?</span> <span id="s238">Is this the last -- is this it?</span> <span id="s239">You know?</span> <span id="s240">And it wasn’t, but it was almost.</span> <span id="s241">Okay, I don’t know if I answered your question, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Well, another question I had, from the video interviews, is that -- I -- I’m interested in -- in your father, it seems like, to a certain extent, he tried to maintain a normal life, during -- throughout the hiding is -- you mentioned that he had painting lessons once a week, for example.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: He -- He sounds like -- like an interesting character.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: My father was an interesting man, he -- he was a kind of an ineffective man, i -- that -- and my mother always held him up as the artist in the family, and she was the one who took care of everything.</span> <span id="s246">Even -- I mean, after the war, before the war, she was the driving factor, sort of, in -- in -- you know, getting everything done.</span> <span id="s247">But here they were, these two people, in a room, for two and a half years.</span> <span id="s248">You ever sat in a room for two and a half years without going out?</span> <span id="s249">It’s not easy.</span> <span id="s250">And he began to do sketches, put little still lifes on the table, or -- and then he started painting with watercolors a little bit, and pastels, and my mother got him art materials, and it was a God given thing, you know, cause he would have gone crazy there.</span> <span id="s251">And then, through somehow another, they found this painter -- I have a painting of him [indecipherable] upstairs.</span> <span id="s252">I have several painting of my father, and also of his teacher.</span> <span id="s253">Found this teacher where he went once a week.</span> <span id="s254">I didn’t want to go into the details about it, but I told you about the raid on the hut, and that my mother came to rescue us in the woods.</span> <span id="s255">The reason why she knew was, when my buddy and I ran off from the raid, we wound up in the city of Hilversum, I remember that my father took painting lessons from a man named Shlutter, a painter, well-known painter in -- in -- in Holland.</span> <span id="s256">And that this man lived in a village near Hilversum, where we were, and I decided that -- we didn’t know where the hell to go, that I would to this Shlutter, because obviously he was all right, he was somebody we could trust, because he gave my father painting lessons.</span> <span id="s257">It so happened when we -- we took a little train there, a little -- a little sht -- a little -- little -- a -- a s-- a tram, and it so happened when we got there, my father was there, painting, you know, very quiet in the studio of this man.</span> <span id="s258">And my father said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s259">And my father never was very perceptive in things, and I told him, “Pop, we were raided,” you know?</span> <span id="s260">“And I think all the men probably are -- are going to be dead.”</span> <span id="s261">And he said, “Gee, gee, hm.”</span> <span id="s262">But he didn’t interrupt his lesson or anything.</span> <span id="s263">And he said, “So where you going to be today?”</span> <span id="s264">I said, “Well, we don’t know, we’re,” -- and I don’t know where we were all day, until we wound up in the woods that night.</span> <span id="s265">But one thing is for sure, my father eventually went back to his hiding place, and told my mother, and my mother immediately grasped the seriousness of the situation.</span> <span id="s266">My father didn’t.</span> <span id="s267">And she -- how she found out, I don’t know, I think probably to Mr. Oskam, the policeman, where the hell we would meet that night.</span> <span id="s268">So my father painted, and my mother -- and my mother took care of the -- tried to save the rest of her family, and did, and saved herself, too, of which I will tell you.</span> <span id="s269">But his -- his glor-glory period came when we were all hiding in that little cottage, from the fall of 1944, until the liberation, 1945.</span> <span id="s270">He became a real strong father, you could almost say a brother to me.</span> <span id="s271">He and I took care of the boys, and ourselves.</span> <span id="s272">But he and I decided what -- how to find food, where to steal trees, you know.</span> <span id="s273">Where to beg for sandwiches from the farmers, or something, anything.</span> <span id="s274">It was like a team.</span> <span id="s275">When my father died, probably about 10 years ago, or so, I really felt like one of our team had died, you know?</span> <span id="s276">He shouldn’t have died, we should have all died together, my two brothers, my father, and I, we were a team, a wonderful team of -- that managed to survive.</span> <span id="s277">And my father died, of course he died, but it was like losing a member of a string quartet, you know, and say God, you know, irreplaceable.</span> <span id="s278">Anyway, so I have many funny stories about my father.</span> <span id="s279">My father mostly is known in the family for his funny stories, because he did so many things out of -- I don’t know, re -- because he didn’t -- he wasn’t aware.</span> <span id="s280">My wife always says, “Your father never was aware.”</span> <span id="s281">My father wasn’t aware of what the hell was going on.</span> <span id="s282">He wasn’t even aware that I was in -- wa -- you know, wa -- my life was threatened when I was there, you know, with my buddy.</span> <span id="s283">So, I hope that answers that question, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: I wonder from a certain sense that -- that led him -- that let him get through the experiences in a way different from other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I didn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s286">What did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: That him being aware -- sh -- maybe shutting things out, allowed him to sort of maintain some of his former life all through that -- the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: That’s probably -- probably so, yeah.</span> <span id="s289">He’s an interesting man, I was never very close to him, except for that period then.</span> <span id="s290">I could tell you for hours about him, but I don’t think this is the place to do it.</span> <span id="s291">He -- He tried all his life to not be a musician, and yet, he only was a musician, he always went back to it.</span> <span id="s292">And after the war, when we moved to -- or when they moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, my father really had -- I said, well, his only glory period was during the war, that isn’t quite true.</span> <span id="s293">After they moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, and my father began to play in the Springfield Symphony, and he played in the Hartford Symphony, he was a cellist, and he set up a string quartet with friends, and they gave concerts in -- in Pittsfield, in the Fine Arts Museum, those were glorious times for him, because he loved music.</span> <span id="s294">So -- But during the war, and of course, I don’t know all of it, because they were in hiding, my father and mother together, and somehow another -- I think my father probably had an easier time of it than my mother, because he could lose himself for hours in sketching a glass of water, and -- and a little jar, you know?</span> <span id="s295">I have many of his sketchbooks still upstairs.</span> <span id="s296">So, where do we go from here?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Well, let’s go -- let’s continue after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Let’s talk about the war ended, and -- and what happened with you and the family from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: All right.</span> <span id="s301">I may duplicate some of it that was in the -- oh no, I ge -- I don’t know where the original video -- video interview ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: It ends pretty much at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: When we were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Nothing after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s308">All right, the first thing I have to tell you about is -- its’ a little bit difficult, the structure is a little bit different.</span> <span id="s309">I must first tell you about what happened to my mother, because it -- then I can go back to -- to us.</span> <span id="s310">My mother, as I said, was sent to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s311">And interestingly enough, she had a -- she had a dream -- my mother was always a little psychic, by the way, very interesting.</span> <span id="s312">There were times that she would say to my father, “I think your father is maybe coming for a visit from Amsterdam today.”</span> <span id="s313">And I don’t know, three out of five times, there was my grandfather in the afternoon, you know, ringing the doorbell.</span> <span id="s314">So we always thought she was, what we call in Dutch, helderzingda, clear -- clear voyant -- clairvoyant.</span> <span id="s315">She had a dream.</span> <span id="s316">I think -- I think it was in Westerbork, in the Dutch camp.</span> <span id="s317">She had a dream in which she saw a newspaper, a masthead of a newspaper, and that said, January 21, very big, and she woke up from it.</span> <span id="s318">And she thought, “I wonder what that means, if it means something.”</span> <span id="s319">And she thought, “Either I will be dead by then, or I will be free.”</span> <span id="s320">But then, how could she be free?</span> <span id="s321">I mean, she was in a concentration camp in Holland, and soon after that, she was sent to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s322">And one day in January, a friend of hers, who she slept with in the same bunkbed, you know, the wooden bunkbeds they had there, said, “You know, Lene,” she was always called Lene, from -- from Angeline, “Lene,” she said, “there is an SS guy sitting in -- in the barracks, and he’s checking on people who have foreign nationality.”</span> <span id="s323">And my mother said, “Well, I don’t have foreign nationality.”</span> <span id="s324">And her friend said, “But yeah, you said when you were interrogated in Amsterdam, you told him you don’t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen?”</span> <span id="s325">“Yes,” said my mother, “so what?</span> <span id="s326">You know, I don’t have any papers.</span> <span id="s327">I’m not really an American.”</span> <span id="s328">Okay, I got to go back, I got to b-backtrack, got to backtrack for a second to the interrogation in May 1944, when she was caught in Amsterdam, in front of the Gestapo there.</span> <span id="s329">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s330">They asked her what’s your name, and I told you she gave her maiden name, Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, and as an afterthought they said -- she said, “And you don’t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen.”</span> <span id="s331">And they asked her, “If you’re an American citizen, where did you live in the United States?</span> <span id="s332">Give us an address.”</span> <span id="s333">And she rattled off 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston.</span> <span id="s334">And it’s a wonderful thing, because it was one of the addresses where we had lived in 1929, when my parents for three years, emigrated from Holland to the United States.</span> <span id="s335">It was a lousy year to come to the States, 1929, my father got sick, he got tuberculosis, and so on, everything went wrong.</span> <span id="s336">In 1932 they returned again to Holland.</span> <span id="s337">But they did live at 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston, and my mother remembered it, and rattled it off in front of the Gestapo, and they wrote it down.</span> <span id="s338">They must have laughed, but they wrote it down.</span> <span id="s339">So, now we go back to Bergen-Belsen, and it’s January 1945, and things are really getting bad in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s340">I -- Sorry, I have to s-suddenly think of S-Spiegelman’s, “Maus Two,” which bears the title -- when his father arrives in Bergen-Belsen, either from Auschwitz, or wherever he came from, some horror, comes to Bergen-Belsen, and says, “And here’s where my troubles really began.”</span> <span id="s341">It’s -- It’s tragic, but it’s funny.</span> <span id="s342">Anyway, my mother came to Bergen-Belsen, and here’s where our troubles really began.</span> <span id="s343">Sh -- Her friend said, “Go to this S -- SS guy.”</span> <span id="s344">My mother said, “Why, ba, ba.”</span> <span id="s345">Says, “Go, go, go anyway.</span> <span id="s346">So what do you have to lose?”</span> <span id="s347">So she went to this barracks, there was an SS guy sitting, and he was just closing the books, and sh -- he said, “What do you want?”</span> <span id="s348">And she said, “Well, I hear you’re checking on people with foreign papers?”</span> <span id="s349">And he said, “Yes,” he said, “but I just finished.”</span> <span id="s350">And she begged him to open the book again, and he opened the list again, and he said, “What’s your name?”</span> <span id="s351">And she said, “Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer.”</span> <span id="s352">And he went down the list and he said, “Oh yeah,” he said, “you get yourself ready, and two days from n-now, you will be -- you will be exchanged for a German.”</span> <span id="s353">And she didn’t believe a word for it -- of it, you know?</span> <span id="s354">But two days later, there was a train standing.</span> <span id="s355">There was not a railroad spur into Bergen-Belsen camp, as you may ha -- may know, but there was -- people had to walk for two miles outside of the camp to -- to Bergen-Belsen, or Belsen-Bergen station, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s356">And there was a train standing there with a big red cross on it, and she went in there with 301 other Bergen-Belsen inmates, and as she came in -- she tells this all later on, I’m re -- I’m retelling now what she told to my brother Fred in interviews later on.</span> <span id="s357">She said there was an SS sitting there at a little table, and she said, “Could I have a little water?</span> <span id="s358">I’m very thirsty.”</span> <span id="s359">She had been walking.</span> <span id="s360">And he said, “Sit down, you’re going to get coffee soon.”</span> <span id="s361">And of course, she didn’t believe a word of that, either, but a little later, a nurse came in with a tray with real coffee, whi -- nobody had seen in years.</span> <span id="s362">And then she began to believe that maybe it wasn’t a ruse, you know?</span> <span id="s363">What they used to do to Germans wa -- load 1,000 people in the train, promising them to go to -- you know, be freed, and they, you know, two days later, they’d be all gassed in Auschwitz, or Sobibór.</span> <span id="s364">So that train really started out and went through -- was very secure, there’s a route -- route through Germany, and my mother later on says very gleefully, they all saw the bombed out cities of Germany.</span> <span id="s365">We’re talking now January 1945, of course.</span> <span id="s366">We’re approaching the end of the war.</span> <span id="s367">And that train would up in, I forget, Saint Dollan, I think she mentioned.</span> <span id="s368">It’s in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s369">And they came in on one side of the -- of the platform, and -- an-and another train came on the other side, and they were exchanged for Germans.</span> <span id="s370">And I got to tell you the rest of this, because otherwise what I tell you later makes no sense.</span> <span id="s371">The first night, they spent, sh -- this is a footnote to the Swiss treatment of dying -- 300 s -- terribly sick and dying Bergen-Belsen inmates.</span> <span id="s372">They put them in an abandoned school building on straw, and for the few -- first meal, my mother said, “They gave us white bread, and cans of sardines.”</span> <span id="s373">And she said -- she couldn’t help herself, she said she opened the can of sardines and poured the oil in the sardines over the white bread, and just ate and ate and ate.</span> <span id="s374">And she said, “I never was as sick in the camp as I was that night.”</span> <span id="s375">And finally she found some relief in the morning by throwing up.</span> <span id="s376">It was a terrible night, she said.</span> <span id="s377">She’d never been so sick in all those -- in all her -- all her time in -- in the -- in the camps, or in hiding.</span> <span id="s378">And it got to be morning, and the others were still asleep, I think, and a little boy came by, and she had been in camp, and hadn’t -- did not know what was happening in the world.</span> <span id="s379">And she asked the boy if it was possible to get a newspaper somewhere, and he said he could, and he ran off, and he came back with a newspaper, a Swiss newspaper, and she opened it.</span> <span id="s380">It said January 21st, and she was free.</span> <span id="s381">Now magical things, you know?</span> <span id="s382">That’s amazing.</span> <span id="s383">My mother was a pretty amazing person.</span> <span id="s384">Anyway, the train went on, or another train, and they wound up in Marseilles, and there she was given a choice.</span> <span id="s385">She could go either to her sister in Massachusetts, or she could go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s386">And she decided she -- and the third choice was she could go to United Nations rehabilitation camp someplace.</span> <span id="s387">And she decided she’d go to her sister in Massachusetts, and for there there was a -- a ship lying there, the Gripsholm, Scandinavian ship.</span> <span id="s388">And that was transporting wounded American soldiers.</span> <span id="s389">And she was already on board of the ship, and then suddenly she changed her mind, and she ran off, and one of the officers there said, “You can’t do this, you already,” -- but sh -- he could never impress my mother, and she ran off the -- off the ship, and said she changed her mind, she wanted to go to rehabilitation camp, United Nations camp.</span> <span id="s390">And so they put her on another boat, and I think they traveled for a whole week over the Mediterranean, I don’t know why it took so damn long, but she finally wound up in a United Nations rehabilitation camp called Jeandark, which was located in Philipville, in Algiers, North Africa.</span> <span id="s391">That’s where she stayed until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s392">Now, okay, we’ll leave her there, sitting there, safe.</span> <span id="s393">Go back to Forthausen, where we were in hiding in the little cottage, and we are a couple of weeks liberated, and I could tell you many stories, I don’t know how long you want to do this interview.</span> <span id="s394">I could tell you a funny -- I think I really should tell you this story, cause it is so funny.</span> <span id="s395">The Canadians came, and we spent three days in a dugout shelter, until -- under a fierce artillery bombardment, and then we came out, and we were free, and the Canadians settled all around us in camps, and there were tanks there, and God knows, and it was -- it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s396">But we didn’t have anything much more to eat, so my father went -- and we had been making something that was called coffee, but it was made out of ground up shells of -- of -- what do you call that fruit that comes from a oak tree?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: An acorn?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Acorns, ground up acorn shells.</span> <span id="s399">It was horrible stuff.</span> <span id="s400">My father went and persuaded the Canadian cook in one of the camps that this was the best stuff, and he exchanged it for three cans of corned beef, or something, which we hadn’t seen in years.</span> <span id="s401">And so -- And we went into the woods, and we found in -- we found in -- a German mortar, and with the ammunition, and we went and sold that to the Canadians for -- for sugar and tea, and -- anyway, but -- oh no, not for sugar, for tea, an-an-and -- and bread, and -- but we didn’t have any sugar.</span> <span id="s402">So my father peddled on this old little bike into town, and he saw there was a detachment of military police, huge guys, as he explained to them, broad shoulders, and they had these enormous gloves, and they had Harley-Davidson motorcycles with MP on it.</span> <span id="s403">These were tough bastards, you know?</span> <span id="s404">And my father went up to -- to one of them, [indecipherable] already, went up to one of them, and said, “Sir, would you have some sugar for us?</span> <span id="s405">We -- We’ve been -- hadn’t had any sugar.”</span> <span id="s406">Guy was a redhead, with a red moustache, as my father ex -- described him.</span> <span id="s407">The guy said, “What’s the matter with you, begging around here?</span> <span id="s408">Say, you a Jew?”</span> <span id="s409">My father -- this is after two and a half years of not being a Jew, he said, “No, no, no, no, I’m not a Jew.</span> <span id="s410">I,” -- you know -- he says, “No, I just need -- wanted some sugar.”</span> <span id="s411">He said, “Get the hell out of here.”</span> <span id="s412">And my father went -- left him.</span> <span id="s413">The next day he happened to be in town again, and they were breaking up.</span> <span id="s414">The whole first division Canadian army was pulling through the village.</span> <span id="s415">Endless, you know, miles and miles of -- of kitchens, and tanks, and carriers, and -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: This is a interview with Ed Lessing, tape two, side A, and we were just continuing on your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: All right, this little story when my father came back into the village, and saw the military police unit breaking up, and he went up again, to the redhead guy, who was just about getting on his huge Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and revving up the engine, and my father said -- and the guy said, “Are you here again?”</span> <span id="s418">“Yeah,” said my father.</span> <span id="s419">“I wondered if you left behind any sugar.”</span> <span id="s420">The guy said, “I asked you yesterday, are you a Jew?”</span> <span id="s421">And my father said, “No, no, I told you I’m not a Jew.”</span> <span id="s422">“Well,” he said, “you see, I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s423">I would have given you sugar if you were a Jew, but I don’t give to any goyim.”</span> <span id="s424">And he roared off on his motorcycle.</span> <span id="s425">Ah, this is a lovely, lovely story.</span> <span id="s426">You -- You got to realize that my family is a story telling family, both my brothers, and my father, and I, we all tell stories, and we remember them.</span> <span id="s427">So, our whole family is suffused with stories, and this is -- this is a -- a cutie from -- from the war.</span> <span id="s428">Anyway -- from right after the war.</span> <span id="s429">Okay, get -- let’s get serious again.</span> <span id="s430">A couple of weeks after our liberation, my father tells me, he said, “You know, they told me in Barnfeld,” -- a little town nearby, “there are some men -- some men who have lists, and they take care of -- of -- of -- of -- of our Jewish people.”</span> <span id="s431">That was all he knew, you know.</span> <span id="s432">So he said, “I’m going to go there, find out about mutter,” the Dutch word for mother, we always called her mutter.</span> <span id="s433">I said, “Yeah, sure.”</span> <span id="s434">And he rattled off on this old bike, and th -- and -- and by that time, I al-always keep on talking about rattling bikes.</span> <span id="s435">You see, we didn’t have any air tires any more.</span> <span id="s436">Tires were made then either out of wooden strips, very cleverly, wound around with steel wire around the rim, or if you were a little bit better, old car tires were stripped, the rubber -- solid rubber was then wound around, and so -- but you can imagine, within about a month, everything rattled loose on your bike, so they always rattled.</span> <span id="s437">Anyway, my father set off, and he went to Barnfeld, and as he -- and now I’ll have to quote him, because he tells this later, also in the interview, he -- he -- he reaches Barnfeld, and he goes there into a building, and behind a rickety table, he find three older -- older men, yeah, three older, Jewish men, and the -- and they said, “Can we help you?”</span> <span id="s438">And as -- he said, “Yes,” he said, and -- and I’m trying to express this as naïve as we were still.</span> <span id="s439">My father says, “Yes, my -- my wife was -- was arrested, and she was in -- in -- in Westerbork, in a camp, and then she was sent somewhere to Germany, I would like to find out where she is.”</span> <span id="s440">So they said, “Well, you’re in luck, because we don’t know anything right now,” he said, “but s -- one of a -- one of our men is in Germany, and he is coming back with all the lists, and where everybody is.”</span> <span id="s441">And we’re talking about 110,000 Dutch Jews, shipped out.</span> <span id="s442">And my father said, “Oh, thank you.</span> <span id="s443">I’ll be back in a week.”</span> <span id="s444">And a week later -- And he tells this to me when he comes back to our little hut, we’re still living in that little cottage, not a hut, a cottage.</span> <span id="s445">And a week later, he goes again.</span> <span id="s446">And as he tells it later, he said, “There I saw the three men again,” he said, “but they weren’t the same.”</span> <span id="s447">He said physically they were the same, but mentally they were completely beaten down.</span> <span id="s448">They said, “Mr. Lessing, we have just found out about concentration camps, and there were gas chambers there.</span> <span id="s449">And there’s a very -- hardly anybody is alive still.”</span> <span id="s450">In my speeches I always say this is the moment that they found out what we now call the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s451">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s452">We didn’t know what happened to those trains that left every Tuesday out of Westerbork to that work relief in Germany.</span> <span id="s453">My father found out then, right there and then.</span> <span id="s454">And they found it out, too.</span> <span id="s455">So, it was a terrible thing, and -- and -- and they said that we have lists, but there’s hardly anybody on them.</span> <span id="s456">He said, “They all murdered?</span> <span id="s457">Murdered?”</span> <span id="s458">He couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s459">“Well,” my father said, “but, could you just look, maybe my wife is on there?”</span> <span id="s460">And he said, “Well, we give you very little chance, Mr. Lessing,” he didn’t want to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s461">And he went down the list, Red Cross list, and he said, “But she’s here, your wife is here.</span> <span id="s462">Angeline Elizabeth Lessing Van Leer.”</span> <span id="s463">“God,” my father said.</span> <span id="s464">“How wonderful,” he said, “where is she?”</span> <span id="s465">And this little old man said, “She’s in Philipville.”</span> <span id="s466">My father said, “Where’s Philipville?”</span> <span id="s467">They said, “Philipville is -- i-i-it says here, Algiers, in North Africa.”</span> <span id="s468">And -- And another funny story.</span> <span id="s469">My father said, “No, that’s impossible, cause we never had anything to do with Africa.</span> <span id="s470">We never were in Africa.”</span> <span id="s471">He said, “Tha -- those -- that’s ca-can’t be,” you know?</span> <span id="s472">And as he said that, the little old man got kind of insulted, and he said, “Mr. Lessing, the Red Cross never makes a mistake.</span> <span id="s473">She must be there.</span> <span id="s474">Now, you better go home and tell your children.”</span> <span id="s475">And so my father went back, and he came back, and he told us, “Your mother is alive.”</span> <span id="s476">It was exactly a year, practically to the day that she was arrested.</span> <span id="s477">It was May, 1945.</span> <span id="s478">Well, that was one surprising thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: When were you reunited with -- with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I’m not quite sure, but I think it must have been in August.</span> <span id="s481">We -- A couple of weeks later, we went on a -- on a Canadian army truck, and voyaged back to our hometown, Delft.</span> <span id="s482">And I must say, we were helped enormously by the members of the Resistance, the people who have been in the Resistance, who were still in charge then, before the other creeps from -- who had never done anything, came back from London, and started to take over, and they [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s483">But it was still in disarray, you know, and the Resistance people were in charge, and my father and his three sons came there, back to Delft, and they said, “Ah, Mr. Lessing.”</span> <span id="s484">They knew him, and they said, “What do you need?”</span> <span id="s485">And my father said, “Oh, we need a place to live.”</span> <span id="s486">“Well, we’ll give you a house, you know.</span> <span id="s487">We got houses from Nazis, Dutch Nazis.</span> <span id="s488">We’ve thrown them -- We’ve thrown them out, you know.</span> <span id="s489">They’re in jail now,” and so we got a -- we got a house, three floors, I mean, they’re all been a -- you know, not detached houses, they’re row houses, with three floors.</span> <span id="s490">And they said, “What else do you need?”</span> <span id="s491">And he said -- “Well,” my father said, “I need some furniture.”</span> <span id="s492">And, “Okay, we give you furniture.”</span> <span id="s493">And they gave us a -- a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s494">They had a whole warehouse full of stuff confiscated from Dutch Nazis, and we got that, and we got spoons, and forks, and knives, and even some curtain materials, you know.</span> <span id="s495">And -- And they said, “What else do you need?”</span> <span id="s496">My father said, “Well, I -- you know, I’m a music teacher, I -- I had a piano.”</span> <span id="s497">“Oh, we’ll give you a piano.”</span> <span id="s498">They gave him a piano.</span> <span id="s499">So, my father and I fixed up this new abode as well as we could.</span> <span id="s500">We put the furniture, which was all disjointed pieces, you know, I mean, non-matching pieces, and where we thought it would do the best good, and -- and we hung up curtains on strings, and -- and that’s how we started out.</span> <span id="s501">And my brothers went back to school.</span> <span id="s502">God, I wished I could read to you the piece that my brother wrote about going back to school.</span> <span id="s503">He was -- See, born in 1936, must have been about nine years old when he went back to school.</span> <span id="s504">He wrote recently in a speech to the Michigan State Assembly, he -- he wrote a little piece about going back to school.</span> <span id="s505">He said that we were -- as if nothing had happened, open your book to page number 25, and he said, after two and a half years of being shit, you know, after being in hiding, after -- after denying our -- our -- our -- our -- our -- our names, and our religion, and -- it was like -- I mean, the way he says it, a beautiful speech.</span> <span id="s506">Anyway, the boys went back to school, and right around the corner there was a -- there were buildings of the university, and they became a -- a -- a pr -- a prisoner of war camp for -- for Germans.</span> <span id="s507">And the engl -- There were English soldiers guarding them, and every day we would see them march through town, you know, they went to -- God knows what they did.</span> <span id="s508">Oh, they -- they -- I don’t know what they did, and -- and then one day, something magic hap -- magical happened.</span> <span id="s509">My brothers, who would go and hang around there, to see those German prisoners there in the camp, and they’re looking through the gates, and one day they came, and there were no longer English soldiers there, they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve.</span> <span id="s510">And it said, Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s511">They came home, and they said, “They had Jewish soldiers there.”</span> <span id="s512">I don’t know, but my father and I didn’t believe a word at first.</span> <span id="s513">What do you mean Jewish sol -- there are no Jewish soldiers.</span> <span id="s514">So we went to look, son of a bitch, there was these guys, just like the English standing there, you know, guarding the gate.</span> <span id="s515">So, the way that my brother told it later on, my -- my little brothers went there, and they -- they said, “How do we make clear to them that we are Jewish boys?”</span> <span id="s516">So, my brother Ott, who was always kind of inventive, said, “Yeah, I know something.</span> <span id="s517">Let’s go, and I’ll stand next to him, and I’ll sing us the only Jewish song I know.”</span> <span id="s518">And he started to hum, didn’t know any words.</span> <span id="s519">And he started [sings notes] which I think it -- I’m not quite sure what it is, but he said -- it’s a well known song, I think, that people sing at Passover, or you know.</span> <span id="s520">And the soldier looked at him, and said, “Come here.”</span> <span id="s521">He said, “Are you Jewish boys?”</span> <span id="s522">They said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s523">“Come in.”</span> <span id="s524">And they brought them into the camp, and they became the mascots of that battalion, and every day trucks would pull up in front of the house, and soldiers’d say, “Are the boys here?</span> <span id="s525">We want to take them up to a trip.”</span> <span id="s526">And it was all wonderful.</span> <span id="s527">In August, I think, 1945, I came back from a Zionist meeting in The Hague.</span> <span id="s528">We lived again in Delft, which is about 20 minutes by train one way.</span> <span id="s529">I came back from The Hague, from a Zionist meeting.</span> <span id="s530">My cousin had said, “You better go to The Hague, there’s a group of kids there, they all were in hiding, and they sing songs, and they dance, and then there are also nice girls there.”</span> <span id="s531">Well, I -- here I was, I was 18 or 19, never been kissed, never been to bed with a girl, you know?</span> <span id="s532">I mean, my teenage years were gone.</span> <span id="s533">Girls, God.</span> <span id="s534">I wa -- In no time, I was on the train, and it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s535">There was all these boys and girls, and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, who brought food and drink, and they took us for weekends, and I joined this Zionist group.</span> <span id="s536">There’s also a girl there called Carla Hymons, but she was three years younger, and kind of a kid.</span> <span id="s537">I didn’t pay too much attention to her.</span> <span id="s538">Course, now I been married to her for 50 years.</span> <span id="s539">Anyway, I came back one evening from a Zionist meeting, Sunday -- Sunday morning, came back.</span> <span id="s540">It was -- It was dusk, and I approached our new home, and there was an English army truck standing in front of the house, which was nothing special, because the -- the Jewish Brigade always had trucks standing there in -- but a-as I ran by, from under that -- that camouflage canvas, a woman’s voice called, and said, “Oh sir, could you tell me where the Lessings live?”</span> <span id="s541">It was my mother’s voice.</span> <span id="s542">I’ve always been warned, when doing interviews for the Shoah Foundation, watch out, departures and reu -- when people reunite, that’s when people start to cry, and it’s true.</span> <span id="s543">It always -- It always happens that way, because that was my mother -- my mother’s voice, and I barely had strength to -- to say, “Mother, it’s me, it’s Eddie.”</span> <span id="s544">And she came out of that truck, not at all what we expected.</span> <span id="s545">She was all tanned.</span> <span id="s546">She came in an army jumpsuit.</span> <span id="s547">I mean, we ex-expected this Bergen-Belsen emaciated, sick person, but of course, she had recuperated marvelously out there in Algiers, and as a matter of fact, typically like my mother, in no time at all, I understand, a few weeks after she arrived there, she was in charge of the office already.</span> <span id="s548">Anyway, there she was, and we rang the doorbell, and my father came, and -- and he was just, you know, he just -- he kept on saying to her, “Just sit down, I just want to look at you.”</span> <span id="s549">And she walked around [indecipherable] and she had -- she had boxes full of stuff to eat.</span> <span id="s550">And we had saved one chocolate bar, that had fallen out of the sky one day when we were still hiding in that little cottage during the winter of 1944 - ’45.</span> <span id="s551">The English made a mistaken drop of an enormous amount of weapons and radios, and also food canisters.</span> <span id="s552">And I had managed to get one of the food canisters, and hide it until the Germans had taken everything.</span> <span id="s553">The Germans had been warned, and they came and took everything, but they didn’t get this.</span> <span id="s554">Out of that, we had saved, for all those months, one little chocolate bar for my mother when she -- when she would come back, maybe.</span> <span id="s555">And here she was with boxes full of stuff, you know, with chocolates, and cigarettes, and whatever she could have got of there, out in that -- anyway, well there she was.</span> <span id="s556">She had flown back -- two bombers had flown from Algiers to Paris, and as I later h-heard -- this is -- I mean, this is the God damnedest ironic and horrible thing, one of the -- one of the bombers, w-with survivors, had flown from Algiers back to Europe, to France.</span> <span id="s557">Most of them were Dutch.</span> <span id="s558">One of them -- One of the planes crashed, and everybody was killed, but the other one arrived in Paris, and my mother from there hitchhiked, [indecipherable] and finally wound up in front of our house, and there she was.</span> <span id="s559">And my brother Ott, in his hurry to see her, he fell down the stairs, I remember.</span> <span id="s560">He rolled down two floors of -- of stairs, and it was pandemonium, but it was glorious, glorious, glorious.</span> <span id="s561">And my mother walked around, and she said, “Oh, beautiful, this is -- is this ours?</span> <span id="s562">And my father said, “Yes, this is our h-home now.”</span> <span id="s563">And she said, “Oh look at all the furniture you have, and -- and,” -- this is the -- my father telling, you know, again, a little story, a mini story, he says, and she walked around, and she said, “Oh, it’s so beautiful, and -- and look, you even put curtains, and I,” -- she was so impressed.</span> <span id="s564">She said -- But the next morning, when she got up, she said, “Well, the couch is not right there, we got to move that, and those curtains, they got to go.</span> <span id="s565">Th-That’s -- That’s a mess, and,” he said -- my father starts shifting everything.</span> <span id="s566">Typically, like a woman.</span> <span id="s567">And then my brother said, “Mom, there are Jewish soldiers around in, and they guarding prisoners of war.”</span> <span id="s568">You know what my mother said?</span> <span id="s569">She said, “I never want to see another Jew in my life.”</span> <span id="s570">Oh, it was shocking.</span> <span id="s571">However, three weeks later, at a party in the Jewish Brigade, Italian camp, she was a performer, she was an amateur singer.</span> <span id="s572">She sang Yiddish and Jewish songs for them, and she just loved it, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: What did that mean to her, or to you at that point that she [inaudible] see another Jew in her life?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: If you read what she tells about Bergen-Belsen, she said everybody stole from everyone else.</span> <span id="s575">She said you couldn’t leave a -- a hanky lying around, you find the next day it was gone.</span> <span id="s576">If you -- well, at one point -- I -- I can’t tell you the whole story of my mother, but th-there -- she tells about one night, she ca -- she wa -- she -- she managed to get a job in the kitchen, from I think midnight until seven in the morning, or something like that, where she was once in a while be able to steal some -- a potato or something, which would -- she would then divide with her friend, or something else, a lit -- tiny bit of extra food.</span> <span id="s577">And she said, “One morning I came back from my job, and the whole barracks was empty.”</span> <span id="s578">And she said the Germans had this crazy mania, like every two weeks or so, they would move everybody around into different barracks, for no God damn reason that anybody could see.</span> <span id="s579">But then you had to move your stuff, and if you weren’t there when you, as she wasn’t -- she -- she came, and it -- it was in the middle of the winter, it was very cold, she says, bitterly cold.</span> <span id="s580">Snow everywhere.</span> <span id="s581">And she said, “I came, and there was no one there, and all my stuff was gone.”</span> <span id="s582">And she said, “I sat at the doorstep of the barracks, the empty barracks,” she said, “and I cried.”</span> <span id="s583">And she said, “I don’t want to go on, this is the end, I -- I don’t want to go fight any more.”</span> <span id="s584">And that’s her -- with her magical thing, she said, “I heard a voice saying, you must go on, don’t give up, don’t give up, you must go on, you must live,” she says, “and then I -- I schlepped myself to the barracks where they had gone, and I pushed somebody aside so I could get a place in a bunkbed, and -- to sleep.</span> <span id="s585">And I borrowed a blanket from a friend,” or something.</span> <span id="s586">Anyway, she continued on.</span> <span id="s587">So -- But she said you couldn’t trust anyone.</span> <span id="s588">They would sell your -- their -- your -- their souls for -- for -- you know, they’ll sell you for a -- for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s589">So her impression of Jews was like, what do you expect, you know?</span> <span id="s590">Anyway, let me continue with the story, otherwise we’ll sit here until a long, long time yet, because there’s more to come on this.</span> <span id="s591">So, my mother was back, and I went back to school.</span> <span id="s592">Now I was -- I was a terrible scholar, I -- I -- I had been to high school, and failed, had been held back.</span> <span id="s593">In -- In -- In desperation my father had asked a neighbor, “Wh-What should I do with my son?”</span> <span id="s594">And the neighbor had said, “Do you know what’s a good profess -- send him to trade school, he learn profession.”</span> <span id="s595">And then my father, “What -- What kind of a trade school?</span> <span id="s596">What kind of a profession,” and -- and this man said, “Well,” he said, “I work with people who are instrument makers.</span> <span id="s597">They -- They -- They -- They make and repair scientific instruments.”</span> <span id="s598">He said, “It’s a good job,” he said, “and maybe your son can learn that.”</span> <span id="s599">So, I don’t know if you know the Yiddish expression, ashander?</span> <span id="s600">It means -- It means -- It means a -- it’s a terrible thing in the family.</span> <span id="s601">It used to be said if a -- if a girl marries a non-Jew, that’s ashander, it’s -- it’s Yiddish, and it means -- it’s a -- it’s a -- it’s a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s602">So here my -- I probably was the only Jewish boy who ever was in that trade school.</span> <span id="s603">I mean, there were no Jewish kids in trade schools.</span> <span id="s604">They became lawyers and doctors and writers, and whatever, but here I was.</span> <span id="s605">I had gone to the trade school, and during the war, when the Germans decided Jewish kids couldn’t go any longer in school, I was out of trade school.</span> <span id="s606">And now the war was over, and I went back to the trade school, and I finished one year of -- to get a diploma in instrument making.</span> <span id="s607">It didn’t take very long after that, I worked at one jo -- I worked at two jobs, and -- with instrument companies in Delft, and first as an apprentice in the shop, and later on -- my mother made another decision for me, come to think of it.</span> <span id="s608">My mother said, “Why don’t you take a little vacation before,” you know, and -- oh, the first job I had, I worked in a machine shop, as an apprentice tool maker, or instrument maker, and I had a -- I found out I had an anti-Semitic boss, a g -- a guy who said Jews are no good.</span> <span id="s609">And I told this at home, and my mother said, “You quit, right now.”</span> <span id="s610">And I quit.</span> <span id="s611">She says, “Now you to-take a vacation,” oh no, first, “go around, see if you get another job.”</span> <span id="s612">And I went to another -- there was another instrument company, very prestigious one, and I asked for a job there, and they said, “Well, we don’t have a j -- we don’t have a position in -- in the -- in the sh -- in the -- the shop, but w-we could take you on as an apprentice draftsman.”</span> <span id="s613">And I said, “No, I -- I work in the shop.”</span> <span id="s614">My mother said, “Why don’t you go take a vacation for a week?</span> <span id="s615">Go visit friends.”</span> <span id="s616">Which I did.</span> <span id="s617">When I came back, she says, “You have a job as a draftsman.”</span> <span id="s618">I said, “But I said no.”</span> <span id="s619">She said, “I took it for -- I told them you would take it.”</span> <span id="s620">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Let me ask you, you mentioned that your brother had gone back to school, and how strange it was to sort of all of a sudden be studying, you know, open your book to page one.</span> <span id="s622">What was it like, the attempt to return to normal life, and how much was it like normal life?</span> <span id="s623">What -- What were people -- Were people reuniting?</span> <span id="s624">Were people were -- talk about the experiences?</span> <span id="s625">What was that sort of, you know, getting back [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: From my memory -- It’s going to be hard to believe what I’m going to tell you.</span> <span id="s627">We didn’t talk about the war.</span> <span id="s628">We sort of went right into picking up where we left off.</span> <span id="s629">I’m still saying it today in my speeches to -- to -- to adult -- when I speak to adult audiences.</span> <span id="s630">I say, “We thought we would just pick up where we left off, and we did.</span> <span id="s631">We thought that two and a half years of hiding was an interruption, but now we were back.”</span> <span id="s632">And life -- I joined this -- this group, my father started teaching music, my brothers went to school.</span> <span id="s633">Nobody talked about the war.</span> <span id="s634">Nobody talked about.</span> <span id="s635">There was no Holocaust.</span> <span id="s636">The word didn’t exist, the beginning.</span> <span id="s637">I was together in this -- this group of -- of -- of we went with hundreds of kids who had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s638">We went on weekends, provided by the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s639">Nobody talked about what had happened.</span> <span id="s640">It was as if we -- as if we were ger -- normal kids.</span> <span id="s641">When I think it back ows -- it seems incredible, it’s unbelievable that w -- but -- but I guess we had to do it, in order to get started again.</span> <span id="s642">So my answer to you is that life seemed to resume normally where -- where th -- where we had left off, two and a half years before.</span> <span id="s643">Course, we weren’t Polish Jews, who came back and then were murdered.</span> <span id="s644">Or, later on a Czech friend of mine here in the United States, says, “When I went back to my village, they tried to kill me, when I tried to get my parents house back.”</span> <span id="s645">We were welcomed, and well, friends said, “We’re glad you’re back.”</span> <span id="s646">We got a nice letter from the little -- the maid, who had -- we had had that -- a maid before we left, and she wrote us a nice letter, “Dear Mr. and Miss,” -- to my parents, “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Lessing.”</span> <span id="s647">She was a simple soul.</span> <span id="s648">“I’m so glad you’re back, because I already thought you had kicked the bucket.”</span> <span id="s649">She say -- She wrote it, something very similar in that.</span> <span id="s650">Life resumed.</span> <span id="s651">For all those who didn’t -- who had disappeared, there was no -- we didn’t talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Even within your family, you didn’t talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Even within our family, nobody talked about it.</span> <span id="s654">There was no discussion.</span> <span id="s655">The discussions came 50 years later.</span> <span id="s656">And pretty soon -- well, a -- as I said, I was in this Zionist group, I met this girl, and she was three years younger, but then a year later, my father and I, we got a -- we got a visa for the -- for the United States, which was very unusual, and my parents said, “Are you coming to the United States?”</span> <span id="s657">And I said, “No, I’m a Zionist, I’m going to go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s658">Palestine, then.</span> <span id="s659">And they said, well -- they talked me out of if, they said, “Why don’t you come with me?</span> <span id="s660">You have a visa now, come with us to the States.</span> <span id="s661">We need help to get started.</span> <span id="s662">Maybe you can save some money and help us get started.”</span> <span id="s663">We didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s664">And so, I agreed.</span> <span id="s665">But I managed to -- like, a month before I agreed to leave, before we supposed to leave, I fell in love with this girl.</span> <span id="s666">And when I left, we made an agreement that if we would keep on writing letters, then it would be something, but if we didn’t keep on writing letters, well then, it was nothing.</span> <span id="s667">And so, my father and I left for the United States.</span> <span id="s668">My father went to Springfield, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s669">And I got a job, my first job, with -- we actually went both to my aunt and uncle, liv -- the aunt that my mother was supposed to go to.</span> <span id="s670">Aunt and uncle lived in Holyoke, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s671">And from there, my father went to Springfield, and started teaching music, and my uncle got me a job in General Electric, in Schenectady, New York, as a toolmaker, and that’s where I went.</span> <span id="s672">And so, the first year, my first year in the United States was spent in Schenectady.</span> <span id="s673">And I would call that the armpit of -- of New York State, it was about the worst place.</span> <span id="s674">And I think that’s where, maybe the first intimations of what had happened to me began to -- to be felt a little bit, because I had no one there.</span> <span id="s675">I was almost in the same situation when I was -- as I was on my first farm.</span> <span id="s676">I knew nobody.</span> <span id="s677">I lived in a -- the room I -- if somebody had said to me, “If you -- You need a room?”</span> <span id="s678">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s679">Oh, the man at General Electric, at the employment office there said -- personnel office, he said, “Why don’t you go to the YMCA, they have an announcement board and people post rooms for rent sometimes.”</span> <span id="s680">So I went there, and I found the McDuffys, or something like that, and -- on the street, and I rented a room from two older ladies.</span> <span id="s681">And they had some more rooms, there were other students, there were -- there were some Latin American students there.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: This is interview with Ed Lessing, this is tape two, side B. And you were just talking about coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yeah, I rented this room from these two -- two Catholic ladies, and after a month, they said, “Ed, we’re sorry, we -- we need the room for someone else.”</span> <span id="s685">And I was out.</span> <span id="s686">And I thought it was a little strange.</span> <span id="s687">In the meantime, I had contacted -- I found out there was a Jewish Community Center, something I never knew about, and I went there, and I spoke with the director there, and I said, “You know, I had this room, and,” -- he said, “Who was it?”</span> <span id="s688">I said, “Mr. and Mrs. McDuffy, on the,” -- whatever, “Cedar Street,” or something.</span> <span id="s689">He said, “You rented from Catholic people?”</span> <span id="s690">I said, “Yeah.”</span> <span id="s691">He said, “Well, did they know you were Jewish?”</span> <span id="s692">I said, “Yeah, I told them, you know, I said I was a Zionist, and,” -- he said, “Of course y -- th-they didn’t want you in the house.”</span> <span id="s693">He said, “Wa -- You,” he said, “We have rooms here for rent with Jews,” he said.</span> <span id="s694">My first -- My first hit with anti-Semitism in the United States.</span> <span id="s695">I haven’t found any after that, I must say, you know, but it was a revelation.</span> <span id="s696">I thought, “Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s697">That’s still going on in this country?”</span> <span id="s698">And I thought, “I’m not going to take this.</span> <span id="s699">I had this for two and a half years.”</span> <span id="s700">And it began to dawn on me that I was different from -- from the regular -- what should I say?</span> <span id="s701">American -- American Jews, that I had -- I had a past.</span> <span id="s702">And I met -- Well, I got another room with a very old Jewish lady, who spoke mostly Yiddish, and she was very sweet, but I didn’t have any heat in my room, so I had to always leave the door opened.</span> <span id="s703">But she was very sweet, and was my first touch of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s704">I had never heard Yiddish before.</span> <span id="s705">And here was a lady who spoke mostly Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Y-You mentioned that that was when you started to feel that you were different from other Jews who hadn’t had that experience.</span> <span id="s707">In what way do you mean, like h-how did you start to feel different?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Well, it c -- it came about because I met -- through the people I met at the Jewish Community Center.</span> <span id="s709">I met a guy called Phil, forget his last name.</span> <span id="s710">He was the all American Jewish teenager, I guess.</span> <span id="s711">A little bit older.</span> <span id="s712">Yeah, he was pre-college, he was -- yeah, he was teenager, he was in -- probably in high school.</span> <span id="s713">And he and I made friends, somehow another.</span> <span id="s714">And Phil, well, I realized, was a happy guy.</span> <span id="s715">He had a car, he did some -- he did some amateur -- no, not amateur, he did some photography for the local newspaper.</span> <span id="s716">You know, he would take -- go to a fire, or something like that.</span> <span id="s717">What they call it, a stringer, probably, right?</span> <span id="s718">Anyway, Phil -- Phil seemed to have -- was terribly unlike me.</span> <span id="s719">H-He wasn’t serious about life.</span> <span id="s720">He wasn’t worry about de -- worried about death.</span> <span id="s721">He -- He was -- Life was happy.</span> <span id="s722">He went to school dances, and to reunions of his class, and he invited me for New Year’s Eve, “You want to spend New Year’s Eve with me and my family?”</span> <span id="s723">I says, “Yeah, great.”</span> <span id="s724">In Holland, on New Year’s Eve, the whole family comes together, and you make special pastries and so.</span> <span id="s725">So I came to his house that evening, about nine o’clock, and I just bumped into his father and mother, who are on their way out.</span> <span id="s726">They said, “Hi, Ed, we’re,” -- I said, “Where you going?”</span> <span id="s727">“Oh, we’re going to a party.”</span> <span id="s728">Oh, oh, and so they left.</span> <span id="s729">Then his sister came out with her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s730">“Well, Ed, have a nice evening.”</span> <span id="s731">I said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s732">“Oh, we’re going to celebrate somewhere, New Year’s Eve, with friends.”</span> <span id="s733">So it was Phil and me.</span> <span id="s734">I realized this is different.</span> <span id="s735">These people, they just have fun, they go out, they party.</span> <span id="s736">New Year’s Eve was a serious business in Holland, you remembered, you know, life and death, and -- so Phil said, “What shall we do tonight?”</span> <span id="s737">I said, “I don’t know, what do you do on New Year?”</span> <span id="s738">He says, “You want to cruise around with the car?”</span> <span id="s739">He had this big Chevy convertible.</span> <span id="s740">I don’t know, we -- we cruised around through Schenectady until it was after 12, and then I went back to my little old Yiddish lady, and -- and I realized I’m different, this is -- then I met someone else.</span> <span id="s741">A -- A man who seemed a little older than me, and he was from Czechoslovakia, and he -- I realized it years later, he was a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s742">But I didn’t know what a Holocaust survivor was.</span> <span id="s743">He said, “I have a car.</span> <span id="s744">You want it,” -- somehow another, I guess he -- he said where were you, and I said I was in Holland, in hiding.</span> <span id="s745">And -- And he said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s746">He said, “I was in camps.”</span> <span id="s747">And he -- who knows what camps he may have been in.</span> <span id="s748">Auschwitz for all I know.</span> <span id="s749">The name didn’t -- if he had said Auschwitz, it wouldn’t have rung a bell with me even then.</span> <span id="s750">And we spent a little time together, and he told me -- he was the man who said, “When I tried to go back to my village, and get to my father and mother’s home, who had been killed in camps,” he said, “they tried to kill me, and I ran off.”</span> <span id="s751">And he was a butcher in the A&amp;P.</span> <span id="s752">I think it’s the first time that I met up with a camp survivor.</span> <span id="s753">I’ve always remembered him.</span> <span id="s754">So I realize there was a little bit of a kinship there.</span> <span id="s755">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: And yet -- And yet, you didn’t’ talk about your experiences there?</span> <span id="s757">It was just something that was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: No, we did not talk at length about what had gone behind.</span> <span id="s759">Survivors didn’t talk about what happened then.</span> <span id="s760">You were busy making your life.</span> <span id="s761">Anyway, let me see if I -- let me not forget anything.</span> <span id="s762">I worked for about a year at General Electric.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: What was your family doing at this point?</span> <span id="s764">When did you all</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Well, my mother and -- no, my mother wasn’t over yet, my mother and brothers were still in -- in Holland, and my father was in Springfield, Massachusetts, beginning to set up a teaching schedule, and I was in Schenectady.</span> <span id="s766">And my girlfriend was in Holland, and I wrote letters like crazy.</span> <span id="s767">Man, did I write.</span> <span id="s768">And after a year, I -- I quit at General Electric, as my plan had been.</span> <span id="s769">I just had joined General Electric in order to learn the American system for measuring, and the tool names, and all that, the -- you know, the -- how -- we -- we di -- we had the metric system in Europe, and I wasn’t used to the system they had here, and so -- so I took that year, and I learned, and I worked, and it was very interesting, I had a very good time, and working with -- with American men, and my boss was a great guy, I -- was totally unknown i-in Holland, something like -- first day I was there, he said, “Ed, call me George.”</span> <span id="s770">I said, “That’s my boss, I can’t call -- call -- call him -- can’t call him George.”</span> <span id="s771">But he insisted, it -- it was like Jesus.</span> <span id="s772">When I left one of the -- an old man, Hank Kruger, old toolmaker, he said, “I’ve been here for 35 years.</span> <span id="s773">What are you leaving for?”</span> <span id="s774">I said, “Well, I want to go back to drafting, you know, become a drafts -- I was -- I was a draftsman when I left home.”</span> <span id="s775">He said -- “I on -- I only took this j -- this job to learn about tools, and so on.”</span> <span id="s776">He said, “You’ll never get a job like this again.</span> <span id="s777">You can stay here forever,” you know, and -- and I thought, “Gee, d-d-don’t they fire people here?”</span> <span id="s778">He said, “Yeah, you got to commit a murder in order to fire someone,” he said.</span> <span id="s779">“Beside, the union would -- union -- union wouldn’t let the -- let you be fired.”</span> <span id="s780">I was a member of a union, electrical workers.</span> <span id="s781">But I did quit, after a year, and my mother came over.</span> <span id="s782">I went to New York, and my mother, and my brothers came.</span> <span id="s783">We all went to Radio City Music Hall, saw Gene Kelly in “The Pirate.”</span> <span id="s784">Grace -- Great days, and -- and I found a job in Ossening, little bit up the river from -- you know, Ossening, New York.</span> <span id="s785">Which -- Life is very strange, I -- I had written down some names when I -- when I left Holland, of companies similar to the ones -- the one where I worked as a draftsman in Holland, a scientific instrument company.</span> <span id="s786">One of them was the Cambridge Instrument Company, and I called them, and I explained that I had worked for Kip and Sons in Holland.</span> <span id="s787">And oh, they said, “Oh, w-we make the same things here.</span> <span id="s788">We’d love to meet you, Mr. Lessing.”</span> <span id="s789">And I said, “Where do I go?”</span> <span id="s790">And they said, “Well, our headquarters is in Grand Central Station, in New York, in the office building.”</span> <span id="s791">And I traveled to Grand Central, and -- and oh, they were delighted with my resume, and -- as it was at that time.</span> <span id="s792">And they said, “Well, we’d gladly -- gladly h-have you,” he said, “but all we want you to do is -- is do meet our -- our chief engineer, Mr. Digby, an Englishman.”</span> <span id="s793">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s794">I said, “So, I’ll take the train to Cambridge then.”</span> <span id="s795">They said, “No, no, our -- our -- our factory is located in Ossening.”</span> <span id="s796">I said, “Aren’t you in Cambridge?”</span> <span id="s797">They said, “No.”</span> <span id="s798">They said, “Why would you want to be in Cambridge?”</span> <span id="s799">I said, “Well, my parents live in Springfield, and I figured Cambridge near Boston, and -- and Springfield, it’s an easy -- there’s a train connection, and a -- you know, it’s an hour,” and -- “Oh, no,” they said.</span> <span id="s800">I said, “Well, what’s Cambridge Instrument Company then?”</span> <span id="s801">They said, “Oh yeah, well years ago, we used to be a sister company of Cambridge Instrument Company in England, but what -- what had nothing to do with us any more, we’re now located in Ossening.”</span> <span id="s802">And that’s how I wound up in Ossening, and that’s why I’m living here in Westchester still.</span> <span id="s803">Anyway, I got the job there, and started working, and then my girl came over.</span> <span id="s804">And -- But before that, I should tell you another little incident with my mother.</span> <span id="s805">I lived on the houseboat, I -- When I got the job in Ossening, I lived on a houseboat in the river, on a dock in the river.</span> <span id="s806">It was a houseboat somebody else had lent me.</span> <span id="s807">He said, “Would you take care of the houseboat?</span> <span id="s808">You can have it for a year, with no rent.”</span> <span id="s809">Okay.</span> <span id="s810">So I wrote all my letters from the houseboat in Ossening, and one day I got a letter from my mother, and said, “I want to send you here this little advertisement that I’ve cut out of the Jewish newspaper in Holland.”</span> <span id="s811">And I plucked it out of there, and it said that Ed Lessing was engaged to Carla Hymons.</span> <span id="s812">And so I was engaged.</span> <span id="s813">My mother had decided that we were engaged, so -- it always makes a wonderful hit because at our 50th wedding anniversary, I told this story about our engagement.</span> <span id="s814">People -- Americans, they -- they look at you -- “You were -- your mother told you were engaged?”</span> <span id="s815">I said yeah.</span> <span id="s816">I didn’t think it was strange.</span> <span id="s817">My mother had seen that we wrote a lot of letters, and she figures here’s a nice girl, Ed, you’re engaged.</span> <span id="s818">So we were engaged to get married, and so we married.</span> <span id="s819">She came over, and we got married in -- what is it, 1948, I think, in Chicopee, Massachusetts.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: What sort of things did you write in your letters?</span> <span id="s821">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Oh, desire, love, forever.</span> <span id="s823">I mean, I had three little black and white photographs of her, and they just drove me crazy.</span> <span id="s824">I could look -- look at them for hours.</span> <span id="s825">I -- I just crazy with love for this girl.</span> <span id="s826">Oh, it was endless letters about -- I told her about what I was doing, and what -- you know, but each let -- I wrote at least -- at least four letters a week, and each one had a least eight, if not 12 pages.</span> <span id="s827">When the -- When it was all over, when they come -- I had a -- we filled a suitcase with -- and she would write back once in awhile also, but not that much.</span> <span id="s828">She would also write I love you.</span> <span id="s829">I wrote -- anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Was it important that you both had similar experiences during the war, that she was in hiding as well, or did that -- was that not even part of the conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Of course, because that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s832">We met in -- We met in the Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s833">Both of us didn’t want to live in Holland, both of us wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s834">I mean, all the girls, all the boys, nobody want to stay in Holland, although some did, but we all wanted to get -- get the hell out, and go to the -- many went to the United States, others went to -- to Palestine.</span> <span id="s835">Carla’s brother went -- helped by the Jewish Brigade to get to Palestine illegally.</span> <span id="s836">It was the end.</span> <span id="s837">We didn’t realize why it was the end, I think even.</span> <span id="s838">It’s just strange, when I think back of it.</span> <span id="s839">We wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s840">None of us knew the numbers, by the way.</span> <span id="s841">None of us knew at that time that 75 percent of the Dutch Jewish population had been -- had been murdered.</span> <span id="s842">A lot of people went on those trains, and they -- yeah, well, you heard, I have an uncle, or somebody had -- that his father was killed, or -- but it didn’t form a picture.</span> <span id="s843">Again, the Holocaust did not exist yet.</span> <span id="s844">The -- The scope of this -- of this horror, was this -- was unknown to us.</span> <span id="s845">It had been bad, and a lot of people got killed, it seemed, but what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s846">That’s how I remember it, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: So what changed?</span> <span id="s848">When did people start to see it as this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Well, I got to jump way ahead, but let me see.</span> <span id="s850">I better stay a little bit chronologically, otherwise it doesn’t make any s -- we got married, and in 1950 we decided now was the time to go to -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s851">1948, the state had been declared, in 1950 we left.</span> <span id="s852">We left on the LaGuardia, a ship of the American export line, and we had a marvelous trip across.</span> <span id="s853">We stopped in various places, Gibraltar, and Paraeus, and -- and we wound up in Haifa, and Carla’s brother was there, and we went to where Carla’s brother and sister-in-law lived in a kibbutz called Dovrat, in Israel.</span> <span id="s854">And there we lived for five years, as kibbutniks -- kibbutzniks.</span> <span id="s855">Idealists.</span> <span id="s856">You didn’t make, you know, no money, and I started working at first as a blacksmith there, because I had some experience with metal working, of course, a-and later on I became a tractor driver, I had my own little tractor, and I spend most of my time spraying poisons on apples, and pears, and grapes, and -- and Carla worked in the children’s houses, with -- with the babies, and with little children, and -- and our daughter was born in 1952, I guess, and we named her Noa, N-o-a, for figure out of the -- out of the Bible.</span> <span id="s857">And I wasn’t very happy in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s858">I had already tasted individual life, and it was very hard to adjust.</span> <span id="s859">I had been an independent guy.</span> <span id="s860">When I come to think of my whole life, I’ve been -- always been more or less a -- a lo -- a -- a -- a -- a guy who did better as a -- as a s -- as a loner.</span> <span id="s861">Not -- Not necessarily completely detached from life, but -- but as one who took care of himself.</span> <span id="s862">I took care of myself during the war, most of the time.</span> <span id="s863">I was not with anyone else, I was by myself, except for la -- at the end.</span> <span id="s864">Before that, I had two brothers, but they were eight and 10 years younger.</span> <span id="s865">They were always together, like twins, and I was by myself out there, you know, 10 years older.</span> <span id="s866">So, I had worked in the States, I had worked in Holland, in my own profession, and here I was a tractor driver.</span> <span id="s867">So I wasn’t too happy there.</span> <span id="s868">My daughter got sick, she got tuberculosis, which runs in the family, and almost died in the hospital.</span> <span id="s869">And strangely enough, we had not made any decision to go back to the United States, but it -- it happened through a bunch of strange coincidences.</span> <span id="s870">I had no family in Israel, none whatsoever, all my family was in the United States, and it was quite a -- quite a group by then.</span> <span id="s871">My two brothers, my father and mother, my cousins had come over, with wives, with their children.</span> <span id="s872">It grew here in the States, all around Springfield, and so on.</span> <span id="s873">And I was -- I was sitting out in -- i-in Israel, and everybody was poor, they didn’t have money to travel to Israel to -- in those days everything was different, you know, you didn’t say, “Oh well, we go, you know, spend a couple of weeks in Israel,” you know, wh-what the hell, a couple of thousand bucks, so what?</span> <span id="s874">20 dollars was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s875">So, I had actually no prospect of seeing my family again.</span> <span id="s876">Carla had her brother, and an uncle, and she had some family in Israel, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s877">And my mother wants us -- when we -- when we left the United States to go to Israel, Carla and I, we had asked for a re-entry permit, which you needed in those days.</span> <span id="s878">You needed a re-entry permit if you wanted to come back into the States, as a non-citizens.</span> <span id="s879">We weren’t citizens, you know?</span> <span id="s880">I had sent the money to Washington, but the re-entry permit never came.</span> <span id="s881">Oh, we said, so what.</span> <span id="s882">It was just -- It was like a -- a -- a safety line in -- in case we wouldn’t like it in -- in Israel, then we could always come back.</span> <span id="s883">But, you know, we liked it well enough, and five years went by, and then my mother wrote.</span> <span id="s884">She said, “Did you ever get that re-entry permit?”</span> <span id="s885">And I wrote back, “No, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s886">We sent the money, but we didn’t get it.”</span> <span id="s887">She -- Well, my mother being well, my mother, immediately spoke with her senator.</span> <span id="s888">“What the hell’s going on here?</span> <span id="s889">My son sent money to Washington for re-entry permit.”</span> <span id="s890">“I’ll look into it.”</span> <span id="s891">Two weeks later a letter came from the embassy in Tel Aviv, that, “You are hereby requested to reapply for a visa to the United States,” and I hadn’t planned to apply for a visa -- send photographs.</span> <span id="s892">And we thought, well, my daughter hadn’t been s -- been so sick, and almost died, and maybe we should go back for some time, and -- well, from there it rolled on and on and on and on.</span> <span id="s893">They needed photographs, you needed documents, you need to go to the local police to tell you that you were a good character.</span> <span id="s894">And one day a letter arrived in the kibbutz, and somebody in -- the letters in the kibbutz all come to the office, and then they get distributed.</span> <span id="s895">And somebody in the office said, “Hey, I’m going to open this letter.”</span> <span id="s896">He opened our letters from the embassy, and said, “Hey, these people are applying to go back to the United States.”</span> <span id="s897">Now, it’s hard to imagine at this point in the history of Israel, but then, if you left the kibbutz, just leave it and go to the city, you were an outcast already, sort of.</span> <span id="s898">They would give you a table, and two chairs and a bed, and 20 bucks, and goodbye Charlie, that was nice of you to be in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s899">We don’t want to have further anything to do with you.</span> <span id="s900">To go back to the country where you came from, you were yuradeem.</span> <span id="s901">There are two words in Israel, one it alleyah, which means going up, when you go to Israel, you make alleyah, you go to Israel, you go up.</span> <span id="s902">The word El Al comes from there, by the way, the airline.</span> <span id="s903">When you leave Israel, you yurate, you go down.</span> <span id="s904">We were yuradeem, people who go down.</span> <span id="s905">It was, again the word ashander, an-and it was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s906">And in the general meeting, in the kibbutz, the members decided that we had no right to live there any more, even though we had worked for five years, our butts off, and all that, but -- and we had been bona fide members, they voted us out.</span> <span id="s907">But they didn’t want to throw us out right away, first -- they would throw us out as soon as I found a job, some -- outside of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s908">So I went, and I applied for a job, and I got a job as a draftsman, in an English company, the refineries, the oil refineries in Haifa.</span> <span id="s909">And I don’t know any more what happened, but we didn’t -- we decided that we wouldn’t stay in Israel after all.</span> <span id="s910">However, we couldn’t go to the United States either, because of my daughter’s tuberculosis that she had had.</span> <span id="s911">They took x-rays, and they said, “You’ll have to wait a year.”</span> <span id="s912">In those days tuberculosis was like AIDS today.</span> <span id="s913">You had it, you didn’t get into the States, and that was the worst.</span> <span id="s914">So, they said, “You’ll have to wait a year.”</span> <span id="s915">And I don’t know, we decided, you know what, if we have to wait a year, let’s go to Holland, and we’ll wait a year there, and then we’ll apply to the American embassy there.</span> <span id="s916">And so we got on a ship, and left Israel with our daughter, and went back to Holland, and we lived there for one year in 1956.</span> <span id="s917">I went back to the same place where I had worked before as a draftsman, found out about a new profession that I had never heard about, and immediately decided that was the profession that I wanted to learn.</span> <span id="s918">It was called industrial design.</span> <span id="s919">I’d never heard of it.</span> <span id="s920">It was ideal for me.</span> <span id="s921">It was a combination of art, and technology.</span> <span id="s922">Industrial designers are the people who design cars on the outside, and telephones and refrigerators, and -- in other words, people who give shape to modern industrial products.</span> <span id="s923">Anyway, we spent a year in Holland, had a wonderful time.</span> <span id="s924">One of the best years of our lives, I don’t know why, but it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s925">My daughter, in quick succession, dropped her Hebrew, which she spoke fluently, and learned Dutch, and at the end of the year, when we went to the United States, she dropped her Dutch, and in three weeks spoke fluent English.</span> <span id="s926">So, went through three languages in no time at all.</span> <span id="s927">And so we got back to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: But let’s just go back to Israel for a moment.</span> <span id="s929">Again, being identified as people who had survived the war, an-and what was t -- as you say, to later become the Holocaust, was there -- were people i-identified in different ways, [indecipherable] didn’t feel like they were different [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s930">Were there conversations about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: It’s g -- It’s a good question you ask, because it brings me back to our five years in kibbutz.</span> <span id="s932">It’s astounding.</span> <span id="s933">In the kibbutz, there was a group of youngsters who had come from Romania, they were all orphans, their parents had all been killed.</span> <span id="s934">They worked a half a day in the morning, and in the afternoon they learned, they had school lessons.</span> <span id="s935">I actually set up a little drafting course for some of them, for some of the boys that wanted to learn drafting.</span> <span id="s936">Do you know that it never occurred to me that they were Holocaust survivors?</span> <span id="s937">That they had gone through hell?</span> <span id="s938">That these kids were -- I mean, that they couldn’t even imagine what these children had gone through.</span> <span id="s939">They were just kids to us, yeah, and they were not such good kids either, because sometimes they would steal things.</span> <span id="s940">Sometimes, you -- you know, you were supposed to work with them.</span> <span id="s941">I had s -- a kid who were helping me on the tractor, and he wouldn’t work very well, and I thought, “Oh, he’s a rotten kid.”</span> <span id="s942">When I think back of it now, I cannot even imagine that I didn’t realize, that I didn’t have the compassion.</span> <span id="s943">There were two ladies in the kibbutz, who were Holocaust survivors from camps.</span> <span id="s944">One, Margit, big woman, would scream at night in her dreams.</span> <span id="s945">And aft -- you know, when we heard it the first time, we’d say, “Who was this screaming last night, this awful screaming?”</span> <span id="s946">“Oh that’s -- that’s Margit, she’s dreaming about the camps, oh yeah.”</span> <span id="s947">That was it.</span> <span id="s948">And I think about that now, I can’t even imagine that either, that it didn’t ring a bell, it didn’t do anything, it -- oh well, that was the Holocaust survi -- we had a father on a -- a father of one of the members of the kibbutz, an old man, he had been in the camps.</span> <span id="s949">Every meal, he would take from the communal dining room, he would take pieces of bread, and put them in his pocket, take them to his room and hide them.</span> <span id="s950">It was a big joke.</span> <span id="s951">Abba Bower.</span> <span id="s952">Abba Bower, who would take bread.</span> <span id="s953">You look back and you don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s954">I guess we -- we were busy.</span> <span id="s955">We were busy working, we were busy building a family, we -- we were busy with our children, we were busy having fun sometimes.</span> <span id="s956">We were busy sitting on the lawn in the evening, and talking about the neighbors, and about Holland, and how much of what we did in our childhood, and the fun we had, and -- and remembering old class songs, or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s957">Nobody mentioned a word about what had happened to us.</span> <span id="s958">And Carla’s brother had gone through the Holocaust, he was in hiding with her, he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Was it considered a weakness to dwell on that, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I think it probably was.</span> <span id="s961">There -- There are many -- I mean, this is in hindsight now, of course, and I’ve heard -- we all have heard now, the stories of -- that the Holocaust survivors weren’t particularly welcome in Israel after the war, because they represented defeat, and what Israel was about was victory.</span> <span id="s962">And then there were these people who kept on talking about the horrors they had seen, and nobody wanted to hear this.</span> <span id="s963">Nobody wanted to hear the stories.</span> <span id="s964">And the hidden children -- that term by ca -- didn’t exist, of course, but those who had been in hiding, we -- when you heard a story from a -- from a Holocaust survivor who had been in Auschwitz, you weren’t going to talk about, hey, I was in a room for two and a half years.</span> <span id="s965">They would laugh.</span> <span id="s966">Nothing happened to you.</span> <span id="s967">You weren’t in the camps, you didn’t see anybody die, did you?</span> <span id="s968">No, but -- anyway.</span> <span id="s969">No, it -- I guess there was something like that, but I’m not sure that that influenced us at all.</span> <span id="s970">We lived with a little group of o-other Dutch kibbutznikim, some of who had also gone through hiding, and we worked hard, we got children, and we didn’t talk about the war, talked about everything but the war.</span> <span id="s971">Talked about the crummy bastards in the kibbutz who were freeloading, on -- on us who were working so hard, and they talked about the -- the guy, the sadana witha the guy who puts you in work places every day, and he always gave you the lousy jobs.</span> <span id="s972">And talked about tractors, that they weren’t working right, or stuff like that.</span> <span id="s973">Years went -- went by talking about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So you’re -- After the war, you know, you -- you sort of welcome this, you know Zionism, and -- and identified in that way with -- did it feel like giving up a -- a dream, or was it the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Wait a minute, I didn’t get that.</span> <span id="s976">Say it -- Would you reformulate that?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: After the war you -- you were a Zionist, and you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: -- these groups.</span> <span id="s980">And so your experience in Israel, did that sort of -- [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Cure me of Zionism?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: or --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: I guess I wasn’t enough of an idealist to stick it out.</span> <span id="s984">Life in a kibbutz was hard.</span> <span id="s985">Carla would have liked to stay.</span> <span id="s986">I opted for leaving Israel.</span> <span id="s987">She said she would have stayed.</span> <span id="s988">As a matter of fact, she once said that someone in the kibbutz, and I never found out who it was, some man had said, “Why don’t you stay with me?</span> <span id="s989">Let Ed go back to United States?”</span> <span id="s990">And she decided not to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Was that hard for both of you, that conversation about whether to go or stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Yeah, I’m not quite sure, you see, I’m not quite sure what happened there.</span> <span id="s993">I had this job -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: -- a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing, and this is tape three, side A.</span> <span id="s995">So we were just -- you were just on your way back from Holland to the United States.</span> <span id="s996">Pick -- We can pick up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s998">We came back, and of course now we had a daughter, and I started looking around for a job, and an apartment, and we -- we found that in the next village where -- from where we are right now, in Dobb’s Ferry.</span> <span id="s999">And I started a job with a -- with an instrument company.</span> <span id="s1000">Let’s see, a son -- we got a son.</span> <span id="s1001">He was born here in the -- in here, in the area, and we moved from an apartment in Dobb’s Ferry to this house in Hastings, 36 years ago.</span> <span id="s1002">In the meantime, I started going to school at night.</span> <span id="s1003">I went to Pratt Institute, and got a degree in Industrial design, and started working on Madison Avenue, and then got laid off there, because they ran out of work.</span> <span id="s1004">This is just about the time Kennedy got assassinated.</span> <span id="s1005">And then I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself.</span> <span id="s1006">And life went on, and Carla started going to school, and she graduated, and she -- she first went -- got a Bachelors, and then she got a Master’s from Columbia, and she became a Social Worker.</span> <span id="s1007">And was all -- that was a great accomplishment for us, because we had missed our education in a sense.</span> <span id="s1008">So now I was free-lancing, and then -- and I got a studio in New York City for awhile, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, in a prestigious building, and a -- we were very busy, and the kids were growing up, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1009">I thought that our life -- my life would be pretty well without surprises further on.</span> <span id="s1010">I looked at it -- I forget what birthday that was, but it’ll be my 40th -- my 40th would have -- would have been in ’66, right?</span> <span id="s1011">Born in ’26.</span> <span id="s1012">Anyway, somewhere, one of these birthdays, I said, “Well, I think I’ve seen it about.”</span> <span id="s1013">You know?</span> <span id="s1014">Sounds a little cynical, but I had a big birthday party, and at the end of the day I thought, probably it’s going to go on until my death wi -- about the same way, you know?</span> <span id="s1015">With working, and kids growing up and leaving the home, and so on and so forth, and -- and two things happened.</span> <span id="s1016">Actually, three things happened, but -- but the first one happened in -- let me see, I think 19 -- 19 -- 1980.</span> <span id="s1017">[inaudible] 1980?</span> <span id="s1018">1981.</span> <span id="s1019">My wife got involved with a couple of other ladies in setting up a -- something that hadn’t been done before, a special kind of meeting of people who had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s1020">And now, she was always involved in reading Holocaust literature, and especially Dutch is -- tr -- poetry, and stories written by Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1021">I never touched it.</span> <span id="s1022">My brother sent me the standard work in Holland, about the destruction of the Dutch Jewry, a two volume book, and it stood on the shelf.</span> <span id="s1023">I once looked, there were a couple of photographs in it, I was horrified, I put it back on the shelf, never touched it.</span> <span id="s1024">Anyway, in 1981, she started to organize this -- this business with -- but before that, there was an article in New York magazine, I’m sure she had -- she must have told you about all this -- was an article in New York magazine in which there was a -- a couple of stories, a bunch of stories of -- of hidden -- what they suddenly were called, hidden children, children who had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s1025">It hit the -- It hit the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the media, you know?</span> <span id="s1026">In short order, CBS, NBC, ABC, the magazines, Time, I don’t know, Newsweek, everybody wanted to know -- a new buzz word there was, hidden children, who had ever heard of hidden children?</span> <span id="s1027">Here we had been for 50 years surrounded -- now we -- we didn’t think about it ourselves.</span> <span id="s1028">Anyway, that’s the time we got in -- we got asked to be interviewed by the Holocaust museum, I guess, and in short order we -- I got onto all kinds of television programs.</span> <span id="s1029">I was on CNBC, we were -- the whole family was on ABC Good Morning America, and -- it was amazing -- amazing time.</span> <span id="s1030">Anyway, the conference was in sight.</span> <span id="s1031">It was on Memorial Day, 1981, I think.</span> <span id="s1032">And Carla said to me, “Are you coming to this conference?”</span> <span id="s1033">She had been very busy organizing this.</span> <span id="s1034">I had heard the news, you know, and -- and -- and I -- I think my -- a-answer was -- is -- is a classic by now, I -- I said, “Ah no, why should I come?</span> <span id="s1035">I mean, you will be busy, running around here -- there -- at the conference, and I’ll just be hanging out, you know, waiting til it’s over.”</span> <span id="s1036">“Well,” she said, “you know, my brother is especially coming from Israel, and he’ll be wandering around by himself.</span> <span id="s1037">Couldn’t you just come?”</span> <span id="s1038">And I said, “All right, all right.”</span> <span id="s1039">I’ve been married for many years, you learn when to -- when to be acquiescent, you know?</span> <span id="s1040">And so, there we gathered, on Memorial Day weekend, in -- on Times Square in the -- in the Marriott.</span> <span id="s1041">And I think it was Friday night when the first registration was supposed to be on, and I -- Carla was busy up there on the seventh floor.</span> <span id="s1042">They were -- They had the -- like, sort of places where you could register.</span> <span id="s1043">And I positioned myself between those windows, where people stood behind them, had all these kits for they -- for those who had registered, and the elevators.</span> <span id="s1044">Now the elevators i-i-in -- in that hotel are made out of glass, sort of.</span> <span id="s1045">They -- They -- They rise from -- from -- from the bottom on the -- in -- in an atrium.</span> <span id="s1046">And then, when they come to the floor, they open up, and they disgorge their people.</span> <span id="s1047">And I stood there, and I watched the elevators bringing up these people, these gray haired men and women, of all kinds of heights and sizes, and girth, and -- and then I saw them go to the -- to the windows there, where the volunteers of -- were standing, and they were getting their kits, and then they got the tags, and they put the tags on, and they wrote on there where -- who they were, and where they had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s1048">And I can’t -- to this day I cannot explain to you, but as they got -- started to crowd around on the floor, and I began to read their tags, sort of furtively, you know, I wasn’t with anyone, and they began to form groups and talk, and I looked at the tags, and the tags said, I was hidden in Belgium, I was hidden in France, I was hidden in Holland.</span> <span id="s1049">I came from Poland, I came from Romania.</span> <span id="s1050">And this -- very strange, but I began to cry.</span> <span id="s1051">I began to cry, and it was to me as if I always had believed that I was the only one who had been in hiding.</span> <span id="s1052">Is a thing so strange, I mean, I knew, you know.</span> <span id="s1053">I mean, my o -- my own brothers, and friends, and everybody had been -- but here they were, the hidden children, s -- 1600 of them.</span> <span id="s1054">And they crowded around, and they talked, and I just stood and looked at them, and I cried.</span> <span id="s1055">And they were suddenly like I had all these brothers and sisters, but of course, I had very little in common with most of them, sum -- you know.</span> <span id="s1056">There was very little in common between somebody who has been in hi -- in hiding in Poland, and somebody who has been hi -- in hiding in -- in France, let’s say, or in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1057">The situation w-were vastly different, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1058">And the conference started up, and Carla’s brother came, and we sat in the conference, 1600 people, we listened to Abe Foxman, you know, of the Anti-Defamation League, who was a hidden child.</span> <span id="s1059">And we listened to other people.</span> <span id="s1060">And I cried, and everybody cried.</span> <span id="s1061">I cried for three days.</span> <span id="s1062">Something magical happened there.</span> <span id="s1063">I, who had never read a book on the Holocaust, I suddenly was -- it was like, I don’t know, like my mind opened up suddenly to something that I could -- you asked me, did you t -- earlier, did you talk about the war, either in New Yor -- in -- in the Zionist organization or in the kibbutz?</span> <span id="s1064">Never a word.</span> <span id="s1065">Carla and I didn’t talk about the war with each other.</span> <span id="s1066">And it happened there.</span> <span id="s1067">It changed my life.</span> <span id="s1068">I -- It went on for three days, and wherever I went, I talked with people, and they talked to me, and I got to tell you funny thing, that people never stopped talking, and they couldn’t get enough of telling what happened to them, as if they had never -- as if -- as if they had never told it to anyone, you know.</span> <span id="s1069">Or maybe they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1070">It was -- It was so bad, I stood in the men’s room next to a guy -- next -- the -- the guy next to me in the urinal said to me, “So, where were you in hiding?”</span> <span id="s1071">And I said in Holland.</span> <span id="s1072">I said, “So where were you in hiding?”</span> <span id="s1073">He said, “I was in Poland.”</span> <span id="s1074">And we talked while we peed.</span> <span id="s1075">And even there, you didn’t stop talking with -- and -- and [indecipherable] what happened to me, and then we zipped up, and then we talked some more outside.</span> <span id="s1076">It was astounding.</span> <span id="s1077">It was an astounding experience.</span> <span id="s1078">And when it was over, three days later, we left, and it was as if I had suddenly acquired, you know, like 1600 sisters and brothers.</span> <span id="s1079">I didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s1080">Nobody wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s1081">There were people sitting downstairs in the lobby that -- that cried because it was over.</span> <span id="s1082">When you ask people today, who were at that conference, they all remember it exactly.</span> <span id="s1083">I was there.</span> <span id="s1084">I experienced it.</span> <span id="s1085">It was as if the door suddenly opened, after 50 years.</span> <span id="s1086">It was as if we were suddenly allowed to remember.</span> <span id="s1087">Anyway, I went home, it was very strange, as -- the car was in the garage downstairs, as I drove out, an enormous thunderstorm broke out over Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1088">The sky was blue with lightning every second, and the rain poured down, and it thundered b-between those buildings, it sounded -- it was like hell had broken loose, it was like God himself sort of thundered out on -- on us for -- you know, it was very strange.</span> <span id="s1089">Got home, started reading every -- every book, every pamphlet, every story I could lay my hands on.</span> <span id="s1090">And my life changed.</span> <span id="s1091">It -- It’s never been the same.</span> <span id="s1092">I became a speaker, became an interviewer for a -- Spielberg’s Shoah Foundation.</span> <span id="s1093">I -- I’m a-about the best speaker they have of the Hidden Child Foundation.</span> <span id="s1094">I spoke last month at the commemoration at the Supreme Court of New York state, to the judges and the lawyers.</span> <span id="s1095">It’s -- All this happened after that day.</span> <span id="s1096">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Let me ask you, based on -- on what has happened since then, and that you’ve become so involved, do you look back on all those years of not talking about it, and wonder why you and man -- and many others didn’t really discuss the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes, of course I have, and there’s all sorts of theories about it.</span> <span id="s1099">If you ask Carla, who is a Social Worker, and who psychologically knows much more than I do, you heard her say earlier, when we were talking about it, briefly, about needing four decades to -- to be able to talk about it, but that -- that still doesn’t -- I still don’t understand.</span> <span id="s1100">But th-the experience is -- I’m not the only one.</span> <span id="s1101">There are so many who said -- I’ve interviewed people myself, not hidden children, but the camp survivors, who said, “Ah, Mr. Lessing, this is the first time that I will be speaking about it.</span> <span id="s1102">I’ve never spoken about it like this with anyone else.”</span> <span id="s1103">What is it?</span> <span id="s1104">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1105">I -- I -- Really, I’m stupid, as far as that’s concerned, I have -- I have no idea why it took 50 years for me, but it -- for me there was a definite epiphany, that -- that moment there, I could look, I could take you to the place on that floor in the Marriott Marquis on Times Square, and say, here’s where I stood.</span> <span id="s1106">Here is where suddenly everything changed.</span> <span id="s1107">No, no, come back in another 10 years, maybe I’ll have an answer.</span> <span id="s1108">Maybe Carla had an answer, I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s1109">Anyway, I became quite active, slowly, not -- not immediately, but Carla, of course, had the -- became vice-president of The Hidden Child Foundation, and I -- I began to -- and she formed a group here in Westchester, and I decided that my forte was maybe writing some things, I have written little pieces, and I began to write a newsletter, every month I write a newsletter, there’s only two pages, but I love to write a little editorial for it, and I’ve written those, and -- and then later I started a newsletter, same thing, two page newsletter for The Hidden Child Foundation in New York, and that has a circulation of about 3,000 people, and that goes around, you know, the -- the whole New York region.</span> <span id="s1110">That’s my involvement, and the speaking -- the speaking involvement is much more intense.</span> <span id="s1111">I spoke to, I don’t know, maybe 15 - 20 places this -- during the Holocaust commemoration season, you know, these -- these speech days come in seasons.</span> <span id="s1112">Anyway, that was one -- one thing that changed my life.</span> <span id="s1113">Now, I got to go to something very important.</span> <span id="s1114">That was in 19 -- was that 1990, or 1991, the big [inaudible] 1991 -- 1981, I think.</span> <span id="s1115">In 1982, there was a decision that in -- of the Dutch Jews, that they would hold a conference for hidden children in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1116">And of course we were invited to come, and of course we decided, you know, we were hidden children from Holland, so Carla and I decided yes, we will go there.</span> <span id="s1117">Okay, tickets, airline tickets and so on, so forth, and -- about two months before -- about two months er -- before the conference, I decided that -- are you comfortable?</span> <span id="s1118">You could lean back, maybe, if that’s easier for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: No, that’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Are you okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: About a month and a half, or two months before conference in Amsterdam, I suddenly decided that I had actually never said enough -- given enough thanks to one man in Holland, who had helped me save my life.</span> <span id="s1123">I don’t know if you remember I talked to you about a police officer, Oskam, a great model of a naz -- Dutch Nazi, but he was really a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s1124">I thought, I wonder if Oskam is still li -- I didn’t know his name.</span> <span id="s1125">I wonder if that police officer is still alive.</span> <span id="s1126">And I couldn’t find his name in my mind.</span> <span id="s1127">I asked my brother Fred, who did all the interviews, he said, “Yeah, something like Boscamp, or something like that.”</span> <span id="s1128">Anyway, I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec -- documentation in Amsterdam, and said -- described the hut where I had been, and described Oskam, and I sent a little picture, a little photograph of Oskam, his wife, and their son, who was then three and a half, four years old, and sent it off to war document -- and asked them, is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp, or whatever his name is still alive, and I described him.</span> <span id="s1129">And I got a letter back that said, “No, we’re sorry, but that gentleman has died, and so -- his wife has also died.</span> <span id="s1130">But his son, Oskam junior is still alive, and he’s a retired plumber, and we sent your letter with the photograph, on to him.”</span> <span id="s1131">So I got a letter back from Oskam, junior.</span> <span id="s1132">And he said, “Mr. Lessing, I don’t know who you are, but I’m very grateful for the little photograph you sent me, I’ve never seen that photograph.”</span> <span id="s1133">Of course he hadn’t, because I had taken it just before I left for the United States.</span> <span id="s1134">And he said, “What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s1135">And I said to him, “I’m sorry your father died, but I would like to, when I come to Holland for the conference, I would like to get together with you, and talk about your father, he -- who saved my life, you know.”</span> <span id="s1136">And I got a letter back from him, it said, “Well listen, I was only four -- four, four and a half years old, and I don’t know much.</span> <span id="s1137">My father was a very closed man.</span> <span id="s1138">I -- I don’t know what to -- what I could tell you.”</span> <span id="s1139">And I said, “I don’t really care, but I would like to find out a little bit about your father, who was he, what -- what background did he come from.”</span> <span id="s1140">Suddenly, I -- it had to do with the whole hidden children business, too.</span> <span id="s1141">Suddenly I decided I must find out about what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1142">I must find out what happened to all the Jews during the Holocaust, and here was a chance.</span> <span id="s1143">So I wrote to him, we’re coming to Holland, and can we meet with you.</span> <span id="s1144">And he said, “Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s1145">I don’t know what I can do for you, but okay.”</span> <span id="s1146">We go on the plane, and we are 10 minutes away from Amsterdam airport Schiphol, and the captain comes on.</span> <span id="s1147">As they always do, it’s, “Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for flying KLM, we’ll be landing in 10 minutes in Schiphol, and don’t forget any of your stuff,” whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1148">And I burst out in crying -- crying, next to Carla.</span> <span id="s1149">I’m sobbing sitting there.</span> <span id="s1150">She said, “What happened, what’s the matter?”</span> <span id="s1151">I said, “This shit makes no sense at all, but when we land, when this plane land in Schiphol, I see at the end of the runway, there’s a line of black trucks, with SS, waiting for me, and they will kill me.”</span> <span id="s1152">A direct remembrance of the morning of the raid in the woods.</span> <span id="s1153">And she said, “Well, you know that that’s not true.”</span> <span id="s1154">I said, “I know that’s not true,” but that’s how I felt it.</span> <span id="s1155">It was like -- It was like I was right back there, you know?</span> <span id="s1156">Well, we wer -- We landed, of course, and my cousin was there with her little blue Honda, and of course the SS disappeared from my mind.</span> <span id="s1157">Anyway, the next day we meet Oskams, junior.</span> <span id="s1158">By this time I found out the name is Oskam, not Boscamp, and Oskam ju -- Oskam junior, who doesn’t look at all like his father, but he looks like his mother, you know, have a round face, and round body, and very jolly guy, and he’s a retired plumber, and then we meet him in this tiny little doll’s house, like they have in Holland.</span> <span id="s1159">The whole house fits about in this -- in this room, you know?</span> <span id="s1160">And they have the coffee, and the cake, as always in Holland, you know, you have to eat coffee, and you know, and big cakes with great almond paste in it, lovely.</span> <span id="s1161">And we sitting down, and we meet his wife, and -- so he said, “What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s1162">I said, “Well I -- I didn’t know who your father was, really, because it was all so secret.”</span> <span id="s1163">And he tells me a little bit about his father, and it comes out that Oskam came from a family of all Nazis, Dutch Nazis, and bad ones, anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1164">People who tried to discover where Jews were hidden, and found them, and -- and denounced them to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1165">The worst.</span> <span id="s1166">The whole family was one big heap of garbage, you know?</span> <span id="s1167">He was the only good one.</span> <span id="s1168">But because the whole family was so bad, his reputation was -- was bad -- for the Germans was excellent, because he came from this virulent Nazi family, they thought he was so too, and when -- when I show you a picture of him, he looks like it, like a Nazi in black uniform, and everything.</span> <span id="s1169">He was a good man.</span> <span id="s1170">Anyway, we’re talking, and he tells me about this br -- his father, and then -- and then I said, “Listen, did you know there was a hut in the woods not far from here?”</span> <span id="s1171">And he said, “Yes, I -- I knew that, my father told me that.”</span> <span id="s1172">I said, “Did you know who was in the hut?”</span> <span id="s1173">He said, “No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1174">My father didn’t tell me too much about it.”</span> <span id="s1175">I said, “You didn’t know that I was in there?”</span> <span id="s1176">He said, “No, I -- I don’t.”</span> <span id="s1177">He said to me, “Why are you asking me these questions?”</span> <span id="s1178">I said, “Well, I had this crazy idea,” -- all this comes after the revelations in 1991, the conference.</span> <span id="s1179">I -- I had to find out everything now.</span> <span id="s1180">I said, “I thought if maybe there were a group of men in there, and I probably saw them for the last time when they were alive.</span> <span id="s1181">And I thought maybe a brother or a sister, or maybe even a father or a mother might still be alive, and I could tell them at least, for that last morning, when we ran into the hut and warned them, and,” -- and he’s listening to me, and he says to me, “But Mr. Lessing, I just want to tell you something wrong with your story.”</span> <span id="s1182">I s -- And I thought, “What the hell does he know?</span> <span id="s1183">He was four years old at the time.”</span> <span id="s1184">I-I -- I said, “What do you mean there’s something wrong with my story?”</span> <span id="s1185">He said, “Well, I don’t know much what happened there,” he said, “but I know one thing.</span> <span id="s1186">Nobody was arrested that morning.</span> <span id="s1187">They all escaped.”</span> <span id="s1188">Now, you’ve got to realize, for 50 years I have lived with the idea, on and off, not every day, not every week, but at least once a month, I would think about the morning of the raid on the hut, and how we stormed in, my buddy and I, and warned the men, and pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, “It’s a raid, it’s the SS, get up, the Germans are here.”</span> <span id="s1189">And then, when we saw that they were all up and out and awake, we fled.</span> <span id="s1190">And always the question came up, we should have stayed, maybe.</span> <span id="s1191">We should have stayed with them, helped them more.</span> <span id="s1192">But then it went in my mind, then, not the seven that were there, but we would have been caught, too, and we’d have been killed.</span> <span id="s1193">This way, there were seven killed, at least two escaped.</span> <span id="s1194">And that went on through the years, this feeling of guilt that we -- I didn’t stay long enough.</span> <span id="s1195">I should have spent more time there.</span> <span id="s1196">I -- I -- So what?</span> <span id="s1197">I might have been killed with them, but -- but then that didn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1198">We did warn them, and you know, and we did our best, and so we couldn’t help it, you know, this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1199">And here this man tells me they all escaped.</span> <span id="s1200">So instead of being guilty of maybe not doing enough, it now comes out, I’ve actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives.</span> <span id="s1201">So, I come out of that conference with this man -- this man, and my cousin is there, and she says, “So, how was it?”</span> <span id="s1202">I said, “You can’t -- I can’t believe this.</span> <span id="s1203">The men whom I thought were killed, all survived.”</span> <span id="s1204">“God,” she says, “that’s amazing.</span> <span id="s1205">Who were they?”</span> <span id="s1206">I said, “He didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1207">I don’t know either.”</span> <span id="s1208">By the way, I should backtrack for one second.</span> <span id="s1209">At the beginning of the conference of my talk -- it is not a conference, but a talk with -- with Oskam junior, he said, “Mr. Lessing, I went into the basement to see if there’s anything I could find on my father, and you know, there were thousands of paper my father had gathered through the years.</span> <span id="s1210">They were all the old tickets that he had given to people,” you know, where you don’t have a -- you don’t have a na -- an a -- license plate in the back of your car, or people didn’t have a l -- a light on the front of their bicycle, and there were thousands of those tickets, or copies of tickets.</span> <span id="s1211">And he said, “I threw all those away.</span> <span id="s1212">I saved a few things,” and he came up with a picture.</span> <span id="s1213">“But,” he says, “I have something here, and it had -- was sent to my father by your mother.”</span> <span id="s1214">I said, “My mother?</span> <span id="s1215">From where?”</span> <span id="s1216">He says, “I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1217">It looks like from Africa someplace.</span> <span id="s1218">Algiers?”</span> <span id="s1219">He fishes out -- now this is 1992 I’m talking about, so it’s seven years ago, he digs out of there a postcard sent by my mother, to his father, saying that she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she doesn’t know what’s the mat -- what -- what happened to her husband and s -- and her -- and her three sons.</span> <span id="s1220">She wonder if they’re still alive.</span> <span id="s1221">Would he know something more?</span> <span id="s1222">And he hands me this postcard, it was like a postcard you get after somebody dies, and it reaches you.</span> <span id="s1223">It wasn’t addressed to me, but it was my mother’s, she had written it, you know?</span> <span id="s1224">She had typed it on the office typewriter there.</span> <span id="s1225">I have it here.</span> <span id="s1226">That’s how it started out already.</span> <span id="s1227">He says, “This something that interests you?”</span> <span id="s1228">I said, “What do you mean it interests me?</span> <span id="s1229">This is from my mother.</span> <span id="s1230">She sent it after she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she,” -- I don’t know, it’s amazing, anyway.</span> <span id="s1231">You see, life was full of surprises, and -- so anyway, as I said, my cousin said, “Do you know who was in the c -- in -- in that hut?”</span> <span id="s1232">I said no.</span> <span id="s1233">She said to me, “You know, there’s a radio program on here, comes on once a week, on Friday morning, it’s called Address Unknown, goes on the Catholic radio station, and they interview people, there’s a guy who interviews people, and -- who are sic -- looking for people they have lost years ago.”</span> <span id="s1234">I said, “Yeah, well, you know, I lost people 50 years ago.</span> <span id="s1235">Sh -- Who the hell would know?”</span> <span id="s1236">And she said, “Oh, you could try.”</span> <span id="s1237">So I call up the radio station, and I got a -- got the producer on the phone, and -- very nice lady, and she said -- I told -- I told her a little bit about this story, and she said, “That’s a fascinating story, Mr. Lessing.</span> <span id="s1238">Are you going to be here next month?”</span> <span id="s1239">I said, “No, I -- I’m here just for a conference, I’m -- got to go back to the United States.”</span> <span id="s1240">And, she said, “Ah, that’s too bad, because it takes us about a month to put program together, you know.</span> <span id="s1241">We have already,” and so on, so forth.</span> <span id="s1242">You probably know all about this, and -- okay, we went to the conference -- there’s something else I didn’t tell you, and I should tell you about it.</span> <span id="s1243">I don’t -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: This is a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing.</span> <span id="s1245">This is tape three, side B.</span> <span id="s1246">You were just talking about going back to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: I said, “No, I have to go back to the United States.”</span> <span id="s1248">And we went to the conference.</span> <span id="s1249">We went to visit a lady in Brussels who was -- played a part in a friend of mine’s life, and -- which I haven’t told you about, and I sort of should backtrack on that later, because it’s an important part also, what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1250">Anyway, we go to the conference, we come back to my cousin again, who lives in the center of Holland.</span> <span id="s1251">She lives, by the way, very close to where I had been in hiding in the -- in the hut, and where Oskam junior lives, that’s all around Utrecht, the area they’re in now.</span> <span id="s1252">So, she says, “Call the radio station, they’ve been calling here all -- all -- all the time.”</span> <span id="s1253">So I call them up, I get the producer upon the phone.</span> <span id="s1254">“Yeah, Mr. Lessing, we -- we -- we decided that your story is so fascinating.</span> <span id="s1255">Could you come next Friday morning?”</span> <span id="s1256">I said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s1257">So, Friday morning very early, Carla and I went to the radio station, and my cousin went also with us, and -- and I said to my -- said, “Carla,” I said, “this is a waste of time,” sit -- sitting there talking about something that happened 50 years ago, who the hell would remember an obscure hut in an obscure piece of wood somewhere in an obscure little village?”</span> <span id="s1258">You’re going to get that on.</span> <span id="s1259">So -- But we were there, and there’s a guy, he was sort of like -- you could say a little bit like, oh, the Letterman of the -- of the Dutch air waves, a very popular man.</span> <span id="s1260">Hans Frombilihamber, Hans Frombilihamber, should put his name in here.</span> <span id="s1261">And Hans seats me there, sits me down, and this is an hour program.</span> <span id="s1262">They make a break after the half hour, and then they gave our telephone number, and then people can call in if they have any -- have any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1263">Anyway, he interviews me, and I tell him the story about the hiding in the woods, and the -- the raid, and I tell him about finding Oskam junior back, and about the terrible surprise, or the wonderful surprise, to find out that I didn’t -- what say -- did do enough, that I helped those people -- to save seven people, to save their lives, and -- and -- and he makes a break, and they play some music, and then the program goes on, and at the end, he says, “Well, thank you very much,” and he -- “I’ll show you where we have the telephone.”</span> <span id="s1264">So we go back to a room, and they have a dozen telephones there, and they have six people.</span> <span id="s1265">And they do this every week, by the way, it’s been going on for years.</span> <span id="s1266">There’s six people, they take the telephone calls, and they write on slips whatever call comes in.</span> <span id="s1267">And so, I come there, and these dozen phones are ringing off the hook.</span> <span id="s1268">And they’ve got a little stack of slips already this big.</span> <span id="s1269">And they ask me, you know, as it goes on, as they’re writing it, “Is this something?”</span> <span id="s1270">And they hold it in front of me.</span> <span id="s1271">And there was very strange things.</span> <span id="s1272">There’s a -- “Yes, my -- my sister was in there, in the hut with a dog,” You know, I -- there’s all kinds of stupid things.</span> <span id="s1273">But, there was one -- th-there were several that were very interesting, one -- once -- one was -- said, “My brother was with you in the hut, but he is -- doesn’t live here any more in Holland, he i -- lives now in Indonesia, and he -- I’m sure he would love to hear from you.”</span> <span id="s1274">His name on -- Herman Mueninghof.</span> <span id="s1275">Okay, I don’t know Herman Mueninghof, you know, but might be true.</span> <span id="s1276">And a little later, another message comes in, it says, “I was with you in the hut, and I’m listening to this broadcast, and I live right around the corner from the radio station.</span> <span id="s1277">Please come and visit me afterwards.”</span> <span id="s1278">Lou Fontichilin.</span> <span id="s1279">I don’t know Lou Fontichilin, but it says he was there.</span> <span id="s1280">So anyway, we got -- the phone keeps on ringing, and finla -- finally it dies down, and -- and I got this big stack of p-pieces of paper, and they -- not only -- that -- that’s not where it stops for them, any messages that are important, they research, no matter where they are.</span> <span id="s1281">They go all over the world, find these people, and make contact with them.</span> <span id="s1282">Okay, so it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1283">We get into my cousin’s little blue Honda, and we go around the corner, and I ring the door of an apartment house, and this huge woman comes out, and throws her arms around me, and says, “Eddie, I didn’t think you would make it.”</span> <span id="s1284">I said, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s1285">She said, “Don’t you remember me?”</span> <span id="s1286">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1287">She says, “My name was Perk.”</span> <span id="s1288">Her secret name was Perk during the war, “But,” she says, “I kept it.</span> <span id="s1289">Cut me -- Call me Perk Fontichilar.</span> <span id="s1290">And I remember you very well,” she says.</span> <span id="s1291">“I used to be courier for the underground.”</span> <span id="s1292">Vaguely I began to remember something.</span> <span id="s1293">She says, “Come, Lou wants to meet you.”</span> <span id="s1294">Leads me into the living room, and there’s an old man sitting, with white hair, but I immediately recognized him as one of the men I had left behind that morning.</span> <span id="s1295">Ah, we cried, and we hugged, and we did, and -- I tell you, it was like -- couldn’t believe it, that all this was happening.</span> <span id="s1296">Well, finally we settled down, and his wife brought some coffee, of course, and -- and we talked about the morning, and he said he ran away in his pajamas, and -- and without shoes, and everyone managed to get out.</span> <span id="s1297">I said, “Lou, who were the people who were in the hut?”</span> <span id="s1298">And he said, “Well, I have some photographs that I took in the hut.”</span> <span id="s1299">I said, “You do?”</span> <span id="s1300">He said, “Yes, I’ll show you.”</span> <span id="s1301">And he -- his wife brought out a box of photographs, and there was photographs with all the men in the hut, and not only that, but also the Canadian, and the Englishman, the flyers from the RAF on there.</span> <span id="s1302">But I wasn’t on there.</span> <span id="s1303">And he said, “But I also have a picture of you.”</span> <span id="s1304">I says, “You do?”</span> <span id="s1305">And yes, and he came out with a photograph of -- of me standing in the hut, cynical young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Can you describe it for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Well, what you’re seeing here is -- looking at the bunk beds, the upright posts are made from pine trees that were cut by the men, and you can see there’s an upper bunk, somebody’s si-sitting on there eating a sandwich, and there’s a lower bunk, where somebody’s eating an apple, or something like that, and I’m leaning against one of the posts of the bed, in shorts, and a woolen jacket, and I’m looking directly into the camera.</span> <span id="s1308">I’m the -- this man that I was talking with, had taken this photograph.</span> <span id="s1309">It was taken in the fall of 1943, before the hut was raided.</span> <span id="s1310">Now, I said to Lou -- and he described all the men, and their names.</span> <span id="s1311">So now I knew who had been in the hut.</span> <span id="s1312">And then I ask him the final question, I said, “Lou, everything is revealed except one thing.</span> <span id="s1313">Who was my buddy, who was my partner that morning, who stood guard with me that morning, who escaped?</span> <span id="s1314">Who was the man who my mother gave her bicycle to, and -- and the flashlight?”</span> <span id="s1315">And he said, “I don’t know, don’t you know?”</span> <span id="s1316">I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s1317">He said, “Don’t you remember anything of him?”</span> <span id="s1318">I said, “I seem to remember a man who was a shoemaker in the regular life.”</span> <span id="s1319">And he said, “Oh, well, he wasn’t a shoemaker, his father was a shoemaker, and his name was,” -- I said, “What was his name?”</span> <span id="s1320">He says, “His name was Jan Carman, Jan Carman.”</span> <span id="s1321">So now I knew who had been my buddy.</span> <span id="s1322">I said, “Where is he, what happened to him?”</span> <span id="s1323">He said, “Ed, I don’t think you’re -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me that morning.</span> <span id="s1324">We fled together.”</span> <span id="s1325">I said, “Lou, it can’t be, he was with me.</span> <span id="s1326">I think your memory must be mixed up.”</span> <span id="s1327">He said, “Well, maybe it is, you know, it’s years ago, and I’m old, and,” -- I said, “What happened to Jan Carman?”</span> <span id="s1328">He said, “He was with me three weeks later, we were raided in -- in unrelated raid on a house with Jews, and he was -- he was taken, and he was executed in the dunes.</span> <span id="s1329">And he is buried in the cemetery for the martyrs, the -- of the Resistance, in Holland.”</span> <span id="s1330">So the picture changed again.</span> <span id="s1331">The man who were de -- who I thought were dead, were -- had -- had lived, the two who had escaped, one -- one had been caught, and was -- was executed.</span> <span id="s1332">So, with that, I went one more -- once more back with -- with Oskam junior, to the place where the hut had been.</span> <span id="s1333">And then I knew 50 years had gone by, because where there had been an impenetrable wood of young pine trees, now there was a forest you could look right through, with tall pine trees, and you could walk right through it.</span> <span id="s1334">It poured that morning.</span> <span id="s1335">It rained cats and dogs.</span> <span id="s1336">I had a yellow slicker, and one of these plastic coats over me, and it poured, it was a dismal day.</span> <span id="s1337">And we went to where the hut had been, and the only thing there was was a slight depression in the ground.</span> <span id="s1338">I tried to find a splinter of wood, a little piece of glass, something to take back, and there was nothing.</span> <span id="s1339">And then finally he took me to the edge of the wood, where I stood that morning and watched the Germans come, and I stood there in the rain, and they distanced themselve a little bit -- there was some more people there.</span> <span id="s1340">There were people from the -- the -- the nursing home next door.</span> <span id="s1341">Anyway -- and I stood there, at the same place where I had stood that -- you know.</span> <span id="s1342">And you know, it’s weird, and it sound very dramatic, but it -- I stood there, and it was almost as if I could hear tires coming up again, up on the road.</span> <span id="s1343">It was scary, it was scary being there.</span> <span id="s1344">Must have been a little bit like Holocaust survivors going back to Auschwitz, you know?</span> <span id="s1345">Anyway, there is -- there’s too much to tell, because it’s all in little details, there -- the ones who had given us food during the days when we were in the hut, were the nuns next door.</span> <span id="s1346">Next to the wood was a fence, and then next to that, there was a -- what do they call that, where nuns live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: A convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: The convent.</span> <span id="s1349">And the sisters at the convent, every day put food next to the fence, and we had cut a hole in it, and I would -- was one of the persons who was designated to bring the food to the hut.</span> <span id="s1350">In the meantime, it had been converted from a convent to a nursing home for older nuns, and for other Catholics, and these people had heard the broadcast.</span> <span id="s1351">They had never known what had happened next door to them.</span> <span id="s1352">And so, I was invited to come to there, and we did that, and then I met some people who had been -- that same day had been incarcerated by the SS, who had just been caught hanging around.</span> <span id="s1353">The gardener, for instance, of the grounds of the convent had been -- he had come to see what was going on, he was thrown in jail.</span> <span id="s1354">The Mother Superior, they had knocked on the door of the convent, and when she opened the door, they said, “We want to come in,” and -- the SS said, and she had said, “You have nothing to li -- look for here,” and they slapped her in the face, and she fell on the ground, and they walked right over her, and threw her in jail for three months, also.</span> <span id="s1355">And Oskam, the policeman, was found walking around with a gun, which he was allowed to have, but in civilian clothes, because he had heard about the raid.</span> <span id="s1356">And they took him in for awhile, he came back three weeks later, emaciated, and beaten up, and all this stuff was coming out of what had happened that day.</span> <span id="s1357">Anyway, it was time to go back to the United States.</span> <span id="s1358">I came -- I had -- I had a bunch of photographs from Lou, and I had made a whole slew of new friends from the radio station, and -- and from, you know, the people, and it was all wonderful.</span> <span id="s1359">And so Carla and I went back, and I settled down here, in this room, and I’m sitting right here working, in December, 1992, I get a call.</span> <span id="s1360">“Hi, this is Hans Frontikel in Holland, from the radio station, remember me, I’m -- I interviewed you?”</span> <span id="s1361">I said, “Yeah, how you doing, Hans?”</span> <span id="s1362">“Fine.</span> <span id="s1363">I wonder if you could come to Holland, I have a TV program, and we’re going to do a half an hour on the -- the Dutch Resistance, and also about the Jewish persecution, and I thought you, being involved in both, maybe I could interview you again, but now on television.”</span> <span id="s1364">I said, “Yeah, well that’s very nice, but I don’t have a budget to go for 20 minutes to Amsterdam.”</span> <span id="s1365">“Oh no,” he said, “we pay your flight, and we pay your hotels and everything.”</span> <span id="s1366">I said, “I’ll be there.”</span> <span id="s1367">And so all of a sudden I found myself back in s -- in December, and this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1368">H-Hans, my interviewer send his -- wh-what is it called, his -- the guy you -- an -- an editor.</span> <span id="s1369">Tall guy, and he said, “Ed, I would like to go over the story once more with you, just quickly, for the interview, the day after tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s1370">I said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s1371">I said, “First of all,” -- no, I -- I -- I -- I said, “Okay, but,” I said, “you know the story.”</span> <span id="s1372">“Yeah, we sed -- like to -- tell me a little bit shortly, again.”</span> <span id="s1373">And so I said, “Well,” [indecipherable], it was in the camp, and [indecipherable] you know, and we got raided, and I was -- was out with a buddy, and” -- and he said, “Do you know who your buddy was?”</span> <span id="s1374">I said, “Well, I didn’t know in August, but now I’ve heard that it was a cert -- a -- a certain Jan Carman.”</span> <span id="s1375">And they said, “What happened to him?”</span> <span id="s1376">And he said -- I -- I -- I s -- I said, “He was shot in the dunes.</span> <span id="s1377">He is buried, and,” I said, “I visited his grave yesterday.”</span> <span id="s1378">I had in the mean time, gone to the graveyard of the Resistance people, and there I cried over Jan’s grave, and -- and -- Tong was his name, Tong, the editor.</span> <span id="s1379">He said, “Okay,” he said, “now, the day after tomorrow, I’ll come and pick you up, and first we’ll go to the museum of the Dutch Resistance.”</span> <span id="s1380">I said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s1381">“Oh,” he said, “well, I want to show you a film there, and,” -- okay.</span> <span id="s1382">So, we went there, and I sat there, and this was in the former synagogue, and so I sat there, and I watched this film, which seemed like an old film, it didn’t seem -- I said, “Why are you showing me this?”</span> <span id="s1383">“Well,” he said, “I was told to do this,” and I couldn’t figure it out, you know?</span> <span id="s1384">Anyway, when it was over, we went to the TV studio, and there on the set was a nice thick couch, and on the end of the couch was a little Christmas tree, cause the program was going to be aired on -- on Christmas day.</span> <span id="s1385">And it was a live audience.</span> <span id="s1386">Oskam junior and his wife was there, and my cousin with her husband were there, and as -- my second cousin from -- from The Hague come over.</span> <span id="s1387">And I was alone, Carla hadn’t come with me ya -- you know.</span> <span id="s1388">So, the lights went on, and there was Hans with a nice Christmas tie, and me, in little -- nice little Jewish boy, sitting next to a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s1389">So, by then I had been on TV a couple of times, and I had some idea, you know, I was here on channel 13, and I’ve been there with CNBC, and a couple other places, and -- and so I sort of knew what the routine was, you know, and the interviewer asks the questions, and you give the right answers, you know, and don’t embarrass anybody, and you don’t be idiot, you know.</span> <span id="s1390">So, he said, “Mr. Lessing, many will remember you from this summer, when I interviewed you on radio, but now here you are again, and I want to ask you a few questions.”</span> <span id="s1391">And so he asked me where I was during the war.</span> <span id="s1392">I said I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s1393">And where were you in hiding?</span> <span id="s1394">I -- Well, I was, among other places, was in this hut.</span> <span id="s1395">And what happened?</span> <span id="s1396">Well, we were raided.</span> <span id="s1397">And -- And the interview went along fine, you know, standardized.</span> <span id="s1398">By then I got a little bit, shall I say, blasé about the whole thing, you know?</span> <span id="s1399">But it was fun to be there, and -- and he said, “So, Mr. Lessing, what happened?”</span> <span id="s1400">I said, “Well, we stood guard, a buddy of mine, and -- and -- and I, and we happened to see the Germans coming, and we went back and warned the others, and,” -- he said, “Do you know who your buddy was?”</span> <span id="s1401">I said, “Well yes, he is Jan Carman, and he -- I visited his grave yesterday, and he got executed by the Germans, near the dunes in Holland.”</span> <span id="s1402">And then he said something that did not fit in the thing, and he said, “Mr. Lessing, I want to tell you that we have received a part of a diary of the man -- your buddy, your partner who stood guard with you that morning, describing that morning, the raid, and everything, just like you tell it.”</span> <span id="s1403">And I thought for a second, and I thought, he is wrong, that can’t be.</span> <span id="s1404">Cause Jan Carman’s date on his grave says he was -- he was executed in February, 1945 -- 1944, and we were raided on the 29th of December, 1943.</span> <span id="s1405">There had only been a couple of weeks in between, and he was on the run all the time, I knew that from Lou.</span> <span id="s1406">So I thought this -- something -- something is screwed up here, and -- but, you know, live audience, you’re not going to -- so I said, “Oh.”</span> <span id="s1407">And then he said something that really chilled me to the bone.</span> <span id="s1408">He said, “Mr. Lessing, I want to tell you that the man who was with you that morning, who stood guard with you then, was here -- is here to talk with you.”</span> <span id="s1409">And I became ice cold, and I thought, I just visited his grave, and the dead don’t rise from the grave, and -- and he is so fucked up here, you know with this, I’m sorry, excuse my language, but I didn’t know what to think.</span> <span id="s1410">And a light went on on the far end of the stage, and this man walks out, tall man, who I’d seen in the photographs, who was described to me as the man who lived in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s1411">And out walks this man, Herman Mueninghof.</span> <span id="s1412">And he walks over to me, and he grabs my hand, and he said, “Eddie, I’m so glad you’re alive.”</span> <span id="s1413">And I said, “Herman, it’s wonderful.”</span> <span id="s1414">I said, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1415">He said, “The TV people brought me here.”</span> <span id="s1416">I said, “All the way from Indonesia?”</span> <span id="s1417">I said, “What do you do there?”</span> <span id="s1418">He said, “I’m a Catholic bishop, and I live in New Guinea.”</span> <span id="s1419">I said, “But why are you here?”</span> <span id="s1420">He said, “They wanted me to meet you.”</span> <span id="s1421">I said, “That’s wonderful,” I said.</span> <span id="s1422">He said, “You don’t seem to remember that -- how we stood guard together that morning.</span> <span id="s1423">You don’t -- don’t you remember how we -- how your mother saved our lives?</span> <span id="s1424">How your mother, that night, gave me her bicycle, and the flashlight?”</span> <span id="s1425">And all of a sudden I realized I was wrong.</span> <span id="s1426">It -- It wasn’t the other man, it was this man, this bishop, this Catholic bishop, Herman Mueninghof.</span> <span id="s1427">And again the picture changed.</span> <span id="s1428">The -- Again we -- the two of -- two of us had survived, and the others had survived also, the only one who had not survived was this poor Jan Carman, who had been in the hut, who I had remembered vaguely.</span> <span id="s1429">And we talked, and we cried, and this just -- I said -- he said to me, “Your mother saved -- saved our lives.”</span> <span id="s1430">I said, “Yes, I know.”</span> <span id="s1431">He said, “No, you don’t.”</span> <span id="s1432">I said, “What do you mean I don’t?”</span> <span id="s1433">He said, “Do you remember how your mother gave me her bike, and a little flashlight?”</span> <span id="s1434">I said, “Yes, I do remember.</span> <span id="s1435">You went out, you -- you pedaled away in -- in the darkness.”</span> <span id="s1436">He said, “I hadn’t gone more than two minutes away when a German sprang out in the middle of -- of the road -- the path, and said, halt, get off the bike, stand against the wall.”</span> <span id="s1437">There was a little pumphouse there.</span> <span id="s1438">He said, “And I stood against the wall, with my face to the wall, and he frisked me from top to bottom, to feel if I had any weapons.</span> <span id="s1439">If your mother hadn’t told us to bury the weapons that we had, our -- our nine millimeter Mausers,” he said, “they would have shot me, probably, on -- on the spot.”</span> <span id="s1440">I said, “What happened then?”</span> <span id="s1441">He said, “I don’t know where I got the guts, but I said, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s1442">Why are you stopping me like this?”</span> <span id="s1443">And the German said, “I know you’re one of these -- these terrorists from the hut.”</span> <span id="s1444">And Herman said, “What hut?</span> <span id="s1445">I don’t know any hut.</span> <span id="s1446">What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s1447">And he said, “Yes, don’t deny it, you’re one of the terrorists from the hut.</span> <span id="s1448">We have orders to arrest you all, and we’ll get you.”</span> <span id="s1449">He said, “I have no idea what y,” -- he said, “I come from night school.”</span> <span id="s1450">He says, “You come from night school, what?</span> <span id="s1451">Where night school?”</span> <span id="s1452">He says, “I come from night school in Zeist, and,” -- he said, “What are you studying there?”</span> <span id="s1453">He said, “I’m studying to be a Notary Public,” which was true, Herman was studying to be a Notary Public.</span> <span id="s1454">And he said -- and he said, “I felt that the guy, what he really wanted, was the little flashlight.”</span> <span id="s1455">Now this wasn’t an ordinary flashlight, it was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war.</span> <span id="s1456">It was made by Philips.</span> <span id="s1457">It was a little hand generator, you squeezed it, and it made light.</span> <span id="s1458">And in a time that there were absolutely no batteries any more, these things were worth gold.</span> <span id="s1459">People would buy -- pay hundreds of gilders to get one.</span> <span id="s1460">And the guy wanted this, you know, it was worth something to him.</span> <span id="s1461">And Herman was very smart, he says, “I thought that if he arrested me, he would have to hand everything over to his superior officer, but if he let me go, he could keep the flashlight.</span> <span id="s1462">So he -- I said to him, give me the bike, the bike is no good to you, it’s solid tires.”</span> <span id="s1463">He said, “What I -- M-My mother is waiting with dinner, you know.”</span> <span id="s1464">And he said, “I could see the guy thinking, and then he said, “Nah, alza gazie, go.”</span> <span id="s1465">And he said, “I got on the bike, and I pedaled away.</span> <span id="s1466">And if it hadn’t been for your mother telling us to drop the weapons and bury them,” he says, “I wouldn’t be here.”</span> <span id="s1467">Another surprise.</span> <span id="s1468">There was no end to the -- to the surprises.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Let me ask you some general questions, because it’s interesting how you talk about the picture changing, and even over the last 10 years, all this information that you’ve now learned from, you know, about ha -- what happened 50 years ago, can you just talk just generally about what it’s been like for the last decade, to revisit the history, and have it all change, you know, fill in all those holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Wh-What about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Just what that experience is like, to -- to now, all this time later, be learning the history of what you went through?</span> <span id="s1472">A: It’s a little bit like being hungry, and never really having enough to eat.</span> <span id="s1473">It’s a weird thing to say, I guess.</span> <span id="s1474">I am daily still trying to find out what happened, not exactly to me, but what happened to -- to the Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s1475">I read articles, I -- my cousin send -- the same cousin with her little blue Honda, sends me, almost weekly, articles from the Dutch newspapers describing the things that had happened in Holland.</span> <span id="s1476">The money that’s missing, the paintings that were stolen.</span> <span id="s1477">The -- The archive of -- of -- of -- of name cards that was found recently, abandoned by the Dutch government, somewhere in -- in it -- on the third floor.</span> <span id="s1478">All these things still are filling out my picture of what happened in Holland, to the Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s1479">Every new book that comes out, I immediately buy, and they send me from Holland, in Dutch, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1480">That story seems to never be completely complete.</span> <span id="s1481">There’s always new -- seem to be new little things coming out.</span> <span id="s1482">Because it’s impossible to remember two and a half years, every minute of it.</span> <span id="s1483">So, I found out some of the things, and -- and -- but there’s still the desire to find out exactly where was I, what did I think, what happened?</span> <span id="s1484">It’s an ongoing thing, it will go on til the end of my life now, because the -- the -- the clarific -- it -- it’s like -- it’s like troubled water that slowly becomes clarified, more and more and more and more, who we were then, what we were, what we did, why did I do this, why did I?</span> <span id="s1485">So, that’s the best that I can tell you, it -- it is a need to find out, still.</span> <span id="s1486">And it all started in that God damn moment there, on that seventh floor of that hotel.</span> <span id="s1487">It all started there.</span> <span id="s1488">It’s very strange.</span> <span id="s1489">It was time to go home.</span> <span id="s1490">I got on the plane, very, very tired, because so much has been revealed to me now again.</span> <span id="s1491">And I got back to JFK, to the JFK airport in New York, and Carla was waiting for me there.</span> <span id="s1492">And she said, “Well, how did it go?”</span> <span id="s1493">I said, “I got to tell you something.</span> <span id="s1494">It’s very strange, but for a Jewish boy like me, has now ha -- I have a friend who is a Catholic bishop in New Guinea, in Indonesia.”</span> <span id="s1495">I subsequently asked Herman to send me the complete diary, and when I got it there were pages missing.</span> <span id="s1496">And I send him a letter, and I said -- I call him Herman, I don’t -- don’t call him Your Holiness, or Your Worship, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1497">Or bishop.</span> <span id="s1498">And I said, “Herman, where are the pa -- missing pages, again?”</span> <span id="s1499">He said, “There were things in there that were not so nice.”</span> <span id="s1500">I said, “I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1501">I want -- would like to know.”</span> <span id="s1502">And he send me the pages.</span> <span id="s1503">There were remarks made by the members of the Resistance in the hut, about Jews not being reliable enough, you couldn’t trust them with your life.</span> <span id="s1504">I mean, this is -- this is ironic.</span> <span id="s1505">They had this 17 year old Jewish kid, he was not in the Resistance, he was just in hiding.</span> <span id="s1506">They didn’t really want him in the hut, but Oskam, who was very influence -- influential in that area for the Resistance, and he was pivotal for them, had asked them to take in this Jewish kid, and so they had to take him in.</span> <span id="s1507">But it wasn’t -- there were several members who said, “Well, we ca -- we can’t really trust him, you know?”</span> <span id="s1508">What is so superiorally ironic is that I later on saved the God damn lives of these men.</span> <span id="s1509">I mean, it’s interesting how things evolve.</span> <span id="s1510">Let me see.</span> <span id="s1511">You don’t want to go forever with this -- with this -- are you running out of tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: This -- This tape is about to end [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Okay, then let’s -- this is a good --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: Let’s stop for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: This is the continuation of an interview with Ed -- with Ed Lessing, and this is tape four, side A. And we were just going to talk in general, sort of, thinking about how you’re a different person than you might have been without the experiences you went through during the war.</span> <span id="s1517">Let’s first start in terms of religion, cause you had mentioned during -- during the war that you had made that promise to continue -- you made a promise to God to continue with religion, I wonder if you’d talk about that, a-and how that didn’t work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: They say that in the -- in the first World War, I guess, that in the trenches, every -- every soldier becomes religious, and prays.</span> <span id="s1519">And in a sense that’s, I guess, what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1520">And my mother would have certainly approved of it when I s -- when I said that -- I promised God that I would try to keep his -- the laws he had given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and in the desert, that I would follow them all my life, if he would just spare my family.</span> <span id="s1521">And they survived.</span> <span id="s1522">And I held on for years afterward, in this country, I would -- I had my own kind of Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s1523">On Yom Kippur, I would take a prayer book -- no, I wouldn’t -- not -- not a prayer book, I would take the Old Testament, and I would go out to the Hudson river, and I’d sit there all day long, and I’d fast, and I read.</span> <span id="s1524">I read about the Jews, and their history, and the battles, and King David, and King Solomon, and all the wonderful stories of the Old Testament, and of my people.</span> <span id="s1525">But at -- again, as I began to find out what the Holocaust really had -- had been, it all seemed -- religion seemed like a farce.</span> <span id="s1526">God had taken his own people, and murdered one and a half -- let the Germans murder one and a half million of his own children, little children, innocents.</span> <span id="s1527">It didn’t make any sense.</span> <span id="s1528">Like so many other Holocaust survivors, I guess, there was no thinking of God after Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1529">And so I slowly, slowly left it all.</span> <span id="s1530">I became -- I read more, and more, and more, and none -- none of it pointed to the existence of -- of God.</span> <span id="s1531">It all pointed out to the -- to the terrible things that human beings can do.</span> <span id="s1532">So, religion became not important any more to me.</span> <span id="s1533">What did become more and more important, though, is the fate of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1534">I am very fervent in my defense of the j -- of the Jewish people, as a most marvelous, marvelous people.</span> <span id="s1535">Difficult people.</span> <span id="s1536">Moses knew that already, goes up for a couple of days on the mountains, come back, and they already screwed it up, they made a golden calf.</span> <span id="s1537">There’s a lesson there.</span> <span id="s1538">I mean, the J-Jews are difficult, and they are impossible, but they’re also genius, they are the salt of the earth.</span> <span id="s1539">And to me, the Jewish people in Israel, they’re -- our country, I mean, this is all miraculous, after 2,000 years.</span> <span id="s1540">Jews have waited for this, and we’ve got a country.</span> <span id="s1541">And I thank God.</span> <span id="s1542">We have worked -- We have gone there for five years at least, and given our lives to it.</span> <span id="s1543">It was well worth it.</span> <span id="s1544">So, religion is sort of evolved into a fervent nationalism, and -- and a defense of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1545">I will accept no blame whatsoever to Israel, what they do, or whatever they do.</span> <span id="s1546">It’s -- I’m like the old fashioned English -- Englishman, you know?</span> <span id="s1547">My country -- Or maybe it was an American, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1548">I think it was an Englishman who said, my country right or wrong.</span> <span id="s1549">To me, the -- the security of the Jewish people is uppermost, and it sounds horrendous, but if it would be necessary to throw every Arab out of -- out of Israel in order to secure it’s -- it’s -- the safety of it’s people, I’d say, don’t hesitate, do it.</span> <span id="s1550">We have suffered for 2,000 years, murder and mayhem.</span> <span id="s1551">I mean hangings, burnings, it’s horrible, the whole Jewish history is -- is one of -- of -- of suffering.</span> <span id="s1552">Enough.</span> <span id="s1553">Now it’s our time.</span> <span id="s1554">And so, I guess, my religion became really my love for -- for my people.</span> <span id="s1555">And it’s difficult sometimes you know?</span> <span id="s1556">I -- We had to -- Carla has two grand -- had a grandnephew here, very nice young man who worked for the Israeli embassy here, and he came with his girlfriend, and they stayed here for three months upstairs in a little room.</span> <span id="s1557">And we had this -- we had this conversation, and they said, “Oh, we don’t -- we don’t give a damn for politics in Israel, it’s horrible.</span> <span id="s1558">We don’t want to know anything about politics, and we don’t want to -- and I think we should give the land back to the -- to the -- to the Palestinians, or whoever, and th-the Syrians, and -- and we don’t want to be involved in this.”</span> <span id="s1559">And I -- These were the people I admire, these are the sabbers, the people who are born there, and I said, “Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s1560">Let me give you at least a view of a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1561">We had no country, we had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s1562">There was no way out, they murdered us by the millions.”</span> <span id="s1563">I said, “The Jewish people suffered unbelievably, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1564">Now there’s a country, and you are our hope.”</span> <span id="s1565">I said, “The first thing for us as -- as survivors, is a security, a safe haven, where Jews can go, where Jews can be defended.</span> <span id="s1566">So don’t say that you’re not interested, please.”</span> <span id="s1567">And they understood.</span> <span id="s1568">So, I don’t know if that’s an answer for your question, but that’s as close as I can come.</span> <span id="s1569">Religion is no longer of an -- any importance to me at this point, but the fate of my people is, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Let me ask you about the -- the interviews that your brother Fred did with -- with the family.</span> <span id="s1571">First of all, when did -- when did that happen, did that start to begin this process of being interested in [indecipherable] this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: With my brother?</span> <span id="s1573">It -- Can you hold on a second?</span> <span id="s1574">I’ll get the book --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: -- and show you the dates, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Oh, so tell me what this is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: This is a box, which is about -- as you can see, about 12 to 15 inches long, and it holds audio tapes that my brother did with the whole family.</span> <span id="s1579">Underdark means diving under, going into hiding.</span> <span id="s1580">The family’s recollection of the Holocaust years, and there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 tapes, and everybody that I know is like -- Carla, my wife, and Hans, my cousin, Carla -- Fred, my brother.</span> <span id="s1581">Aba is my brother Art, who changed his name to Aba at some point.</span> <span id="s1582">Me, Ed, Lene, my mother.</span> <span id="s1583">Lene and Art is my father and -- my mother and father, and my father.</span> <span id="s1584">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Transcription.</span> <span id="s1587">No, it doesn’t give -- has a wonderful preface, by the way, and the first interview, I think was probably 1979.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: So, these interviews began long before your process of realizing that this was important to go back, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Well, not so -- not so long, a couple of years before, yes.</span> <span id="s1590">We had -- The first interview, with my mother is really -- I would love to write a play around it, a one act play, maybe.</span> <span id="s1591">It is an interview that is at the same time serious, I’ve quoted some of it to you, and it’s also hilarious, because everybody is sitting around a round table, and it’s not just the -- it started out as a regular interview with my mother, but it finally -- everybody threw in their two cents worth, there are interruptions, and -- and -- and my father says I -- should I bring the dog to the vet tomorrow?</span> <span id="s1592">And it’s like -- it’s a wonderful interview, I would love to see it on stage, as a beginning of my mother’s story.</span> <span id="s1593">So, the other dates, I -- I -- I don’t know if you want to know them all, but [indecipherable] has -- he transcribed this, by the way, with his son Ben, who doesn’t know any Dutch, and half of my mother’s story is in Dutch.</span> <span id="s1594">[indecipherable] I’ll just give you another date.</span> <span id="s1595">Oh, this is even earlier, 1985.</span> <span id="s1596">He interviewed my father at 1985.</span> <span id="s1597">And he interviewed me, I’ll do the last one, okay?</span> <span id="s1598">He interviewed me in 1983, and my -- my other brother even later, I think.</span> <span id="s1599">Did I answer your question, or did I digress again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: [indecipherable] Another question I would ask, from the -- your interview, you talked a lot about going back to therapy, and sort of looking back at that time, and I wanted to sort of ask, not a specific question, but how that process has sort of changed your other views, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: The therapy?</span> <span id="s1602">Oh, night and day.</span> <span id="s1603">About 25 years ago, I had ulcer symptoms, and I went to my mem -- my -- my house doctor, and -- that’s a typical Dutch translation, isn’t it, my house doctor?</span> <span id="s1604">I don’t know what they call it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Family doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Yeah, family doctor.</span> <span id="s1607">In Holland they say your house doctor.</span> <span id="s1608">Every once in awhile I catch myself with these Dutch translations.</span> <span id="s1609">And he said, “Well, you know you -- you have to get an -- undergo a G.I. series, you -- you have like ulcer symptoms, you may have an ulcer.</span> <span id="s1610">Anyway, it came out I didn’t have an ulcer yet, but I was very close, and he said -- he recommended that I go to a clinic in a hospital nearby, where it -- for very cheap, and you could get therapy, you know, but -- and it was -- c-could be seen by a -- so I contacted a -- a doctor there, and he said -- and when he found out that I was a Holocaust survivor -- that was just sort of be -- people began to be aware that there was something special with people who have come through that, and -- and I started going every -- once a week to this -- to this clinic.</span> <span id="s1611">Unfortunately, after awhile, that doctor couldn’t see me any more, but he recommended me to another doctor, Doctor Hillel Swiller, and I went to him for about -- one of the first sessions I had with him, I said, “Look, I want to tell you something doctor,” I said, “I am not one of these guys who believes in going for years and years and years into psychotherapy.</span> <span id="s1612">I see it more or less, exactly the way, if I break a leg, I go to a doctor, and he puts a cast around it, and then like a month later, or you know, whenever, two months later, the cast comes off, and that’s the end of it, you know?”</span> <span id="s1613">Well, that was 23 years ago, and -- and I don’t go now any more, I -- but he totally changed me, because I was a very angry person.</span> <span id="s1614">I can still get very angry, but at least I -- I calm down again.</span> <span id="s1615">I was very depressed, skies were gray all the time, and I was very angry.</span> <span id="s1616">I was not a very good father, I’m afraid, with my children, I got very angry sometimes, I would throw things against walls, and ooh, when I think back of it, it’s almost unbelievable that I was like that, but I -- I was.</span> <span id="s1617">Had no insight in myself.</span> <span id="s1618">That is all changed, you know, you begin to -- maybe just age, but also, again, finding out about what happened to us then, has clarified my own personality a lot, you know?</span> <span id="s1619">I can see myself now as -- as that -- the little boy, who -- how he grew up, and how he -- the 1929 episode in -- in the United States was a terrible one.</span> <span id="s1620">My mother had to farm me out.</span> <span id="s1621">She farmed me out to a young woman who -- I don’t know if she beat me, but she was very bad for me.</span> <span id="s1622">I remember crying, and doing -- and finally my mother found out, and she took me away from there, and farmed me out to old people, grandma, grandpa they were called, and they were lovely for me.</span> <span id="s1623">But that first -- first experience, being separated from my mother, who had to go to work because my father was in the hospital then, and being alone, and being mistreated, when the war came, and the whole thing started all over again, the loneliness, and the danger and the fear, I think it all accumulated.</span> <span id="s1624">And then we had, what, 25 years of doing nothing, and then you wind up with a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1625">It’s -- You know, it’s funny.</span> <span id="s1626">One of the last sessions -- recently I had to go back to him for just the one session, because I have interviewed a man nearby here, who had been in Auschwitz with his brother, and the story was so terrible that I had nightmares overnight, wh-what happened to him, happened to me during the night, and the next morning I was crazy, I -- I couldn’t clear my head, and I -- my wife said, “You’ve got to go see -- see a shrink because, you know, this has been too much of a thing.”</span> <span id="s1627">And I went back to him, and we tal -- and he helped me immediately, and we talked about it, and he -- he explained to me why it upset me so much, because it was -- this man had been with his brother in Auschwitz, and it brought all my war stories back, the danger, and the fear with my little brothers, and -- and I said, “You know, I never talked about the Holocaust with you, did I?”</span> <span id="s1628">And he began to laugh, he said, “You did nothing else.”</span> <span id="s1629">He says, “You did -- you did all the time,” he said.</span> <span id="s1630">I said, “I can’t remember that, did I talk about?</span> <span id="s1631">I thought I only talked about sex, and -- and -- and women, and,” -- he said, “You crazy.”</span> <span id="s1632">He said, “You,” -- no, he didn’t say I was crazy.</span> <span id="s1633">He said, “Ed,” he said, “every session you talked about the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s1634">“Oh, I did?</span> <span id="s1635">All right.”</span> <span id="s1636">So, I don’t know where we started with this question, I lost myself in the answer, but -- oh, did th -- did therapy change me, how did it change me?</span> <span id="s1637">It made me into a more wise person, I think.</span> <span id="s1638">More livable person.</span> <span id="s1639">I don’t think our marriage would have lasted if I hadn’t, was pretty impossible, you know?</span> <span id="s1640">Carla is very even person, is like -- the whole family, her mother was like that, her brother is like that, they’re wonderful people.</span> <span id="s1641">They -- They’re not -- don’t have great emotional outbursts on the up side, but also not on the down side.</span> <span id="s1642">They’re very, very stable, and I was very unstable.</span> <span id="s1643">So, I am more stable now, let’s put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: In -- In terms of what’s made you and Carla so involved now, recently, the last 10 years, where maybe other people, other survivors, they’ve withdrawn more, what’s made you do -- choose that path, and also how is it -- how has that changed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: You know, I -- I’ve thought about it, and I’ve come up with an answer that may not be the right one, but when you deal with Holocaust survivors, as you do now, and as I have done in interviews, you realize there’s an enormous range of suffering.</span> <span id="s1646">Those people -- and I’ve interviewed people who were lying in a hole in the ground in the woods for nine months, frozen practically to death.</span> <span id="s1647">That is not comparable to what I -- what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1648">They saw th -- I’ve interviewed people where, first their fa -- their mother, then their father was killed, then the brothers, a -- a woman had seven brothers, she wound up with one after the war.</span> <span id="s1649">One by one they were killed in Polish forests where they were in hiding.</span> <span id="s1650">One by one, she saw them being slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1651">That woman is probably -- it is probably impossible for her to go out and do interviews -- interview other Holocaust survivors.</span> <span id="s1652">I come from a family that survived complete.</span> <span id="s1653">An oddity in Holland, by the way.</span> <span id="s1654">Holland has a -- has a -- I don’t know if you’re familiar with the statistics of Holland.</span> <span id="s1655">Holland is the worst country after Poland and Greece, and certainly by far the -- the worst country for survivors in -- in the -- in -- west of Europe, western Europe.</span> <span id="s1656">So, my k -- my family survived.</span> <span id="s1657">I came out with a father, I came out with a mother, I came out with two brothers.</span> <span id="s1658">I came out with cousins, I came with uncles, aunts, a whole family.</span> <span id="s1659">I think that because of that, it is possible for me to go and interview other people, and not go completely to pieces.</span> <span id="s1660">I think if I had been like the woman who saw her family slaughtered one by one in the Polish forest, I don’t think I could be like -- sitting here, talking with you like this.</span> <span id="s1661">So -- Then there is something else, this is usually not talked about.</span> <span id="s1662">There is an intellectual range in Holocaust survivors, as well as non-Holocaust survivors, course.</span> <span id="s1663">It makes a big difference what -- where you come from, intellectually.</span> <span id="s1664">If you come from a Polish farming family, a Jewish family, somewhere in a shtetl, where the father was a shoemaker, and the mother did the household, and -- and life was fairly primitive, but wonderful, but then, that’s not my background either.</span> <span id="s1665">I come from a family, my father was an artist.</span> <span id="s1666">My mother was a telegraph operator when she -- when -- when no women were practically working.</span> <span id="s1667">I come from a family that loved music, loved literature, loved all the kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1668">I come from a family where I have one -- two brothers who were college professors, one -- one has changed in the meantime, to be an -- a psych -- a psychotherapist.</span> <span id="s1669">You know, this makes a big difference.</span> <span id="s1670">I-It’s possible for -- for Carla and me, come from a little different group, little different level, to help others.</span> <span id="s1671">When -- When we go to national conferences, and I see the others, they’re not that many that -- I cried when I saw them the first time, the 1600 hidden children, and I still feel, you know, love for them, but -- but I realize now that not all Holocaust survivors are people that -- that I can -- that I can feel at home with, you know?</span> <span id="s1672">And it’s interesting in many of the interviews that I’ve done, the interviewee said, “Ed, we got to get together afterwards, you know.</span> <span id="s1673">Let’s go out, you and my -- my wife, and -- a-a-and I, and you and your wife, and we’re going to have dinner together.”</span> <span id="s1674">And I thought, “I can’t do this, not with you.”</span> <span id="s1675">I mean, very primitive people sometimes.</span> <span id="s1676">Lovely people, but primitive, I couldn’t -- you know, I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1677">There was nothing we had in common, except that I interviewed them.</span> <span id="s1678">So -- Let’s see, what was the qu -- what was the question?</span> <span id="s1679">Oh, why do we -- why can we do this, and others cannot?</span> <span id="s1680">I think it had to do with our background, the fact that we’re not too damaged, and the fact that we came from backgrounds where reading, and -- and -- and culture was of -- of importance.</span> <span id="s1681">And you’ll find this all over, if you look at the people who, let’s say, are important in -- in the Holocaust community, they’re most -- mostly people who were not that terribly damaged, and who -- who can write, and read, and understand, and so -- or a psychologist, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1682">I don’t kn -- I -- I think -- that is my view of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Is there anything else that you want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1685">I forgot something.</span> <span id="s1686">And I think he deserves a place, and I don’t think he is in the original interview, because he couldn’t be.</span> <span id="s1687">After the conference, in 1981, of the Hidden Children, a letter arrived at my -- my wife’s desk in New York, of the Hidden Children, from a man in Yonkers, his name was Eddie Strauss, have you heard of him?</span> <span id="s1688">No.</span> <span id="s1689">Eddie Strauss wrote a letter, and it said, “I’m so sorry, I’m a hidden child from Belgium, and I’m so terribly sorry I couldn’t come to the conference, because I was in the hospital, but I would like to take up contact with you.”</span> <span id="s1690">And Carla came home with this letter, and she handed it to me, and said, “Listen, I’m very busy, and this man writes, and he lives right nearby here, about 10 minutes away, in Yonkers.</span> <span id="s1691">Maybe you can contact him.”</span> <span id="s1692">Okay.</span> <span id="s1693">So one day I call -- called up this man, and I got him on the phone, and I -- and I said, “Ah, Mr. Strauss?”</span> <span id="s1694">“Yes?”</span> <span id="s1695">I said, “My wife handed me this letter, could I come and say hello to you?”</span> <span id="s1696">You know.</span> <span id="s1697">“Yeah, I heard you -- you were sorry you couldn’t come to the conference.”</span> <span id="s1698">“Yes,” he said.</span> <span id="s1699">So I went down, straight down Broadway, same Broadway you have in New York, and entered a dark apartment, climbed five stairs, five steps up from street level, and entered a dark apartment, and there in the far -- far end of the dark apartment sat a man in a wheelchair, with one leg.</span> <span id="s1700">I hadn’t expected this.</span> <span id="s1701">He was overweight, and I shook his hand, and I said, “So, tell me about yourself.”</span> <span id="s1702">And out comes this story that he was -- he lived in Antwerp, in Belgium, and he was play -- out playing one day, and he stayed out too late, and when he came back, a neighbor grabbed him from the street, and said, “You can’t go home.”</span> <span id="s1703">And he found out later that his mother, his grandmother, his three year old sister, and his one year old baby brother had been snatched away from the house that day by -- by the Germans, put in a truck.</span> <span id="s1704">They were sent to Auschwitz, and the day that they arrived, they were all gassed, all murdered.</span> <span id="s1705">That was Eddie’s background, and his family.</span> <span id="s1706">He wound up in an orphan home in -- Belgium had six or seven orphan homes that were set up by the -- by the Judenrat, and with help of the Belgian Queen Mother, and the Germans knew about it.</span> <span id="s1707">So these children were really, I say, hostages of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1708">But they were cared for, and taken care of, and Eddie had been one of them.</span> <span id="s1709">He had, after the war, he had come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1710">He -- He went to an uncle of his in Manhattan, and -- and his grandfather lived there, and it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1711">They were German Jews, and they couldn’t understand this boy who had, at one time, been found in the street, totally full of lice, and -- and full of wounds, and -- so Eddie was placed somewhere in New Jersey, with people who were very good for him, and he went to -- he went to college, and he graduated, very smart.</span> <span id="s1712">Joined the American army -- was drafted into the American army, and of all places was sent to Germany, because he knew fluent German, and he knew French fluently, and English.</span> <span id="s1713">And he worked for the adjutant general, or something like that, in -- in -- in -- in Munchen, or so-someplace, interviewing Germans to see if they were Nazis, and so on.</span> <span id="s1714">He came back, and he invented a story about himself, he made an artificial life.</span> <span id="s1715">The people didn’t know that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1716">He st -- He said that when people asked about his parents, he said they had died in a car accident in Texas, and he had had -- he had a sister somewhere, but also in Texas, and he hadn’t seen her in years, and so on.</span> <span id="s1717">He told me all this.</span> <span id="s1718">His name was Eddie, like mine.</span> <span id="s1719">Our birthdates happened to be the same, the eighth of May.</span> <span id="s1720">And somehow another, I decided that I would adopt this man.</span> <span id="s1721">And I began to do what in Jewish we call mitzvahs, good deeds.</span> <span id="s1722">I got him -- first of all, I got him money.</span> <span id="s1723">I helped him with everything he needed, as much as I could, and he became like a brother to me, and I was his brother, you know, I’m the brother that had died.</span> <span id="s1724">And I took care of him as much as I could, for years.</span> <span id="s1725">He went -- He had only one leg, he had diabetes, and about a year after I met him, his other leg had to be amputated, so now he had no legs at all, and he wanted to commit suicide, he had tried once to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s1726">Ha -- But he got a new apartment, a nice, clean apartment, and he had electric wheelchair, which made him very happy.</span> <span id="s1727">And I gi -- brought him gifts, and I brought him books, and I talked with him, and -- and I took him to Hidden Child meetings in New York, on Purim, or you know.</span> <span id="s1728">And he was here, we sat in this room with him for Passover, to the seder, we invited him, and brought him with.</span> <span id="s1729">Lot of trouble, always, getting him with the wheelchair to there -- places.</span> <span id="s1730">And we took him to Washington, I took him to Washington when the Hidden Children, our group from Westchester, went to the Holocaust museum, he wanted to go there, and you can’t imagine what we went through, took Eddie in the wheelchair to -- to Washington.</span> <span id="s1731">And February, 1997, he died in front of the computer I had gotten him.</span> <span id="s1732">He wanted to learn the computer, and he learned, and then he was suddenly dead, and he was gone.</span> <span id="s1733">And it fell to me to take care of his stuff, little stuff that he had.</span> <span id="s1734">And it fell to me, about a year ago, to put a -- to take care of his funeral, and then later to put a stone on -- on his grave.</span> <span id="s1735">And I decided that there was more to him than just -- more to his grave, and there should be more to that grave, and I had a gra -- on the gravestone, I had a stonemason chisel that -- something like, in this place -- let this place remember not only Eddie Strauss, whose name was really Abraham Katz, but also his mother, with her name, and his father, and his sister Esther, and his little one year old brother.</span> <span id="s1736">I put all their names on there, with the dates, all killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1737">So that gravestone is nearby here, and I’m very proud of that, that at least that’s the last thing I could do for Eddie.</span> <span id="s1738">And I wanted to put that in, it was also a part of my development after the war, as a -- an aware Jew, let me put it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">End of Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00 PAGE 2 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0051 PAGE
