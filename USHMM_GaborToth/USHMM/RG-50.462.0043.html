Zoslow, interviewer Interview Date: October 1, 1981 Tape one, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">BZ: The following is an interview with Mrs. Edith Millman, a survivor of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s3">Mrs. Millman, when and where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">EM: I was born in 1924 in Bielsko, in Silesia.</span> <span id="s5">It’s not far from the Czech and German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">BZ: Please describe your childhood and family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">EM: My father was an executive for an American Oil Company, which means my life was that of an upper-middle class kid.</span> <span id="s8">We had a beautiful apartment, a sleep-in maid, and in summer I went to the seashore or the mountains and I went skiing.</span> <span id="s9">I attended some private schools, so it was very much like the life of a suburban kid in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">BZ: Are you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">EM: Yes, I was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">BZ: What is the extent of your schooling?</span> <span id="s13">Did you have a religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">EM: Not very much of it.</span> <span id="s15">We, I had a religious teacher come to the public school, or the elementary school.</span> <span id="s16">He would come twice a week and even when I attended a private Jewish school there wasn’t much really of religious education.</span> <span id="s17">But I do have a strong Zionist background.</span> <span id="s18">I learned Hebrew as a living language from some chalutzim that were preparing to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s19">My grandparents were Orthodox Jews.</span> <span id="s20">My parents did not keep a kosher house and went to the synagogue just on the High holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s21">At Pesach we had a Seder with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s22">It was held in a traditional way.</span> <span id="s23">But I, as I say, I didn’t have much of a religious education but was raised with a strong Jewish feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">BZ: And your secular education?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">EM: I attended in Bielsko, I attended elementary school, part of it in private and Jewish school and then I attended the first year of high school in Bielsko and in 1937 my father was transferred by the company to Warsaw and I attended high school in Warsaw until the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">BZ: Did you ever experience antisemitism before the rise of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">EM: Yes, I, even as a child I was called a “dirty Jew.”</span> <span id="s28">Sometimes while walking to school I was chased by boys; sometimes stones had been thrown.</span> <span id="s29">But that was rather infrequent, but we were quite aware of antisemitism in other parts of Poland, especially in Warsaw at the universities where the right-wing students always had fights with the Jewish students.</span> <span id="s30">We were well-read and we knew about antisemitism all over the world and took it very seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">BZ: Did Nazi propaganda in Germany before World War II affect your standing with your neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">EM: Well, I suppose so.</span> <span id="s33">I guess it was an undercurrent of antisemitism among the neighbors or the kids in school but, having had many Jewish friends, I really did not feel it that much until I moved to Warsaw, when, which was in 1937, when it became much more prevalent.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">BZ: Did you or your family make any attempt to emigrate before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">EM: Yes, my father was always a pessimist and as early as 1936 he applied for an emigration visa but then, because of the quota system, I think his number was due to come up in 1941 and he wouldn’t do anything that was illegal.</span> <span id="s36">There were ways of getting out sooner by bribing and buying tickets and what not.</span> <span id="s37">He just couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">BZ: Now please give the date and describe the Nazi invasion and conquest of your community.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">EM: Well, as I said, I was in Warsaw and the bombing started almost immediately after the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s40">We lived in a very good neighborhood—it was a Gentile neighborhood—we lived in an extremely modern apartment building and bombs started to fall immediately.</span> <span id="s41">An order was given just before the war broke out that one room in each house had to be made airtight because everybody expected gas to be used, and I remember my mother taping the big picture windows in one room to make it gas-tight.</span> <span id="s42">Unfortunately, after the first couple of bombs, the windows broke and naturally we didn’t have any airtight room.</span> <span id="s43">About a week after the war started, there was a call on the radio for all men, able-bodied men to leave Warsaw and go east.</span> <span id="s44">We later learned that it was a mere ruse by the Germans but we really don’t know for sure.</span> <span id="s45">All I know is that my father took a knapsack in the middle of the night—we all had knapsacks prepared for an emergency—which contained a blanket, and some food and a first-aid kit and a gas mask.</span> <span id="s46">In the middle of the night we left the apartment.</span> <span id="s47">We heard many fighter planes flying low and heard a lot of shooting and in the morning we learned that one of the bridges going out of Warsaw, east towards Praga, which is a suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s48">The German stukas (planes) swept very low and machine-gunned hundreds and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s49">We had no way of knowing if my father survived or not.</span> <span id="s50">He did make his way over to east, to the border with Russia and then, especially since the Russians also invaded Poland from the East, he had some harrowing experiences on the way and then he finally made his way back to us, to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s51">In the meantime our house was bombed, I was injured, and after the bombing we sought shelter in the sub-basement, which was a storage place for the coal with which the house was heated and hot water was provided.</span> <span id="s52">And that’s where I met my first cruel antisemitism, because my mother bedded me down on a pile of coal.</span> <span id="s53">There was no ventilation, a lot of coal dust and no windows.</span> <span id="s54">It was a very hot summer.</span> <span id="s55">It was hot and I was feverish from infected wounds.</span> <span id="s56">The superintendent of the building, or the janitor, who always seemed quite nice to us and was getting a nice monthly tip from my father, all of a sudden decided that he did not like Jews and, although he did let us stay on a heap of coal, he did not give us any water, and he knew where the pipes were that still carried some water and so he and his children had water and he let his children splash in it, but refused to give me any.</span> <span id="s57">The water just splashed a couple of feet from me.</span> <span id="s58">He offered some water to our dog but not to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">BZ: How soon after the conquest of your community were the Jews singled out for special treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">EM: Almost immediately.</span> <span id="s61">I remember the Nazis marching in and Warsaw finally surrendered and soup kitchens were established, and people were lining up to go to soup kitchens, and any people that looked Jewish or some Orthodox Jews in their traditional garb, they were singled out for “fun,” which meant the Germans would pull on their beards, make them lie on the floor and so on, an order was given that Jews had to take off their caps from their heads when they met a German and step off the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s62">Frequently if they looked in the face of a German while pulling off their cap the German could say, “Well, you arrogant Jew, how dare you look in my face?”</span> <span id="s63">and hit the Jew or beat him up.</span> <span id="s64">If you averted looking at the face of a German you could be asked, “You dirty Jew, what’s wrong, why don’t you look in my face?</span> <span id="s65">What have you done?</span> <span id="s66">What are you guilty of?”</span> <span id="s67">and be beaten that way.</span> <span id="s68">When the order was given for all the Jews to wear armbands with the Star of David, it was very easy for the Poles also to single them out, and if you stood in line in front of a bakery store to get your ration, or bread, or in line for water, because many of the water mains were broken and there were only certain places where you could get water, the police could come and chase you out of the line, and if you were close to the storefront they sent you back to the end of the line.</span> <span id="s69">There was just no recourse.</span> <span id="s70">You couldn’t fight them all and if you tried to fight they would just call a German guard who made you go to the back of the line.</span> <span id="s71">Since I didn’t look Jewish I frequently left the house without my armband and that helped a great deal, when procuring food and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">BZ: When your father went on the march with the able-bodied men from Poland, there was an incident about a horse that I would like you to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">EM: Well, as I said, my father left in the middle of the night, and as a matter of fact he left right after he had what the doctor diagnosed the day before as a mild heart attack and so he was really quite weak.</span> <span id="s74">After he picked himself up, they were all in some kind of a gutter waiting for the planes to go by, he walked for several hours and he met some other Jewish men and they all were middle-aged and kind of weak and I guess scared.</span> <span id="s75">And when they came to a farm they decided to pool the money, they all had some money, and to buy a horse and a wagon so they could put their knapsacks and ride in the wagon.</span> <span id="s76">As it turned out, since none of them knew anything about horses—they were all city men and never lived on a farm—they had bought an old horse that was lame and blind on one eye and the wagon was just an old farm wagon.</span> <span id="s77">It was falling apart and it turned out the horse was quite weak.</span> <span id="s78">But they didn’t have the heart to leave it on the road, so they spent more money just buying food on the road and paying exorbitant prices for the food for the horse, for the hay, and none of them sat on the wagon because the horse just couldn’t pull it.</span> <span id="s79">They even took the knapsacks off the wagon to make it lighter and then they left the wagon and unhitched the horse and pulled the horse and took it from community to community and just fed it, because they didn’t want to leave it as I said, and finally, in some little village, they paid a farmer to take the horse with a promise he would not kill it but feed it.</span> <span id="s80">So they left even money with the farmer for food for the horse.</span> <span id="s81">I thought it was kind of a funny incident.</span> <span id="s82">On the other hand, it shows just how sentimental Jews were about life.</span> <span id="s83">My father got quite sick on the way.</span> <span id="s84">As a matter of fact that was on the way back, trying to make his way through to Warsaw, but he was taken in by a Jewish tailor in Lublin, I think it was; he had a high temperature and the wife of the tailor took care of him.</span> <span id="s85">They were also in pretty bad shape—their house was also burned down—and they were living in some little shack, and they nursed my father back to strength, at least enough strength that he could come back.</span> <span id="s86">At the time we were living in my father’s office.</span> <span id="s87">It was an American company, American office building, and since our house was demolished, almost everything was ruined, we had moved to this office with some other families, employees, of this firm.</span> <span id="s88">We slept on the desks and we ate in the soup kitchens because there was no facility to cook.</span> <span id="s89">But through some strange coincidence, some of my mother’s canned fruits—she used to can fruits and cherries and so on and made jams—this wasn’t destroyed in the bombing and we were able to get it out of the house and had it with us and we exchanged the jam and compotes, applesauce and canned pears and so on for bread.</span> <span id="s90">There was a kind of feeling of camaraderie.</span> <span id="s91">Somebody got some bread or a piece of meat or something in exchange for some jam.</span> <span id="s92">I will never forget the first time I ate horsemeat.</span> <span id="s93">It was at the soup kitchen and a friend of mine told me, “Edith, there is some good soup there with lots of meat in it but it is horsemeat,” and I immediately believed her.</span> <span id="s94">I didn’t care, so when we went with my mother and she enjoyed the soup and on the way out somebody told my mother.</span> <span id="s95">In fact I had told my mother it was horsemeat but she thought I was joking so she said, “Oh sure, sure,” and she ate the soup, but on the way out somebody told, my mother was told by another lady who was cooking in the kitchen that it really was horsemeat and my mother got awfully sick in the middle of the street and threw up and I thought she was going to faint.</span> <span id="s96">I just want to contrast that with later on with life in the ghetto or life when we escaped from the ghetto, where you paid a lot of money to get a piece of horsemeat and my mother learned how to prepare it in such a way for my father not to recognize it, and I guess I was the first one to insist that we buy and get that horsemeat because I knew how important some protein was.</span> <span id="s97">My father didn’t know for a long time that what he was enjoying was hamburger but we didn’t call it hamburger, [unclear] was actually horsemeat.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">BZ: Were you in a ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">EM: Yes, when the orders for the ghetto were given and rescinded and given and rescinded.</span> <span id="s100">There was always a lot of confusion.</span> <span id="s101">Finally we were moved into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s102">My parents managed to get an apartment, or a room in an apartment, in one of the houses that was right on the border of the ghetto, because the ghetto was established in an old area, an industrial area, dilapidated.</span> <span id="s103">And it was just the outskirts where halfway decent houses existed, and that’s where we moved in.</span> <span id="s104">Unfortunately, that was not for long because, as you know, the Germans kept squeezing the size of the ghetto and always cutting off streets, and the upshot was we had to move many, many times because I guess my folks were unwilling to move back into the middle of things.</span> <span id="s105">They always moved, one street inside the wall, and as the ghetto was made smaller we always had to move.</span> <span id="s106">I remember the first house we moved into, we lived in a dining room.</span> <span id="s107">The other rooms were occupied by other families, but since it was a dining room it was a walk-through room for other families to get to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s108">The young people immediately organized a library in this building and we also organized a little nursery for the children that could not go to nursery school and so on.</span> <span id="s109">We were not allowed to go to high school; the high schools were closed.</span> <span id="s110">I spent a lot of time studying English.</span> <span id="s111">There was a rage for studying English and a rage for reading certain books.</span> <span id="s112">I remember that’s the time when I read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and I remember countless discussions about his philosophy of life, what a wonderful life it would be the way Huxley described.</span> <span id="s113">We also read a lot of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky was very popular at that time, War and Peace, almost everybody in my circle of friends studied English and most of us studied on our own, and later on secret courses were organized in the ghetto for students.</span> <span id="s114">They were organized by high school teachers and even university professors.</span> <span id="s115">We would meet in groups of five and six.</span> <span id="s116">There was a death penalty for being caught studying.</span> <span id="s117">I remember vividly that it took us at least half an hour or more to get to a place.</span> <span id="s118">We always usually changed the place where we had our lessons so as not to attract attention.</span> <span id="s119">We were even afraid to all walk in together to a teacher because it would attract attention, so we went in one at a time.</span> <span id="s120">In the winter of 1941, when it was very cold, we had just a little lamp, a karbowka lamp, it was called, and we would sit around it and put the lamp on the table and study by that light and more than anything, we would warm our fingers at that little flame.</span> <span id="s121">I remember being taught physics by a former university professor who was quite famous in his field in astrology, some measurements that he had made and he was our physics professor.</span> <span id="s122">I remember his teaching us with his gloves on and he had some holes in the tips of his fingers and he had these holes so he could hold the pencil better, but often the tips of his fingers would get so cold and he would blow on them to get some more heat.</span> <span id="s123">I must say that I got a very good education because I was taught in groups of five by some excellent professors and we took our studies very seriously.</span> <span id="s124">It was our way of holding on to humanity.</span> <span id="s125">It might sound ridiculous now but the world was falling apart around us and, yet, we were solving some differential equations and studying literature and studying languages.</span> <span id="s126">We studied French.</span> <span id="s127">We studied Latin.</span> <span id="s128">We were reading many works in Latin and translating them, and I guess it was just our way of trying not to know that the world was really, as we knew it, was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s129">That does not mean we were not concerned with what was going on.</span> <span id="s130">Our little group organized a little nursery.</span> <span id="s131">We would gather the kids together just to get them off the street and there was not much that we could do but just to keep them occupied.</span> <span id="s132">We would also collect some food, we would go to our relatives and friends who were better off than most other people, get some canned stuff, make some soups and so on and feed these kids.</span> <span id="s133">There were shelters for children but, in spite of that, there were many children who wandered around and these were the ones we tried to get into our little what we called nursery.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">I don’t know how much you want me to talk about the ghetto....</span> <span id="s135">Typhus broke out and typhoid fever and many of our friends got awfully sick.</span> <span id="s136">Somehow it took an awful toll among the young people.</span> <span id="s137">I had a very good friend who was very sick and lost all his hair afterwards.</span> <span id="s138">There were other diseases transmitted by lice and everything was full of lice.</span> <span id="s139">It was so bad in 1941-42 that if you walked in the street, and the streets were extremely crowded, if a small wind came you could be sure that the wind brought with it some lice.</span> <span id="s140">The place that we lived, we had a rule that everybody had to strip completely before we entered the apartment just to shake all the lice out.</span> <span id="s141">But in spite of that, in one apartment where we lived a woman died of typhus.</span> <span id="s142">That was my first close encounter with death in the apartment itself.</span> <span id="s143">She had a daughter of eight years and several weeks later the daughter also died of typhus.</span> <span id="s144">She was the wife of a lawyer who had escaped.</span> <span id="s145">One woman in the apartment became pregnant and, we lived with many professionals in the apartment and a doctor performed an abortion right there in the house, and I was a teenager at the time but it was kept a secret for a while, but several weeks later I learned that it was an abortion that was performed.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s147">EM: Another incident in the ghetto that I remember and about the same time was when we had to put our dog to sleep.</span> <span id="s148">It seems kind of unimportant now, but there was just not enough food to give to the dog but we did have some sugar, I remember, and we gave the last three sugar cubes to the dog before my mother took him to the vet to get the injection and when she came back, on the way back, she was crying and everybody on the street whom she knew felt that something happened to either me or my father, who might have been taken away, because she was crying so bitterly, and she was ashamed to say that she cried because she had to put the dog to sleep.</span> <span id="s149">There were no dogs allowed at that time.</span> <span id="s150">There just was not enough food for any dogs.</span> <span id="s151">We were often hungry but because my father had the foresight of taking most of the money out of the bank before the war, shortly before the war, and converting it into dollars, we were able to buy food on the black market.</span> <span id="s152">This was extremely expensive and we had to be very careful with the way we spent money.</span> <span id="s153">In the beginning we were also getting packages even from overseas, from America.</span> <span id="s154">It was before the war between Germany and America.</span> <span id="s155">My father had some cousins in New York and through the Joint Distribution Committee we got a few packages.</span> <span id="s156">In the beginning of the ghetto, my father was still able to work because it was an American firm, so he was still getting some of his salary and that naturally helped.</span> <span id="s157">Later on all that stopped and we just had to live on the money my parents had saved up and from selling some stock.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">At one time I was caught in the street for labor to be taken outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s159">I was taken to some barracks and told to wash the windows, I think it was on the fifth floor.</span> <span id="s160">It was in winter and it was extremely cold and I was given a bucket of cold water and told to wash all the windows inside and out, and when I asked for a rag or some soap or something they told me, “No soap,” and if I wanted a rag I should take my blouse off.</span> <span id="s161">And I was sitting on the window sill trying to balance myself and the bucket and splashing the cold water on the window panes and then scraping the ice that almost immediately formed with my fingers.</span> <span id="s162">I felt like my fingers were going to fall off any minute and while I was balancing myself on this window sill, there were some soldiers sitting around and they had a lot of fun just watching me trying to balance myself.</span> <span id="s163">At that time at a point when I felt I was going to lose my fingers I started to talk German to them.</span> <span id="s164">Up to that point I never spoke German to them.</span> <span id="s165">I was proficient in German, but I thought maybe if I speak in their mother tongue they won’t be quite as cruel, and it really worked.</span> <span id="s166">They told me to get off that window sill and then they gave me a rag just to wipe the windows on the inside, and at the end of the day they gave me a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s167">It was two kilos of bread which was quite a lot of bread and it wasn’t the black terrible bread that we would get with our ration cards.</span> <span id="s168">And I was quite hungry because they didn’t feed me all day.</span> <span id="s169">I decided to bring it back to the ghetto to my parents, but as we were crossing the gate from the outside into the ghetto, a policeman took it from me and said, “That bread was too good for the Jews.”</span> <span id="s170">So there I was, without having eaten anything and without a bread to show for my labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Coming back to the typhus, when it broke out in a building, they would close all the doors and they would quarantine the house and not only quarantine that house but quarantined also the house to the left and to the right and nobody could get in and out, which meant the people could not even go for the food that they would get on their ration cards.</span> <span id="s172">People couldn’t go to work and because of that, most times we kept it secret and when somebody did come down with high fever, whatever its cause, it just was not reported.</span> <span id="s173">Besides, if they were taken to the hospital the conditions in the hospital were so terrible; much worse than if they had just died in the house.</span> <span id="s174">Medicine was extremely hard to get and it was just impossible to get ampule of vaccine and so the stronger ones just survived and the weaker ones died.</span> <span id="s175">There were some doctors—there were many doctors around—they sometimes would come to these houses and try to help, but without proper medication and with very poor nutrition, there was very little they really could do.</span> <span id="s176">It was just a matter of which organism was stronger.</span> <span id="s177">At one point, one of my favorite friends was taken—she was very pretty—she was taken outside of the ghetto for some filming and I guess they were sending some films to Germany, how well the Jews had it in the ghetto, and they were taken to a café and there were some young men and young women given clothing to dress up and it was filmed, they were dancing, to show they were having a jolly good time.</span> <span id="s178">I guess it was a film for propaganda purposes.</span> <span id="s179">I know this as a fact because this girl came back and told us how she had to dance and was drinking something from a cup which was really water but they had to talk about it as if it were coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">We did have some cultural life in the ghetto; we had concerts which I attended quite frequently.</span> <span id="s181">I especially enjoyed the symphony and I think my love for Mozart and Beethoven stems from that time.</span> <span id="s182">You just could immerse yourself completely in music.</span> <span id="s183">It was mostly the German composers that were played.</span> <span id="s184">I don’t remember having heard any non-German composers.</span> <span id="s185">I might be wrong, I don’t remember, but I think there was a rumor that only German composers were allowed to be played.</span> <span id="s186">We did go several times and enjoyed it tremendously.</span> <span id="s187">When the order was given….</span> <span id="s188">Up to that point we had no idea what was really happening on the outside.</span> <span id="s189">We didn’t know about the concentration camps, how bad they were, and we were under the impression that they were all work camps.</span> <span id="s190">Nobody really knew about the Final Solution that was coming.</span> <span id="s191">We tried to survive, mainly, I guess, because we never lost faith that the Allies eventually will win, and our only way of fighting Hitler and the Nazis was to stay alive.</span> <span id="s192">There wasn’t too much active resistance in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s193">This means we didn’t kill many Germans, mainly because of the repercussions, mainly because of all the hostages that would be taken.</span> <span id="s194">I think the ratio was something like 100 to 1.</span> <span id="s195">At least that was the announced ratio.</span> <span id="s196">And I think the feeling in the ghetto was that we do not have the right to jeopardize the lives of other people because we feel we want revenge.</span> <span id="s197">If a German was injured, not only the family—if they caught the culprit—would be taken away, but also the neighbors and the whole house would be emptied of all people and everybody was taken as a hostage and either shot or sent away, never to be heard of again.</span> <span id="s198">I think because of that the feeling was quite strong that nobody had the right to jeopardize the life of another one.</span> <span id="s199">I think that was the main reason why there wasn’t that much active resistance because we still didn’t know we were marked for death.</span> <span id="s200">At that time, we just thought we were marked to languish in this ghetto until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s201">When the deportations started and in June and July of 1942, that’s when we started to doubt that we are going for resettlement and that we are going for labor, because they were taking old people and children were not supposed to be in the ghetto and the whole ghetto was supposed to be a big labor camp and so on.</span> <span id="s202">I’ll never forget the “cauldron” that they made, I think it was in September 1942 and the order was given that all the Jews had to go into a, I think, six block square area and the big selection was taking place there.</span> <span id="s203">I don’t know exactly how many people were marching to this kociol, I think it translates as “cauldron.”</span> <span id="s204">There was just a small area where all the remaining Jews—at that time I think maybe a hundred and twenty thousand were left in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s205">We were marched out in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s206">The order was given and we were all allowed to take some food with us.</span> <span id="s207">And many people were able to procure poison.</span> <span id="s208">I had poison.</span> <span id="s209">My father gave me some arsenic to have with me and I gave some to my mother and she had some, because at that time we already knew that it wasn’t resettlement but it was a camp, and although we didn’t know it was a death camp, we had an idea it was a concentration camp where the chances of surviving were maybe slim, or maybe that the torture would have been too much.</span> <span id="s210">We didn’t know about gas chambers.</span> <span id="s211">Although somebody came back from one of the camps and talked about people being gassed, I don’t think he was believed.</span> <span id="s212">They just thought he was crazy.</span> <span id="s213">But I guess there was enough.</span> <span id="s214">Even if we didn’t believe it all, we didn’t believe there were gas chambers, that people were just shot and there were mass graves—there was enough doubt.</span> <span id="s215">We just didn’t want to go through all that, to be deported.</span> <span id="s216">And in this kociol we had to wait overnight before the selection started and we were all crowded together in a small room.</span> <span id="s217">The thousands of people.</span> <span id="s218">My mother, father and I were crowded in a small room and there was an old iron stove and somehow—we were crowded in what used to be a kitchen and my mother took some coal soot from that stove and she put it on my father’s head.</span> <span id="s219">He was getting gray so just to make him look younger and she put a black thing over his temples to cover the gray and I don’t remember where she found it or if she had it but I remember there was a piece of chicory, that stuff that you put into coffee, I don’t know if she had it in her knapsack, but it had the reddish brownish color and I remember her putting it on his cheeks to make him look healthier.</span> <span id="s220">Then when we were crossing through that border—it was a kind of a gate where the selection was taking place—the Germans would usually just take one.</span> <span id="s221">We marched in four, four people and they would just take one out and the rest of the family would go, if it was a family, because at that time people just didn’t want to separate.</span> <span id="s222">There was a child who was put to sleep in a knapsack in front of me.</span> <span id="s223">Some father tried to carry it through that gate and the child started to cry and move and the German noticed it and made the father take the knapsack off and open it and it was the child and he got some other people with big bags and knapsacks and there were children in those.</span> <span id="s224">Some were asleep and some weren’t.</span> <span id="s225">And he just lined them up and shot them and a few mothers tried to cover with their own bodies the children, and they were just also shot.</span> <span id="s226">And then they beat us with whips and we just ran so that I don’t really know exactly how many were killed that way.</span> <span id="s227">But that is one of my last remembrances of...Then we got separated somehow from my mother and we got back into the compound of the Schultz factory where we worked at the time.</span> <span id="s228">And my mother worked for Toebbens and they were selected later, so we didn’t really know if she made it or not.</span> <span id="s229">And I understand there was quite a discussion.</span> <span id="s230">The people didn’t know if they should go ahead of the line or towards the end and tried to outguess the Germans, if they would be in a good mood in the beginning and let them through or if they would be tired of selecting and towards the end they would let them through.</span> <span id="s231">But somehow my mother and her friend chose the right part of the convoy and they did get through.</span> <span id="s232">But most of these people did not, and when some of them came back to the ghetto and they said that most of the people from Toebbens were taken to the Umschlagplatz and were taken to be sent away, and my mother wasn’t showing up and I was with my father and we were sure that she didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s233">But towards the end she finally did come in.</span> <span id="s234">I remember the terrible fear that we had that she was taken but she finally did come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">I worked at Schultz, in the office.</span> <span id="s236">I remember all that.</span> <span id="s237">Schultz worked on uniforms and furs.</span> <span id="s238">We had quite a group.</span> <span id="s239">Well, that was the passive resistance, because most of the uniforms, the fur that was made, we tried to rip the seams in such a way it would kind of pass inspection and fall apart when it would go to the front.</span> <span id="s240">My father was working also in the office as an accountant and Schultz was trying to cheat the government, the German Army, I guess it was.</span> <span id="s241">He would ask, not directly, but through his directors, the order would come down to my father how to juggle the figures because he would juggle them in such a way as to increase his profit and I once asked my father how he felt about it and he said, “Well, since it was all going against the army and against the government [he said] he felt good about it and the more he could juggle the better.”</span> <span id="s242">He didn’t care who made the profit just so long as in the long run it would not benefit the Germans.</span> <span id="s243">I escaped from the ghetto in November of 1942 when I volunteered for a transport outside on a truck labor battalion.</span> <span id="s244">…</span></p> <p><span id="s245">BZ: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s246">When they didn’t want children in the ghetto, were most of those children hidden by their parents?</span> <span id="s247">Did the Germans ever come with a transport and take the children out while the parents were at work in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">EM: At that time there were not supposed to be any children officially, so if the parents went to work they would hide the children.</span> <span id="s249">If they believed in the resettlement they would just leave with their children, they would just leave with their children.</span> <span id="s250">But one day when we came back after that cauldron, after that big selection, there were dead bodies of children in the building.</span> <span id="s251">These children obviously had been hidden and when they were found by whoever went through the building, Germans, Ukrainians or Latvians, because they all went through the buildings there looking for people hiding, and some people managed there to stay in their houses, they had double walls, double floors and what not.</span> <span id="s252">In our building there were bodies of two children that I remember, that were found and shot and I guess the parents had just hidden the children and left to go to the cauldron, but the parents never came back, by the way, so they never knew what happened to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">BZ: You were there when Janusz Korczak went with his children?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">EM: Yes, I watched the procession and he walked at the head and holding the hands of the children and it was a very, very moving moment.</span> <span id="s255">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">BZ: How did you escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">EM: Well, as I said, I volunteered and there were some friends of mine on the truck and we did have some contact with the outside.</span> <span id="s258">I had a Gentile friend on the outside.</span> <span id="s259">And his mother and he knew that I would be coming and at a certain point the truck slowed down at a corner and these friends started a pretend fight on the truck and the guard was too busy beating them up, so I jumped.</span> <span id="s260">Actually, the driver of the truck was bribed and he knew that I would jump.</span> <span id="s261">Just the guard did not know and he didn’t even notice that I was missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">BZ: The driver was a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">EM: The driver was a German but he was pretty easy to bribe and I guess I wasn’t the first one that escaped that way.</span> <span id="s264">I don’t even know but I suspect that the guard on the truck probably was sharing, officially [unclear] he was not because I cannot imagine that he never noticed that I was gone.</span> <span id="s265">He was busy beating up the two friends but, for all I know, he could have been pretending that he was so busy beating them up.</span> <span id="s266">I do know that the driver of the truck was bribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">My mother escaped several weeks later by joining a group of Polish smugglers.</span> <span id="s268">Unfortunately, I think they wanted to get rid of my mother, too.</span> <span id="s269">She had to bribe them and pay them to take her along, although she pretended that she was a Pole.</span> <span id="s270">She was dressed like a Polish smuggler, a Polish peasant, and she just pretended that she had lost her group and that her usual way of entry was cut off, and that’s why she had to join them and she paid them.</span> <span id="s271">They waited until it was dark and then they went through some demolished buildings and some holes and sewers and demolished buildings, but, somehow, just as they were reaching the border between the ghetto and the Aryan area, some Germans came along and my mother suspects that these Polish smugglers had set it up because they disappeared and my mother found herself quite alone.</span> <span id="s272">So she started to run and she had a vague idea where the escape route was, but the Germans came with their flashlights and were running and she ran and she jumped into several feet into some kind of a hole, which was half filled with mud and dirty water, and as she was escaping in December it must have been from some melted snow or something.</span> <span id="s273">Anyway, the Germans stood almost on top of her on a half destroyed brick wall and they were shining their flashlight, and she was so sure that the flashlight would shine right on her face, but somehow it just missed her and they were looking down, but they just didn’t shine it close to the wall where she was and she was just under their feet practically and she always told me how she prayed and she said, “If there is a God, please help me now and don’t let them see me,” and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s274">All she could hear them saying: “Ich hab sie ja gesehen, sie war hier” means: “I have seen her, she was here,” but they stood there for a while and looked for her, but didn’t find her.</span> <span id="s275">And when it got lighter she made her way out and, since she had some stuff with her because she was pretending she was a smuggler, and she had some stuff with her, when she got out she continued to pretend she was a smuggler.</span> <span id="s276">All the smugglers had a pretty good network there and they did suspect her of being Jewish so they took most of her stuff, but they did let her go and she made her way to this apartment where I met her, which was set up in advance and we had some papers prepared for us, identity cards.</span> <span id="s277">They were completely false.</span> <span id="s278">They cost a lot of money, but they really were no good because there was no basis to them.</span> <span id="s279">Later on, I was able to get a birth certificate from a small village in the east of Poland and on the basis of this birth certificate I went to the administration where they were giving regular identity cards and I got another identity card, and it was better insofar that if they had bothered to check they could see that that identity card was given based on a birth certificate, while the first one was just a paper, just the same, just stolen stamps and so on.</span> <span id="s280">I had this funny experience, when I went to pick up my second identity card, I walked out of the office and put it in my muff and in the muff I also had the first identity card, which was on a different name, but just as I walked out, I met a friend of mine from the ghetto and we greeted each other and started talking, and two Polish policemen noticed us and that was almost a cardinal sin, to talk with another Jew in the street, because while one Jew could possibly get by unnoticed, when you put two Jews together there was something about them that attracted attention and maybe that’s why these policemen noticed us.</span> <span id="s281">And one of them took her and the other one took me and took us to a big courtyard and there he asked me for my identity card and I pulled one out and I had no idea which one because they both looked and felt the same.</span> <span id="s282">They were just folded, and he grabbed it from me as soon as I got it out of my muff and he stood across from me and asked me what my name was and these names differed on both cards, so I had no idea which one he had.</span> <span id="s283">But somehow I thought quickly, and I jumped around behind his shoulders and pointed to the place where the name was printed and I said, “It’s printed right- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s284">EM: I don’t know what I’m forgetting.</span> <span id="s285">I don’t know what, where you stopped.</span> <span id="s286">Is it going now?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">BZ: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s289">Well I’m, where I’m I jumped behind him and I pointed to the place that was print-, where my name was printed, and I said, “It’s right here.</span> <span id="s290">Can’t you read?</span> <span id="s291">I didn’t know that they hire illiterates at the police force.”</span> <span id="s292">And then that gave me enough time to know the whole, my curriculum vitae, so to speak, because it had the birth date and so on.</span> <span id="s293">And I had most of my story pretty pat, except when he was interrogating me and when he asked me how I support myself, I said, “I give lessons of German,” since I knew German.</span> <span id="s294">And he became suspicious.</span> <span id="s295">That business of giving a German lesson was good for my other identity card where I was born in western Poland where people did speak two languages.</span> <span id="s296">They spoke German.</span> <span id="s297">But in eastern part they didn’t.</span> <span id="s298">If anything they maybe spoke Ukrainian or Russian.</span> <span id="s299">But they certainly didn’t speak German.</span> <span id="s300">So he became suspicious and asked me how come I knew German.</span> <span id="s301">And I had to think quickly and I made up a story immediately that my mother really was a German, but she died in childbirth, but my grandmother brought me up and spoke German to me, and that’s how I learned.</span> <span id="s302">But he was still suspicious.</span> <span id="s303">And he wanted me to go with him to the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">And I had some money with me which I had taken in case I had difficulty getting this identity card out of the office.</span> <span id="s305">And I thought maybe I would need it for a bribe or to buy my way out.</span> <span id="s306">But I didn’t really want to lose it and besides, I wasn’t sure if he would take me to a police station just for a bribe or if he would interrogate me further and send me off to the Gestapo, because that was the next step.</span> <span id="s307">You either could buy your way out from the police station or you were taken to the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">So, and this happened right across the street from the railroad station in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s309">And there were some gendarmes.</span> <span id="s310">I mean, what do you call them?</span> <span id="s311">MP’s, German MP’s, always on guard or marching back and forth in front of the station.</span> <span id="s312">So I, after having made up that story with my German mother, I decided that, well, first when I said to the Polish policeman, I said, “I’m not going to any Polish police; I am half German.</span> <span id="s313">and if anything is wrong with my papers, let a German tell me so.”</span> <span id="s314">And I ran across the street to the German MP.</span> <span id="s315">I showed him the identity card and I said, “At least could you look it over and see if it’s all right.</span> <span id="s316">And if it’s all right, tell this Polish policeman that it’s so.</span> <span id="s317">And if it’s not all right just take me to your police.</span> <span id="s318">Because this Polish policeman is bothering me.”</span> <span id="s319">And this MP looked at the card and he didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s320">I mean, he wasn’t a Gestapo man.</span> <span id="s321">He didn’t suspect anything.</span> <span id="s322">And I was a relatively good-looking girl and young and he was a young guy.</span> <span id="s323">So he looked at the card and he says, “Oh, scheint alles in ordnung zu sein” which means, “everything seems to be all right.”</span> <span id="s324">And he called the policeman over and he yelled at him and he slapped him in his face, slapped him on the side of his face.</span> <span id="s325">And he said, “You’d better look for bandits and Jews and leave pretty girls alone.”</span> <span id="s326">Because no way did the policeman or I, say, that he suspected me of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s327">He just wanted to verify my identity.</span> <span id="s328">When he saw an identity, when this MP saw an identity card and it seemed all right to him, it had a picture and had a stamp, so, he just said to the Polish policeman to look for Jews and bandits and leave pretty girls alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">And I ran to the station.</span> <span id="s330">And we were hiding out in a suburb of Warsaw at that time.</span> <span id="s331">And I went to the station and I, later on I met the same policeman.</span> <span id="s332">His beat was right near the railroad station.</span> <span id="s333">I met him many times and he always saluted.</span> <span id="s334">And that story with that, a German mother who died in childbirth, became very handy, several weeks later when I was looking for a job.</span> <span id="s335">I saw an ad in the newspaper for somebody who was bilingual, to work for the railroad stations.</span> <span id="s336">And I went to apply for that.</span> <span id="s337">It was in a big office building.</span> <span id="s338">I had to go to the personnel director of the railroad system.</span> <span id="s339">It was a big office building.</span> <span id="s340">There were many guards almost, everywhere.</span> <span id="s341">So I decided instead of taking the elevator and standing maybe close to some German—oh, the place was crawling with Germans—who might suspect me of being Jewish and might not like my face, I decided to walk up the steps.</span> <span id="s342">I think it was the third or fourth floor.</span> <span id="s343">And standing on every landing, on every floor, there was a guard and I had to show my fake identity card.</span> <span id="s344">I would have been much better off just taking the elevator.</span> <span id="s345">But anyway, I made my way in and this personnel director had me sit down and type and he was dictating to me.</span> <span id="s346">I knew some typing, which I learned in the beginning of my ghetto years, when my father insisted that I do something constructive, and just as I learned some English and I also had to learn shorthand and typing, which I taught myself.</span> <span id="s347">But it wasn’t, it was the hunt and peck method.</span> <span id="s348">But I mean, but I did know a little bit how to type.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">So he was dictating to me, and I always say an angel must have been sitting on my shoulder, because never before and never since could I type that fast and that well.</span> <span id="s350">And he was dictating.</span> <span id="s351">Is this thing going?</span> <span id="s352">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s353">I have to see.</span> <span id="s354">[noise; tape off then on; noise] He was dictating some very technical article, about the brake system.</span> <span id="s355">And I swear some words were half a line long and one paragraph was half a page long.</span> <span id="s356">And when I finished, he looked it over.</span> <span id="s357">And apparently there wasn’t even one mistake in that whole thing, although most of the words I had never heard before.</span> <span id="s358">They were all very technical.</span> <span id="s359">And he shook his head and said, “Well, Miss, are you Polish?”</span> <span id="s360">And I said, “Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s361">And he shook his head and said, “No, you’re not.”</span> <span id="s362">And my heart sank because I knew that the Germans, the more knowledgeable Germans, always suspected when they found somebody who was a little more intelligent or a little more educated, that they were Jewish rather than Polish.</span> <span id="s363">So I said, “Uh oh, he knew, he knows that I am a Jew.”</span> <span id="s364">And so I kept insisting that I was a Pole.</span> <span id="s365">And he kept insisting that I was not.</span> <span id="s366">“No, you’re not.</span> <span id="s367">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s368">You’re not.”</span> <span id="s369">So finally, in desperation I pulled my German mother out again, and I said, “Well, I can tell you it’s, I’m trying to keep it a secret, but my mother was German, and she died in childbirth.</span> <span id="s370">And my father was Polish.”</span> <span id="s371">So he was so pleased with himself.</span> <span id="s372">And he said, “Ja, ich hab’es gewusst, I knew it.</span> <span id="s373">I knew it.”</span> <span id="s374">And so he bought this story.</span> <span id="s375">He asked me why I’m keeping it secret.</span> <span id="s376">I said, “Because my father was a Polish officer and was in a POW camp.</span> <span id="s377">So because, since he was a Polish officer I couldn’t very well get papers as a Volksdeutsche [ethnic German].</span> <span id="s378">Because most Poles, even if they had one German grandmother or great grandmother, immediately tried to get the papers of Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s379">It was the ethnic Germans, which immediately gave them some added privileges.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">And so he bought this story and he asked me where I wanted to work.</span> <span id="s381">I said, “I thought you had a job, a specific job.</span> <span id="s382">He says, “No, just tell me where you want to work.”</span> <span id="s383">So I mentioned a little town, which was really, it was a small town.</span> <span id="s384">It was a resort in the summer, but it was also a railroad junction, on the eastern part of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s385">And I said that’s where I wanted to work.</span> <span id="s386">And he called the stationmaster in that place and told him that he’s sending a young girl over there and to give me a job.</span> <span id="s387">I thanked this man and left.</span> <span id="s388">The next day I went to that stationmaster and I presented myself for work and he gave me an office of my own, and a desk, and treated me beautifully for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s389">And I just couldn’t believe my luck.</span> <span id="s390">And, because I knew that they didn’t even treat Poles or even Germans that well.</span> <span id="s391">And he, several days later he comes in and he tells me, “Hedwig,” that’s, they changed my name from Jadwiga, which was my Polish name, to Hedwig, which is germanized.</span> <span id="s392">He said, “Hedwig, Heinz is coming.”</span> <span id="s393">And I looked at him stupidly and I said, “Who?”</span> <span id="s394">And he said, “Heinz.”</span> <span id="s395">Now who is Heinz?</span> <span id="s396">And he laughed, and he said, “You know,” in a knowing way and kind of blinked and said, “Oh, you don’t know who Heinz is, huh?”</span> <span id="s397">And I said, “No, I don’t.”</span> <span id="s398">Anyway, it took a few minutes before I realized that I really didn’t know who that Heinz was.</span> <span id="s399">It happened to be that personnel director in, at, for the railroad.</span> <span id="s400">And apparently he was under the impression, since this Heinz, whatever his last name was, I don’t know, called and said he’s sending somebody for, to give me a job, he thought that I must have been a mistress of this Heinz.</span> <span id="s401">And that’s why he treated me that well.</span> <span id="s402">So when he realized that I didn’t even know who that Heinz was, he took the office, the desk, and everything away from me.</span> <span id="s403">But still I did get another desk, which I had to share with some other workers.</span> <span id="s404">And he turned out to be a pretty decent man.</span> <span id="s405">I mean he, I was put to work translating German directives into Polish.</span> <span id="s406">And then also, later on I was put in charge of extra ration cards, or stamps, that the Polish railroad workers were getting.</span> <span id="s407">And that helped me a great deal, because I quickly made another list and I stole many of these extra rations.</span> <span id="s408">I was put in charge of that whole thing, and I was able to supply some other people with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">First of all, I was able to get more for us.</span> <span id="s410">And, but I also was able to supply some other people with these ration cards.</span> <span id="s411">And I knew where the blank identity, railroad identity cards were kept, and where the stamp was kept.</span> <span id="s412">And I was able to steal some of those.</span> <span id="s413">And the friend that I, that helped me get in the beginning, when I got out of the ghetto, he had a connection with the underground.</span> <span id="s414">And I supplied him with these identity cards.</span> <span id="s415">And I made some for some other Jews that were in the area that I knew were hiding.</span> <span id="s416">We, I discovered a whole family in hiding, not far from where I was hiding my father.</span> <span id="s417">And they all got identity cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A matter of fact, one from this family was going out.</span> <span id="s419">He didn’t look Jewish, so he was moving freely.</span> <span id="s420">And he was caught by the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s421">But I understand that he was, he ate the whole card before he was interrogated.</span> <span id="s422">So, but when I learned that he was caught I thought that my life was in danger, because I knew that he had one, a card that I supplied.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">I was able to make, put, make some fake letters.</span> <span id="s424">I had there, a letterhead, you know, from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s425">And I tried to save my aunt and my cousin, who lived in Galicia.</span> <span id="s426">And they were in the ghetto there.</span> <span id="s427">And I made out the letter.</span> <span id="s428">I typed the letter on this official paper, that I was supposed to take them out of the ghetto and take them to Warsaw, because they used to be railroad workers and they knew certain things that the Gestapo is interested in knowing.</span> <span id="s429">It was a very crude way and really didn’t help anything, but it did give me some papers with which to go to Boryslaw and Drohobycz and Lvov [L’wow], where my father’s family was still in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">I made my way.</span> <span id="s431">I got, I traveled by train and I, just before we hit Lvov, some Ukrainians threw me out of the train.</span> <span id="s432">The train was still moving.</span> <span id="s433">I think they were suspecting of me being Jewish.</span> <span id="s434">So here I again had a close, very close encounter, with death, really.</span> <span id="s435">But after they had thrown me out, the train stopped; it didn’t have no entrance to that station.</span> <span id="s436">And I ran to the car, the wagon where the Germans, reserved for the Germans.</span> <span id="s437">And I got in.</span> <span id="s438">It was full of German soldiers.</span> <span id="s439">I got in and I, again, addressed them in German and said would they please give me refuge because there were some wild Ukrainian guys after me.</span> <span id="s440">And they saw a rather disheveled young girl, a teenager.</span> <span id="s441">And so they decided to give me refuge.</span> <span id="s442">They thought that these Ukrainians just wanted to have fun with a girl.</span> <span id="s443">They didn’t suspect me, that I was Jewish, and they didn’t suspect that the Ukrainians suspected me of being Jewish, and that’s why they threw me out in the first place.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">I made my way to the ghetto, in this little town.</span> <span id="s445">I bought, with the help of a farmer, who gave me a ladder and I climbed over the ladder in the middle of the night to get into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s446">And it’s funny, but this cousin, I had the papers, and some clothing for this cousin, who was about my age.</span> <span id="s447">I wanted to get and take her with me.</span> <span id="s448">But her parents were there and I couldn’t save both her parents, who looked rather Jewish.</span> <span id="s449">And I wanted to take first my cousin and find her place and then maybe later come back for her parents.</span> <span id="s450">But we couldn’t all travel, you know, four Jews together.</span> <span id="s451">And so I showed her the identity card and this special letter that I had.</span> <span id="s452">And that letter, I didn’t have opportunity to show to anybody, because nobody had stopped me up to that point.</span> <span id="s453">And, but she didn’t want to leave her, she didn’t want to leave her parents, so she refused.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">And then I went to Lvov, where I had an aunt.</span> <span id="s455">And at that time they had an Aktion, means a selection.</span> <span id="s456">And there was a lot of shooting and stuff.</span> <span id="s457">And I tried to make my way into the Jewish area.</span> <span id="s458">And I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s459">Frankly, I made it, I almost made it, and I got scared.</span> <span id="s460">And I didn’t go in.</span> <span id="s461">And I came back empty-handed, after a couple of bad experiences again with some Ukrainians who followed me, who suspected me of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s462">And again I jumped, twice I jumped into a German trolley car, pretending to be a German.</span> <span id="s463">And I always spoke German.</span> <span id="s464">And I made my way back to Warsaw and to this little town where we were living.</span> <span id="s465">My mother didn’t look too Jewish, but my father did.</span> <span id="s466">And besides that, it was almost more dangerous for a man to be outside, because all they had to do is pull their pants down and if somebody was circumcised he certainly was a Jew, because the Poles do not circumcise their males.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">I, we had dug a hole under the floor for my father to go in, in case, you know, if somebody came to the door.</span> <span id="s468">It was a old farm house that we had rented.</span> <span id="s469">The owner of that house, a peasant, knew me and my mother as sisters.</span> <span id="s470">And that came in quite handy at one point, because we had a couple of blackmail experiences.</span> <span id="s471">And at one time the, my mother was blackmailed.</span> <span id="s472">And the Gestapo came and they asked for, well, they asked for the people who lived there.</span> <span id="s473">And the farmer, but we got wind of that blackmail so my parents had left the night before, to another hiding place.</span> <span id="s474">But when they walked into this old farmhouse there was a ton of coal in the middle of the kitchen, which I managed to gather.</span> <span id="s475">Every day from, after work, I would fill a bag or a knapsack with coal.</span> <span id="s476">I would climb on the engine, on the train, and you know, most of the engines had coal.</span> <span id="s477">They were not electrified.</span> <span id="s478">And I would carry about forty or fifty pounds of coal, and take it home.</span> <span id="s479">And then my mother would either sell it directly for money or exchange it for some other food with the local farmers.</span> <span id="s480">But I had managed to get about a ton of coal.</span> <span id="s481">And then it was just piled in the middle of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s482">So when the Gestapo came, they asked how the coal got there.</span> <span id="s483">And that farmer who owned the house said well, the only thing he knows is that this Zoszak, which was my mother’s Polish name, had a sister who worked at the railroad station, and that I probably was the one, that the sister was the one who brought the coal, stole the coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">So the Gestapo came to the station where I was working and asked if there was a Zoszak employed.</span> <span id="s485">Now, my boss asked me, because I had all the lists of the employees.</span> <span id="s486">And when the Gestapo said, “Zoszak,” I was sure that they had caught my mother, because my mother’s name was Zoszak.</span> <span id="s487">And I had a list that, a special list, made out in pencil, and I pretended that that was Zoszak, and I said, “Yes, this woman used to work for us, but she isn’t working any more.”</span> <span id="s488">And I was sure it was my mother that they had caught.</span> <span id="s489">But it turns out later on, when I found out what happened, that they were really after me, because they expected me to have the same name.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">You want to interrupt it for a while?</span> <span id="s491">Because you...</span></p> <p><span id="s492">BZ: No, no, no!</span></p> <p><span id="s493">EM: You’re sleepy.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">BZ: I’m not sleepy!</span> <span id="s495">No, no, no, no!</span> <span id="s496">[unclear] Come on.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">EM: Well, I, so they actually were after me.</span> <span id="s498">But because the farmer thought we were sisters, he didn’t have my true name.</span> <span id="s499">Well I had several other experiences while I was working at the railroad.</span> <span id="s500">At one time they caught somebody whom they suspected of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s501">And they brought her to the, it was a woman.</span> <span id="s502">They brought her to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s503">And they sat her down in my office.</span> <span id="s504">And they told me to call the SD, the Sicherheitsdienst [Security Service].</span> <span id="s505">And I said I would.</span> <span id="s506">And I went...</span></p> <p><span id="s507">BZ: Who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EM: Hmm?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">BZ: Who were they SD?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">BZ: Who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">EM: Well, they, well now it wasn’t the, it was the “KRIPO,” the Kriminalpolizei.</span> <span id="s513">The police, the German police.</span> <span id="s514">It wasn’t the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s515">It was the German Polizei.</span> <span id="s516">Anyway, the man in charge of that in our town was a drunkard, and he had already the, you know, the alcoholic shakes and he was completely out.</span> <span id="s517">I mean he was an awful, awful man when he was drunk, I mean.</span> <span id="s518">He was extremely cruel, with the Poles and so on, because they were really, the Jews weren’t really his domain, so to speak.</span> <span id="s519">But anyway, at one time they got this woman and I couldn’t very well let her know that I was Jewish and that I was [unclear].</span> <span id="s520">She was terrified.</span> <span id="s521">And, but I didn’t say anything to her, and I just said yes, I would call the people in charge.</span> <span id="s522">And so they left me with it.</span> <span id="s523">And so I told her she should walk out.</span> <span id="s524">And she looked at me as if I were crazy, because, well, she thought I was a Pole.</span> <span id="s525">And I said, “Just run.”</span> <span id="s526">And I told her where to hide till night came.</span> <span id="s527">Because I knew the area pretty well.</span> <span id="s528">And she left.</span> <span id="s529">And then when my boss came back, he said did I call the KRIPO?</span> <span id="s530">And I said, “Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s531">But I had to go to the bathroom, and then when I came back she was gone.</span> <span id="s532">I think the KRIPO must have taken her.”</span></p> <p><span id="s533">BZ: Oh, that was marvelous!</span></p> <p><span id="s534">EM: So, he said, “Are you sure the KRIPO was here?”</span> <span id="s535">I said, “No, not really.”</span> <span id="s536">So he says to me, “Well, you know what that means?</span> <span id="s537">It means that we might have let some bandit go.”</span> <span id="s538">Because they got her with the suspicion that she was Jewish, but they didn’t call it that.</span> <span id="s539">They called the Jews bandits.</span> <span id="s540">So, that we let a bandit go.</span> <span id="s541">So I said, “Well, I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s542">I wasn’t, I’m not a god.</span> <span id="s543">I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s544">And I did call them.”</span> <span id="s545">So he says, “Well, you know what?</span> <span id="s546">Let’s not investigate it any.”</span> <span id="s547">That was the same guy, the head of the whole railroad station.</span> <span id="s548">“Let’s not pursue it any more, because if she escaped, it’s our fault.</span> <span id="s549">So let’s just leave it alone.</span> <span id="s550">And whatever happened, let’s think that everything went all right.</span> <span id="s551">And as long as we don’t know anything.”</span> <span id="s552">So I said, “Fine with me.”</span> <span id="s553">And this woman did go to that hideout place.</span> <span id="s554">And I knew that the underground was active there, and they helped her along from there.</span> <span id="s555">I also was able to get somebody from the underground to work their Morse machine, you know, the Morse Code when you...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">BZ: Oh, the Morse Code, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">EM: Yes, at the railroad.</span> <span id="s558">And there was a girl, and she was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s559">And she was also quite active in the underground and she knew, you know, how to work that thing.</span> <span id="s560">And they hired her.</span> <span id="s561">And through that, we knew when some important trains were coming by.</span> <span id="s562">She was relaying information for the people who should have known about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">BZ: Did they derail the trains and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">EM: Well, I don’t know if I, quite frankly, I don’t want to know if I was responsible for derailments or not.</span> <span id="s565">All I know is that we gave important information to the underground about some troop movements and some machinery going and so on, and what the partisans did further east, I don’t know if certain trains they definitely derailed, but they did get the information.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">BZ: Did, what- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s567">BZ: Did, were you aware of an underground in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">EM: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s569">I was aware when they were staying of, thoughts of resistance, when the young people were getting together.</span> <span id="s570">We had a couple of meetings of what to do, but I was not in the thick of organizing and resistance in the ghetto itself.</span> <span id="s571">It was more on a, I would say more on a philosophical basis when I was there.</span> <span id="s572">That was in the early spring, or should we, shouldn’t we?</span> <span id="s573">What can be done?</span> <span id="s574">There was no definite planning at that time.</span> <span id="s575">I guess there was, but not among my friends.</span> <span id="s576">Among my friends it was all that intellectual part of business, what can be done, you know, these discussions or, about the plus and minus of armed resistance and so on.</span> <span id="s577">But, and my relation with the resistance movement outside of the ghetto was not a direct one.</span> <span id="s578">I knew one person who was in the underground.</span> <span id="s579">And whatever I did, I just gave him.</span> <span id="s580">But I wasn’t involved in any, in a close way.</span> <span id="s581">I mean I supplied some ID cards.</span> <span id="s582">I supplied some ration cards.</span> <span id="s583">And then I got a job for this one person who worked in the, with the Morse and so on, so that, you know, through her I guess I was involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">BZ: But the underground was involved when you escaped.</span> <span id="s585">The person that you escaped to, was she involved?</span> <span id="s586">It was a woman and her son?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s588">But they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s589">BZ: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s590">EM: They were the son...there was...the woman wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s591">The son was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s592">The father was Jewish, but he escaped to the States before the war.</span> <span id="s593">And he, I think he left his wife.</span> <span id="s594">I don’t know if it was really an escape.</span> <span id="s595">I think he was, they weren’t divorced, but he left.</span> <span id="s596">So the son was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s597">But he wasn’t brought up as Jewish.</span> <span id="s598">But he had contact with the, I don’t how active he was in the underground, but he had contact with the underground, and he had access to fake identity cards, because we got our cards through him, the first ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">I had, you know, there were many cases of blackmail.</span> <span id="s600">I was renting or subletting a room in an apartment which belonged to a Polish policeman, actually.</span> <span id="s601">And there were just French doors connecting my room with the rest of the apartment.</span> <span id="s602">And it wasn’t really subletting it.</span> <span id="s603">I was renting this one room which used to be part of this apartment, and the rest of the apartment was rented by this policeman.</span> <span id="s604">And the administrator of this house, this house used to belong to Jews.</span> <span id="s605">And the administrator of this house, in the beginning, was extremely friendly.</span> <span id="s606">And then I learned of an apartment in this big building, an empty apartment, and I had another Jewish friend who escaped from the ghetto, whom I knew from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s607">And he and his mother and sister were hiding.</span> <span id="s608">And they were in need of an apartment.</span> <span id="s609">So I procured this apartment for them.</span> <span id="s610">But they looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s611">And from that time on the administrator suspected me of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s612">Up to that point I don’t think he knew that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s613">And then he started to suspect me.</span> <span id="s614">Because he did rent them the place.</span> <span id="s615">And I think he suspected them of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s616">And I think that they paid quite a bit of money later on.</span> <span id="s617">But since I was the one to bring these people to him, he started to suspect me of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s618">And one day he came to my little room and he thought he was probably, get himself a mistress very cheap, you know.</span> <span id="s619">And he started to make advances.</span> <span id="s620">And then he started to talk about Jews, that he does not really hate Jews, they are also people, they’re people like everybody else.</span> <span id="s621">And then he slowly brought the subject up, if I agreed to live with him he would protect me.</span> <span id="s622">He wouldn’t throw me out.</span> <span id="s623">And I had to make a choice, if I wanted to be a mistress of a 55-year-old, ugly, toothless Pole who had a family and maybe seven kids, or not!</span> <span id="s624">And so when he finally came out with it, and he made a move, he wanted to kiss me, I slapped, and I looked at his teeth.</span> <span id="s625">I still remember his half-rotten teeth.</span> <span id="s626">He was approaching me and I slapped him real hard in the face.</span> <span id="s627">And I said to him, “You dirty old man!</span> <span id="s628">And how dare you!</span> <span id="s629">What makes you think that I am Jewish?”</span> <span id="s630">And I started to yell at him and I threw him out and said, “If he bothers me once more not only will I go to his wife and tell her, but I’ll go to the police, and tell them that he is willing to hide a Jew!”</span> <span id="s631">[laughter] And that guy got so scared or thrown back, because he really figured that if I was Jewish, I would just submit, and I would do anything to not to be discovered.</span> <span id="s632">But he was so shaken that I guess he really had his doubts, so he was convinced that I was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s633">And he was afraid I might tell his wife or go to the police.</span> <span id="s634">So he left me alone.</span> <span id="s635">But I did tell the other people then, that it’s dangerous to be there.</span> <span id="s636">And a couple days later they found another place and moved out.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Another experience I had was with a Volksdeutscher, who was an ethnic German who suspected my mother of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s638">And at that time we had no other place to go.</span> <span id="s639">You know, usually we had one or two places where we could escape when things got very bad.</span> <span id="s640">But my mother came to me and she says, “This woman is making, or talking in the neighborhood that she is going to get this Jew,” and what should she do?</span> <span id="s641">Now I knew a German officer, who used to go to the, take the train quite often.</span> <span id="s642">And he was a, some kind of an instructor, at an army training base or something that was in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s643">And he, I knew his name, and I knew where he was stationed.</span> <span id="s644">He used to be an instructor in philosophy at the university in, I think in Halle it was.</span> <span id="s645">And, well, I guess I should go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s646">At one time I was trying to take a train from Warsaw to Otwock, and I was waiting.</span> <span id="s647">And the trains were coming.</span> <span id="s648">They were packed full.</span> <span id="s649">And I couldn’t get on the train.</span> <span id="s650">I mean they wouldn’t just let anybody on any more.</span> <span id="s651">And I had to go back because my parents were hiding, they were in hiding and, you know, they would be scared silly if I didn’t come back at night.</span> <span id="s652">And they...</span></p> <p><span id="s653">BZ: Were they in hiding together?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">EM: Yeah, they were in, at that time they were in hiding.</span> <span id="s655">Sometimes they were and sometimes they weren’t.</span> <span id="s656">At that time they were together.</span> <span id="s657">But they expected me back that evening.</span> <span id="s658">And it was getting late and our curfew and what not.</span> <span id="s659">And I didn’t really have where to go.</span> <span id="s660">So, I, a couple of trains went by and then these two officers came and waited on the platform.</span> <span id="s661">And I had a book by Kant, a German, you know, philosopher.</span> <span id="s662">And I was into philosophy at that time.</span> <span id="s663">And I had this book with me.</span> <span id="s664">And they noticed that, and they made some remark.</span> <span id="s665">And they wanted to get acquainted.</span> <span id="s666">So in the beginning I ignored them completely.</span> <span id="s667">But then when I saw that it was really getting late and that I, when another train came, and while I was waiting, and they were already moving to get into the train, and I couldn’t get in so I let the book drop.</span> <span id="s668">And they picked it up.</span> <span id="s669">And so they gave it to me and they, you know, they had seen before it was Kant and it was in German.</span> <span id="s670">So they started to talk and I smiled prettily and then I said something, “Well, yes, I read Kant.”</span> <span id="s671">And do they know anything?</span> <span id="s672">And they started to talk but the train was ready to move.</span> <span id="s673">We had a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s674">So, I said, “Well, it’s a pity we can’t discuss Kant, but I can’t get into that train,” you know.</span> <span id="s675">And so they said, “Oh, come with us.</span> <span id="s676">Come with us as our guest,” you know, there, because they were allowed to have somebody with them.</span> <span id="s677">So I said, “O.K.” You know, so we got into that compartment for the Germans and we discussed Kant.</span> <span id="s678">And they were very interested, especially this one guy.</span> <span id="s679">He was middle-aged.</span> <span id="s680">And, as I say, he used to be an instructor in philosophy.</span> <span id="s681">And so he was very impressed and then, but somehow I let them know that I didn’t like the Germans and they tried to convince me that the Germans are nice.</span> <span id="s682">And he asked me where I lived.</span> <span id="s683">And I wouldn’t tell him.</span> <span id="s684">But a couple days later he saw me at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s685">So he figured out where I work.</span> <span id="s686">And he had to go to Warsaw quite often.</span> <span id="s687">So very frequently I would find a fish, smoked fish, or some sausage, in my drawer.</span> <span id="s688">It was his way of proving that the Germans aren’t all bad.</span> <span id="s689">[laughter] So when I came to the office I smelled the fish in my drawer, I knew what that was, that here are the good Germans!</span></p> <p><span id="s690">So, anyway, I had a few conversations at the railroad station and he was always going somewhere and I was working.</span> <span id="s691">And when this, my mother came, so desperate that she didn’t have where to go and that this woman really means business with that blackmail.</span> <span id="s692">And she didn’t even want the blackmail; she threatened she is going to go the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s693">I called up and I called this base there and I asked if I could speak with this lieutenant Osthus was his name.</span> <span id="s694">And he came to the phone and I said I want to talk to him.</span> <span id="s695">And he came.</span> <span id="s696">And I said that it’s very important.</span> <span id="s697">Because he had once said, “Well, if you ever,” I also told him that my mother was a German, you know, the same German old story and my father was a P.O.W. Yeah, a P.O.W. So, and he was very intent on proving that the Germans are good people, and that I should become a Volksdeutsche and this, since I have German blood in me.</span> <span id="s698">And anyway, so he said if I ever need him, I should call him.</span> <span id="s699">And I had told him that I lived with my cousin.</span> <span id="s700">My mother was my cousin, really, but for the owner of the house she was, you know, I was a sister and here I was a cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Anyway, I called him and he came and I said, “Look, I am in trouble.</span> <span id="s702">You know we are from out of town.</span> <span id="s703">We’re not from this area.</span> <span id="s704">And some Volksdeutschers suspect us as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s705">And you know what happens to people who are suspected.</span> <span id="s706">We have no close friends that could vouch for us that we’re not Jewish.</span> <span id="s707">And you know what the Gestapo will do, will take us to, send us away and we couldn’t prove that we’re not.</span> <span id="s708">And so can you, do you have a way of helping, you know?”</span> <span id="s709">And he said, “That’s ridiculous!</span> <span id="s710">You are Jewish?</span> <span id="s711">That’s ridiculous!”</span> <span id="s712">And when I think of it, it was quite a chutzpah to go to a German officer, to tell him, “Help me, because somebody suspects I am Jewish, which I am not.”</span> <span id="s713">And that’s what it really amounted to.</span> <span id="s714">So he said, “Come with me.</span> <span id="s715">Show me where this woman lives.”</span> <span id="s716">And he had never met my mother before.</span> <span id="s717">He just knew that I lived with a cousin.</span> <span id="s718">And my mother, you know, I went there.</span> <span id="s719">I called my mother out.</span> <span id="s720">My father was hiding under the ground in the hole at the time, and my mother came out.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">BZ: Under the ground of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">EM: And my, yeah, because we had dug out that hole which also was quite a job because we had a little tiny shovel and spoons and everything.</span> <span id="s723">And at night you had to go and put it in the forest, you know, so as not to show any dirt or [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s724">BZ: Put all the dirt in the forest, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EM: Put all the dirt in the forest.</span> <span id="s726">But anyway, we went with this German to that woman.</span> <span id="s727">And she, what I always say, she is a Volksdeutsche, but she didn’t know any German.</span> <span id="s728">And he started to speak German with her.</span> <span id="s729">And here she’s, “Huh?</span> <span id="s730">Huh?”</span> <span id="s731">Not a word.</span> <span id="s732">And she didn’t know any German.</span> <span id="s733">He got real mad.</span> <span id="s734">Well, maybe she understood some, but anyway, he got so mad.</span> <span id="s735">And he said, “If you ever, ever accuse these people of being Jewish, I’m going to take you personally to the Gestapo and accuse you as a Jew!</span> <span id="s736">And you’d better apologize to these ladies!”</span> <span id="s737">And she threw herself on the floor, and started to kiss, well, first she grabbed my hand and I put her away.</span> <span id="s738">Then she threw herself on the floor.</span> <span id="s739">Then my mother gave her a few little kicks [laughter].</span> <span id="s740">I never forgot it.</span> <span id="s741">My mother gave her a shoe.</span> <span id="s742">And she was just all over the floor, kissing my mother’s shoe.</span> <span id="s743">And she said, no, she never, she never, she didn’t really mean it.</span> <span id="s744">It was just a joke.</span> <span id="s745">And I’m Polish.</span> <span id="s746">And I was the one to translate it.</span> <span id="s747">And he says, and he kept on and said, “Maybe you are Jewish!</span> <span id="s748">You say you’re a Volksdeutsche and you don’t know any...”</span></p> <p><span id="s749">BZ: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">EM: German and so on.</span> <span id="s751">Anyway, when we came out of her house, he had this, he came with his bicycle.</span> <span id="s752">And we came out of the house.</span> <span id="s753">The, his bicycle was full of flowers.</span> <span id="s754">All the Poles around there, they really hated this woman, because she was denouncing them and you know, whenever something, there was a, whatever they did that wasn’t quite legal, she would always denounce them to the police and what not.</span> <span id="s755">So they really hated her.</span> <span id="s756">So when he came out [unclear] his bicycle was full of flowers that the Poles put on it.</span> <span id="s757">And we never had trouble from this woman any more.</span> <span id="s758">Well, not directly, but I don’t know if she didn’t pass the word to other ones, because we did have trouble later on.</span> <span id="s759">And as I say, we had to abandon that place.</span> <span id="s760">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s761">BZ: How long were you there, in this particular house?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">EM: Well, I think since, oh, about March of ‘43 till about May or June of ‘44.</span> <span id="s763">I don’t remember the exact dates.</span> <span id="s764">As I say, we were there and then we moved somewhere else.</span> <span id="s765">My father [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s766">BZ: March of ‘43 till May or June of ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">EM: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s768">And then we had, well, at one, I think in April of ‘44 we had one very bad experience there.</span> <span id="s769">And that was when some Poles came and, early in the morning, and they walked in.</span> <span id="s770">And my mother could see them come.</span> <span id="s771">Somehow they, she suspected.</span> <span id="s772">I think that some dogs started to bark, because the house was in the middle of like a field, there was like a farm house.</span> <span id="s773">So there was a lot of fields around and you could see who approached it.</span> <span id="s774">And a dog started to bark.</span> <span id="s775">And my mother looked out and saw these Poles come.</span> <span id="s776">So my father immediately jumped into that hole that we had dug out.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">BZ: Out of what, out of the living room floor?</span> <span id="s778">Was it in the living room?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">EM: Yes, it was in the, there were actually only two rooms.</span> <span id="s780">One was a big kitchen.</span> <span id="s781">It was like a farm kitchen, which was just about all taken up with that coal that I dragged back in.</span> <span id="s782">And then there was one room.</span> <span id="s783">And that served as a dining room and a bedroom and everything else.</span> <span id="s784">We also had trouble, there was a toilet, the toilet was outside of the house, was an outhouse.</span> <span id="s785">And well, my mother could use it.</span> <span id="s786">But this farmer who lived in a house, a couple of, maybe 100 yards away, had no idea that my father was hiding there.</span> <span id="s787">So my father couldn’t use it.</span> <span id="s788">So my father had to go on a potty and at night my mother had to use, run to empty it.</span> <span id="s789">You know.</span> <span id="s790">But anyway, this, we had dug a hole in the middle of the floor.</span> <span id="s791">First we cut out the floor.</span> <span id="s792">It was just a wooden floor.</span> <span id="s793">And my mother and I had prepared that place before my father even left the ghetto.</span> <span id="s794">And we dug that hole with a little shovel and spoons and everything and then emptied the dirt in the forest at night.</span> <span id="s795">And then we made a cover for it.</span> <span id="s796">And so we weren’t carpenters, really.</span> <span id="s797">So it wasn’t like a trap door.</span> <span id="s798">It was just another big piece of wood made out of boards.</span> <span id="s799">And, which we put on top of that.</span> <span id="s800">And then we had one, a little rug.</span> <span id="s801">And we put that on top of that, and a table on top of that.</span> <span id="s802">And the table had a long table cloth that reached just to the floor, so you couldn’t even see that the floor was uneven.</span> <span id="s803">And that was the hiding place in case, once in a while the farmer came or so.</span> <span id="s804">My father would hide there and we all, we had the doors bolted, you know, so it would always take a while before you opened the door and you pretend you were washing.</span> <span id="s805">There was always some water and, we didn’t have a sink.</span> <span id="s806">The water had to be taken in from a well.</span> <span id="s807">And so my mother always kept some water in one, in a wash basin.</span> <span id="s808">And the farmer is the only one that we couldn’t see approach because the house was in the back.</span> <span id="s809">So, but whenever he came my father would, my mother would first ask, “Who is there?”</span> <span id="s810">And then she would splash water and pretend that she was just washing.</span> <span id="s811">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s812">He must have thought she was very clean because she washed whatever hour of the day or night.</span> <span id="s813">And then in the meantime my father would hide.</span> <span id="s814">But he didn’t come very often.</span> <span id="s815">And, but this one time when they came, and I had another place, the one that I, the one that was connected with this apartment, you know, the one that I had mentioned before...</span></p> <p><span id="s816">BZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">EM: This Polish administrator.</span> <span id="s818">So, I spent my time partly with my parents and partly with, in this other place, that I kept.</span> <span id="s819">And when we suspected that somebody is suspecting us, my father would come to me and also stay, and stay under the bed, just as he stayed with that prostitute.</span> <span id="s820">I don’t think I mentioned that before.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">BZ: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">EM: When he first came out of the ghetto he was hiding in Warsaw for several weeks—I forgot, nine weeks or something, I forgot how long—with, in the house of a prostitute, which we thought would take the money for it.</span> <span id="s823">And he had to hide under her bed and it was not, she never wanted any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">BZ: And she was no member, was she a connection from the underground?</span> <span id="s825">Or you just approached her because she was a prostitute?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">EM: No, well, we got her name through this friend of mine.</span> <span id="s827">She wasn’t a member of the underground.</span> <span id="s828">But I guess maybe the underground had used her before, because we didn’t have many connections with prostitutes!</span></p> <p><span id="s829">BZ: No, but she was willing to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">EM: She got the name, yeah, she was willing to help and I suspect she, my father wasn’t the first one or the last one that she helped.</span> <span id="s831">A matter of fact, she would take clients in while there were people hiding under the bed.</span> <span id="s832">And she didn’t want any money.</span> <span id="s833">On the other hand, I had, when my father first came out of the ghetto, oh, even, gee, I forgot so many things.</span> <span id="s834">My father first escaped the ghetto in January of ‘43.</span> <span id="s835">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s836">BZ: And you escaped about October of ‘43?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">EM: I, beginning of November.</span> <span id="s838">And my mother escaped, I don’t know, I think it must have been December.</span> <span id="s839">And then my father came out in January.</span> <span id="s840">And we were hiding in one apartment.</span> <span id="s841">And somehow, and I swear I don’t remember how, I mean, I have a complete block, we got word from this Neumann, who was a director at Schultz, that he knows where we are and that if my father doesn’t come back to finish this accounting for Schultz, he will denounce all of us, you know.</span> <span id="s842">And I had forgotten about this incident completely until the other day we were talking with my mother about it.</span> <span id="s843">Anyway, my father went back to the ghetto, because he was scared that they would really, oh, that he was told to come back and that Neumann promises him he is going to see to it that he gets out in time.</span> <span id="s844">And I guess at that time we already knew that, you know, the ghetto will be liquidated, because the first resistance, there was an action in January, too.</span> <span id="s845">So, my father went back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s846">And I don’t even know how he went back.</span> <span id="s847">And I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t go back by car.</span> <span id="s848">That they sent for him.</span> <span id="s849">And he went back in the ghetto because he was doing all this accounting that, all these crooked accounting for Schultz.</span> <span id="s850">And, but then he wanted to come out and they didn’t want to let him out.</span> <span id="s851">They wanted more.</span> <span id="s852">And it was getting very bad.</span> <span id="s853">And that’s when he again came out through that same truck, with that same truck that I came on.</span> <span id="s854">So he came out, I think in the end of February, anyway, before the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">And between then and until we moved them into this farmhouse, he stayed with this prostitute.</span> <span id="s856">But while he was still in the ghetto, I went to a friend of ours, “friend,” somebody that my father was very close to.</span> <span id="s857">It was a business associate.</span> <span id="s858">And he used to come to us and play chess with my father and we had him over for Sunday dinner very frequently, him and his wife.</span> <span id="s859">They were Gentiles.</span> <span id="s860">They were Poles.</span> <span id="s861">And they were always very, very Polish, such Polish patriots.</span> <span id="s862">You know, nobody was Polish enough for them.</span> <span id="s863">But my father considered him as a friend.</span> <span id="s864">He didn’t even suspect him of being antisemitic or anything like that.</span> <span id="s865">He was a highly-educated man.</span> <span id="s866">And I learned that while we were in the ghetto he became a Volksdeutsche, like so many Poles did.</span> <span id="s867">And he was a big shot.</span> <span id="s868">And I learned where he was.</span> <span id="s869">So I went to him, with the idea, you know, if he could help to get my father out of the ghetto, and if he could help later to set us up somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">And he was very nice.</span> <span id="s871">His wife was on winter vacation.</span> <span id="s872">This was in the winter so she went somewhere on winter vacation, to Swi-, well I don’t know where, but skiing.</span> <span id="s873">And he was alone in the house.</span> <span id="s874">And we were talking and it got late and he said, “Well, why don’t you sleep over?”</span> <span id="s875">And I consider him a friend of my father.</span> <span id="s876">He was my father’s age.</span> <span id="s877">And I knew him from the time I was a little kid.</span> <span id="s878">And there was, a curfew was on.</span> <span id="s879">So I said, “Fine,” you know, and I went to his, he had this son who was somewhere in school or something.</span> <span id="s880">Anyway, I went, he told me which bed to go to, you know, [unclear] bed.</span> <span id="s881">He did have a maid in the house, who slept in the maid’s room.</span> <span id="s882">Anyway, I went to bed and no sooner did I hit the sack when he came in and he wanted to lie down with me.</span> <span id="s883">So, I ran out.</span> <span id="s884">I wasn’t even dressed.</span> <span id="s885">I just got my clothes and ran.</span> <span id="s886">And then I stayed the whole night in the, on the steps on an adjacent building, because I was afraid to walk.</span> <span id="s887">It was late.</span> <span id="s888">I couldn’t walk in the street at that time.</span> <span id="s889">So I slept on the steps.</span> <span id="s890">So that here on one side was my father’s very good friend who wanted to rape me or sleep with me.</span> <span id="s891">On the other hand there was that prostitute who didn’t even want any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s893">EM: So there were always experiences like that.</span> <span id="s894">And I had one experience that, as I say, that building that I moved into was, belonged to a Jew.</span> <span id="s895">And he was shot.</span> <span id="s896">And the owner.</span> <span id="s897">… And that Jew [she meant to say building] was administered by this Pole.</span> <span id="s898">And I, we found this family, and the one that we were helping out, the name was Silver.</span> <span id="s899">And they were hiding in a farmhouse not far.</span> <span id="s900">And they were the owners.</span> <span id="s901">The father was shot, and there was the mother, a daughter, and two sons.</span> <span id="s902">And one son was free.</span> <span id="s903">His name was Paul.</span> <span id="s904">And he was, you know, he didn’t look too Jewish.</span> <span id="s905">He was the one that I gave the identity card and he ate it or something...</span></p> <p><span id="s906">BZ: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">EM: The Gestapo, he didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s908">And this other brother looked very Jewish, so he never left the house.</span> <span id="s909">And he was the one that, well, they were the ones that I would always help, always bring food in and bring coal and give them the identity cards and what not.</span> <span id="s910">But before Paul was taken to the Gestapo he knew of some gold watches and some money that his father had buried, not far from the house.</span> <span id="s911">And, but he was afraid to be seen there because he was the son of the owner.</span> <span id="s912">You know, and he, they knew that he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s913">But since I lived in this house, one night he asked me to come out.</span> <span id="s914">And we went into the garden and sat on the grass and pretended that we were, he knew where that was.</span> <span id="s915">And we pretended that we were lovers.</span> <span id="s916">So we were, when somebody walked by us, so it was getting, it wasn’t curfew time yet, but it was getting dark.</span> <span id="s917">So we pretended to kiss and what not.</span> <span id="s918">And somebody walked by and when the coast was clear, so to speak, he was digging.</span> <span id="s919">And he dug that, these watches out and some money.</span> <span id="s920">And I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s921">He gave me as a “payment,” he gave me a pair of silk stockings.</span> <span id="s922">You know, which were a big thing.</span> <span id="s923">And I had never worn silk stockings until then.</span> <span id="s924">And I was saving them and saving them and they survived till long after the war when I wanted to, finally wanted to put them on, they all fell apart!</span> <span id="s925">They all fell apart.</span> <span id="s926">So, anyways.</span> <span id="s927">So that was kind of funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">But this man, this son, the whole family is, well, not the whole family, but the mother and the two kids, survived.</span> <span id="s929">And the younger son had a brewery.</span> <span id="s930">And then they were very rich people.</span> <span id="s931">And they had a brewery in Lublin.</span> <span id="s932">And then after the Russians marched in, he gave my father his first job after the war, [unclear].</span> <span id="s933">It wasn’t even after the war.</span> <span id="s934">The war was still going on, but we were liberated by the Russians early.</span> <span id="s935">And after we were liberated we made our way to Lublin, and that’s where this Silver family had a brewery.</span> <span id="s936">And although it was taken, it was nationalized, he, since he was the son and he knew the brewery business, he was a big administrator and he gave my father a job in there, in the brewery business.</span> <span id="s937">I don’t know what happened to them later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s939">What else?</span> <span id="s940">What was I talking about?</span> <span id="s941">[unclear; tape off then on; noise] I am afraid the whole thing is pretty disorganized because I mixed up.</span> <span id="s942">I’ll tell you what comes to my mind.</span> <span id="s943">There was one incident that was quite tragic for me personally.</span> <span id="s944">I, well I worked at a railroad station.</span> <span id="s945">I mean, I worked at the railroad translating things and doing office work.</span> <span id="s946">But to make some extra money, on Sundays I would go to a, other little resort town, which was quite popular, over the weekend, and was selling tickets.</span> <span id="s947">And frequently at that time, well first of all I got paid for that.</span> <span id="s948">The pay was good.</span> <span id="s949">But in addition to that, very frequently when people were buying tickets, and they were in a rush to make the train or they were in a good mood and they were high, they had some couple of beers under their belt, they wouldn’t wait for the change.</span> <span id="s950">Or they would give you a good tip, you know.</span> <span id="s951">The ticket was, I forgot how much it cost, but let’s say if it cost $2.20 they would give you three zloty.</span> <span id="s952">That wasn’t so much zlotys, whatever it was, the change, they often they didn’t pick up the change.</span> <span id="s953">And if they were in a good mood they would even leave some really extra.</span> <span id="s954">So it was a good way of making extra money.</span> <span id="s955">And I had a very good friend who was kind of connected with the underground.</span> <span id="s956">And I was very close to him.</span> <span id="s957">I, anyway, he usually accompanied me to that railroad office, to that ticket.</span> <span id="s958">And this one Sunday we were walking to that station.</span> <span id="s959">And I remember I found a penny.</span> <span id="s960">And I picked it up.</span> <span id="s961">And I wanted to give it to him and he said, “No, that’s for good luck.”</span> <span id="s962">Now, it wasn’t that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Anyway, one day while I was at the, all, at the, selling the tickets, I noticed a girl with whom I went to school.</span> <span id="s964">She was a Gentile girl.</span> <span id="s965">And she must have recognized me, because she looked and she looked and then she asked a couple of questions as if to try to hear my voice and maybe recognize me by my manner of speaking.</span> <span id="s966">And they were stupid questions, so I knew that she suspected something.</span> <span id="s967">But I pretended that I didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s968">And I did look a little different.</span> <span id="s969">My hair was bleached, and I was a couple years older.</span> <span id="s970">And, yeah, and my, af-, in that evening I told this friend of mine that I think somebody recognized me.</span> <span id="s971">And he said, “Please don’t go again, because she might report you or, you know.”</span> <span id="s972">And I said, “Well, that’s silly.</span> <span id="s973">I never had any fights with this girl.</span> <span id="s974">We weren’t that friendly, but I certainly, you know, I mean she’s just a classmate and she has no reason to really, to denounce me.”</span> <span id="s975">And he begged me, but I didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s976">And the next Sunday I went and as we were walking I found that penny and I remember, I tried to give it to him for good luck and he gave it to me for good luck.</span> <span id="s977">And I finally forced it into his hand for good luck.</span> <span id="s978">And I went, walked into that little ticket office, and as I, and as I was selling, I heard this commotion and, on the side of that little building.</span> <span id="s979">And somebody burst into the office that there are some Germans fighting with this boy.</span> <span id="s980">And it was his way of really alerting me that there was danger.</span> <span id="s981">Apparently they came, they were in German uniforms but they weren’t real, they weren’t even real Germans.</span> <span id="s982">I think they were either Ukrainians or somebody but they were in uniform.</span> <span id="s983">And I saw her, this girl, who was standing to the side.</span> <span id="s984">And I heard this shuffling of feet and fighting and then I saw that one guy with a gun drawn.</span> <span id="s985">And he was kneeling right in front of that little window where I was selling the tickets.</span> <span id="s986">And I saw the gun and a minute later as they, the two of them were fighting, they came out from behind that wall and there was a shot and he was shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">And there was a lot of commotion.</span> <span id="s988">And people who were there surrounded these Germans.</span> <span id="s989">That was in July of 1944 when, and the Russians were approaching.</span> <span id="s990">So at that time there was more resistance already among the Poles, and more hatred and open resistance.</span> <span id="s991">So they surrounded these Germans and yelling at them.</span> <span id="s992">And I just ran out to this, to the boy.</span> <span id="s993">And he was dead.</span> <span id="s994">Because he was shot right in the head.</span> <span id="s995">But his fist was clenched and I opened the fist and here is that penny.</span> <span id="s996">Ever since then I don’t like to pick up pennies.</span> <span id="s997">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s998">BZ: This boy wasn’t Jewish, was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">EM: No, he wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1000">Anyway, he was dead.</span> <span id="s1001">And I ran off.</span> <span id="s1002">And I guess the girl got scared later on, because I didn’t go back to this office.</span> <span id="s1003">And I, because I was afraid that they would, you know, find me and they’d come, the Gestapo would come anyway for me.</span> <span id="s1004">And so I went and escaped to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1005">And my parents had this blackmail a couple of weeks earlier and they had moved to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1006">So we went to, we lived in Warsaw and I just didn’t go back to work at all any more and I just hid.</span> <span id="s1007">But even then in Warsaw, two weeks later we had a very bad blackmail.</span> <span id="s1008">And some Poles came in and they said that they knew that we were Jewish and that they’re going to report us.</span> <span id="s1009">And they already, it was a terrible, terrible night.</span> <span id="s1010">And then finally they didn’t report us, but we were, well we threatened them.</span> <span id="s1011">We said, “If you will report us, we have friends in the underground.”</span> <span id="s1012">And something, and they know that if something happens to us, they know who would be the ones.</span> <span id="s1013">Because it lasted the whole night.</span> <span id="s1014">And we told them that we wrote down the name and put it in a hidden place that only we and the underground knew about.</span> <span id="s1015">So that we put down their names of these, we knew these people who were blackmailing us.</span> <span id="s1016">They were neighbors.</span> <span id="s1017">So if something happened to us, the underground would get after them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">And then we escaped, again, over the roof.</span> <span id="s1019">And my father was in pajamas.</span> <span id="s1020">And they took everything.</span> <span id="s1021">And we escaped and went back to that other town and we just had to find hiding places.</span> <span id="s1022">But we had a few prepared and, as I say, we did have some friends who were willing to help us for a night or two nights.</span> <span id="s1023">But soon after that the Russians marched in.</span> <span id="s1024">And actually, it was good.</span> <span id="s1025">I mean, that last blackmail was a, in a way it was a blessing in disguise, because if not for that we would have been caught in Warsaw, and we wouldn’t have been liberated for a half a year or more because of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">BZ: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1027">Boy, that’s a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">EM: Because of that blackmail we made our way back to that first town, in Swider and, oh, we hid there and I was hiding my father there in this little room that I had.</span> <span id="s1029">And that’s when my father was sleeping, you know, under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">BZ: Under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">EM: And my mother was hiding with the Silver family.</span> <span id="s1032">We went to the Silver family and was hiding there.</span> <span id="s1033">But we knew that it was bad already because they, we could hear the Russian artillery at that time.</span> <span id="s1034">But that’s the reason we were liberated in July of ‘44, rather than maybe in January or later in ‘45, because the Russians stopped on the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s1035">They didn’t cross the Vistula River and didn’t take Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1036">And the uprising started in Warsaw, the Polish uprising, started in ‘44, the end of ‘44 in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1037">And many, many people were killed.</span> <span id="s1038">And so, I don’t know if we would have survived if we hadn’t had that one blackmail that made us go back...</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">BZ: Hmm, that is really... How did you react to liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">EM: Well, with a depression, I guess, because there was no reason for living any more after the Russians marched in and we were free.</span> <span id="s1041">Of course we couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1042">I remember I, yeah, I walked in the street and I found a friend of mine with whom I went to these secret course, you know, in the, went to school and she was a ghetto friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1043">And it turned out that she was in hiding a couple of miles away.</span> <span id="s1044">But the whole family looked Jewish, so they never left that place.</span> <span id="s1045">But they were quite wealthy and they paid that farmer to hide them.</span> <span id="s1046">But anyway, I met her in the street and I couldn’t believe that she survived.</span> <span id="s1047">I mean it was my, I was extremely happy.</span> <span id="s1048">Well, we embraced and then we cried and then we wrote down all our thoughts of why we survived and our feelings about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1049">And we couldn’t see any reason for really living.</span> <span id="s1050">We couldn’t really.</span> <span id="s1051">We wondered what happiness was and, you know, again, this was one of those friends who was in that intellectual-philosophical circle.</span> <span id="s1052">So we tried to find a reason for living.</span> <span id="s1053">Because there was no reason any more.</span> <span id="s1054">You know, after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">And then the Russians opened a med school.</span> <span id="s1056">They established a med school, Curie Sklodovska University.</span> <span id="s1057">And both this friend of mine and I were enrolled.</span> <span id="s1058">So we studied medicine for a year, yeah, in Poland.</span> <span id="s1059">And her brother also studied.</span> <span id="s1060">We all started medical school at the same time.</span> <span id="s1061">But then after, when the war ended, we heard that in the U.S. Zone of Germany, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Organization is supporting students while they go to a university.</span> <span id="s1062">And I made my way out of Poland and studied in Marburg.</span> <span id="s1063">So I [unclear].</span> <span id="s1064">And after the war I made my way and studied in Germany.</span> <span id="s1065">And this friend of mine, she went to England and from there she went to Australia and she lives in Australia now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">BZ: She went to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">EM: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">BZ: And you had a friend that when you were in Poland, in these secret schools, you had a friend who was killed [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">EM: Yes.</span> <span id="s1070">I had, well, one whole group was found out and shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1071">And one girl from this sec-, from this school, when I made my way out of the ghetto, she came and she got out and I remember bleaching her hair because she had dark hair and we bleached her hair and we tried very hard to make her look Gentile.</span> <span id="s1072">And she didn’t look too Jewish once she had her bleached hair, but she couldn’t take the pressure of living outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">BZ: The double life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">EM: And, the double life, because every time somebody looked at her she thought that they suspected her and she just found it too hard.</span> <span id="s1075">And she went back into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1076">And I understand that she was active in the underground, in the uprising.</span> <span id="s1077">And she was killed during the uprising, but supposedly with weapons in her hand.</span> <span id="s1078">So, but she, maybe I didn’t say it, but she chose to go back, because she couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1079">At that time she wasn’t active in the underground, you know.</span> <span id="s1080">She just couldn’t take the pressure of living outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1081">So she went back.</span> <span id="s1082">She felt more secure.</span> <span id="s1083">She had lost her parents and everybody.</span> <span id="s1084">She was the only one that was left.</span> <span id="s1085">Her parents were taken to an Umschlagplatz, and I don’t know if they survived, but they were taken away and so she was the only one left.</span> <span id="s1086">But she couldn’t stay outside of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">BZ: Now, during the uprising you were passing as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">EM: Yes, during the uprising...</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">BZ: On the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">EM: I was passing as a Christian, and I was working at the railroad station and we knew about the ghetto burning.</span> <span id="s1091">And the only thing that the Poles regretted was that there were still some buildings that still could have been used, but there was never a bit of sympathy for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1092">There was only the, well there were some buildings that they were, they bemoaned the fact that some good buildings might have been destroyed, but never for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1093">And there were incidents of, well, the antisemitism showed through, like once a forester came to the railroad station and asked me to go out for some, well, for a drink.</span> <span id="s1094">Because I had to pretend I was a Pole and you know, pretend that I drink with them and what not.</span> <span id="s1095">And I asked him what the occasion was and he said that he, there were “seven heads.”</span> <span id="s1096">And I couldn’t understand what he meant by “seven heads.”</span> <span id="s1097">Then, and so he almost looked suspicious at me and then it dawned on me that he had just denounced seven Jews that he had found and he got enough money for it from the Gestapo to buy himself a good bottle of whiskey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">So, but, and I had a deal going with a woman who had a concession at the restaurant there.</span> <span id="s1099">So I told her that whenever I come with somebody and they order whiskey, vodka, you know, which is colorless, she should give me a glass of cold water instead.</span> <span id="s1100">And I got a reputation that I was, had a good head on my shoulders, that I could drink; I never got really drunk.</span> <span id="s1101">Sometimes I pretended I was tipsy so they wouldn’t know, you know.</span> <span id="s1102">So I pretended.</span> <span id="s1103">I started to act silly.</span> <span id="s1104">But this woman was very grateful to me because she was giving me water, charging for vodka, and I had to live the way they did.</span> <span id="s1105">You know, they would drink vodka and eat a piece of lard with it and just, it wasn’t even bacon.</span> <span id="s1106">It was just like a piece of lard or kielbasa or whatever.</span> <span id="s1107">But I had to, I was a railroad girl.</span> <span id="s1108">So I had to pretend I was one of them.</span> <span id="s1109">So, that’s my, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1110">There must have been more incidents, but.</span> <span id="s1111">… There was one incident when my mother was trying to save her sister in Lvov after I came back and I was unsuccessful, or at least I didn’t get into the area, really.</span> <span id="s1112">So she decided to go with the same faked letters and identity card.</span> <span id="s1113">And as she was walking up the steps at the railroad station in Warsaw, a German, she accidentally bumped into some German and he kicked her down the steps.</span> <span id="s1114">And she was all bloody.</span> <span id="s1115">Blood was running down her face.</span> <span id="s1116">And she ran and she just hopped on the, the train was leaving.</span> <span id="s1117">And the trains were very full, so she was able to just, she jumped on the train while it was moving on the last, I don’t know what you call it, the connection with, between cars.</span> <span id="s1118">On the, you know, on that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">BZ: The interlocking...</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">EM: Yeah, the interlocking device.</span> <span id="s1121">[coughing] And she sat on that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">BZ: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">EM: And there was some railroad man sitting right next to her.</span> <span id="s1124">And she felt as, since she was injured, you know, blood was gushing down her face, so she couldn’t even see very well.</span> <span id="s1125">And she was still all dazed from that fall.</span> <span id="s1126">So he was holding her while that [coughing] was shaking.</span> <span id="s1127">And she was on it.</span> <span id="s1128">And she thought that that was, well, she had a little suitcase with her, and that she had clothing for her sister because, you know, decent clothing.</span> <span id="s1129">Because anybody who came out of the ghetto was in rags.</span> <span id="s1130">And she, and this train had to pass through the railroad station where I was working.</span> <span id="s1131">And so she says she only prayed to God to let her fall off and get killed, after she had passed that railroad station, because she knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">BZ: Oh, so you [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">EM: So I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s1134">Because she knew that if she would fall before, they would bring the body, if they found the body they would take her to my railroad station and I would see her.</span> <span id="s1135">So she only prayed to hold on long enough to, you know, to fall off later.</span> <span id="s1136">But then the train stopped somewhere.</span> <span id="s1137">And this railroad man, who was very nice, he opened the door to the car.</span> <span id="s1138">It was just packed full like sardines.</span> <span id="s1139">Nobody wanted to let her in first.</span> <span id="s1140">And then he started to yell and he said, “In the name of Christ, let this woman in!</span> <span id="s1141">In the name of Christ let her in!</span> <span id="s1142">Don’t let her,” you know, “just die here on that outside of that train”.</span> <span id="s1143">… So they took her in and she stood on one leg because there was no room for two feet, you know.</span> <span id="s1144">It was so crowded.</span> <span id="s1145">So she stood on one leg.</span> <span id="s1146">There was no place for her to put the other, to put two feet down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">And well, she had an address of somebody who was a real Volksdeutsche, and whom somebody knew where she probably could get the address of my aunt, you know.</span> <span id="s1148">Because they were all moved around in Lvov.</span> <span id="s1149">And, but she couldn’t, she didn’t know where to find her.</span> <span id="s1150">So somebody had told her to go to some central registry office and to ask for this one woman.</span> <span id="s1151">So when she ran to that registry office, which was staffed by Poles and Ukrainians, the woman who was in the office suspected her of, probably of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1152">So she says, “O.K., I’ll tell you where to go.</span> <span id="s1153">Go to this other office where they will know where this particular woman is.”</span> <span id="s1154">And she scribbled an address on a piece of paper and gave it to my mother.</span> <span id="s1155">And my mother walked up there and it was the Gestapo office.</span> <span id="s1156">And my mother was so, you know, she couldn’t think straight and she just saw this very, you know, office building.</span> <span id="s1157">And she should have realized that it was a German office.</span> <span id="s1158">Well, she got the address, so she thought it was a registry, maybe there are many Germans.</span> <span id="s1159">So she walked up there and there was a big entrance foyer or something and steps up.</span> <span id="s1160">And she walked up and the Gestapo was standing there and said, “You stinking Pole!”</span> <span id="s1161">They didn’t know that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1162">And she said, “I have to find out [unclear].”</span> <span id="s1163">And so he kicked her down the steps.</span> <span id="s1164">But he thought that she was a Pole.</span> <span id="s1165">But otherwise he would have probably taken her.</span> <span id="s1166">So my mother actually thought that that was the office where she was like a register or something.</span> <span id="s1167">And so this woman, in the first office, just sent her straight to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1168">And then my mother found out where the Jews were being, were kept, and, but apparently she came too late, two days too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">And she, but she walked up there and there was a guard.</span> <span id="s1170">And she walked up to him and she showed him that fake letter that I had given and he said, “She has to find Erna Koch” [name of her sister] is the, and he read the letter.</span> <span id="s1171">And then he said, “Look, don’t fool me.</span> <span id="s1172">I know that’s, you know, it’s just a fake letter.</span> <span id="s1173">I happen to know Erna Koch, so come in the evening to such and such place that I tell you.”</span> <span id="s1174">And she isn’t here any more.</span> <span id="s1175">You know, he told her that, what I tell you.</span> <span id="s1176">And my mother did go to him and he was a, he was a guard.</span> <span id="s1177">And he apparently was a decent man because he, you know, he told my mother that he knew my aunt.</span> <span id="s1178">And she was taken on the, on a truck.</span> <span id="s1179">And she was completely out of her mind.</span> <span id="s1180">And she was screaming.</span> <span id="s1181">My mother does not know, but he was in a guard’s uniform.</span> <span id="s1182">Or maybe he was a Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1183">She didn’t even know if he is.</span> <span id="s1184">And, but he didn’t denounce my mother.</span> <span id="s1185">You know, and he decided, he read the letters that said, you know, terrible things happen here.</span> <span id="s1186">And when she went to him, he told her that she, my aunt, was on the truck and she was completely out of her mind because she had just gotten over typhus and her head, she had lost all her hair and what not.</span> <span id="s1187">And she kept yelling, “It’s all a mistake.</span> <span id="s1188">My sister is coming for me.</span> <span id="s1189">It’s all a mistake.”</span> <span id="s1190">And then we got the letter.</span> <span id="s1191">Well, and my, this other aunt of mine back in Poland, shut this off.</span> <span id="s1192">[tape off] Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">EM: Well, we got a letter recently from Poland where one sister who survived, one of my mother’s sisters who survived, had it and we don’t even know how she got it.</span> <span id="s1194">But it was a letter written by this aunt in Lvov that we tried to save, to my mother, just before she was taken.</span> <span id="s1195">And so I don’t really know how this letter came to my other sister’s possession or, you know, when we got it or, I don’t remember any….</span> <span id="s1196">But it’s a terrible letter, begging to please come and save her.</span> <span id="s1197">At that time she had lost her husband already and she was my mother’s favorite sister.</span> <span id="s1198">They were very close.</span> <span id="s1199">So apparently there was some way of getting mail back and forth.</span> <span id="s1200">And I don’t even remember how they did it, but there must have been a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">So that’s, the other, my other two aunts, my other, my mother’s other two sisters, were killed in a concentration camp, killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1202">We found out recently that one of them was lining up, she went for a shower, to get a regular shower, not a gas shower, early in the morning, and was five minutes before that shower opened.</span> <span id="s1203">And she was standing in line in the middle of winter to go to the shower and a German guard yelled at her.</span> <span id="s1204">He said, “You dirty Jew!</span> <span id="s1205">Don’t you know that it’s too early?</span> <span id="s1206">It’s, you still have five minutes,” or something, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1207">And, but he used the word, “You dirty Jew, don’t you know it’s too early?”</span> <span id="s1208">So she told him, she said, “If I were a dirty Jew, I wouldn’t stand in the middle of the night trying to get to take a shower.”</span> <span id="s1209">So he beat her so mercilessly that she died the next day.</span> <span id="s1210">And my other, her sister, who was with her, I mean, after this one died she didn’t want to live any more and she just let herself go completely and became one of those, what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">BZ: Muselmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">EM: Yeah, a Muselmann, and was taken, you know, to the gas chamber soon afterwards.</span> <span id="s1213">But, up till then, if it were, hadn’t been for that one incident, they might have survived, because some other women, who were in Auschwitz with them, survived.</span> <span id="s1214">They were their, you know, their friends.</span> <span id="s1215">They were strong, young women.</span> <span id="s1216">And they might have had a chance of surviving.</span> <span id="s1217">But just because she was in a, standing in line, you know, standing early to be able to get a shower, she was killed.</span> <span id="s1218">It’s the only thing, you know, that I know that.</span> <span id="s1219">I know that my grandfather was killed on a walk to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1220">He was a old man and he was weak and he couldn’t walk fast enough.</span> <span id="s1221">And they were walking them.</span> <span id="s1222">So he couldn’t walk fast enough.</span> <span id="s1223">So of course he was beaten and then just, beaten, clubbed to death, really, with a rifle butt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">BZ: Had he just had an operation?</span> <span id="s1225">Was it he who just had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">EM: Yeah, it was, he had, an operation on this, I don’t know, this was like a cancer.</span> <span id="s1227">He had an operation.</span> <span id="s1228">As far as my father’s family goes, I know of one uncle who used to be a lawyer in a small, very small town in Galicia.</span> <span id="s1229">And he was the only lawyer.</span> <span id="s1230">And when the Germans marched in, they made him head, or whatever, a Judenrat3 that they made him because he was the only man there with any education.</span> <span id="s1231">He was a lawyer and he knew German.</span> <span id="s1232">And the next day they came to him and they demanded a contingent of laborers, of workers, of Jews for labor.</span> <span id="s1233">But he had known already about things that were going on in the surrounding communities and maybe what was going on in Poland.</span> <span id="s1234">Because that part of Poland was taken later.</span> <span id="s1235">You know, the first, the Russians were there.</span> <span id="s1236">Anyway, he told them, yes, he would get them the men they wanted if they give him in writing a receipt and assurance in writing that the same number of men will come back in the same condition as they left.</span> <span id="s1237">And they shot him on the spot for that.</span> <span id="s1238">Because, you know, he was, but he, and I am very proud of him.</span> <span id="s1239">I understand that in Israel some people who knew about it, I mean, wanted to make some special, I don’t know what they do in Israel, you know, for these, the Righteous people, because they felt that he was killed just trying to protect them because he did say, “I’ll see to it that you get these men for labor, but you have to give me in writing [tape off then on].”</span> <span id="s1240">Well, coming back to the idea of God, I guess I believe it’s just a universal idea or spirit or feeling that unites mankind.</span> <span id="s1241">And you just turn to that idea when, you know, when you’re in trouble, mostly when you’re in trouble, I think.</span> <span id="s1242">And then when things turn out all right, you say, “Well, that’s what it was.”</span> <span id="s1243">But I think the value of it is still the same, you know.</span> <span id="s1244">You know, if the old saying, if God created people or people created God.</span> <span id="s1245">I think it really doesn’t matter, as long as the idea contributes to their, to better behavior of people.</span> <span id="s1246">It’s a, O.K., that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">BZ: And all the values that you attribute to your God are intact, as well as your God, but I, you know, a set of values really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">BZ: And your values are still intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">EM: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">BZ: Whether you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">EM: So I don’t know if it, you know, if He can influence my life or something outside of me, or if the idea that originates in me can influence my life or my behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">BZ: How about your parents?</span> <span id="s1254">Have their ideas about God changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">EM: Yes.</span> <span id="s1256">I guess my father doesn’t believe, although he still wants to be buried in a tallis and I don’t think he likes the Reform services.</span> <span id="s1257">In a way he likes the sermon.</span> <span id="s1258">I took him to Reform services.</span> <span id="s1259">He likes the sermon.</span> <span id="s1260">But he still is shocked by some modern ideas, modern way of conducting the services.</span> <span id="s1261">So he says he doesn’t believe in God.</span> <span id="s1262">He is bitter.</span> <span id="s1263">But yet the first thing he did when he came to this country is buy a tallis to be buried in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">BZ: Is that right?</span> <span id="s1265">The first thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">EM: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1267">And I think my mother believes in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">BZ: She had so many close calls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">EM: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">BZ: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">EM: Yes, she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">BZ: And you told me one time an incident about when she was in a puddle of water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">EM: Yeah, well when she was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">BZ: In the middle of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">EM: She was just getting out of the ghetto and she joined, I don’t know if we talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">BZ: No, that wasn’t mentioned.</span> <span id="s1277">You told me that privately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">EM: Oh.</span> <span id="s1279">Well, she was in the, she was escaping and she joined a bunch of smugglers, and, but they, pretending that she is also a smuggler and that she lost her usual group with whom she crosses the wall or you know, her usual hole was, wasn’t there and so she joined another group.</span> <span id="s1280">And they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">BZ: Were they supposed to be Jewish?</span> <span id="s1282">Or Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">EM: No, Gentiles, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">BZ: Yeah, Gentile smugglers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">EM: As a Gentile smuggler.</span> <span id="s1286">And all of a sudden there were, well, there were noises, and you know, they knew that the Germans were near.</span> <span id="s1287">Anyway, the other smugglers knew where to escape and she was all alone and so she started to run and there was a half-burned-out building or half-demolished building.</span> <span id="s1288">And she knew she was right near the, border between the ghetto and, you know, and the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1289">But anyway, she ran and she fell, from a broken wall or half a wall and she fell maybe eight, nine feet, and, right into a big puddle of water and mud.</span> <span id="s1290">And she was lying right near that wall of the building and the two Germans came and they were with a flashlight.</span> <span id="s1291">That was at night.</span> <span id="s1292">And so they were searching.</span> <span id="s1293">And the flashlight just missed her, you know, and, because she was so close to the wall and they didn’t lean over.</span> <span id="s1294">Anyway, she was praying, she says.</span> <span id="s1295">She says, “If there is a God, please help me and don’t let them see me.”</span> <span id="s1296">And she was, so this was like a miracle that they, that that searchlight just missed her toes by inches.</span> <span id="s1297">And they never saw her and she was lying there very still and then, and they left.</span> <span id="s1298">And she got up and so, you know, that was a close call.</span> <span id="s1299">And she always says that God helped her there, because she was praying.</span> <span id="s1300">So I think in all she has a much stronger belief in God than my father, than I do, and certainly than my father.</span> <span id="s1301">Yes.</span> <span id="s1302">My father is very strict, I mean, I had a very good Jewish background.</span> <span id="s1303">He went to a cheder when he was only three or four and whenever I wanted to, you know, well, when I wanted to give the kids a feeling of what Jewish education has meant, that is when it is Pesach, when he reads the Haggadah.</span> <span id="s1304">And I, he reads the whole Haggadah in Hebrew without one mistake.</span> <span id="s1305">And, you know, just so fluently.</span> <span id="s1306">And yet I know that he doesn’t know it by rote or doesn’t, but he really reads.</span> <span id="s1307">Because once in a while he would get stuck on the word, and repeat the word, or look again.</span> <span id="s1308">So I know he reads it.</span> <span id="s1309">But yet it’s like a second, I mean, it’s just so fluent, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1310">And he knows everything what to do, and in what order and so on, that I’m very impressed because I know that for years he didn’t read the Haggadah, you know, it was just years and years, almost a lifetime, that he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1311">And yet when he picked it up he knew exactly what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1312">And, any prayer, any Hebrew, he just reads perfectly.</span> <span id="s1313">[unclear] The same he can read from the Torah very easily, you know.</span> <span id="s1314">Because the way they were brought up, I mean they were four years old they had to read.</span> <span id="s1315">You know?</span> <span id="s1316">And so he could never really understand the business with bar mitzvah here, you know, the big party and the little, the very little that the kids had to learn, especially in the Reform Temple we belong to.</span> <span id="s1317">And he just thought it was atrocious, you know, that you, the kids can’t read the Torah but they get a little piece to study up for and not really that they’re being called up and can pick up at any place and read it.</span> <span id="s1318">And so he just thinks that Jewish education is way behind here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">BZ: And he’s interested in seeing it preserved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">EM: Yeah, in a way.</span> <span id="s1321">But I don’t know if it’s, I don’t think it’s because of a belief in God.</span> <span id="s1322">It’s just because of a strong feeling for the preservation of Judaism as an idea, and maybe because so many suffered for it.</span> <span id="s1323">And I guess I, in that sense, I feel the same way, you know?</span> <span id="s1324">It’s a uniting cause and I wouldn’t think of turning away from it.</span> <span id="s1325">But I don’t think that belief in God, I mean, it’s paradoxical.</span> <span id="s1326">I mean [unclear] exists because Judaism is the belief in God.</span> <span id="s1327">But yet it’s, to me it’s something else.</span> <span id="s1328">I mean something that can be separated from the idea of a..</span> <span id="s1329">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">BZ: Well actually it’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">EM: A God that, you know, is, as represented in the Bible history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">BZ: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">EM: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">BZ: Religion was so concerned with acts that it really, you know, you can really, as long as you’re doing well, you know, you don’t have to believe.</span> <span id="s1335">I mean, I think that, you know, there certainly is a valid experience there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">EM: Yeah, you just don’t know if you do good deeds because of religion or belief in God or just because it’s just in you.</span> <span id="s1337">And maybe that process is in you, makes you do good things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">BZ: [unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">EM: Empathy with other people, like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">BZ: Yes, your daughter was saying that your parents have so much empathy, that, you know, when terrible things are cited on TV, terrible accidents and so forth, she’s almost immune to the statistics.</span> <span id="s1341">And your parents just see each, you know, each individual when they hear any statistic announced on, you know, TV or the radio.</span> <span id="s1342">They can really feel, they know those statistics are individuals.</span> <span id="s1343">They get very excited.</span> <span id="s1344">She was telling me that.</span> <span id="s1345">Did you have a hard time adjusting to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">EM: Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s1347">I guess the life was, I had a hard time adjusting to American values.</span> <span id="s1348">And I don’t know if I would have had the same values had there not been a Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1349">Because after all, I did grow up in a upper-middle-class family.</span> <span id="s1350">But maybe my values would have been the same as the American kids and teenagers or young adult values.</span> <span id="s1351">But in a way I doubt it.</span> <span id="s1352">I think there is something very superficial here that I didn’t have there, and certainly which the experiences of the war prevented me from having.</span> <span id="s1353">And in that sense it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1354">I also didn’t really feel at home here.</span> <span id="s1355">You know, I still don’t.</span> <span id="s1356">I still feel like a stranger.</span> <span id="s1357">And I feel like I’m a rather unwanted stranger.</span> <span id="s1358">And I don’t think that feeling will ever leave me, no matter how many years I live here.</span> <span id="s1359">And I, somehow I feel that American Jews also fool themselves when they think that they are completely integrated into the society or just as important for the general society, important citizens as they think they are.</span> <span id="s1360">I feel that they always will be a strangers here.</span> <span id="s1361">And they just don’t see it and realize it, partly because they usually are surrounded by their own kind, that they, at least the older generation.</span> <span id="s1362">They lived in close communities, you know, surrounded by other Jews, where the only time they really talked or really got the feeling, was with other Jews.</span> <span id="s1363">And they could try to convince, or think, that they were accepted citizens.</span> <span id="s1364">But I feel that the outside, the non-Jewish Americans, really never considered them true Americans.</span> <span id="s1365">And I think with Israel they even have more doubts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">BZ: Divided loyalties.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">EM: Divided loyalties.</span> <span id="s1368">And they probably feel it more now than ever before that the Jews are not real true Americans.</span> <span id="s1369">And that, I mean it’s just a feeling I have.</span> <span id="s1370">And yet I know that there are many American Jews don’t think that that’s the case.</span> <span id="s1371">So, it’s not, they think of themselves as Americans.</span> <span id="s1372">And, but I don’t think the outside world [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">BZ: Regards them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">EM: Regards them as always strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">BZ: In your opinion, should the Holocaust be taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">EM: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1377">It should be taught.</span> <span id="s1378">Sometimes I have my doubts of how much good it will do.</span> <span id="s1379">But I think it is important to teach it.</span> <span id="s1380">I don’t know if it really penetrates very deeply, if it’s remembered, if it’s really.</span> <span id="s1381">I hope it contributes to a better understanding, but, quite frankly, I don’t think that many people care, non-Jewish people, they care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">BZ: And you’ve been engaged as a speaker...</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">BZ: For quite a number of years.</span> <span id="s1385">And you always were very well-received.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">EM: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">BZ: And yet you feel it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">EM: Well, I think it’s something of a fleeting, they’re impressed, they’re impressed maybe with a personal story more than, that’s why the movie Holocaust made such an impact.</span> <span id="s1389">I mean, if you show documentary films and you can show, you know, pictures, and talk or write about concentration camps in the newspaper, it’s, describe it or statistics, and yet it doesn’t really have much of an impact.</span> <span id="s1390">Many people say, “Oh, isn’t that terrible.</span> <span id="s1391">Yes, it’s bad,” or, “It’s horrid.”</span> <span id="s1392">But then they go about their business and that’s, it’s just water over the dam.</span> <span id="s1393">When you see a movie like The Holocaust, well, then it’s an impressive story and maybe it touches them for a little longer.</span> <span id="s1394">And the same thing when I go and speak about it.</span> <span id="s1395">And I think it’s mostly my personal experiences and it’s, you know, it’s hard to be, they feel with me.</span> <span id="s1396">They sit quietly.</span> <span id="s1397">They listen.</span> <span id="s1398">And maybe they discuss it for ten minutes afterwards.</span> <span id="s1399">But I don’t think it really makes a big difference.</span> <span id="s1400">But I still feel it should be taught.</span> <span id="s1401">If for no other reason I think we owe it to all those who died.</span> <span id="s1402">But I don’t think it’s going to change humanity!</span> <span id="s1403">Maybe I am very cynical.</span> <span id="s1404">I guess I am.</span> <span id="s1405">But I have just seen too much not to be cynical.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">BZ: Well, do you ever, do you get much response when you mention, you know, the antisemitic acts that you’ve encountered and, you know, and that you point out are the reasons that the Jews could so easily be singled out?</span> <span id="s1407">Do you get any response, you know, to that, as though, maybe they should do some re-thinking, really?</span> <span id="s1408">Evidently not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">EM: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">BZ: Evidently you don’t get...</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">EM: No, no, I do not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">BZ: Any real response.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">EM: A matter of fact I think that if the conditions were right it would happen just as easily here.</span> <span id="s1414">And I think that American Jews who now say, “Well, isn’t it awful that the European Jews, that the German Jews didn’t emigrate sooner,” that they didn’t leave everything and go, you know, that they were attached to their material goods and wealth, and they think that that kept them.</span> <span id="s1415">I don’t think that’s the case.</span> <span id="s1416">I think American Jews would have, even if they saw the writing on the wall as close as it was in 1935 or ‘36 in Germany, they wouldn’t leave either.</span> <span id="s1417">It’s, because you just thought it was something that would pass, something you disagree like you disagree with the policies of one president and not another.</span> <span id="s1418">You wait for the next president and it’s going, something will pass.</span> <span id="s1419">And German Jews felt that they were, maybe in fact even more than the American Jews, that they were German citizens with their rights.</span> <span id="s1420">And they just didn’t see any reason why somebody else would have the right to expel them or right….</span> <span id="s1421">You know, and I think the American Jews would do the same.</span> <span id="s1422">And yet I feel that in America it could happen just as easily as it, as it happened there, in spite of the Holocaust or in spite of teaching the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1423">And I don’t think that there is really any more love for the Jews or understanding of the Jews because of the Holocaust or because of the knowledge of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1424">I’m sorry to disappoint you!</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">BZ: No, no, no, you have to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">EM: But that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">BZ: You know, this is what we want to know, how you feel and your experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">EM: I mean, when you see your people whom you considered as friends and probably much closer friends than some American Jews have here, you know, as far as Gentile goes.</span> <span id="s1429">My parents were, as I say, they felt they were Jewish yet they were very well-integrated into the non-Jewish society and had many Gentile friends.</span> <span id="s1430">And yet it, things happened that just shook your belief in, you know, for what friends really are, how well-accepted you are.</span> <span id="s1431">On the other hand, there is no denying that many Poles, or some Poles, helped, like that prostitute that helped.</span> <span id="s1432">And it was just out of the goodness of her heart.</span> <span id="s1433">I don’t think it was because she wanted to help a Jew, or because she believed in Christ.</span> <span id="s1434">It just was a good person.</span> <span id="s1435">And I had, you know, many close calls and incidences where I did get help.</span> <span id="s1436">And I think it’s because they were just good people, but not because they felt, well we have to help them because the Jews are being persecuted and it’s not right.</span> <span id="s1437">I mean, they would have felt the same way about helping any other person, or an animal for that matter!</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">BZ: And when they were willing to persecute, it was because they were a Jew, and it was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">EM: Right.</span> <span id="s1440">Exactly.</span> <span id="s1441">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">BZ: I want to ask you, before we finish, I don’t think we went into the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1443">And, did we go into the Judenrat in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1444">I think you shared your opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">EM: I..</span> <span id="s1446">.</span> <span id="s1447">don’t really know that much about it.</span> <span id="s1448">I think it probably had its, well, it definitely had its function in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1449">I think, for instance, the idea in Warsaw, when the Judenrat was established, and when they tried to organize these labor battalions to go outside of the ghetto, it was a better idea to have it on a organized type way rather than having the whole population, Jewish population, in constant fear of being caught and sent out without even knowing where they’re going and so on.</span> <span id="s1450">So, in the beginning, when they were established, when they tried to bring some kind of an order into the chaos, the chaos of things, you know, when people could, younger people could go to work, where older people either could pay their way out or were excused by, because they knew somebody, you know, I mean certainly there were some injustices committed.</span> <span id="s1451">But by and large I feel it was a pretty good system, until the later days when the unscrupulous people got in.</span> <span id="s1452">Or maybe people in the Judenrat got more frightened of what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1453">And they became more, more unscrupulous.</span> <span id="s1454">But my beef wouldn’t be so much with the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1455">I don’t know much about the Judenrat in other cities or towns.</span> <span id="s1456">And I think they tried to do a job and by and large I don’t think they did such a bad job.</span> <span id="s1457">I mean there were other people like the, well, let’s say the police.</span> <span id="s1458">I mean, here I feel that, and there was more, you know, there was cruelty there and...then there were the smugglers.</span> <span id="s1459">There were some people who became very powerful in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1460">But I don’t think it was really the, maybe I’m mistaken.</span> <span id="s1461">I just don’t know enough.</span> <span id="s1462">But I don’t think it was so much the members of the Judenrat who became so all-powerful.</span> <span id="s1463">It was more other people, the big smugglers and people who were making money in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1464">And they were much more powerful than the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1465">The Judenrat did try to give out as many work certificates as they can, you know.</span> <span id="s1466">And some people had to pay money for these certificates and others, some did not.</span> <span id="s1467">By and large I, I don’t even know if taking that money, I mean, you can always argue that it wasn’t just to give a certificate to somebody who could pay for it.</span> <span id="s1468">By the same token you couldn’t, you know, just give them out completely and indiscriminately.</span> <span id="s1469">And the money that they collected, they did turn to good use.</span> <span id="s1470">And so I don’t, you know, I just don’t know how they could have saved more people by giving out certificates in this community.</span> <span id="s1471">I mean, how do you judge, you know?</span> <span id="s1472">And that’s certainly human nature being what it is.</span> <span id="s1473">And you know, money was everything.</span> <span id="s1474">And I think… Tape four, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">EM: I think they were trying to do a job.</span> <span id="s1476">So you, maybe it sounds like an apology for people who could buy their papers.</span> <span id="s1477">My father certainly didn’t, because he didn’t, you know, didn’t get any work through the Judenrat, and we didn’t know anybody in the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s1478">But from what I hear now and maybe what I heard there, you know, somebody got papers and probably paid for it.</span> <span id="s1479">How do you judge who should get the papers?</span> <span id="s1480">And how many papers can you, there, I mean in the end none of these papers were worth anything.</span> <span id="s1481">But they just prolonged life for a little while.</span> <span id="s1482">I think they were trying to do a good job as far as bringing in food and, you know, exchanging goods with the Aryan side or with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1483">Conditions were just too hard for anybody to do a perfect job.</span> <span id="s1484">You know, you might expect them, well, the Judenrat was there, they should have saved everybody.</span> <span id="s1485">But it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1486">So, and I don’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1487">I certainly feel that there were many people who were unjust and cruel—you know, Jews—and took advantage of other Jews.</span> <span id="s1488">I know that my father supposedly had, in the beginning, was introduced to somebody who could have gotten papers to get out of Poland, you know, some visa to a South American country.</span> <span id="s1489">And I know my parents lost almost all their money because they gave their money to this man who was supposed to get the paper.</span> <span id="s1490">And he got the paper, but for himself, and left!</span> <span id="s1491">And we were there without, you know, but certainly it was dishonest, was awful.</span> <span id="s1492">Yet this guy, he figured, well, he can get the money so he could get out!</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">BZ: But on the whole you really felt that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">EM: On the whole, I am not, I hate the police or what it turned out to be later on.</span> <span id="s1495">In the beginning there was a need for police in the ghetto even, because even for the traffic, even, you know, but then they turned out to be very, so subservient and so afraid for their own skin that, you know, they turned out to be very cruel.</span> <span id="s1496">Once again, it’s human nature that, you know, they were so afraid.</span> <span id="s1497">And I, I mean, I hate them.</span> <span id="s1498">I hate them as people.</span> <span id="s1499">And I don’t know if there were different leadership in the police, if it would have turned out any better.</span> <span id="s1500">And certainly many people, you know, the, only the, kind of the dregs joined the police!</span> <span id="s1501">Because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">BZ: Yeah, people that considered themselves honorable wouldn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">EM: And because they want to consider themselves honorable wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1504">I know one guy who did join in the beginning but after a couple of months, I think two months, he got out of it, because when he saw what was going on.</span> <span id="s1505">In the beginning he thought it was a good idea, you know.</span> <span id="s1506">But maybe, and I don’t think he joined, at that time, they didn’t join for their safety of the thing.</span> <span id="s1507">Because it wasn’t that dangerous yet that, you know, you had to have a paper, or be in the police to, in order to stay in the ghetto and not to be shipped out.</span> <span id="s1508">So he just joined because he thought there was a need for it, you know.</span> <span id="s1509">Maybe he thought he could do a good job.</span> <span id="s1510">But when he saw what it was turning into, he got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">BZ: By and large, I’m sure you feel it for, the suffering went on, that went on, and that more people really rose to the heights of goodness rather than descended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">EM: Yes, in general I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">BZ: In general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">EM: In general, yes.</span> <span id="s1515">Naturally the other cases just stand out...</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">BZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">EM: Much more forcefully.</span> <span id="s1518">But they were, I don’t know, I..</span> <span id="s1519">.</span> <span id="s1520">feel in my case, it was almost, since maybe through luck we were able to survive the initial selections and, you know, be sent out, and then it was just a matter of, almost obligation to stay alive, because of the other part of your family needed you, you know.</span> <span id="s1521">I, if, I’m sure that if my parents had been taken, I would have thrown in the towel and not tried to survive, you know, so hard.</span> <span id="s1522">But you knew you had an obligation.</span> <span id="s1523">It’s very.</span> <span id="s1524">… Well, it’s a funny feeling that you have.</span> <span id="s1525">You had to stay alive because you knew that the other, that your mother or your father needs you.</span> <span id="s1526">Or, you know, and so you stayed alive for each other as much as for, to show that Hitler is not going to win, that in spite of everything you’re going to stay alive.</span> <span id="s1527">And I think that’s why so many people kind of gave up, because when one part of the family went, they just didn’t see any reason, you know, to fight back, or to try to escape, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1528">And in a way, I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I have a very strong feeling about the lack of resistance in the ghetto, for which we are being blamed, you know, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1529">It was just because in the beginning we felt so strongly that it’s a matter just of waiting and surviving.</span> <span id="s1530">And you didn’t want to take the chance of, well, the responsibility of having somebody else killed because of your desire to resist.</span> <span id="s1531">You know, if you kill a German, and then your family or your neighbors are taken and shot, you just didn’t feel you had the right to have them suffer or have them lose their lives because you feel like resisting.</span> <span id="s1532">And in the long run you knew that your resistance would just amount to maybe killing one German or two Germans.</span> <span id="s1533">And yet you knew that at least 50, 60 or 100 people will die for that.</span> <span id="s1534">And since you believe that most people will survive, that it’s just a matter of time, you know, you just didn’t feel it was right to take that chance, that risk, or take the….</span> <span id="s1535">Even if you didn’t care if you die while you kill a German, you did care, you didn’t feel you could subject other people to jail or to being sent out to a camp or to being killed because you didn’t feel like living any more and you felt like taking a German’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">BZ: To whom do you suggest the Holocaust should be taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">EM: To ev-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">BZ: To all age groups?</span> <span id="s1539">Or to specific age groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">EM: I would say to all age groups.</span> <span id="s1541">As I say, I don’t think it’s going to make much of a difference.</span> <span id="s1542">I think that these people will still write books that it never happened, and people who want to believe that will believe it no matter how many films they see, how many pictures they see, or how many books on the Holocaust they read.</span> <span id="s1543">If somebody will come out and say that it’s all a Jewish propaganda or, then they still will believe it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">BZ: Do you feel that your children are more sensitive to you and to others as a result of your experiences and losses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">EM: Yes.</span> <span id="s1546">I, yeah.</span> <span id="s1547">I know they are.</span> <span id="s1548">But I don’t think they really long to talk about it too much.</span> <span id="s1549">I don’t know, maybe they don’t want to talk about it because I, well I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1550">But there aren’t many questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">BZ: They’re not asking you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">EM: No, no.</span> <span id="s1553">And maybe they’re afraid that it might upset me too much.</span> <span id="s1554">But there aren’t many questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">BZ: What does your daughter want to do?</span> <span id="s1556">Does she have a specific area in mind, you know, in her studies in Harvard Law?</span> <span id="s1557">Is that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">EM: Kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">BZ: Or, either of your, either, or any of your children, in other words.</span> <span id="s1560">Are they seeking, you know, their life’s work in a way that will contribute to society?</span> <span id="s1561">You know, are they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">EM: I certainly hope so!</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">BZ: You know, are they geared to that, in other words?</span> <span id="s1564">Have they...</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">EM: Yes, I think both of them have a strong feeling that they want to contribute to society and do something good, or worthwhile with their lives.</span> <span id="s1566">I mean, it’s not for them a matter of trying to make a good living.</span> <span id="s1567">And that’s certainly not their goal and I think it’s on the bottom of the list.</span> <span id="s1568">The most important thing for them is to do something worthwhile for, well, for my daughter, for humanity.</span> <span id="s1569">And for my son, maybe, for science.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">BZ: For science, which of course would benefit humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">EM: Well, I guess, I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">BZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">EM: So, he wants to go into medical engineering now and I hope he does.</span> <span id="s1574">And I, I don’t know, Diane wants to help people.</span> <span id="s1575">So we’ll see what comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">BZ: Does she still want to go into international relations, is that, international law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">EM: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1578">Sometimes she says yes, and other times she feels there is another, a lot to do right here, that she can help other people who need help.</span> <span id="s1579">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1580">Right now she is studying or doing some research on the impact of desegregation on education.</span> <span id="s1581">She is working with some professor.</span> <span id="s1582">And so I wonder what she will dig up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">BZ: Please feel free to complete this interview by elaborating on anything you’ve said, or adding anything that you wish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">EM: I don’t really have much to say except that I think what you are doing is worthwhile, or I hope it is worthwhile, and I appreciate the opportunity to tell my story, such as it is.</span> <span id="s1585">I hope it will do some good.</span> <span id="s1586">But I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1587">I just hope.</span> <span id="s1588">Well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">BZ: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span
