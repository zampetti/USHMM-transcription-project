Walinsky, born in London, England, April 19, 1908.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: At the age of four with mother and sister.</span> <span id="s15">My father was already here at the time Q: Tell me a little bit about your family background.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Well, my father had a been a revolutionary in Russia in his youth.</span> <span id="s17">Because he was only 16 when he had left.</span> <span id="s18">He got in trouble with the police for political activity; demonstrations and so on.</span> <span id="s19">In London he had any number of jobs: He barbered, he was a weaver of baby carriages, and so on.</span> <span id="s20">But he also became a member of Prince Peter Kropotkin's Anarchist's Circle; and he got involved in journalism and I don't know how many years exactly that he lived in London before coming to this country.</span> <span id="s21">He must have come in 1911 -- the family a year later.</span> <span id="s22">When he got here, as I said, he had been offered a job in Toronto so we moved there.</span> <span id="s23">And we were there two years.</span> <span id="s24">He managed a local union.</span> <span id="s25">My mother had two brothers in New York who were embroiderers by trade; and they belonged to the ?</span> <span id="s26">Embroiderers and Pointers Union.</span> <span id="s27">And they were instrumental in getting that union to offer my father a job managing their local union in New York.</span> <span id="s28">And that is what brought us down from Canad</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Then I went to school.</span> <span id="s30">I did pretty well in school.</span> <span id="s31">I went to Cornell and studied economics, which became my profession later.</span> <span id="s32">I had two or three minor jobs, and then decided to teach school.</span> <span id="s33">So I got a teacher's license in economics in New York.</span> <span id="s34">And then, in -- that would have been 1931.</span> <span id="s35">Well, in 1932, a friend of mine who was a great drover, came and said "We ought to go to Germany, because this guy Hitler is coming to power and it will be an interesting place to be.</span> <span id="s36">I'm going to go to the university; why don't you come?"</span> <span id="s37">Well, while I was still at school at Cornell, I had taken out some insurance policy, so I had a little equity in it.</span> <span id="s38">And I was able to get $500 or $600 on that, and that took me to Germany.</span> <span id="s39">You have no idea what prices were in those days, but on the German/American Line, travelling -- I think it was called</span></p> <p><span id="s40">01:05: "student class"; it was really not very different from steerage -- the round-trip fare was under $200.</span> <span id="s41">In Berlin, I lived very, very frugally; I had to, because I had to stretch that money.</span> <span id="s42">And, well, you got breakfast with your room -- that is, a cup of coffee and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s43">And then for lunch and dinner, I would go to the student house in the Aranienburg Strasse where you had two choices, I believe it was.</span> <span id="s44">You had an Eintopfgericht, a stew; or you had soup and a stew.</span> <span id="s45">And for one, you paid 60 pfennigs; that was 15 cents.</span> <span id="s46">But the other, you paid a mark; that was a quarter.</span> <span id="s47">And the system was: You could get a second on the soup and a second on the vegetable, but not on the meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">So you would go with a friend and you would get your meal, the soup and the dish, and you would eat the soup fast and the vegetable, and your friend would go off and get the second, the refill.</span> <span id="s49">And then you would have -- well that was 25 cents and two ate on it.</span> <span id="s50">And in the evening, you'd go to the automat where they had a very, very hearty bean soup that cost maybe 40 or 50 pfennig; and so those were the meals.</span> <span id="s51">Obviously, I wasn't</span></p> <p><span id="s52">01:05: spending very much money.</span> <span id="s53">One thing in Germany in those years, there were student rates on the metro equivalent -- at the film, theater, opera; so you could go very, very cheaply.</span> <span id="s54">Anyway, you know, very soon, late in 1932, the Nazi business became quite tense.</span> <span id="s55">And some of my friends, Germans, were extremely concerned because they felt vulnerable.</span> <span id="s56">And there would the Nazis be out on the streets shaking their collection boxes Einweg nach Jerusalem, oneway to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s57">I was at a student ball in the Reichsgarten the night of the Reichstag fire.</span> <span id="s58">When I came out at about 1:00 a.m. that night, it was very strange; there were policemen all around the place.</span> <span id="s59">And I asked one, I said "What's happened?"</span> <span id="s60">And he said "There's been a fire in the Reichstag."</span> <span id="s61">And I looked down, because it was in plain view down at the end of that walk, there were no signs of external fire damage.</span> <span id="s62">So whatever fire there had been, it was strictly internal.</span> <span id="s63">But of course when the press came out and Goebles made a story out of it, you'd think the whole building had been burned down; and this was not true.</span> <span id="s64">Anyway, that was a little background to the DP thing that came later, you know; that eight months or so in Germany.</span> <span id="s65">And after the election -- the elections were in March and early in March.</span> <span id="s66">And Hitler was confirmed; he had already been in the Reichstag seated.</span> <span id="s67">I had run out of money, and my father refused to send me any.</span> <span id="s68">He thought it was a good place to get out of.</span> <span id="s69">I didn't feel I was in any danger, and I don't think I was.</span> <span id="s70">But I did run out of money and I had to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Is there anything else you can tell me about your eight months in Germany and the change of the mood of the people or ...</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes, a few things.</span> <span id="s73">There was a landlady of my friend who said, "You know there have been five major elections in Germany in one year, and not one of them succeeded in creating a majority government?"</span> <span id="s74">And that was one factor in what happened later, because people gave up on the democratic process; it wouldn't work.</span> <span id="s75">But I've never seen that mentioned as an element contributing to Hitler's coming to power, and I think it was.</span> <span id="s76">Anyway, how did I get there?</span> <span id="s77">I was on a train of thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Well, I was asking you a little bit about the mood in Berlin at that time and anti- Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s80">So this lady, this Wirtin, the Hausfrau, the landlady, she said she was voting for Hitler because after Hitler, the communists would come and that's what she wanted.</span> <span id="s81">I thought this was a strange prognosis -- psychology.</span> <span id="s82">But I initially had rooms with the widow of a professor.</span> <span id="s83">So she was Frau Doctor Professor Resica (ph.) and a very German lady.</span> <span id="s84">I subsequently took a room with a Jewish family, and I was with them until March, when things had already become quite bad.</span> <span id="s85">They had no intention of leaving.</span> <span id="s86">They didn't think it was necessary; they didn't think they ought to run or had to run.</span> <span id="s87">They were German, so -- anyway it's not easy to recall all of it, but there's enough to make it a very tense and dramatic experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Was there a palpable sense of the anti-Semitism, of restrictions against people in those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Well, no, the more open expressions of anti-Semitism -- the badge, the tagging of stores and so on, that mostly came later.</span> <span id="s90">There wasn't much of that in the first months; and don't forget, I was out by March of '33.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Were you there during the book burning; was that during that time?</span> <span id="s92">A: I don't remember if that came then or shortly after.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: The other thing I wanted to ask you about your family background: Was your family very conscious of being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s95">I grew up on a Bronx street, 176th Street; and our side of the street was all Jewish, the other side of the street was all Irish.</span> <span id="s96">We kids did not play with one another.</span> <span id="s97">We just -- they were there we were here and that was it.</span> <span id="s98">So my family's friends were all Jewish, and the only Gentiles really I knew as a boy growing up were our teachers at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Well, as a union leader, my father was a great activist.</span> <span id="s101">01:14:30 Then he was also a meagerist(?)</span> <span id="s102">; and he liked to dramatize and he liked to play a public role, be a public figure.</span> <span id="s103">And his union was not big ,and it didn't have a very large treasury, but he could always could come up with a $5,000 donation here or a $10,000 there toward the building, let's say of a -- toward the purchase of a house for YVO -- you know, the Yiddish Research Institute -- or to make a gift to the Urban League or whatever.</span> <span id="s104">And he was a very popular speaker, always invited to speak at banquets and so on.</span> <span id="s105">So he wasn't home very much, but by the same token, we knew of his activities and this was part of the milieu.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: The reason why I was asking was to try to get a sense of if your background prepared you or motivated you for some of the work that you did later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Well, my first real job after the university was teaching school.</span> <span id="s108">I taught at the Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s109">And it was a new school with a very enterprising principal who had organized a great faculty.</span> <span id="s110">And the student population was, I suppose, 80 percent Jewish.</span> <span id="s111">We had a few Blacks, and we had some Catholic children.</span> <span id="s112">But in those days, the Teachers Union was a very active organization.</span> <span id="s113">And actually, the communists tried to take it over from inside.</span> <span id="s114">And so the less inclined split off and</span></p> <p><span id="s115">01:17: formed the Teachers Guild.</span> <span id="s116">And so that was also a part of a social milieu, you know.</span> <span id="s117">And I was with the Teachers Guild.</span> <span id="s118">I was also, in those years, trying to write plays.</span> <span id="s119">I wrote one play about Hitler's coming to power which was published but not produced.</span> <span id="s120">And I wrote a number of other plays in the thirties after I had returned from Germany.</span> <span id="s121">And you know, I wanted to be a playwright, but I couldn't make it to Broadway; and so at a given point, I said to myself "You can't do both things.</span> <span id="s122">You've got to pick one or the other."</span> <span id="s123">And so I decided to stay with teaching and I gave up play writing.</span> <span id="s124">But I had a play produced in Paris, a dramatization of Aldus Huxley's "Brave New World."</span> <span id="s125">But then, the war came and I had the opportunity to join the War Production Board, which I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: This is in '43.</span> <span id="s128">And I was with the War Production Board into its demise early in 1947; and that was a great experience.</span> <span id="s129">It didn't have anything to do with Jewishness or Jewish causes or whatever, but I made the acquaintance for example of Lucius Clay who represented the Army at the Requirements Committee in the War Production Board.</span> <span id="s130">And when I went to Germany later for the ORT I went to see him, and he received me very graciously.</span> <span id="s131">We spent 70 minutes together.</span> <span id="s132">And it ended with his giving our organization access to those enemy supply dumps, which was an important element in equipping our schools, which were pretty barren at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What were your responsibilities with the War Production Board?</span> <span id="s134">A: The War Production Board had a Program Committee and it had 01:20: the industry divisions which were operational -- steel, copper, paper, whatever.</span> <span id="s135">The operating divisions were run by people from industry.</span> <span id="s136">The Program Committee had responsibility for reviewing the proposals made by those operators.</span> <span id="s137">And we were largely academic.</span> <span id="s138">So I was taken on as the pulp and paper specialist, because there was that opening.</span> <span id="s139">I knew nothing about pulp and paper.</span> <span id="s140">When I was offered that assignment to start, let's say, two weeks from then, I went back home and lived in the New York Library for a couple of weeks and studied pulp and paper.</span> <span id="s141">And so I became an instant expert, as a lot of us did in those days in the War Production Board, and in the Government, generally.</span> <span id="s142">So for most of time, that was my beat.</span> <span id="s143">But towards the end, I got more responsible assignments; because I became head of the Research and Analysis Group, which covered all the work of the program people.</span> <span id="s144">And so that got me into steel and copper and oil and any number of other things.</span> <span id="s145">And we had an interesting arrangement at the War Production Board.</span> <span id="s146">The U.S., the U.K. and Canada had a Combined Raw Materials Board.</span> <span id="s147">And the people in my group, our program committee types, 95 percent of our work was on the U.S. but we also served as U.S. staff to the Combined Raw Materials Board.</span> <span id="s148">And we had toward the end a Combined Pulp and Paper Committee, on which I served as executive secretary.</span> <span id="s149">And after VE Day, but before VJ Day, I was one of a</span></p> <p><span id="s150">01:23: commission of two sent to the U.K. and Sweden to line up paper supplies for the liberated areas.</span> <span id="s151">France had an important national election coming up and they didn't have any paper for posters and voting materials; and I earned an undying love from one of my French colleagues for getting them 20,000 tons of paper for those elections.</span> <span id="s152">Why am I doing all of this?</span> <span id="s153">This has nothing to do with the ORT.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Well, I was just trying to get some background.</span> <span id="s155">Although actually, what you're talking about right now seems to me to be some training for all of the logistics and procurement that you got involved with for the Board.</span> <span id="s156">Why don't you tell me how you got to ORT from War Production Board.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Well, it was through my father, who was a friend of Louie Boudine (ph.) who was one of three grand old men of the ORT and chairman of the American ORT Federation.</span> <span id="s158">He had already, starting in '46, had more than a little difference of opinion with Lubovitch (ph.) and Singalovsky (ph.) the two European chiefs.</span> <span id="s159">And he had won a vote to create a financial and accounting office for the ORT in New York, where there would be some control over the numbers and statistics, so when the American ORT went to the Community Funds and foundations for grants, they'd be able to demonstrate what they had done with the money.</span> <span id="s160">Because he couldn't up to that point; he couldn't get the data out of Europe.</span> <span id="s161">So he asked my father for some help.</span> <span id="s162">And my father persuaded me to go see him.</span> <span id="s163">And so our understanding was that I would come to the ORT for a limited period of time to set up this office and get it going.</span> <span id="s164">So that's how I came there.</span> <span id="s165">And that office was in New York on 72nd Street next to Broadway.</span> <span id="s166">And I had got that under way two or three months only, but it was already rolling when -- I guess Boodine mostly, but others in the American ORT became concerned about the way things were going in Germany where they feared the program would collapse.</span> <span id="s167">And in their view everything depended on Germany and the DP camps.</span> <span id="s168">So they asked me to go over and take responsibility for the operation in Germany, U.S. Zone and Austria and British Zone.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Let me just stop you there.</span> <span id="s170">Why was there so much concern about the European operations?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Well, Dr. Lubovitch, who had started the work of the -- not started the work.</span> <span id="s172">He got the organization there, but Jacob Olaseky (ph.) who had been a director of ORT in Kowno before the war on his own steam and initiative, he had started an ORT school in Landsberg where he was liberated.</span> <span id="s173">And then he got some of his former friends who were in other areas to start training operations there; but they were scrounging, they were barefooted and bare-knuckled, and they had no outside support at all.</span> <span id="s174">Lubovitch came into that situation, you see, and "all right, here's the ORT, I'm the ORT."</span> <span id="s175">and made all sorts of commitments and promises of supplies and funds; and in order to help hiring instructors, they were promised -- you know the marks they would be paid were meaningless.</span> <span id="s176">The cigarettes they would be given would help.</span> <span id="s177">But the important thing was the few pounds sterling per month they were promised upon completion of their service in Germany when they came out.</span> <span id="s178">Well, already in 1947, some people were coming out and they would come to an ORT office, whether it was Paris or Geneva or New York, and say "I'm so-and-so; I had so many months of service with ORT; you owe me so-and- so many pounds."</span> <span id="s179">But the people had no documentation.</span> <span id="s180">They had never been notified that nowhere was there a list of people who had been made that commitment and what their service had been and what they were entitled to.</span> <span id="s181">So some of these stories were already getting around, and it had elements of scandal.</span> <span id="s182">So that was one of the things that really terrified the Americans.</span> <span id="s183">They</span></p> <p><span id="s184">01:29:30 were already not in very good odor with the Community Funds all around the country, because they hadn't been able to supply them with data on how many courses, where, how many students, what -- and so they felt pretty low before this happened.</span> <span id="s185">And as I suggested earlier or hinted earlier, Boodine was already into some kind of feud with Singelovsky and Lubovitch, and he was really determined to break their -- what he thought was a death grip on the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Is there a way to sum up what the basis for the feud was; is it too complicated?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well, neither Lubovitch or Singelovsky had any administrative capabilities.</span> <span id="s188">What records they had were little slips of paper or chits in this pocket or that pocket; but no books, no sense of organization.</span> <span id="s189">In presenting data requested by our office in New York, this new financial and accounting office which we had to turn over to the AJDC budget -- I didn't mention that in '47, ORT had always raised its own funds; not very successfully.</span> <span id="s190">But in '47, they made an agreement with the American Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s191">The AJDC would give us a subvention of $2 million a year to the ORT in return for which ORT would refrain from any attempted individual fundraising.</span> <span id="s192">Well, the material that came from our Paris and Geneva offices to the AJDC in Paris on request was just -- "never, never land"; and pitiful, really.</span> <span id="s193">And then there's a third element which was personal.</span> <span id="s194">You know, in the course of my, I guess it was two and a half years I suppose, with the ORT at different times in a personal conversation with Dr. Singelovsky said: I am the ORT.</span> <span id="s195">In a personal conversation with Lubovitch, he said: I am the ORT.</span> <span id="s196">And finally, to my surprise, in a personal conversation with Louie Boodine, he said: I am the ORT.</span> <span id="s197">So here you had these three egos.</span> <span id="s198">All of them old men, Lubovitch ill, Louie Boodine nearly blind -- but a bulldog; and he was determined to wrest what he thought was their death grip or chokehold on the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Was the New York operation pretty controversial?</span> <span id="s200">A: Which?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: When you were in Europe...</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: The financial and accounting office?</span> <span id="s203">Q: Did the Europeans react to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s205">Singelovsky, chiefly, he sabotaged it.</span> <span id="s206">But of course, I started out -- I think I made a mistake at the beginning.</span> <span id="s207">I should have gone over and gotten acquainted personally.</span> <span id="s208">Instead of which, I sat there in New York and I dreamed up these beautiful reporting forms, you know -- financial and educational -- and developed a system where they would go out and they would come in a certain way and the information would be collated and so on.</span> <span id="s209">And Singelovsky wasn't happy with that.</span> <span id="s210">And then quite soon, I told you I was sent over to Germany to take over there, operationally.</span> <span id="s211">And I got a friend to take over in New York for me.</span> <span id="s212">And while I don't think I was terribly politic, he was certainly less so.</span> <span id="s213">And both Singelovsky and Lubovitch couldn't abide him.</span> <span id="s214">They thought he was arrogant.</span> <span id="s215">But -- he was trying to do a job, but not in a terribly sensitive way.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: So you were sent to Germany; where were you sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Munich.</span> <span id="s218">Munich was the headquarters of the USO, and it had had its own turmoil.</span> <span id="s219">There had been a conflict between Jacob Olaseky, who's the real hero in this whole thing, and the Westerners who had been sent in by Lubovitch to oversee the operation.</span> <span id="s220">Olaseky was a DP.</span> <span id="s221">He had no face or status with the IRO or the U.S. military.</span> <span id="s222">The liaison with them was important.</span> <span id="s223">Lubovitch knew that so he sent him people thinking they would play that role, but they would not attempt to interfere with the management of the actual training operations.</span> <span id="s224">Well neither of the people he sent in took it that way; they wanted to boss Olaseky.</span> <span id="s225">He wasn't having it.</span> <span id="s226">And so things there were also not very well.</span> <span id="s227">Well, the first time I was introduced to Olaseky, George Bacca (ph.) was there.</span> <span id="s228">And he was the president of the American ORT.</span> <span id="s229">And I forget who else, maybe it was Lubovitch.</span> <span id="s230">And Olaseky.</span> <span id="s231">And it was plain that Olaseky was resentful.</span> <span id="s232">He was another mischief-maker, another outsider.</span> <span id="s233">"I've done all of this work; whatever is here, I've made without help, and now you're going to..." So when I saw how this was going I said to Jacob, "Let's you and I step out of this meeting and have a word with one another."</span> <span id="s234">And we did.</span> <span id="s235">And when we were alone, I asked him, "What really is your problem here?"</span> <span id="s236">He said, "I have been the director in the U.S. Zone and I cannot lose face by having someone coming in over me."</span> <span id="s237">I said, "What's your proposed solution, then?"</span> <span id="s238">He said, "Let the ORT appoint you to be director for Germany and Austria; then I can be under you, but I still am the chief in the U.S. zone."</span> <span id="s239">I said "wonderful."</span> <span id="s240">And from then on, we never had a spat or difficulty of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: In terms of how all these different groups worked together when you went over there, and you know was the UNRRA with the IRO at this point, maybe?</span> <span id="s242">During that period the UNRRA became IRO but it the same organization, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: How did ORT work with all these organizations over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Well, we didn't have very much to do with anyone except the joint -- the AJDC.</span> <span id="s245">We had some important business to do with them.</span> <span id="s246">You know, it was the joint who gave supplementary rations.</span> <span id="s247">Supplementary rations were very important for us to be able to offer our students who were doing manual work in the metalworking shop and the woodworking shops.</span> <span id="s248">So one the things was to get the joint to classify students as being eligible for supplementary rations, which they did.</span> <span id="s249">Another thing was: It was a big organization, you know; they had a very large staff in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">01:40: They had all sorts of warehousing and supplies.</span> <span id="s251">And I was able to arrange with them where they had supplies that we needed and could use, for them to make them available to us and charge it off against our subvention, which they did.</span> <span id="s252">So that sort of thing was the relationship with joint.</span> <span id="s253">But we had nothing to do with other NGO's, or other voluntary organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: What about the US Military, did you work with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: I told you of the thing with Clay after that it would be up to our district directors to work with the military guys in charge of their areas.</span> <span id="s256">We didn't have to much to do them actually.</span> <span id="s257">But we had a certain number of our people in uniform.</span> <span id="s258">And the uniform was important because it entitled us to -- well, it entitled the wearer to mess privileges, to PX privileges.</span> <span id="s259">The PX privileges was awfully important.</span> <span id="s260">You could buy a carton of cigarettes at the PX for eighty cents.</span> <span id="s261">That was worth 1,500 dollars in the equivalent Marks on the streets.</span> <span id="s262">So you know, this was important trading.</span> <span id="s263">And there were guys who made full use of that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s264">The guys --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: For themselves?</span> <span id="s266">A.Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: For themselves or for themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: For themselves; for themselves.</span> <span id="s269">One American I brought over I known as a specialist in - - what would be the term -- what would be the term?</span> <span id="s270">In testing.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: ??</span> <span id="s272">What sort of administrative hurdles did you have as director of these organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: You mean on the spot in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: You got over there and you found a system in place which didn't appear to very organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What did you find?</span> <span id="s277">What were you able to do to improve that problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, I think the first thing was to develop some hard facts on what we needed by way of equipment and supplies from outside, and to initiate the actions that would bring the men.</span> <span id="s279">Another was to organize or supervise procurement within Germany.</span> <span id="s280">There, there were two things: There was the Army helping us; and the other was purchasing with cigarettes.</span> <span id="s281">We bought Italian lathes that were worth twelve thousand dollars for twelve cartons of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s282">You know, so you could -- and when you imported those at eighty cents a carton and you had thousands of cartons a month allowed you as incentive goods for your instructors and students, you could go a long way with that.</span> <span id="s283">So cigarettes were good currency.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Was this a legitimate process or was this -- A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: -- did you improvise?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I think it was in the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s287">Everyone had been doing it before I got there, I did not invent it.</span> <span id="s288">And as a matter of fact, when sometime later on a disgruntled colleague went after Olaseky, he wanted to bring him down.</span> <span id="s289">And he reported to the IRO that the ORT under Olaseky was black marketing and keeping two sets of books.</span> <span id="s290">Well, they came after Olaseky.</span> <span id="s291">And I said no, I will go to meet your invitation.</span> <span id="s292">It's not for you.</span> <span id="s293">And I think the IRO headquarters is Frankfurt, if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s294">When I came there, they told me there were these charges against Olaseky.</span> <span id="s295">And I said "of course."</span> <span id="s296">You mean you -- you acknowledge you have two sets of books?</span> <span id="s297">I said "of course."</span> <span id="s298">They said, well -- I said, but look ,if you want to come after me, you have to go for the Joint, you have for the Red Cross, you have for the Church World Service, we are all doing it.</span> <span id="s299">Because we have got to stretch our means to meet our needs.</span> <span id="s300">That was the end of it.</span> <span id="s301">So -- well, that was an administrative hurdle of some kind.</span> <span id="s302">But that kind of thing there was plenty of.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Are there other examples you can give of the creative procedures?</span> <span id="s304">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: How you were able to stretch human end resources to make your work effective?</span> <span id="s306">01:47:00</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Well, I think I mentioned the chief ones.</span> <span id="s308">In addition to the subension (ph) from the Joint, much of which was to finance the work of the DP camps, the Women's American ORT -- the Ladies' ORT -- they were prohibited from raising funds, as such; but they could have value-received functions.</span> <span id="s309">And they raised some money that way.</span> <span id="s310">They came and got around and looked and tried to be helpful and contributed here or there with -- toward various projects.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: For example?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Well, like providing a car for Olaseky, so he could have transportation; things like that.</span> <span id="s313">Q: What other problems did you spot when you went over there that needed to be corrected?</span> <span id="s314">A: Supply, I think, was the first and most basic.</span> <span id="s315">Organizing the courses of instruction; because they been very al fresco.</span> <span id="s316">They had initially been left to the artisans who took responsibility for running the course; but these courses had to be developed and organized and more standardized and so on.</span> <span id="s317">We had to develop an inspectorial staff who would go round and check out and make suggestion and try to give superintendency.</span> <span id="s318">We had a transportation problem of some seriousness, because we were spread all over the country.</span> <span id="s319">Means of transportation were -- you know, you didn't have trains or planes.</span> <span id="s320">So we needed cars for our district directors and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Has you question been recorded?</span> <span id="s323">Q: No, but it doesn't need to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well, I have been -- I've been trying to state, I think, all along what the general and particular situations were that we had to face and how tried to cope with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Is there anything else that you can think of; you mentioned different areas of professional training, supplies.</span> <span id="s326">What about, did you have focus at all on the living conditions for the DPs, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: The chief thing on that had to do with the supplementary rations for the students; and that I have already been onto.</span> <span id="s328">We also, you know, gave -- I forget, now, how many -- but at least a few cigarettes each week to the students, and more to the instructors.</span> <span id="s329">And these were a very important part of their compensation.</span> <span id="s330">But the supplementary rations was really a most important factor in the students' well-being and their interest in continuing the work.</span> <span id="s331">You know, already, late in '47, I suppose it was, we were getting visiting delegations from countries considering opening immigration to DPs.</span> <span id="s332">Canada and Australia were particularly interested and open.</span> <span id="s333">The people in the camps knew that when they were interviewed as candidates, to be able to say they had a skill or show they had a skill or show a diploma of proficiency was a very important element in their being accepted.</span> <span id="s334">So that was one of our big inducements.</span> <span id="s335">And</span></p> <p><span id="s336">01:52:30 these other things, the rations and cigarettes, were perhaps as important.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: What did you think was your biggest challenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: I don't know whether this is challenge, but my greatest difficulty was, in a way, mediating between the Americans and the Europeans.</span> <span id="s339">This had nothing to do with the training operations in Germany.</span> <span id="s340">But it involved all sorts of things periodic meetings in Geneva and Paris; flying back in mid-winter to New York for a critical meeting when the American ORT was ready to cut off transfers of funds to our Geneva and Paris offices and wanted me to be the hatchet man, and serve as the president's deputy and do the money control myself, which I refused to do.</span> <span id="s341">But that was a very trying and tense and distasteful part of the job; but unavoidable.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Did you have a sense that the European ORT program and the US or the camps in various zones were administered differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: I don't get your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Well, I am wondering if, for example, in the British zone, where clearly there was more of a different kind of interest in Palestine and in training and all of that, whether they allowed the same amount of democracy and choice as in the US Zone, where I think we were much more eager to prepare people for Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Who's we?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: The U.S.; the American ORT; no?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: No.</span> <span id="s348">I don't think the American ORT people the Board, were hot Zionists, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: I just thought maybe that the British-run camp might have a different interest.</span> <span id="s350">But maybe</span></p> <p><span id="s351">not.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: There weren't enough of them to have significance from a policy point of view anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Did any of this bickering between European and the Americans ORT organizations translate into the vocational program?</span> <span id="s354">Did they affect that at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Not in terribly significant ways, but one instance that come to mind was, not long after I had been there, I had put the whole organization to work to develop a list of requirements, how many of this, that and the other machines do you need in your school, in your district, in the Zone?</span> <span id="s356">And this was a painstaking operation in which the whole organization participated.</span> <span id="s357">And when it was done and I had reviewed and I done some pruning, I went to Geneva for a meeting with Dr. Singelovsky and Dr. Lubovitch, and we arrived at an understanding of how much this thing would cost -- his engineers there did the estimating -- and who would what.</span> <span id="s358">Singelovsky undertook to do a significant part of the procurement.</span> <span id="s359">Well, it turned out months later he hadn't done a damned thing about that part of the procurement.</span> <span id="s360">Well that was an effect; that affected the pace and progress of the work.</span> <span id="s361">But he was not a killer diller.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What was the general philosophy behind the ORT training in the DP camps?</span> <span id="s365">A: You're confident there must have been one?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Wondering?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Well, you know the ORT got founded originally in response to a widespread belief that the Jew was a Luftmensch you know; an air person, feet off the ground, not a down-to-earth, productive person.</span> <span id="s368">And in a way the thought was, through acquiring a skill and being an artisan, the Jew would demonstrate that this was a canard; it was not true.</span> <span id="s369">He was normal like everybody else.</span> <span id="s370">In Germany, I don't know how much philosophy there was.</span> <span id="s371">There was job to done.</span> <span id="s372">There were these people who were there waiting for a chance to emigrate who were idle; who had to have some constructive occupation.</span> <span id="s373">It was natural place and setting for Olaseky to undertake what he did.</span> <span id="s374">It was natural for the ORTs to see a great challenge and opportunity to go in there and make a real program out of it.</span> <span id="s375">He could not have gone very far by himself without the means.</span> <span id="s376">But I don't know that this adds to a philosophy.</span> <span id="s377">Opportunity, obligation, community.</span> <span id="s378">There was great sympathy in this country for the people for the people in the DP camps, you know.</span> <span id="s379">And you know, you don't give a man fish; you give a rod and line and teach him how to fish to support himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: How large of an effort was the ORT operation at DP camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: We got up to something like ninety training instillations; something like ten or eleven thousand students/enrollees; and something like a thousand employees, of whom about seven hundred would have been instructors and the others would be support staff of one kind or another.</span> <span id="s382">And I think that's about where it peaked.</span> <span id="s383">When I came in early in '47, we had in the U.S. Zone about forty-five hundred people -- enrollees; and four hundred-odd staff.</span> <span id="s384">But it was growing very rapidly, and by the</span></p> <p><span id="s385">02:05: end of the year it was up to eight thousand students and seven hundred-odd staff.</span> <span id="s386">I think, you know, for the first year, the people, the DP's, didn't really know what was happening and what was likely to happen.</span> <span id="s387">But then it became obvious that immigration was not going to be tomorrow; and it soon became obvious that they would need a skill or demonstrable skill.</span> <span id="s388">That would be important factor in their being accepted for emigration.</span> <span id="s389">So this is why they started coming in in much larger numbers.</span> <span id="s390">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Were the courses specific to any particular country or destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s393">They had no way of knowing where they were going.</span> <span id="s394">Remember in '47, this was before the creation of the state.</span> <span id="s395">It was still Palestine, and the Brits were still very, very restrictive on admitting immigrants.</span> <span id="s396">Also sorts of tragic incidents of which you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Did the immigration authorities you would work with from time to time, they were looking for --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I had no occasion to -- Q: -- metalworkers?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I had no occasion to --</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: You said they were coming through from --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes, they were; they were.</span> <span id="s402">And they visiting camps and interviewing people.</span> <span id="s403">And I don't -- I don't know that -- that say, Australia or Canada at any given time had in mind a concentration on metalworkers or machinists or what have you.</span> <span id="s404">They were looking people, though, who could become productive and self-sustaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: What kind of courses were given?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I showed you that long list you know.</span> <span id="s407">Q: Well, give me a since of the range.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Well, metalworking, carpentry, woodworking, mechanics, radio mechanics, electricians, dressmaking and millinery.</span> <span id="s409">We had some in dental assistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: How do you -- how did people -- how did the organizations decide what sorts of courses to offer; was there any plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No.</span> <span id="s412">It was opportunistic in terms of the skills that were found there among the DP's.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">People who would be competent to transmit a skill.</span> <span id="s414">And so that became the basis for a course.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">02:09: Now, there is something else I didn't say earlier and is an important element here: '46, '47, '48, people wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s416">They wanted a chance to immigrate.</span> <span id="s417">If you offered a course, let's say, that would be a two-year course of training in something, no customers; one-year course, no customers; three months, yes.</span> <span id="s418">So you'd start off with a three-month course in metalwork.</span> <span id="s419">When that was concluded and nothing had happen on the immigration front, you organized a sequel to it, another three months.</span> <span id="s420">And that was how - - but they were all short courses.</span> <span id="s421">They had to be; that was the psychology.</span> <span id="s422">People would not commit themselves, couldn't commit themselves to a more prolonged stay when they didn't -- that was not what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Could people choose whatever course -- whatever kind of study they wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">Yes.</span> <span id="s426">If it was being offered, if there was an instructor to give it and there was room.</span> <span id="s427">Q: And were the opportunities different for men and women?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, they'd be different -- different courses of study, but the opportunity were there for everyone.</span> <span id="s429">Helena Volcalvich (ph.) who subsequently became Helena Olaseky, she was in charge of all the women's courses.</span> <span id="s430">She is an admirable, highly competent, attractive woman and she did a great job.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So there women courses?</span> <span id="s432">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: But all programs would have been open to anybody who --</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yeah, but I don't think we had men going for dressmaking or millinery; and we had very few girls signing up for woodworking or metalworking.</span> <span id="s435">Auto mechanics, that was what I didn't mention before that was quit popular.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Was there any effort to meet educational standards or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: That was coming in later ,say toward the end of '48 and then in '49, it became -- it became -- it raised standards to a degree that impressed Franklin Keller, who had been a long-time principal of a vocational training high school in New York City and who is there as a specialist for the Army, and our French Dr. Frankel who had a life time of experience in vocational training.</span> <span id="s438">They were much impressed with the level that had been achieved.</span> <span id="s439">But it happen very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Who did most of the teaching in the training?</span> <span id="s441">02:13:</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: DP's.</span> <span id="s443">DP's who had been artisans, craftsmen; very few had been pedagogues.</span> <span id="s444">But in some of the more recent technologies like radio mechanics, electricians, we didn't have very many among them the DP population and we hired Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Did that work out pretty well?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Well, it apparently it worked all right.</span> <span id="s447">It jolted me when I first got exposed to it; I couldn't -- I think I mentioned to this to you on the way here: When I was taken for the first time introduced to a German instructor and he held out his hand, I couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s448">But my host, Jacob Olaseky, who had been liberated in Landsberg, he had no problem fraternizing.</span> <span id="s449">Another time I didn't mention this earlier, we had been out on the road and it was time to stop for meal, and Olaseky and I went in to eat, he invited the driver to come with us, the driver who was a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Did you think that that was indicative of the general attitude_?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: I didn't know.</span> <span id="s452">I don't think it was general.</span> <span id="s453">I told you another story of a very different kind of Gordon who wanted me let him to qualify to drive truck, because he wanted to find a crowd of Germans and run the truck over them.</span> <span id="s454">So the feelings</span></p> <p><span id="s455">02:15: were mixed to the individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: What about training facilities; where were all these installations?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Well, they were in camps or in the residential community where the DP's gathered in the given town, and there was always a camp committee, and the camp had to allocate space.</span> <span id="s458">And some were more generous, some were more desirous of helping and doing everything they could; and others were not so interested and not so benign in the facilities they provided; but that is how it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Did you ever need to coordinate with or use German facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Not to my knowledge, but I would not have been involved with that sort of thing very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Or what about programs at German factories, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No.</span> <span id="s463">I know about those only as they were described to me, but I -- I never found time to go and see one of those things in operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: But just for the record, there was training in German factories?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I don't know if you'd call it training.</span> <span id="s466">It was the equivalent.</span> <span id="s467">What happen was that often, our people in their institutions didn't have the materials necessary for the training; and these would be consumables like textiles, for instance.</span> <span id="s468">If you're going to make dresses, you need yardage.</span> <span id="s469">But if you don't have the goods, then what do your kids do?</span> <span id="s470">And sometimes in a class, you have a one sewing machine and 15 pupils.</span> <span id="s471">This was early on.</span> <span id="s472">So improvising, our people at the headquarters made arrangements occasionally for some of our students to work in a factory as juniors or assistants or whatever, so they would get some training that way.</span> <span id="s473">But this is really learning by doing, more -- vocational training is learning by doing anyway, but a -- taking part in a production process would not develop an artisan, it would train in a particular</span></p> <p><span id="s474">02:18: operation rather than a general skill.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Were there efforts to provide psychological support or social services as well at some of the vocational school?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I brought in one guy from the States who had taken a doctorate in guidance.</span> <span id="s477">And I thought he could make a real difference and I thought we needed such a person.</span> <span id="s478">But there was an unhappy outcome there.</span> <span id="s479">He hadn't been very long on the spot in Munich when it was reported to me that he was in trouble.</span> <span id="s480">He had been to Switzerland and he was caught at the borders smuggling silver ingot.</span> <span id="s481">So I had no recourse; I had to put him on the next train to Paris.</span> <span id="s482">I had to get him out of there or otherwise he would have gone to jail.</span> <span id="s483">That was the end of vocational guidance specialist program.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: A lot of these displaced persons needed all kinds of counseling and psychological support, doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Well, maybe they did, but I don't think they got it from the ORT in any formal way.</span> <span id="s486">It would've been truly incidental to the major activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Would you say that the real enthusiasm for the training is 02:20:15</span></p> <p><span id="s488">being given?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: I don't know how to answer that.</span> <span id="s490">I visited a certain number of schools and training operations briefly.</span> <span id="s491">I found them busy, active.</span> <span id="s492">I think the trainees were interested in what they were doing.</span> <span id="s493">I think they found it valuable.</span> <span id="s494">I think their instructors were doing there best to be helpful.</span> <span id="s495">But when you ask about enthusiasm, I don't know -- I don't know how to answer that.</span> <span id="s496">These people have been, I think, too recently bruised to be very enthusiastic about anything, including life.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: There was a commitment to --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: There was a future.</span> <span id="s499">They knew that.</span> <span id="s500">That was their objective: To qualify for and make possible the future.</span> <span id="s501">I don't think "enthusiasm" is the right word.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Do you think that the operation was largely successful, from your experience; from what</span></p> <p><span id="s503">you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s505">Of course.</span> <span id="s506">It was very, very far from perfect.</span> <span id="s507">It was certainly less than ideal, but considering the circumstances, the difficulties, the obstacles and everything else that went with the beast, I think one could take satisfaction in the accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Were there certain programs that were more successful than others, in terms of job skills or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I don't know how to answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: The DP's, themselves, who seemed to enroll in these courses?</span> <span id="s511">02:23: Is there any demographic breakdown to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: By demographic breakdown, you mean age groups, for example, sex?</span> <span id="s513">Q: Age, sex, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, I suppose mostly youngish people and young people.</span> <span id="s515">As many women as men, surely.</span> <span id="s516">Some youngsters and a few older people.</span> <span id="s517">It was a mixed --</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Did a lot of these people come with prior job skills?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Well, the younger ones would not have had many job skills.</span> <span id="s520">They wouldn't have had the opportunity to develop them.</span> <span id="s521">The job skills were among our instructors.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: What was general morale like in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: I think it varied.</span> <span id="s524">It varied with the same people from month to month.</span> <span id="s525">You know, it wasn't -- I told you that there were an awful lot of big bellies among the women because, it seemed, after experiencing all that death and observing all that death and losing so much family, everyone wanted to produce a baby.</span> <span id="s526">And the women were getting pregnant as fast as they could</span></p> <p><span id="s527">02:25:25</span></p> <p><span id="s528">and hoping.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did that pose any special problems or challenges?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: You mean the pregnancies?</span> <span id="s531">No.</span> <span id="s532">That was very welcomed.</span> <span id="s533">It was a sign of health and invigoration in what had been a horrible down, you know.</span> <span id="s534">And the women who had already produced a young one were so happy and doted on them and --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Was this more of a thing the camp administration had to deal with?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Well, I think, in terms of camp administrations, I imagine there was quite a disparity of manner, quality, interests, humanity; and adressed it very much with the individual commander how those things were done.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Were there a few camps that you spent most of your time at?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: No, I was based in Munich.</span> <span id="s539">And as it turned out, I soon became involved in a triangular run from Munich to Geneva or Zurich to Paris; because that inner conflict within the ORT, by 1948, I hadn't been there quite a year, the Americans insisted that as part of the solution to that organization or crisis, or so they conceived it, that I be designated as Secretary General of the World ORT Union.</span> <span id="s540">So I had to take that on on top of, you know, Germany; and it meant that I had to spend a certain amount of time at the Paris headquarters and I had to spend a certain amount of time in Geneva back when it was in Singelovsky.</span> <span id="s541">I didn't -- I didn't really give the DP operation the full attention it needed, because I didn't -- I had these other things thrust on top of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I don't recollect talking about a rift.</span> <span id="s544">When the State was inaugurated, early in '48, the Jewish Agency from Palestine, the Sochnut, became very active in organizing an Alyah and they did the rounds of the camps -- and the response was very strong; it was very good.</span> <span id="s545">Because immigration to other countries had not really opened up in a big, significant way.</span> <span id="s546">So it was clear that</span></p> <p><span id="s547">02:29: most of the DPs would be finding their way to Israel.</span> <span id="s548">And so that became the point of concentration.</span> <span id="s549">And because of that, you know, I started, without authorization, shipping machine equipment to Israel so it would be there when people got there, and we could have the training operation essentially shift.</span> <span id="s550">And that's what did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: How were you able to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: (Laughs) We loaded the machinery on ships and sent it.</span> <span id="s553">Q: It was that simple?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Well, more or less.</span> <span id="s555">I had a -- I had a very good supply man who made the arrangements.</span> <span id="s556">I think, actually, our stuff went by rail through Italy, and was put on board ship there.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: This was all through ORT channels?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: No.</span> <span id="s559">I think -- well, we were ORT, weren't we?</span> <span id="s560">Singelovsky opposed this.</span> <span id="s561">He did not see a future for ORT in Israel.</span> <span id="s562">He thought the future of ORT was in East Germany.</span> <span id="s563">And when he learned that I had already initiated this program of shipping are machines to Israel, he had me called to a meeting of the executive committee in Geneva, and put me on the carpet for this unauthorized action, which I naturally defended.</span> <span id="s564">And the decision of that committee at the end of the meeting -- and these were his people -- I mean, his -- Swiss and other French and other friends who are on the executive -- the end of that meeting, the upshot was he was instructed to go to Israel and start the work there.</span> <span id="s565">He didn't win that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: How important were the ORT activities there in terms of providing a base for future Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Well, this a question that's germane to the DP operation.</span> <span id="s568">02:32: It's not germane to the very scanty training there was in the U.K. or the somewhat larger training that took place in France.</span> <span id="s569">It was -- or Holland or Belgium.</span> <span id="s570">It was the DP population.</span> <span id="s571">And there it was most significant, because here came large numbers of skilled artisans who were the instructors and administrators, and trainees, who had developed from minimum to pretty decent skills in their chosen occupations.</span> <span id="s572">And then, of course, the training got underway very quickly in Israel, because the ORT operation grew rapidly, because Olaseky went there.</span> <span id="s573">And this man was a dynamo.</span> <span id="s574">Actually, he's the man who saved the ORT.</span> <span id="s575">And so whereas Lubovitch and Singelovsky and Boodine all thought that they were ORT, he was really the ORT.</span> <span id="s576">He was the heart and the soul and the dynamo.</span> <span id="s577">And I ended up loving this guy.</span> <span id="s578">He's a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s579">But you know what he told me once, though?</span> <span id="s580">It's very distressing.</span> <span id="s581">He said, "Louie, the best people in the camps did not survive.</span> <span id="s582">We who survived were not the best people."</span> <span id="s583">And you know what he meant?</span> <span id="s584">The people who stole other people's rations, you know, who really managed at the expense of others.</span> <span id="s585">And the abnegating, the gentle, the kind, the good; they're the ones who did not survive.</span> <span id="s586">And he felt this very, very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: What made him so effective?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Imagination, energy, creativity.</span> <span id="s589">It's hard to describe.</span> <span id="s590">One of the things I gave to the museum a few years ago was a book about him that was done after his death which is composed largely of testimonials of any number of people; a small one from me.</span> <span id="s591">And so they show a number of facets of this man.</span> <span id="s592">But just -- just bursting with energy and creativity.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Now, we're talking about the role of the DPs and the training in Europe and providing a foundation for Israel.</span> <span id="s594">Is there anything more that you want to add there?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No.</span> <span id="s596">I think that's -- that's the -- that's an element which I think is significant, that made a significant contribution to the early growth of the State, helped provide a foundation for its economy and enabled the newcomers to contribute to the building of the State.</span> <span id="s597">And maybe the most important thing that came out of the DP experience was that contribution.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: And I'm not sure I want to inflict them.</span> <span id="s600">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: But I must tell you my experience with the ORT was my first experience with a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s602">And I had a subsequent one with the World Jewish Congress, another connection.</span> <span id="s603">And I thought, among the so-called leadership -- not only the triumvirate whose names came up so often earlier -- but, you know, members of the executive, members of the leadership ranks; a good deal of the motivation was that of personal ego, rather than, you know, the desire to do a good work.</span> <span id="s604">And this is not very --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: How's it going?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: What's, you know -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Maybe you can address it?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: No.</span> <span id="s611">It's a reflection, that's all.</span> <span id="s612">But it's the human condition too, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: How do you personally feel about going over there as a Jew and the work that you were able to accomplish, or what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I felt very good about it.</span> <span id="s615">I was grateful for the opportunity to do it.</span> <span id="s616">It didn't turn out to be unalloyed pleasure, as I've indicated more than once.</span> <span id="s617">But I thought it was an opportunity to render service; and I was glad to do it, thankful for the opportunity.</span> <span id="s618">Some years -- many years later, World Jewish Congress created an International Economic and Social Commission to try to anticipate some of the results of the desired peace in the Middle East.</span> <span id="s619">We became really an inquiry into the status of the issues facing world Jewry and, particularly, Israel to the Diaspor</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: And I had a wonderful 02:41:30 commission, some great people on it.</span> <span id="s621">But I had to carry the ball.</span> <span id="s622">And I was very grateful for the opportunity to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: When you went over to Europe in '47, and you took a look at the situation -- not just the ORT situation, but the general DP situation, was it -- was it what you expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No.</span> <span id="s625">Because it was so personalized.</span> <span id="s626">You know, it wasn't ORT.</span> <span id="s627">It was Olaseky, it was Lubovitch, it was Singalovsky, it was Boudine, it was clashes, it was this, it was that.</span> <span id="s628">So -- it really took one off -- you know, the golfer says you come off the shot.</span> <span id="s629">Do you play golf?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: A little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Well, you come off the shot, and you spoil it.</span> <span id="s632">But it's lifting your body away instead of going through.</span> <span id="s633">Well, in any activity, there's a danger of coming off the shot.</span> <span id="s634">And there was a lot there to take you off the real shot, which was the DP training operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
