<span id="s48">They used...used to go up on the hills more than in the things.</span> <span id="s49">But...uh... like I say back home, one child raised another you know.</span> <span id="s50">That's

I did survive after my father went...uh...somewhere into...to Hungary, and he brought some kind of special medicine and I did survive.</span> <span id="s68">I had to learn starting scratch to walk and talk, you know, and all those things.</span> <span id="s69">So...uh...not much schooling.</span> <span id="s70">No.</span> <span id="s71">I hate to say, but I wish but not much.</span> <span id="s72">So...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Did you have many friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s75">I had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s76">We used to play

care...used to wash the dishes and the dishes, the dishes you know, and busy around the house, but every Saturday afternoon, we used to go out playing and we played whenever we had a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What were the relations like between the Christians and the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Good.</span> <span id="s84">Very good.</span> <span id="s85">They were so good that my...mine father, he used to come into the house...my father did business, and we used to buy milk from them and...uh...every time they came, they always hug each other.</span> <span id="s86">My father with them.</span> <span id="s87">They were my father's friends.</span> <span id="s88">We were the best relationships you ever saw in your life which I could not understand afterwards.</span> <span id="s89">So...uh...when the thing came, start the...I mean they took out the Czechs...Czechs...you know, the Hungarian took over Czechoslovakian, and they took out the Czechs.</span> <span id="s90">They just did to the Czechs the same thing they did to the Jews.</span> <span id="s91">In 1939, all the Czechs were evacuated and the Hungarians took over.</span> <span id="s92">Uh...That time the problem started the Jews in 1939.</span> <span id="s93">They took away mine...half of the town, almost the whole town, Jews already to...uh... Poland...Poland, Ukrainian, my father's whole family.</span> <span id="s94">He had a lot of brothers and sisters and my grandparents, they all was taken away.</span> <span id="s95">We wanted to...they were going to take us too, but my father was in labor camp of the Hungarian.</span> <span id="s96">And my mother went into hiding and we were just walking around on the streets, you know, the kids.</span> <span id="s97">That time where we started the problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Tell me a little more about that.</span> <span id="s99">What...what do you remember?</span> <span id="s100">How did it begin to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Uh...It was terrible.</span> <span id="s103">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s104">It was just awful that time the way the....uh...Hungarian came in and you know, and they start putting all the Jews on the big...uh ...uh...trucks, you know, and...uh...everybody saw what...the way they were beating up and...and.</span> <span id="s105">I was...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s106">And so my mother, she should rest in peace...she...and my father was...was in the labor camp, so somehow, I don't know.</span> <span id="s107">They don't touch that, but my mother was in hiding all the time.</span> <span id="s108">She just...she had...she had a feeling that what they going to do with the Jews, you know, and she...I don't know what...and she had a fear and they killed all, almost all the whole town Jews then.</span> <span id="s109">But the one...the little bit who stayed behind, the...uh...in 1940, they start taking away.</span> <span id="s110">Well, in 1940...uh...when the...the whole thing started more, the Jews...was after Passover....I was...I was very...I got sick again.</span> <span id="s111">I had...uh...I developed pneumonia, was very sick.</span> <span id="s112">So took all the Jews.</span> <span id="s113">They came to the house and...uh...they saw I was with a high temperature.</span> <span id="s114">I was very sick, so the...the...German...the Hung...the police, they brought a doctor and the doctor said that...uh...I'm not going to survive long.</span> <span id="s115">I'm not going to live that long.</span> <span id="s116">He should leave me die in...in my bed.</span> <span id="s117">So...uh...instead, they took my father, the rest of the children to the ghetto and they left my mother home with me I should die.</span> <span id="s118">So she should bury me.</span> <span id="s119">So everybody was gone.</span> <span id="s120">And my mother... uh...she knew.</span> <span id="s121">She, like I tell you, she had feeling that they're gonna kills us.</span> <span id="s122">They're gonna kill us.</span> <span id="s123">They're gonna kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s124">They're gonna kill us all.</span> <span id="s125">So she decided that we had saved up some money.</span> <span id="s126">She paid for this ...uh...uh...Christian...uh...to come and bring a horse and buggy and take us up to the hill, you know, to hide us out.</span> <span id="s127">On Saturday night, I remember we came down like middle of the night...middle of the night, and they put me on because I..</span> <span id="s128">.</span> <span id="s129">I was very weak and with my mother and they took us to the hills and they put us up in a..</span> <span id="s130">.</span> <span id="s131">on top of the barn, you know the barn.</span> <span id="s132">Sunday morning, just like a..</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">can never forget it as long as I live, Sunday morning it was cold you know after a rainy day.</span> <span id="s135">It was right after Passover.</span> <span id="s136">It was...uh... uh...very miserable outside, Fall, and there was a lot of Jews hiding out in the woods, you know, there in the hills.</span> <span id="s137">So...uh...where we were staying, hiding, there was girls you know, girls, and they were...uh...had boyfriends.</span> <span id="s138">So Sunday morning the boys came to visit the girls.</span> <span id="s139">And the Jews came out from out of the hills to...to sit on the sun to warm up.</span> <span id="s140">They were freezing.</span> <span id="s141">They were cold.</span> <span id="s142">They were wet.</span> <span id="s143">So they were sitting under the trees, under the sun, and we could, you know, on the top of the barn where...where there was, you know, between the woods you could see.</span> <span id="s144">So when they...they came to visit the girls, they noticed that Jews are hiding or sitting there.</span> <span id="s145">So they went and they took a piece of wood, you know, long thing, you know, wood.</span> <span id="s146">Went up and they were killing all the Jews, beating on them and killing.</span> <span id="s147">And those horrible screams.</span> <span id="s148">It still is in my ears.</span> <span id="s149">Those screams.</span> <span id="s150">Please...they begged.</span> <span id="s151">They were screaming.</span> <span id="s152">There was a lot of children and crying and screaming.</span> <span id="s153">It was just unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Unbelievable!</span> <span id="s155">So I told my mother...I start feeling a little better.</span> <span id="s156">I said to my mother, I said, "Look, whatever is going to happen, it all...my father and all rest of the family and all the rest of the Jews has to happen with us.</span> <span id="s157">We're not staying here.</span> <span id="s158">We have to go down.</span> <span id="s159">We have to go.</span> <span id="s160">We have...otherwise, they're going to kill us like....you see what's going on.</span> <span id="s161">Those kids...those screaming, those crying.</span> <span id="s162">They killed them to death.”</span> <span id="s163">So the next day, we decided we gonna volunteer go down into the town, walk down to the town.</span> <span id="s164">Uh...I was very weak so my mother said...uh...whoever asked us where we're coming from...uh...she's bringing me from the hospital...and there was a hospital in another town.</span> <span id="s165">So slowly, slowly, you know, we walked down and took us hours, but I..</span> <span id="s166">.</span> <span id="s167">I had to rest because I was very...uh...nobody would have anything to do with Jews.</span> <span id="s168">So one time we stopped exactly like I said with my father how they lived...lived together.</span> <span id="s169">We lived...they lived liked brothers.</span> <span id="s170">So...uh...sit down on his front, you know, the steps where you into the house.</span> <span id="s171">At least my mother...my mother carried a few stuff, a few things on her back, you know, blankets, some clothes.</span> <span id="s172">She carried some stuff with her and he...he came out with a piece of wood and he said...uh...he took that stuff from my mother and he said, "You're not going to use...be able to use that.</span> <span id="s173">They're going to kill you...before I kill you.</span> <span id="s174">Let.</span> <span id="s175">."</span> <span id="s176">.</span> <span id="s177">So he wanted ...uh...you know, kill us, beat us up.</span> <span id="s178">He said, "Don't...I want...I don't want to see you here.</span> <span id="s179">Don't sit here.</span> <span id="s180">He wouldn't let us sit.”</span> <span id="s181">So we had to walk further.</span> <span id="s182">That's.</span> <span id="s183">.</span> <span id="s184">that's why I..</span> <span id="s185">.</span> <span id="s186">every time I remember, you know, I say that...uh.</span> <span id="s187">.</span> <span id="s188">how you live together with friends and everything, but your best friend was your worst enemy.</span> <span id="s189">And it's true.</span> <span id="s190">And so we finally came down, walked down to town and there was a train coming with the rest...some more Jews.</span> <span id="s191">And we went up on a train and they took us to...uh...ghetto, and not the same ghetto where my father was with the children.</span> <span id="s192">Different ghetto.</span> <span id="s193">We never saw each other.</span> <span id="s194">(Sigh) Took us to ghetto.</span> <span id="s195">Was the Hungarian ghetto, and...uh.</span> <span id="s196">.</span> <span id="s197">it was terrible there.</span> <span id="s198">There was this Hungarian policeman.</span> <span id="s199">He went and they throw down a 50 cent piece, you know, on the floor and then picked it and went around and asked who threw this money away, and beat everybody who was...he could lay a hand on.</span> <span id="s200">Beat up everybody with a stick, you know.</span> <span id="s201">Everybody who could...who could just be there close by him, he beat him up.</span> <span id="s202">And my mother got beaten up terrible.</span> <span id="s203">"You threw the 50 cents down.”</span> <span id="s204">My mother said, "No.”</span> <span id="s205">So he gave her over her face that...uh...blood start pouring you know.</span> <span id="s206">So we were there...uh...about 6 weeks in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s207">And then...then they start taking us to Auschwitz, put us in those trains you know, and those...uh...you know what they take the cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Cattle cars.</span> <span id="s210">Right.</span> <span id="s211">Put...uh...so much people that you couldn't even breath in the train and throw them out you know.</span> <span id="s212">(Sigh) And everybody just... they knew, those Jews.</span> <span id="s213">They knew that...those crying, those praying, praying and scream to God.</span> <span id="s214">Why?</span> <span id="s215">Help us my my prayer .</span> <span id="s216">So...uh...lot of people died from heart attacks and was dead by the time they got to...to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s217">We arrived in Auschwitz and...uh...train stopped.</span> <span id="s218">So I was, like I say, I very, very...you could see on that picture, young, little weak and you know, very sick for a long time, pneumonia.</span> <span id="s219">And you have to live.</span> <span id="s220">You live so anyway, we arrived to Auschwitz and...uh...took us...it was some Jewish people came up the train and said to us, "Whatever we do, don't say that we are sick or weak or sick.</span> <span id="s221">Don't volunteer that...uh...we are sick.”</span> <span id="s222">We didn't know what he meant, but...uh....so anyway all everybody came off the train and...uh...we had to leave everything on the train.</span> <span id="s223">Naked.</span> <span id="s224">You know.</span> <span id="s225">They took over all the clothes, everything.</span> <span id="s226">Naked.</span> <span id="s227">And you stand in the line and Mengele was sitting there, Dr.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Mengele they called him.</span> <span id="s229">And...uh...left, right, you know, all the...all the...announced every young woman should take the baby, give their children to the elderly, to the mother, to the elderly people.</span> <span id="s230">So that's what the people did.</span> <span id="s231">Every child was gone to the...to the mother, to the you know, and to the left, and to the right, to the left.</span> <span id="s232">You know there was not...the Gestapos, and the....and to the right, to the left.</span> <span id="s233">I was with my mother and...uh...he separated us and he put me to the left and they put her to the right.</span> <span id="s234">She was only 39 years old.</span> <span id="s235">She was a young woman.</span> <span id="s236">So...uh...then when he came in the line, you know, Mengele.</span> <span id="s237">He said...uh...he said...on Germany, he talked to us, ....if we are healthy, if are sick, or something, is sorting out.</span> <span id="s238">He talked so nice, so soft, you know.</span> <span id="s239">So (sigh) we passed that.</span> <span id="s240">We said, "No, we're not sick," and all of a sudden I talk a look.</span> <span id="s241">My mother's there next to me again.</span> <span id="s242">I tell you...I don't know, a miracle cause I couldn't survive without her.</span> <span id="s243">So then...uh...you know, they put us in a..</span> <span id="s244">.</span> <span id="s245">in a..</span> <span id="s246">.</span> <span id="s247">took us in a big building and they cut our hair from the top, bottom and and those screaming.</span> <span id="s248">Nobody recognized each other.</span> <span id="s249">You don't recognize your mother.</span> <span id="s250">Your mother didn't recognize you, and after we came out from that place, we stayed.</span> <span id="s251">.</span> <span id="s252">uh... c'est l'appell, they called it c'est l'appell,...uh...to 5 women in the line and...uh...they count us and they took us to the...to the , you know the barracks to...uh...called a lager.</span> <span id="s253">That was in our lager, my mother.</span> <span id="s254">So we got in there and I..</span> <span id="s255">.</span> <span id="s256">uh...I got very weak.</span> <span id="s257">(Sigh) I got so weak that and all the , with all the problems I was lucky to...cause the...the man, you know who took care of .</span> <span id="s258">The , the Gestapo did.</span> <span id="s259">She was...uh...from Czechoslovakian and she was very sweet.</span> <span id="s260">She was very good to me.</span> <span id="s261">If not her, I wouldn't survive because...uh...when they came to count you, they looked at you and they took you out of there and put you right away in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s262">So she somehow put two...two...uh...split up the people so that I should stay in and start, you know, what I mean.</span> <span id="s263">She always left me out behind so I should...I should survive.</span> <span id="s264">I was lucky that way...that, you know.</span> <span id="s265">I..</span> <span id="s266">.</span> <span id="s267">uh...I was there and my mother ...uh...a piece of bread that they gave us every 2, 3 days there in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s268">And she didn't eat, but she fed me with it so I should, you know, pull myself together.</span> <span id="s269">And...uh...then...uh...(sigh) how much she tried, you know, to be nice to you, but it was not...she was afraid too, you know.</span> <span id="s270">She...everybody...everybody was for their own skin there.</span> <span id="s271">Everybody tried to survive.</span> <span id="s272">It was just terrible.</span> <span id="s273">You have to go to the bathroom they...they beat you up.</span> <span id="s274">They chopped your head off.</span> <span id="s275">They...it didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s276">It just didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s277">So we...uh...we saw, you know, we saw that the screaming...we saw that the crima...crimatorium.</span> <span id="s278">They took us one day to see...to the crematorium and they told us, "If you're not going to behave, whatever we tell us to do, we should it.</span> <span id="s279">If this Gestapo wants to sleep with you, you better let him sleep with you.</span> <span id="s280">Otherwise, you see, the flames," he said.</span> <span id="s281">"There you're going be in the flames.”</span> <span id="s282">So everyday they took us there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Every day.</span> <span id="s284">Everyday and there you could see all the horrible, horrible things.</span> <span id="s285">Our...I don't know the manager and what she took care of us there, she said, "The minute there's a..</span> <span id="s286">.</span> <span id="s287">a group that's leaving Auschwitz, I want you to be the first one because you're not going to survive here long.</span> <span id="s288">In Auschwitz, it's...it's the worst...uh...uh... crematorium, the worst, so I'm going to put you on the worst...on the first.”</span> <span id="s289">Uh...We were in Auschwitz 3 months.</span> <span id="s290">After this...uh...they...they put together....uh...a transport, you know, and they took us to ...uh...to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s291">I don't know if you heard about it.</span> <span id="s292">Stuffhof.</span> <span id="s293">Yal.</span> <span id="s294">And when we got to Stuffhof, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s295">It was awful.</span> <span id="s296">It was...day by day, we wished, "Why are we...why are we not...you used to see a cat going behind the...the barbed wire you know.</span> <span id="s297">We used to thought, "God why didn't you made us a cat or a dog or a worm.</span> <span id="s298">Why couldn't I be a worm.</span> <span id="s299">Why do you have to be a human being?</span> <span id="s300">You used to...you put us to the, you know, threw us...threw the people to...uh...the barbed wires and...and they got electrocuted right there and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">And...and crawls...there was a man...man...uh...in a man's barracks and winter and it was cold.</span> <span id="s302">Naked, they made him run around in the snow up to here, naked, and beat him up and same thing they did to the woman.</span> <span id="s303">(Sigh) We were just there...uh...there for a long time and sitting by the barbed wires and every day, they...they came in and they just beat us up, beat us up.</span> <span id="s304">They were...they brought the food, you know, that little no-good food.</span> <span id="s305">Uh...When you stand in the line with that plate to get some food...uh...you...you look ...uh...uh...don't look straight or you look afraid or you think is no good or this, and you just got beaten up.</span> <span id="s306">You just got beaten up or they took you...took you out from the camp and took you to the gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">It's...just like that was nothing...mean anything.</span> <span id="s308">So we was sitting there and by the sand on the...on the outside and praying and crying and screaming, "God, help us.</span> <span id="s309">God, help us.</span> <span id="s310">Let us die, you know, without...” So all of a sudden, after the...quite a few months, I don't know exactly much...uh...how long we were there...uh...they came and...uh...they told us they're taking so many woman now to...to work, you know, to...uh...landscaping work.</span> <span id="s311">So when we heard that everybody who want...who we knew that going to work is gonna live, survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">And every...every day, you stayed in the camp.</span> <span id="s313">You have no chance.</span> <span id="s314">You didn't have a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s315">So you should see what's...what's going on.</span> <span id="s316">Everybody was jumping through the...through the windows and through the doors to be the first to register to go to work, you know.</span> <span id="s317">People killed each other.</span> <span id="s318">People, like I say, your life wasn't...didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s319">Everybody wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s320">And...uh...it just...everybody on his own.</span> <span id="s321">So they took us...uh...they took us away to landscaping and we were, you know, ...uh...digging out potatoes and according 6 weeks.</span> <span id="s322">It took us 6 weeks.</span> <span id="s323">Uh...It wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s324">Wasn't so bad so at 6 weeks after we finished the landscaping, they took out a thousand woman... thousand woman, they took us there.</span> <span id="s325">They took us...they brought us back to ...to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s326">They brought us back to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s327">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s328">Was...uh...uh...going around also typhus, you know, and sickness and...uh...more and more people got...uh...if it came such a death that came that nobody had a chance.</span> <span id="s329">And we were just waiting for our death, you know, any minute.</span> <span id="s330">One night...uh...one night, you know, there was a girl in our barrack and top...I was always on the lowest.</span> <span id="s331">All the way on the top of the bed...bed, there was a girl and she must have had epilepsy, you know, and...uh...middle of the night she got probably a seizure.</span> <span id="s332">That's what we come to and she...uh...threw herself down to the floor and it got such a panic inside that they thought...and they came in to kill us.</span> <span id="s333">It screaming the dark.</span> <span id="s334">It was yelling and screaming and then...uh...the Gestapo came in and put on the lights and...uh...start shooting on everybody.</span> <span id="s335">And he made us, you know, hundred times, made us jump, punish us.</span> <span id="s336">Say one...one for all and all for one, you know.</span> <span id="s337">They made us...uh... jump out the window, jump in the window, jump out the window, jump in the window.</span> <span id="s338">Uh...I said to my mother, I said...uh..."I can't go on like this.”</span> <span id="s339">Says, "I am going to kill myself.</span> <span id="s340">I'm going to do it.</span> <span id="s341">Touch the wires and I'm gonna kill myself because I can't go on, can't take it.”</span> <span id="s342">And my mother said to me, she said...uh..."Let's wait.”</span> <span id="s343">You see, she believed...she believed that...that we're gonna be saved.</span> <span id="s344">She believed we gonna survive.</span> <span id="s345">She believed we're gonna survive.</span> <span id="s346">(Sigh) So...uh...it was the most horrible night you ever can imagine in your life.</span> <span id="s347">Then...uh...the next day I tried to kill myself.</span> <span id="s348">I went to the wires, you know, next to the wires close by and this...uh.</span> <span id="s349">.</span> <span id="s350">Gestapo, this SS came and saw me and grabbed me and...uh...gave me...uh...25, you know, over mine...uh... I had to lay down in a chair and he gave me 25 with that rubber thing.</span> <span id="s351">(crying) The worst thing you can imagine in your life.</span> <span id="s352">(crying) My mother tried to...uh...help me so they did the same thing to her.</span> <span id="s353">That was even worse.</span> <span id="s354">(crying) So...uh...then 2 days later...I don't know how I survived, but I survived.</span> <span id="s355">A terrible beating!</span> <span id="s356">It was awful.</span> <span id="s357">I couldn't move, you know.</span> <span id="s358">I couldn't, but you try to because otherwise you...they put you in the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s359">You didn't have a chance, you know, so you try to survive...to feel, you know, strong and be that you are able to...to move and able to work if you wanted to live.</span> <span id="s360">So your...your...uh...power, you know, to survive.</span> <span id="s361">My mother for me and me for my mother.</span> <span id="s362">You know what I mean.</span> <span id="s363">So anyway...uh...2 days later, we heard that they're taking out 12...they're going to select 12 strong girls to.</span> <span id="s364">.</span> <span id="s365">uh...the strongest one....uh...to work, you know, make those...uh...dig those graves where the soldiers hide.</span> <span id="s366">How you call?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Trenches.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Trenches where the soldiers.</span> <span id="s369">They're gonna select thousand woman and take them to...to that work, do those trenches.</span> <span id="s370">So don't ask.</span> <span id="s371">Everybody wanted to go to work.</span> <span id="s372">Nobody wanted to stay behind.</span> <span id="s373">And everybody was again running and pushing and was going on so when the...when they stayed in the line, they select you, they put you in a bath.</span> <span id="s374">They give you a bath and...and...uh...put you man's clothes, pants, heavy because it was wintertime.</span> <span id="s375">Heavy clothes on and belt.</span> <span id="s376">You stayed in the line.</span> <span id="s377">My mother and I, we were holding hands and we tried to...see you have to register your number, everything.</span> <span id="s378">And...uh...we begged those girls in front to let us through because my mother we should be together.</span> <span id="s379">We registered.</span> <span id="s380">We told them the number.</span> <span id="s381">We told them the name, but somehow and we went in.</span> <span id="s382">No...uh...we told them everything, but when we came...this was just for registration, you know, from...one Gestapo registered you.</span> <span id="s383">The next one looked you over.</span> <span id="s384">So they don't like us.</span> <span id="s385">They took us away.</span> <span id="s386">But three blocks, they took us away, you know, close to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s387">So my mother said, "We have nothing to lose," she says.</span> <span id="s388">"We're going to die anyway.</span> <span id="s389">Let's run away back to the...to the line.”</span> <span id="s390">"Okay.”</span> <span id="s391">We run away back to the line and we asked those...they should let us through.</span> <span id="s392">Please let us through.</span> <span id="s393">We cried and let us through.</span> <span id="s394">We should run into the...to the barrack so there everything was changed so they might not recognize us...uh...anymore so we'd be able to go work.</span> <span id="s395">And we ran into the barrack and...uh...we put us...they dressed us like men, you know, and when we came out from the barrack, guess what?</span> <span id="s396">Those woman, there was...she was a Gestapo woman, she recognized us, and she told...uh...the...the Gestapo, she said, "Here.</span> <span id="s397">These are the ," and took on the side.</span> <span id="s398">He says...and he starts you know beating me up and my mother and why and we start begging him and pleading with him and he said, "No, you go on...you go on to be ashes soon.”</span> <span id="s399">And...uh...my mother, she begged him.</span> <span id="s400">She fell on her knees and she said, "Please, I am strong and my daughter.</span> <span id="s401">We want to go to work.”</span> <span id="s402">And she...she...uh...fall on her knees and grabbed the Gestapo with...with her feet and...uh...you know, like stopping him and (crying) and begged him to let us through.</span> <span id="s403">We.</span> <span id="s404">.</span> <span id="s405">we...he should see that we tried to go to work, that you know, and so he gave my mother a..</span> <span id="s406">.</span> <span id="s407">you know, with his boots...uh...and grabbed us and slapped us and then...I don't know, like God must have changed his mind, you know.</span> <span id="s408">I tell you it's (crying)...he stopped in his to wanta see if we...if we had did something wrong.</span> <span id="s409">If they registered.</span> <span id="s410">We were lucky.</span> <span id="s411">We registered.</span> <span id="s412">So he let us through.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Went to work.</span> <span id="s414">It was...uh...took us on a train.</span> <span id="s415">It was...uh...I don't know.</span> <span id="s416">I was no where.</span> <span id="s417">Was

id="s425">We would drown in the snow.</span> <span id="s426">We were there and at night, you know, we were cold.</span> <span id="s427">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s428">We used to...uh...anyway, they used to...during the daytime, you know, they brought some... uh...food in those big, big cans like you used to carry milk and they used to bring some water, food, you know, some soup or things.</span> <span id="s429">Every time the...uh...whoever they asked to go and put the cans back on that wagon they let...let you lick it out because you were so hungry.</span> <span id="s430">So we had one Gestapo....what I mean...he was the biggest murderer and he had one arm, you know.</span> <span id="s431">He...he carried with him a stick.</span> <span id="s432">It was this big, and he was a murderer.</span> <span id="s433">He was horror.</span> <span id="s434">He beat.</span> <span id="s435">He hit.</span> <span id="s436">So...uh.</span> <span id="s437">.</span> <span id="s438">one

Europe.</span> <span id="s459">Potatoes, all kind of vegetables, you know, keep them for the...for the year.</span> <span id="s460">So that one...one girl...I don't know how she did.</span> <span

id="s505">(Crying) The experiments I was there.</span> <span id="s506">I was unconscious, my mother says, for a long, you know.</span> <span id="s507">And...uh...after I..</span> <span id="s508">.</span> <span id="s509">uh...I came to, my mother made sure that, you know, I'm...I'm gonna be all right.</span> <span id="s510">A mother.</span> <span id="s511">So...uh...they start evacuating that camp too.</span> <span id="s512">I guess, you know, the Russians...uh...came closer by and they start taking us in different camps, you know, different camps.</span> <span id="s513">So we used to, you know...uh...evacuate.</span> <span id="s514">At night, walking the streets and not sleep, and it was cold and we were hungry.</span> <span id="s515">And the sight, you know, of the...on the things...the dead people, so many deaths.</span> <span id="s516">You would not believe it.</span> <span id="s517">Uh...we...we were so hungry.</span> <span id="s518">We used to see garbage you know, garbage, and there was cans that the soldiers throw away.</span> <span id="s519">They were rusted from sardines or tuna fish, you know, any kind of cans, and we used to kill each other over a can.</span> <span id="s520">Who's gonna lick...lick, get...grab it first, and...and lick it out.</span> <span id="s521">Uh...It was...we ate whatever garbage we could find on the streets.</span> <span id="s522">Potato peels or any garbage.</span> <span id="s523">Any garbage!</span> <span id="s524">We...we were terrible starving.</span> <span id="s525">We were hungry.</span> <span id="s526">We were tired, and people just died like flies.</span> <span id="s527">Couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s528">So we were walking and walking and days and nights and walking and walking and at night, you know...uh...we stopped.</span> <span id="s529">The Nazi's stopped and we went in somewhere...who knows...and they...they just, you know, all of the people lay on the...you know, on the ground there and we pulled ourselves together, you know, like this, and we was like this, you know, one on top of the other warming up and we tried to sleep a little bit til they came out and took us further.</span> <span id="s530">And that's how it went.</span> <span id="s531">For two weeks, we went like this.</span> <span id="s532">Finally...uh...we found a barn on the...in of the woods, you know a barn.</span> <span id="s533">(Sigh) They took us in there, 5000...5000 women, put us in that barn which there was no room, but that's like herring, you know.</span> <span

<span id="s537">So that way, they...they sit you down, that's the way you...uh...were thrown together.</span> <span id="s538">Your legs under you, you know, attached.</span> <span id="s539">You couldn't straighten out.</span> <span id="s540">Put us in there, and the Gestapos were around us, the barn there and...uh...once every other day, they used to bring something you know, for...like not live or not to die, you know, every other day.</span> <span id="s541">We were there about 7 months or 8 months, we were there...that barn, and it was terrible.</span> <span id="s542">It was awful.</span> <span id="s543">It was worst.</span> <span id="s544">People died and the lice...you had so much lice.</span> <span id="s545">And my mother...my mother from laying, you know, around there (crying), she...she just gotten eaten up by the bugs you know.</span> <span id="s546">It was nothing til the bones left and her...uh...(crying) mind was left.</span> <span id="s547">Everything else was eaten up, chew up.</span> <span id="s548">She was nothing but, you see, on the...on the television...sometimes they show you those skeleton, those heads, the bones.</span> <span id="s549">(Crying) She was laying.</span> <span id="s550">The mind was clear all the time that she was sick.</span> <span id="s551">I was...I had typhus.</span> <span id="s552">People died.</span> <span id="s553">People died like...like nothing, like...there was nothing left practically to the end there.</span> <span id="s554">It was so bad that...uh...like I say, the lice ate you up alive.</span> <span id="s555">Even...and there was nothing wrong with you, you had nice in your mouth and...and everywhere and they...they practically carried you from one place to the next.</span> <span id="s556">That's how bad...(Crying) We were there (crying) as I say approximately, you know...exact the dates I..</span> <span id="s557">.</span> <span id="s558">I don't remember, but we were there a long time and...uh...by the end, my mother...I was...I..</span> <span id="s559">.</span> <span id="s560">I could...I was okay the last minute.</span> <span id="s561">I used to go out and bring her some snow, you know, and rub my mother on the lips and help...help her, but (sigh) (crying) she...she was so strong til the last minute (Crying) til she got eaten up by those...skeleton.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">No food.</span> <span id="s563">No nothing.</span> <span id="s564">Then...uh...to the end, we got free there.</span> <span id="s565">I mean...uh...the Russian came, you see.</span> <span id="s566">We got free by the Russian, which we didn't know.</span> <span id="s567">It was maybe 50 girls...50 people who survived there to the end.</span> <span id="s568">Uh...We didn't know we were free, you know.</span> <span id="s569">Nobody knew nothing.</span> <span id="s570">Everybody who was alive laid there like a..</span> <span id="s571">.</span> <span id="s572">uh...like just like before.</span> <span id="s573">Laid and wait to die.</span> <span id="s574">The thing should go out.</span> <span id="s575">(Crying) (Sigh) See the Russian when they freed us, if they would've come in and take everybody out, you know, like a child.</span> <span id="s576">If they would've come and take my mother out, she would have survived.</span> <span id="s577">They never came in...inside the barn.</span> <span id="s578">Who was able to go out were...ran out and they put in...and who wasn't able to go out stayed there.</span> <span id="s579">So...uh.</span> <span id="s580">.</span> <span id="s581">we left behind.</span> <span id="s582">We were about 10 girls left behind.</span> <span id="s583">And...uh...I remember I..</span> <span id="s584">.</span> <span id="s585">I had such a high fever...uh...and...uh.</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">you know, and I was screaming to my mom, "Mom, help me.</span> <span id="s588">The lice are eating me up alive.”</span> <span id="s589">I was, you know, all of a sudden you wind up one and somewhere in nowhere.</span> <span id="s590">You were crawling, you know, and I was crying to my mother to help me, help me.</span> <span id="s591">Help me because the lice are eating me up and the lice are taking me away.</span> <span id="s592">Then...uh...uh...about 3 days later...uh...a girl came back like I don't know what

<span id="s724">The only thing came is...is to commit suicide after that.</span> <span id="s725">You had not...nobody to take care of you.</span> <span id="s726">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s727">It was just as bad after you survived because what...what should...how should you survive?</span> <span id="s728">How...how should you live?</span> <span id="s729">You had nobody to take care of you.</span> <span id="s730">You needed parents.</span> <span id="s731">You needed to live.</span> <span id="s732">You needed food, you know.</span> <span id="s733">It was very bad so whoever

and food and clothes on your back and food.</span> <span id="s736">It was...it was terrible.</span> <span id="s737">Lot of the girls killed themselves.</span> <span id="s738">They...they couldn't...they couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s739">They couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s740">They had nobody to take care of them.</span> <span id="s741">It was just as terrible as...as...as before.</span> <span id="s742">If, you see, if...if right away, you know, if you would have had somebody come along and say, "Look, we gonna take care of you.</span> <span id="s743">You gonna have...make sure you have a home, you have a bed to sleep in...” But young girls, if they survived and they had nobody to take care, it was... I married my husband and after...after 3 days we knew each other.</span> <span id="s744">We never knew each other.</span> <span id="s745">I wanted to bring you the...the marriage certificate.</span> <span id="s746">Even had a real marriage certificate, you know.</span> <span id="s747">(Sigh) So...uh...we got married there in the camps and then...uh...I have to tell you this.</span> <span id="s748">Uh...My husband, you know, when he was in the labor camp, he met this girl...Jewish girl, and...uh...he promised her if he's gonna survive and she survives, he's gonna look her up and they're gonna get married.</span> <span id="s749">So after...uh...after he got...he got freed, he came home.</span> <span id="s750">He went over Germany to find her.</span> <span id="s751">He went everywhere in Germany, every he knew there is camps for the Jews to find her and he couldn't find her, so we got married.</span> <span id="s752">And the night...the next morning after we got married, her sister knocked on the door and she came to tell him that her sister is alive, you know.</span> <span id="s753">So I told...uh...he said, "When he gets married, it's for keeps.”</span> <span id="s754">So we got married.</span> <span id="s755">After a year...uh...I became pregnant and my son was born there.</span> <span id="s756">It was...was very bad...uh...you know.</span> <span id="s757">I was very...uh...undeveloped, you know, un...uh...I wasn't ready to have a baby.</span> <span id="s758">You think kids today have 12 years old children, but I wasn't developed yet.</span> <span id="s759">I was young and became pregnant and had very bad, you know, there in the camps.</span> <span id="s760">It was...was no doctors.</span> <span id="s761">Was a midwife, and I was 48 hours in labor there, screaming, screaming and screaming and nobody...nobody heard me screaming.</span> <span id="s762">Finally, you know, they came and they cut me up, and when they cut me...uh...they must have cut me with a rusted instrument.</span> <span id="s763">So after my son was born I got infection between my legs.</span> <span id="s764">I almost died.</span> <span id="s765">I got such...I

some...uh...some kind of special medication, penicillin.</span> <span id="s770">I don't not knew exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s771">Finally, you know, with all kind of compressings...uh...after mine son was born, he was about 6,7 weeks old...uh...I..</span> <span id="s772">.</span> <span id="s773">when I gave birth to him, my breast did develop.</span> <span id="s774">I also tore everything in my body, was torn.</span> <span id="s775">I bleed a lot.</span> <span id="s776">I was very sick so...uh...my husband took me to a doctor, another doctor, and he

id="s777">And...uh...that's...I went to Munich.</span> <span id="s778">He told me... made arrangements in Munich and I left my baby, you know, with somebody...uh.</span> <span id="s779">.</span> <span id="s780">German nurse, and I..</span> <span id="s781">.</span> <span id="s782">I was 3 months there in a hospital in Munich, you know.</span> <span id="s783">After that, I came back.</span> <span id="s784">We were there about a year and...and my son was 9 months old, not a year, but 9 months old, and we start talking about going, you know.</span> <span id="s785">One was going to America.</span> <span id="s786">A lot of people were going to Israel and Israel was already a country, so I said to my husband, "We're not going to America.</span> <span id="s787">We're going to Israel.</span> <span id="s788">We're going to our own land where we gonna be safe.”</span> <span id="s789">So that time, you know...uh...they took woman and children by airplane to...to Israel, and so they put me on the plane with my son.</span> <span id="s790">He was 9 months old.</span> <span id="s791">(Sigh) We almost died.</span> <span id="s792">The...the plane was on fire, you know.</span> <span id="s793">(Sigh) We...we landed somewhere on an island and we stayed there for...for 48 hours til they brought another plane.</span> <span id="s794">Was a miracle we survived.</span> <span id="s795">And I'm still here.</span> <span id="s796">We arrived to Israel and my husband's supposed to come, you know, soon after me, but he came by...by...by boat.</span> <span id="s797">I arrived to Israel.</span> <span id="s798">They put us in a tent there you know, me and my baby.</span> <span id="s799">What shall I tell you?</span> <span id="s800">My friend...concentration camp, I

<span id="s803">A humanbeing didn't mean...they brought so many people...a humanbeing didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s804">Kids die from the...some kind of sickness was going around.</span> <span id="s805">Children died so much over there.</span> <span id="s806">I was in this tent with another family, with my baby.</span> <span id="s807">Uh...Also my throat start bothering me, you know.</span> <span id="s808">So bothered me one day.</span> <span id="s809">The next day my throat gets worse.</span> <span id="s810">My throat was.</span> <span id="s811">So there was a doctor there, doctor.</span> <span id="s812">I went over there.</span> <span id="s813">I said, "Look, my throat is bad and swollen.</span> <span id="s814">My throat is bad and so he looked and he said, "Oh, it's nothing.”</span> <span id="s815">He gives me a bunch of pills like this in your hands and he said, "Swallow those down and go home," and I went back to my child and it get worst.</span> <span id="s816">I'm sick.</span> <span id="s817">I developed terrible high temperature and I can't swallow at all.</span> <span id="s818">I couldn't wait til the next morning.</span> <span id="s819">That family took my baby...and took me to...right away, went the minute he opened, you know.</span> <span id="s820">I couldn't talk anymore.</span> <span id="s821">So doctor looked and he said, "Oh, she needs a hospital right away.”</span> <span id="s822">I had diphtheria.</span> <span id="s823">You know diphtheria?</span> <span id="s824">So they took...and my baby because he was with me the whole time because he probably is very catchy and so instead take him somewhere they put a crib...it was a tent and I was there and he start with me on penicillin and you know, every 4 hours and...and my baby was next to me in crib.</span> <span id="s825">Poor thing!</span> <span id="s826">So I was there...I don't know, til made me well.</span> <span id="s827">My husband didn't get out then until 3 months later.</span> <span id="s828">I went from place to place like another gypsy.</span> <span id="s829">I didn't know what's...what's happened to my husband.</span> <span id="s830">I don't know what happened to anybody.</span> <span id="s831">There's...was a..</span> <span id="s832">.</span> <span id="s833">like crazy.</span> <span id="s834">Just...that's all you have to do is commit suicide...jump yourself in the ocean.</span> <span id="s835">That's it.</span> <span id="s836">Finally, after 3 months we found each other.</span> <span id="s837">He didn't know where I was.</span> <span id="s838">I didn't know where he was, you know.</span> <span id="s839">He went...in Israel, there...looking from Netanya to Hadera to Haifa, everywhere to small places where the tents you know.</span> <span id="s840">They...nobody could tell him where I am, if I live maybe.</span> <span id="s841">He heard that the plane was on fire, that I'm dead.</span> <span id="s842">After 3 or 4 months, we finally found each other.</span> <span id="s843">Uh...So then, you know, we were there about 8 months.</span> <span id="s844">They said they're gonna give you, put on a farm, give you a cow and a horse, make...you know.</span> <span id="s845">So they took me and my husband and the child one of those places where the Arabs used to live, in those...uh...uh... houses from...made from...uh...mud, you know.</span> <span id="s846">The Arabs there...used to be the Arabs occupied.</span> <span id="s847">Then after Israel was taken, this was near , small town.</span> <span id="s848">We went down there and I tell you, there food...food...if you like the on it.</span> <span id="s849">There was not a little milk for your child.</span> <span id="s850">There is nothing.</span> <span id="s851">For Passover, they give you one can of beans for the child, for my husband and me, for the child.</span> <span id="s852">That place they gave me...that place there (sigh) I don't know how to describe it to you.</span> <span id="s853">I tell you you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s854">There was no electricity.</span> <span id="s855">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s856">You couldn't see a human being if...if you wanted...if you...I don't know what.</span> <span id="s857">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s858">It was awful.</span> <span id="s859">If I tell you it was awful, when my husband got a job and...and...near Tele Aviv, you know.</span> <span id="s860">He got a job.</span> <span id="s861">Somebody made that he...he worked in those ovens where they burned iron, you know.</span> <span id="s862">He got a job there.</span> <span id="s863">He used to come home only...uh...the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s864">He stayed there.</span> <span id="s865">I don't know how he sleeped, how he lived, but that's it.</span> <span id="s866">Every Friday afternoon, he came home and Sunday early morning, he left.</span> <span id="s867">If I saw him coming home, there was...you couldn't see a decent...you couldn't see....I was with my child in that house.</span> <span id="s868">The Arabs could come in thousand times to kill you and you don't know...you never knew if I'm alive or I'm dead.</span> <span id="s869">And that's what they did.</span> <span id="s870">They killed every day.</span> <span id="s871">The Arabs came in and they killed.</span> <span id="s872">If the Arabs didn't kill you, the snakes bite you and killed you.</span> <span id="s873">So I just...I said to my husband...one time he came on Friday...he was so exhausted that he went to sleep and he didn't woke til Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s874">But...uh...one time he came home and I said, "That's it.”</span> <span id="s875">I said, "I can't take this anymore.</span> <span id="s876">I cannot take...I have a child.</span> <span id="s877">I'm scared.</span> <span id="s878">I'm scared to death.</span> <span id="s879">We have to do something.</span> <span id="s880">We have to...I get a job in town.</span> <span id="s881">We have to...I can't take this anymore.</span> <span id="s882">I can't.”</span> <span id="s883">So he went down there in that town and talked to this guy and he said to give him a job as a watchman, over night watchman.</span> <span id="s884">I said, "Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Fine.</span> <span id="s886">As long as you're home every day.</span> <span id="s887">I'm scared.</span> <span id="s888">I'm here by myself with a child and you couldn't see a neighbor.</span> <span id="s889">You couldn't see a humanbeing.</span> <span id="s890">You couldn't see nothing.</span> <span id="s891">You could not...it's worse than...than...than I don't know what.</span> <span id="s892">So...uh...he got a job.</span> <span id="s893">Thursday night, he went out on a horse, you know, in the...in the woods, you know.</span> <span id="s894">Watched the Arabs come in.</span> <span id="s895">Okay, he went out to work.</span> <span id="s896">He came back in the morning and I..</span> <span id="s897">and he was very upset.</span> <span id="s898">I mean scared to death.</span> <span id="s899">Poor thing!</span> <span id="s900">He was not himself.</span> <span id="s901">I saw him.</span> <span id="s902">He was not...he was so scared that you could not believe it.</span> <span id="s903">It hurt me to see him like that so I said, "Friday night, you supposed to go again.”</span> <span id="s904">I said, "Look.</span> <span id="s905">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s906">I'm not going to let you do

Friday night, somebody else went and the Arabs came in.</span> <span id="s911">They killed everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">They killed five families, children, everybody who was the

to bring children.”</span> <span id="s944">But it happened, you know.</span> <span id="s945">I had...there was no birth controls.</span> <span id="s946">I didn't know what...I had...and 1951, my daughter was born.</span> <span id="s947">But you love...love them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Desperate.</span> <span id="s949">They're my life.</span> <span id="s950">Without them,

id="s964">I already had my share as a young child.</span> <span id="s965">How many can you real survive...how many can you take?</span> <span id="s966">(Crying) So I said to my husband, I said, "Look.</span> <span id="s967">I didn't wanta go to America, but for my children, to make my life better, I'm taking...we have to...we have to leave.</span> <span id="s968">We have to do something

<span id="s991">My daughter was born in Israel.</span> <span id="s992">They wouldn't let her out.</span> <span id="s993">So I said to him, "I'm going with my son.</span> <span id="s994">You stay here
