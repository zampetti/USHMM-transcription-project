Menke.</span> <span id="s4">I was born in Hamburg, Germany, in the year 1927, February 23rd.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: Why don’t we start off by you telling me a little bit about your childhood and your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I had a father whose age was at that time 55 and my mother at that time was 46 and I had a sister at the age of 17.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: You had one sister?</span> <span id="s8">And that was the only sibling?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s10">We lived in a very nice neighborhood in Hamburg, Germany, and we had to leave that neighborhood and apartment we lived in because Jews were no longer allowed in that part of town.</span> <span id="s11">It was too good for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: What time frame are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: That was, I would say, in about, ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: ’38?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Up until that time, I know this is going to be hard to try to remember, especially because you were that young, but do you remember any of the time, around the time that Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s18">Of course, I was born in ’27 but I vividly remember say around ’35 and that’s when the Jews were starting to suffer.</span> <span id="s19">And it was maybe around ’38 when the Jews, like I said, were resettled in another part of town and we were not allowed to shop in regular stores.</span> <span id="s20">It was stores assigned especially to Jews with the merchandise was higher.</span> <span id="s21">We were also ________ benches which said “no Jews allowed”.</span> <span id="s22">You couldn’t go to a movie.</span> <span id="s23">And there were severe restrictions.</span> <span id="s24">I’m sure you recall Crystal Night, I don’t think we have to get into that.</span> <span id="s25">I’m sure you know that.</span> <span id="s26">When the German official was killed in France and that was supposed to be a punishment to punish the Jews for that and that’s how Crystal Night originated and at that time my father was taken to a concentration camp near Berlin for six weeks.</span> <span id="s27">They came to the house to arrest my father and he was at the place of business and ordered my mother not to contact him and they went and arrested him.</span> <span id="s28">And he came back after six weeks a broken man.</span> <span id="s29">He was hardly recognizable.</span> <span id="s30">And at that time the Nazis had taken over all German owned businesses and they were government run, so my father’s business, he had a small factory producing rubber and signs, etc. and that business was taken over by the government and his bank account was taken and we were only allowed to draw a small amount of our own money at the time and my father was forced to work as a laborer packing shoes in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Do you remember when you were a small child, about this time, was there a lot of anti-Semitic overtones, by the children, especially?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, the anti-Semitism, it was a lot worse in smaller towns first.</span> <span id="s33">Small villages, as a matter of fact, it was so bad that the people who lived in smaller towns went to the bigger cities because there was less anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s34">Now, the German Jew, if you want to use the term integrated, he was not like the Polish Jew who was discriminated by the Poles many, many years before the German Jew was.</span> <span id="s35">And so, the German Jew was a proud German.</span> <span id="s36">Like my father fought for Germany in 1914-18 and was discharged a proud German soldier defending his country.</span> <span id="s37">And the German Jews were dumb enough to believe that what’s happened to the Polish Jews, because the Polish Jews suffered sooner than the German Jews.</span> <span id="s38">“Oh, this will never happen to us.</span> <span id="s39">We are German, first before we are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s40">But I recall being taken out of the school, I was enrolled in a German high school called “Talmud Torah” which is still standing today.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: That was a public high school or a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Jewish school.</span> <span id="s43">And they also had a girl’s school where my sister went.</span> <span id="s44">It was a highlik a real fine school and we were well educated.</span> <span id="s45">Of course that was too good for the Jews again and the building was taken over by the Germans and we were all forced into a small school with the girls.</span> <span id="s46">Of course, there was a lot of immigration at that time and my mother saw the handwriting on the wall and wanted to get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s47">But I recall saying to my father, “ you don’t have a trade, it would be difficult to start over again’ so they procrastinated until it was too late.</span> <span id="s48">We did try to leave Germany in the late ‘30’s but it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: You said something earlier about being moved within Hamburg.</span> <span id="s50">Was that a ghetto set up in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s52">It was a neighborhood where more Jewish people lived already.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Before the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s55">The neighborhood I lived in was on the other side of the river which was a much nicer neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And they moved you into</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">And I was not welcome at the school either, any more, I was going to a public school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Do you remember when you moved, what kind of feelings you had at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Well, as a child, it didn’t bother us at all.</span> <span id="s61">But of course, it was a terrible thing for my parents to go through.</span> <span id="s62">As a matter of fact, we had a real nice home at that part of town and at first we all lived, the whole family, in a rented room, you know.</span> <span id="s63">It was a trauma, at that time already.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Let’s see, you talk a little bit about Kristallnacht, do you remember anything specific about that night that happened to you or your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, I know that all the Jewish businesses were totally destroyed including huge department stores like Hecht Company.</span> <span id="s66">Hashta is the name all over Germany today and they taken furs and threw them in the river and the people that owned automobiles were destroyed.</span> <span id="s67">The strange part is that my father’s business was not destroyed because people didn’t realize that my father was a Jew.</span> <span id="s68">So his business was not destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Is there any reason for that, that they might not think that he was a Jew or did they just not know, is that</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: They did not realize that he was a Jew and like I said earlier, the German Jew was first German.</span> <span id="s71">I want to tell you a little incident.</span> <span id="s72">There was a Nazi holiday and of course the Jews would not display their flag.</span> <span id="s73">My sister and I would make a flag out of a sheet and hang out which my parents naturally reeled back in again.</span> <span id="s74">Just to give you a sample like there was no difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Do you remember much about any friends in school that you had at that time in the neighborhood, especially from the children if there were any anti-Semitic</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, because they were agitated by their parents.</span> <span id="s77">We had to wear a Star of David with the name Jew written in and the letters were made in such a way that they looked like Hebrew, said German Jew, and it had to be worn on the outer clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: From what time was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: That started also in the late ‘30’s.</span> <span id="s80">I would say ’38 and the kids would throw stones, you know kids are cruel and not being allowed to go many places, was a hardship on the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Do you remember what life was like, we’re not talking about a ghetto here but the neighborhood you moved to, was it guarded by the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Was it free going back and forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes it was.</span> <span id="s85">And even at that time there were plenty Germans who were not Nazis but they were scared not to be Nazis.</span> <span id="s86">I remember as a little boy I worked in a little store they were selling health food and I took the deliveries for him.</span> <span id="s87">Beautiful people.</span> <span id="s88">But I also remember taking the packages to the post office, other kids would tear the labels off, you know, being Jewish, and causing problems and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: How did you work at this store?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: It was a little part-time job.</span> <span id="s91">After school I worked there.</span> <span id="s92">There were Germans that my family knew who befriended us who were strictly against the system.</span> <span id="s93">I’ll tell you how bad it was.</span> <span id="s94">One child remarked in school he overheard his parents the night before saying that some law that Hitler made was ridiculous or, I can’t get the detail; anyway this man, this Christian man, gentile man, was arrested by the German Gestapo and eight weeks later his wife received an urn of ashes, they killed him.</span> <span id="s95">So the kids were scared of their parents.</span> <span id="s96">You were not allowed to listen to foreign broadcasts, like England and America were separate, so neighbors would turn other neighbors in that they were listening to foreign broadcasts and they were severely punished.</span> <span id="s97">You inquired of what type of neighborhood it was.</span> <span id="s98">Well, it was not a bad neighborhood.</span> <span id="s99">The living quarters were difficult to find and we didn’t live as nice as we did before.</span> <span id="s100">We didn’t starve.</span> <span id="s101">It was just a different type of living.</span> <span id="s102">We were under pressure all the time like we were an enemy of your own country.</span> <span id="s103">And like I said earlier, a lot of people started to deport, they had enough sense to get out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did a lot of people, were they able to get out?</span> <span id="s105">Was it more restricted as time went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Well, there was a point where Hitler wanted the people to get out.</span> <span id="s107">Of course, they had to have visas in order to come to this country.</span> <span id="s108">They had to be sponsored.</span> <span id="s109">So that sometimes created a problem.</span> <span id="s110">You had to have someone.</span> <span id="s111">They also had Jewish organizations, I think it was HIAS and others that assisted Jews from leaving.</span> <span id="s112">And then of course, you had to have a certain amount of money to leave and since my own bank account, my father’s bank account was taken over, at that time, it was almost impossible to leave so when we wanted to leave in the late ‘’30’s, we couldn’t leave anymore.</span> <span id="s113">My father wanted to go to Australia, that’s what he hoped to do but it didn’t work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: You talked about freezing your bank accounts.</span> <span id="s115">Were you allowed an allowance, is that how it worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: To the best of my knowledge, he was allowed a certain amount.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: A certain amount a month or a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes, but it wasn’t enough so my father had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: You said before that there was no real hunger in this neighborhood that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s121">There was food and everything was available and there was food on the table.</span> <span id="s122">There was no real hardship like I said earlier, there was only certain stores where Jews could do their shopping.</span> <span id="s123">They were state operated.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: All the stores they could go to or were certain stores with certain hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Certain stores at certain hours.</span> <span id="s126">They were operated by the state.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Why don’t we move on here to your deportation?</span> <span id="s128">Tell me a little that.</span> <span id="s129">How it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: It happened you received a letter through the mail.</span> <span id="s131">As a matter of fact, the postman knew of these letters and he normally would ring the doorbell when he had mail for us.</span> <span id="s132">He didn’t do it this time because he was a decent guy.</span> <span id="s133">The contents of the letter would give us an order to vacate our apartment within so many hours and we were allowed so many pounds per person to take with us and then we were told in that same letter that we had to take our own key to our apartment to take to the local police station.</span> <span id="s134">I also want to add this that the gold and furs and other things, we had to turn in earlier already, anything of value.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: They seized your valuables.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: They seized.</span> <span id="s137">Of course, some people didn’t give it all up but there was a drive for that.</span> <span id="s138">So when we received our notice, we bought warm socks.</span> <span id="s139">I think we were allowed 100 pounds at first.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What did you bring, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: You know, a backpack.</span> <span id="s142">Sweaters, warm underwear, clothing, extra shoes.</span> <span id="s143">And we had to report to a Masonic temple.</span> <span id="s144">Now I might want to add that the Masonic temple was also against the law to exist and my father was a mason and he went to secret meetings even.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Freemason?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">And we went to this temple, which the inside was all marble and completely destroyed on the inside.</span> <span id="s148">And we laid on the floor for the night and the Germans ordered us any cash money we had to turn in, any rings and so on, they made a last little pitch to get the stuff off and that was the first time we were guarded.</span> <span id="s149">We were loaded on open trucks and taken to the railroad station and loaded into regular railroad cars, not cattle cars, railroad cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: They had seats and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: They had seats and everything in it.</span> <span id="s152">They were old cars, most had seats.</span> <span id="s153">Some had to lay on the floor.</span> <span id="s154">And we traveled I believe it was three days and three nights to Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Let me back track just a little bit.</span> <span id="s156">When the letter came, did they give you any indication as to where you might be going, what you might be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: I think we were told we were going to the east to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Now, I may have mentioned earlier that many transports that arrived in Minsk were killed right on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And that’s where you arrived, in Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yes, Minsk, it was White Russia, German occupational Russia.</span> <span id="s162">Most people don’t understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: What time frame, what are we talking about, what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And that’s when you were deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Okay, back to Minsk, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: In Minsk we were marched, it was very cold, we were marched into an area which was at one time a Russian school.</span> <span id="s169">Now we were a transport of a 1,000 people.</span> <span id="s170">That Russian school was at that time occupied by Russian Jews.</span> <span id="s171">And they had to vacate that building to put us into that building.</span> <span id="s172">It appeared that at one time it was a fairly modern school.</span> <span id="s173">It had running water.</span> <span id="s174">The faucets didn’t work, the toilets didn’t work but you could tell it was a regular high school like we almost have in this country.</span> <span id="s175">And we already saw a lot of dead people on the ground at this time, Russian Jews that were killed by the Germans that didn’t evacuate the building fast enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: They were in the building or around the grounds?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: They were in the building.</span> <span id="s178">It was part of a ghetto then.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And this was in the wintertime, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: It was in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s181">And we then gathered old mattresses and stuff and we stayed in that building and there was another building, other small out buildings and that’s where we stayed at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Did you go out and work from there, is that what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: The first couple of days I don’t think we did but then we were put to work.</span> <span id="s184">As a matter of fact, we had to build our own fences to go around there.</span></p></body></html>
