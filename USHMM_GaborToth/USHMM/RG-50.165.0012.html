21 people and 19 died.</span> <span id="s27">I had four brothers and one sister.</span> <span id="s28">I’m 77.</span> <span id="s29">I don’t think 1% is alive today.</span> <span id="s30">I was in Birkenau, Auschwitz, Dachau, Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s31">I was with my brother all of the time.</span> <span id="s32">It was very hard for us because we didn’t know German or Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: Did you think you were going to make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">LC: Who thought about making it?</span> <span id="s35">You lived day to day, like an animal.</span> <span id="s36">I was a barber in the camp, but I did other things too.</span> <span id="s37">My brother is a barber.</span> <span id="s38">I was a barber when I was born.</span> <span id="s39">The German-Jewish kapos were worse than the German kapos because they wanted to prove themselves to the Germans.</span> <span id="s40">They never acted like Jews but Hitler taught them they

gave us a room with a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s51">And every week they gave me a week’s pay and they used to buy us clothing and furniture.</span> <span id="s52">I said I’d like to work myself.</span> <span id="s53">They said, “Don’t worry, everything will be fine.”</span></p> <p><span id="s54">WH: Did you get together with the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">LC: Yes.</span> <span id="s56">Every Saturday we got together by the zoo in Franklin Park where the music was.</span> <span id="s57">We’d ask each other “What’s new?</span> <span id="s58">“You working?”</span> <span id="s59">“How come you’re not working?”</span> <span id="s60">And I got a job cutting hair.</span> <span id="s61">And I worked in one place for nine years.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WH: I see you

<p><span id="s65">WH: Why did you put that down?”</span></p> <p><span id="s66">LC: (Leon’s voice suddenly chokes and he hesitates) Why?</span> <span id="s67">That’s my son’s name.</span> <span id="s68">He was killed in Germany.</span> <span id="s69">That is why I don’t like to talk about it.</span> <span id="s70">You can’t live in the past.</span> <span id="s71">You have to live for the future.</span> <span id="s72">Of course I dreamt about it.</span> <span id="s73">Sometimes I wake up sweating, thinking the Germans are chasing us.</span> <span id="s74">But now I don’t dream about it so much anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">WH: Do you belong to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">LC: Yes and I go sometimes but not on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s77">On Saturdays I work.</span> <span id="s78">I always did.</span> <span id="s79">I often ask the rabbi why this had to happen.</span> <span id="s80">What did we do?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: Was there jealousy against the greener?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">RC: Yes.</span> <span id="s83">When we bought our house and moved in, our neighbor, I was friendly with her, called someone over and said: “I want you to meet the refugee.”</span> <span id="s84">I said “Liz, since when am I a refugee?</span> <span id="s85">I have a name.</span> <span id="s86">I own a house just like you do.</span> <span id="s87">And I’m working; I pay taxes just like you do.</span> <span id="s88">I’m an American.”</span> <span id="s89">And other Americans were jealous that we were here such a short time and already we owned a house.</span> <span id="s90">And I said to them: “I didn’t get the money for the house by sitting on my big you know what.</span> <span id="s91">I worked for it.</span> <span id="s92">We worked harder than you children did.</span> <span id="s93">That’s why you have an education.</span> <span id="s94">Because your parents worked hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: What do your kids do?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">RC: One used to be a schoolteacher.</span> <span id="s97">Now he’s in business.</span> <span id="s98">The other son is a dental technician.</span> <span id="s99">They’re both married.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: Did they marry Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">RC: Ah, whaddaya you talking about.</span> <span id="s102">Of course!</span></p> <p><span id="s103">WH:

happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">RC: No.</span> <span id="s114">There are too many Jewish composers, writers, and actors.</span> <span id="s115">The youth here is too strong.</span> <span id="s116">It could happen.</span> <span id="s117">You never know what will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">I remember when I came to work, when I told this woman who works with me I’m a Jew, she said: “Oh my God!</span> <span id="s119">You’re not a Jew.</span> <span id="s120">How can you be a Jew?”</span> <span id="s121">I said: “Listen, you don’t have to bother with me, if you don’t like it.</span> <span id="s122">Did I change from yesterday, when you knew I was Polish?</span> <span id="s123">If I was a Polish Catholic instead of a Polish Jew, would I look different to you?”</span> <span id="s124">“Oh,” she says.</span> <span id="s125">“Forget it, Renia, forget it.”</span> <span id="s126">I put everyone in their place.</span> <span id="s127">I’m a Jew, but I don’t take any crap from anybody.”</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WH: Do you think most survivors take that attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">RC: No, they wouldn’t take any crap.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">WH:

Browns.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">WH: What does it mean to you to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">LC: To have problems.</span> <span id="s135">Not too many people like the Jews for some reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">WH: Are you sorry you’re Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">LC: No, I’m not sorry.</span> <span id="s138">I paid deeply because I’m a Jew.</span> <span id="s139">I’m proud to be a Jew now.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">RC: How many Jews like the goyim?</span> <span id="s141">And the Protestants don’t like the Catholics.</span> <span id="s142">It’s in
