G.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">DATE: July -, 1990 INTERVIEWERS: E. Snyderman and M. Hirsch (Her husband, Boris, is also present, his comments are in parentheses.)</span> <span id="s12">I was born in Chernovtsy, Ukraine in 1954.</span> <span id="s13">I had a big family -- my grandmother, my mother and my father.</span> <span id="s14">I had one sister, Ella.</span> <span id="s15">She is older than I, and we all lived together in one apartment -- not too many, just five.</span> <span id="s16">We had three rooms.</span> <span id="s17">It was a big apartment, it was built by a Rumanian so the apartment was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">My mother was a mathematics teacher, she worked at school and my father, he worked in a business in the production of soda water.</span> <span id="s19">It was a shop.</span> <span id="s20">He was a supervisor, like a manager.</span> <span id="s21">We had a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s22">My childhood was Okay, I didn't feel there were any difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">I stayed mostly with my grandmother when my mother was at work.</span> <span id="s24">Just for two or three years before school, I had, it was like a babysitter, but she taught us how to read and a little bit of math and even German.</span> <span id="s25">When I was six, I could speak German but now I don't remember any words.</span> <span id="s26">It was like a small Kindergarten.</span> <span id="s27">We were three, sometimes four children, sometimes just two of them.</span> <span id="s28">It was private.</span> <span id="s29">It was not allowed by the law.</span> <span id="s30">She, the teacher, is in Israel now.</span> <span id="s31">She was a Jewish woman born in Chernovtsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">People who were born in Chernovtsy were well educated people because Chernovtsy was previously Austria-Hungary, and then it was Rumania before it was turned into the Soviet Union in 1940.</span> <span id="s33">All the people who were there then knew Rumanian, most of them knew Hungarian, and they knew German.</span> <span id="s34">She was a well educated woman who had studied in gymnasium, and was trained like a teacher of the Kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">My grandmother, Golda Stein, was illiterate.</span> <span id="s36">She was very smart, but she was not educated at all.</span> <span id="s37">My parents thought it would be better for me if I went for some hours, maybe four hours a day, to spend with other kids.</span> <span id="s38">It was impossible to get into a Kindergarten especially in Chernovtsy because it is a small city and that's why they decided to let me go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">My grandmother was a housewife.</span> <span id="s40">She was the youngest daughter of a big family of eight brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s41">She was the smartest woman because she was left alone at the age of thirty-five and she raised the children and she had a little business.</span> <span id="s42">When Chernovtsy was burnt down after World War II, she opened a small store and made money.</span> <span id="s43">She was born in 1905, so she was forty when the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">My grandfather died in the war.</span> <span id="s45">We don't know exactly how he died.</span> <span id="s46">We don't have the certificate about his death.</span> <span id="s47">He was lost.</span> <span id="s48">Nobody saw it.</span> <span id="s49">She was left without a pension.</span> <span id="s50">Thousands of people had the same experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">My grandmother opened a small grocery.</span> <span id="s52">They also had a small store in the village of ______________.</span> <span id="s53">During the time from 1925 to 1949 she was like a housewife.</span> <span id="s54">They opened a store and then closed it in 1925 because Stalin changed policies.</span> <span id="s55">Children could not study if their parents had a business.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">My husband's, and my, grandmothers were sisters.</span> <span id="s57">We are second cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Our grandmother spoke Yiddish to us.</span> <span id="s59">I know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s60">I can't speak it now because English interrupts it, but I understand every word.</span> <span id="s61">I cannot say that my grandmother was very religious but she knew all the traditions, all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s62">We knew Passover, we knew Purim, we knew Rosh Hashona.</span> <span id="s63">We had a home celebration when it was possible.</span> <span id="s64">It was very difficult, but we were able to get matzos for Passover.</span> <span id="s65">The matzos were made in a synagogue.</span> <span id="s66">(The Jewish people made a little company and made it underground and sold them to other Jewish people.)</span> <span id="s67">In Tashkent it was possible to buy matzos.</span> <span id="s68">(Different towns had different customs.)</span> <span id="s69">Our aunt from Tashkent sent matzos to Chernovtsy to her sister.</span> <span id="s70">(They sent matzo from Israel.)</span> <span id="s71">My father's cousin has lived in Israel for maybe forty years and sometimes he sent matzos to us.</span> <span id="s72">My mother and my sister all live in Israel now.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">I started to read when I was five.</span> <span id="s74">I went to school when I was six and a half.</span> <span id="s75">It is very interesting, Jewish children were a little bit ashamed that they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s76">Chernovtsy was a very Jewish city, and half of the kids in my grade were Jews.</span> <span id="s77">It was easier for me than for my husband.</span> <span id="s78">In Tashkent there weren't so many Jews.</span> <span id="s79">The level of anti-semitism in Chernovtsy and the Ukraine was much higher than it was in Tashkent.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Almost all my friends were Jewish.</span> <span id="s81">We had to keep all our traditions inside the family and could not bring them to school.</span> <span id="s82">Everybody knew that I was Jewish because of my name and especially my father's name, Shaya.</span> <span id="s83">It was not Russian.</span> <span id="s84">I often asked my parents, "Why did you call me Betya?"</span> <span id="s85">All my life I was not Betya but Beba and was used to this name because Betya was very Jewish and a strange name for Russian people and Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s86">When my sister was sixteen, she had to get a passport and my father wanted to change his name to Alexander because Alexander and Sasha are the same.</span> <span id="s87">But it was not possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">In Russia, everything that went on at home, I could not go out and tell people because nobody would understand you.</span> <span id="s89">My father was born in a different society, not a socialist society, and his mind was very non-socialist, more so than the mind of my mother; but when she got married, my mother got used to his direction of thinking and especially my grandmother could understand my father because she herself was like a small capitalist in this family.</span> <span id="s90">I could not tell that we lived good, that I had everything at home.</span> <span id="s91">All the thoughts of my father were to earn money for his family to live well but it was not allowed, it was against the law.</span> <span id="s92">Therefore we were raised as kids not to tell anybody what was going on at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">In Russia, Jewish people differed from people of other nationalities because, especially the Jewish man, knows that he has to get everything to bring home.</span> <span id="s94">The Russians and Ukrainians spent a lot of money for Vodka, and therefore nobody could understand what was going on in Jewish families.</span> <span id="s95">Sometimes they were in jail.....</span></p> <p><span id="s96">I could not tell anybody that my father bought a refrigerator when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s97">We could not get a television set before all other people bought them.</span> <span id="s98">I remember, it was in 1965.</span> <span id="s99">Even if we had money we would not spend it on such things because nobody should know that we could afford such things.</span> <span id="s100">From early childhood I knew that I could not tell anyone what was going on.</span> <span id="s101">It was the same for our kids too.</span> <span id="s102">If we had a little more money than other people had, we could not show this.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">I was not really aware of a political climate against Jews.</span> <span id="s104">Everything had calmed down because in 1961 my father's brother was arrested because he had some golden coins at home.</span> <span id="s105">I think that was the main reason he was arrested.</span> <span id="s106">I don't know the reason because I was a small child, but he had to stay in prison for seven years because he had the coins at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">(Many people were shot and arrested....) He was in the Ukraine, I think.</span> <span id="s108">I can't remember, I was a kid.</span> <span id="s109">I was six or seven years old.</span> <span id="s110">(He went to the Ukraine because my father paid money so that he wouldn't have to go to Siberia.)</span> <span id="s111">I was afraid, and for all my childhood I was afraid of the authorities and maybe it was because my grandmother told me, "Don't tell anybody about anything."</span> <span id="s112">We lived near a building, it was not a court, but in our town it was police headquarters, and when we passed this building, we went to the other side of the street, not to pass close to it.</span> <span id="s113">My grandmother was afraid and I was afraid all my life of this building.</span> <span id="s114">I had to pass it to go to school and I had to cross to the other side of the street because I was afraid of the authorities.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">We never wanted even our neighbors to come up to our apartment, or if anybody came, we didn't want them to go to the room to see that maybe we had more than they had.</span> <span id="s116">Khrushchev's policy was the same as Stalin's, "Tell about your neighbor, when he has that is more than the average people."</span> <span id="s117">( - and Andropov, he wanted the same policy, "You tell us about your neighbor.</span> <span id="s118">You tell us about your neighbor."</span> <span id="s119">On the street I drove my car and a man stopped me and checked me to find our what I'm doing!</span> <span id="s120">It was the same as thirty years ago with Stalin and Khrushchev.)</span> <span id="s121">I know that all the time my parents were afraid of everything because, as I told you, my father made a little more money than other people, and everything had to be hidden.</span> <span id="s122">I know that my mother had, maybe two rings with diamonds, from her grandmother, from the father's grandmother even, she never wore them and it is the story she brought it to me.</span> <span id="s123">She could not wear anything to show that she was richer than other people.</span> <span id="s124">Therefore, I can tell you that even though we didn't have any difficulties in life, I was raised to know what I can't have, what I can't say, and I can listen but not speak.</span> <span id="s125">(My family was the same way.</span> <span id="s126">We were poor.</span> <span id="s127">We lived openly but many of the families who lived a little better than the Russian neighbors would be called on by the police.)</span> <span id="s128">And people get jealous.</span> <span id="s129">When Khrushchev was dismissed and Brezhnev took his place I can't remember that anything changed in my family because my uncle was still in prison and everybody was afraid and nobody believed that it was something different because after Stalin it was Khrushchev, and about Stalin everybody knew (the children didn't know) but my parents knew that he killed a lot of people, and Khrushchev...</span></p> <p><span id="s130">(Khrushchev wanted to change Stalin's policies, but towards the end he was the same as Stalin.</span> <span id="s131">And about Jews?</span> <span id="s132">he continued Stalin's policies.</span> <span id="s133">Also, many Jews were released from prison after Stalin's death.</span> <span id="s134">Before Stalin's death, was the Doctor's Plot.</span> <span id="s135">My father told me that when he was in Siberia, that there was a special place for Jewish people and he was under home arrest because he was a Jewish military doctor.</span> <span id="s136">When he told me about it, I didn't believe it, because he talked about it only when he was going to Israel.</span> <span id="s137">This was in 1978, when he felt it was safe to speak of it in the Soviet.)</span> <span id="s138">After Khrushchev left, and Brezhnev came in, a lot changed, but my parents did not believe that it could be different.</span> <span id="s139">(She was only ten years old, she did not remember.)</span> <span id="s140">When my uncle came home from prison in 1968, he talked about it but I didn't hear anything about it.</span> <span id="s141">I know that he experienced a number of things.</span> <span id="s142">I was a kid, I was six when he left, but he came home an old man.</span> <span id="s143">He was two or three years older than my father.</span> <span id="s144">After some years at home he changed, and got better, but he was like a sick old man when he came home.</span> <span id="s145">He was able to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">(He sold seltzer water in a shop for the government like a service-man.</span> <span id="s147">He is still in Chernovtsy.</span> <span id="s148">He is going to Israel only now.</span> <span id="s149">He has a son in Israel.)</span> <span id="s150">I had almost no work to do around the house because of my grandmother and she didn't want anybody to interfere with her in the home.</span> <span id="s151">Just a little bit.</span> <span id="s152">I studied.</span> <span id="s153">I had some hobbies and one of these was English.</span> <span id="s154">I studied it as a child when I was seven or eight.</span> <span id="s155">I didn't want to study medicine.</span> <span id="s156">It was my friend's father's idea maybe.</span> <span id="s157">My sister already was at the medical institute at that time and I wanted to be a teacher of English.</span> <span id="s158">It was my hobby then.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">I then wanted to perhaps be a teacher of Chemistry because my mother was a teacher and all my life I thought that I would be a teacher too.</span> <span id="s160">It was not a big decision for me.</span> <span id="s161">I studied well at school and it was not a big difference for me where I went to study.</span> <span id="s162">I decided I would study medicine just before graduation from school.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">(They had a neighbor, and she was a gynecologist, and the neighbor was a very good friend.)</span> <span id="s164">She died in Israel.</span> <span id="s165">(She taught about being a doctor of gynecology.)</span> <span id="s166">She was a good friend of our family and maybe she is one of the reasons that I wanted to go to medical school.</span> <span id="s167">The second reason was that we just had two institutes in our city; there was a university and a medical institute and nothing more.</span> <span id="s168">My father didn't want me to go study any other place in the country, and that's why I went to the medical institute.</span> <span id="s169">I never thought that it was bad.</span> <span id="s170">I was seventeen when I went to the Medical Institute.</span> <span id="s171">I was there for six years.</span> <span id="s172">I started at Chernovtsy, and then I graduated in Tashkent.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">I met Boris when I was ten.</span> <span id="s174">(I met her when she was ten and I was seventeen.</span> <span id="s175">At ten years old I didn't decide about marriage, but when she was sixteen I decided that I would wait for her and we were married when she was nineteen.)</span> <span id="s176">His father is my mother's cousin.</span> <span id="s177">When he was seventeen he went to his father and together they went to the grandmother and I was also there.</span> <span id="s178">(My parents, all my life, were separated.</span> <span id="s179">When I was seventeen, my father took me to Bershed.</span> <span id="s180">All the relatives from all over the Soviet Union came to Bershed to see me.)</span> <span id="s181">It was an unwritten law to accept maybe two Jewish people for one course, for the whole graduating class.</span> <span id="s182">It was around two or three Jewish people.</span> <span id="s183">(In the Soviet Union there exists a law, not on paper, but an oral law about the percentage of Jews everywhere.</span> <span id="s184">In the medical institute especially, they accept only one percent, not more.)</span> <span id="s185">It was different for different towns, but Chernovtsy was a Jewish town, so only one percent, not more, was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">In 1974, there was a big trial, about corruption, with maybe twenty people from the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s187">Two of the people who were arrested were the directors of the medical schools in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s188">They were asked, why didn't Jewish people go to medical school without paying to be accepted?</span> <span id="s189">And they told that it was an unwritten law that every year before the admission tests for medical school, they got calls from the heads of the cities that you can accept this year just two or three Jews to your medical school so you'll have to decide who to accept.</span> <span id="s190">It was an unwritten law, but it was a law.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">(Many high level people wanted money from the Jews because they knew that Jews had money.)</span> <span id="s192">Many of the officials took money, it was a big source of income.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">I usually studied well and all my marks were A's.</span> <span id="s194">But once, I took an after-school activity at an English translation bureau of medical literature, and when we had to get the certificates as translator of English medical literature, everybody got it except me.</span> <span id="s195">All my friends were invited to a big party.</span> <span id="s196">My friend was a Ukrainian, and everybody knew that I knew the language better than anyone else.</span> <span id="s197">They were very disappointed.</span> <span id="s198">She went to the dean of this English course and asked about me, why didn't I get the certificate?</span> <span id="s199">He said, "We will discuss this question later."</span> <span id="s200">She was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s201">She was Ukrainian but she was a very good friend of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">At medical school I didn't have many problems besides the one situation because I studied well.</span> <span id="s203">The only problem was to get into the medical school.</span> <span id="s204">When I graduated I was sent to a place where I didn't want to be.</span> <span id="s205">I was over in Tashkent and Tashkent was short of doctors in ambulances.</span> <span id="s206">Even though I graduated in Obstetrics and Gynecology, I could not practice in that area.</span> <span id="s207">For three years I had to be a general practitioner in ambulances in Tashkent.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">I got married in 1974.</span> <span id="s209">In Russia, usually people get married much earlier than here because you cannot earn money even if you are nineteen, and when you are twenty-nine you have the same amount of money as before you got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">My family left in 1979 to Israel.</span> <span id="s211">The biggest problem for everyone, except for maybe people who lived in Tashkent, was that when they applied for leaving, they could no longer work.</span> <span id="s212">They had to spend any money they had saved and use it just for living expenses.</span> <span id="s213">It was maybe six or seven monthss to wait for the results of the request to leave.</span> <span id="s214">They had to sell all their possessions because you could only take with you a limited amount of things.</span> <span id="s215">They took things for living -- some of the furniture, the linens, they took as much as they needed.</span> <span id="s216">We did not take as many thing with us as they did.</span> <span id="s217">A lot has changed.</span> <span id="s218">(Betya wanted to leave Russia ten years ago.)</span> <span id="s219">I would have been happy to go to Israel with my parents.</span> <span id="s220">(I had my mother.</span> <span id="s221">My mother didn't want to go where my father was.</span> <span id="s222">She believed everything about communism.</span> <span id="s223">She still believes it.</span> <span id="s224">She was born in 1917, the year of the Revolution.</span> <span id="s225">She was raised together with the country.)</span> <span id="s226">She was an engineer, but she was very poor.</span> <span id="s227">She spent all her money on us.</span> <span id="s228">The last twenty years she was poor, because she had spent her money.</span> <span id="s229">She helped us to raise our children.</span> <span id="s230">She had a house.</span> <span id="s231">She lived together with us.</span> <span id="s232">She didn't want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s233">It was before Gorbachev showed us all the "dirty laundry" of our country.</span> <span id="s234">We saw what other countries had.</span> <span id="s235">I opened my eyes, I understood what this country will have.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">In 1985 I forced them to apply for leaving.</span> <span id="s237">It was just when Gorbachev took power and everybody talked about joining their families.</span> <span id="s238">We applied, and in three months we got a refusal to leave.</span> <span id="s239">Then I went to the head of the organization, OVIR, to ask why.</span> <span id="s240">I said that I had my mother there, my sister there, his father there, his brother there, everybody there, nobody is living here in the Soviet.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">He said, "When your parents left this country they left their citizenship.</span> <span id="s242">They knew that they were leaving family here, but they left their citizenship.</span> <span id="s243">Therefore they are not your parents anymore.</span> <span id="s244">Your sister is not your sister and your mother is not your mother because they are not Soviet citizens, and you cannot join them because our politics says that we cannot allow you to go to the enemy country, Israel."</span> <span id="s245">He was the head of the Republic Immigration Bureau in Uzbekistan, where we had to apply to leave.</span> <span id="s246">We could then only apply to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s247">Only now can you apply for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Everybody believed that America wanted war and that it wanted to destroy Russia.</span> <span id="s249">I never believed anything in this country.</span> <span id="s250">I had learned to read between the lines.</span> <span id="s251">When my father died, I didn't believe in anything that was going on in Russia.</span> <span id="s252">He was put in a prison, and he died in prison.</span> <span id="s253">He was just fifty-three when he died.</span> <span id="s254">He was in prison because he wanted my sister to study in the state town.</span> <span id="s255">He had to give money to transfer her from one city to another city.</span> <span id="s256">A lot of people were involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">He died from a heart attack in prison.</span> <span id="s258">It was just seven months that he was there.</span> <span id="s259">During the trial, only my mother could visit him.</span> <span id="s260">She couldn't learn anything about his life in prison because she was a small room and in it was a table and a glass was between her and him, and there was a telephone.</span> <span id="s261">She could speak to him only through the telephone.</span> <span id="s262">He couldn't really tell her anything because people were watching and listening.</span> <span id="s263">He could not write to her before the trial.</span> <span id="s264">There is such a law.</span> <span id="s265">He could not communicate with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">He was in prison six months before the trial, from April to September and he could not write any letters.</span> <span id="s267">The trial lasted one month.</span> <span id="s268">He was sentenced to spend seven years in prison.</span> <span id="s269">He died after serving one month of the sentence.</span> <span id="s270">After his death, I didn't believe in anything in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">After they refused us in 1985, we had to change our jobs.</span> <span id="s272">(Betya was a housewife and I found a job.</span> <span id="s273">I was a mechanic in a big garage.</span> <span id="s274">This is a little job for Russia.)</span> <span id="s275">After we were refused we decided not to try it any more.</span> <span id="s276">We did not know that so many people from Moscow had already started to leave.</span> <span id="s277">We benefited from the change of politics in 1988 and were able to leave the country that same year.</span> <span id="s278">From 1986 to 1988, I worked at a hospital as a gynecologist in Tashkent.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Tashkent is a very different kind of city because if we had been in Ukraine, we never could have found another job.</span> <span id="s280">(Tashkent was a very big city like Chicago.</span> <span id="s281">I found another job, supervisor of a design department of textile machines.)</span> <span id="s282">We could find work.</span> <span id="s283">I worked in a big hospital.</span> <span id="s284">We could just live from our salaries.</span> <span id="s285">We earned approximately 180 rubles a month.</span> <span id="s286">He had a big salary - 300 rubles a month.</span> <span id="s287">We could pay for our apartment.</span> <span id="s288">Before we left, we had a big apartment.</span> <span id="s289">Our big apartment was 23, maybe 25 rubles a month, together with electricity, maybe 30.</span> <span id="s290">It had three bedrooms, but that was only for the last two years.</span> <span id="s291">Before that we lived in one living room, one bedroom apartment for five people, after Boris' mother sold her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Our sons didn't have problems in school when we tried to leave because we left in the summer.</span> <span id="s293">When we left the country, the situation had changed a lot.</span> <span id="s294">No one told you, "You are leaving your own country, your country raised you and gave you your education."</span> <span id="s295">It was in 1985 and 1970 when everybody looked at you as an enemy of the country (When we lived in Chernovtsy, every week, one person left our department.</span> <span id="s296">Many Jews worked together in the design department.</span> <span id="s297">And every week we had a meeting about their leaving from the trade union.</span> <span id="s298">Maybe in the United States, the unions can give some advantages, but in Russia it was just words.)</span> <span id="s299">But every week it was a meeting, and another Jewish person would leave, and they would say, "You are bad people for leaving the country."</span> <span id="s300">Then, the next week the person who said that would be leaving.</span> <span id="s301">In 1976, a lot of Jews left Chernovtsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">(Every month, each office had a meeting.</span> <span id="s303">Everybody knew what we talked about.</span> <span id="s304">It was a routine, a formality that began in 1917, a rule.</span> <span id="s305">Many times I thought about joining the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s306">It could give me a chance to advance my career.</span> <span id="s307">Before, I believed everything about Communism because of my mother.</span> <span id="s308">Later, I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s309">Betya said, "You can choose - me or the Communist party and your career!</span> <span id="s310">Your main career is our family."</span> <span id="s311">Fifteen years ago there was a quota for the need.</span> <span id="s312">Every nationality, every occupation, the party got only workers, not Jews.)</span> <span id="s313">Many have to pay money to join the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s314">(I know from Tashkent many people, like a high level teacher at the Union Institute, who paid money to join the Communist Party, because there was a small quota for this level of people in the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s315">Now the Communist Party wants everybody.</span> <span id="s316">I think I could not have joined because I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s317">The opportunity to join came only twice in my life.</span> <span id="s318">When I was a soldier in the army, my captain offered me the opportunity to join the party.</span> <span id="s319">But I was a soldier for only one year and for the Communist Party, people around me would have to know me for one year to give the recommendation.)</span> <span id="s320">I know that I could not have joined the Communist party because I am a Jew, because I know that in my hospital where I worked right before I left the country, there was one doctor, a year or two younger than I.</span> <span id="s321">She was a best friend of the head of the hospital, who was an Uzbek, not a Jew.</span> <span id="s322">The head wanted her to join the Party, but she was refused because she was a Jew.</span> <span id="s323">There was a quota for doctors and a quota for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">(My second opportunity came when I worked in a big plant in Chernovtsy.</span> <span id="s325">Many of the people were workers and for the plant it was a big quota.</span> <span id="s326">The workers didn't want to join the party.</span> <span id="s327">I had an offer from them to join.</span> <span id="s328">This time, many of the Jews had left Russia.</span> <span id="s329">I had a good friend in the department, because when I looked for a job in Chernovtsy, it was very difficult for a Jew.</span> <span id="s330">When I went to this department, I think now I was not a Jew to him because I lived in the biggest town and I could speak another language.</span> <span id="s331">I made a good impression on him and he became my friend.</span> <span id="s332">I had an opportunity to join the Party but....) I wouldn't let him.</span> <span id="s333">We didn't really argue about this, I just told him never go to the Communist Party!</span> <span id="s334">(I had a high level position and my boss was a good man.</span> <span id="s335">He wanted to keep me and he gave me an offer for the Party.</span> <span id="s336">He was the secretary of this construction bureau.</span> <span id="s337">He is the one man who writes me letters now.)</span> <span id="s338">I was afraid that I would not be able to become a doctor in the United States.</span> <span id="s339">The only thing I really wanted was to leave the country - anywhere and anyhow, just to leave the country because it was the only thing I could do.</span> <span id="s340">I hated everything there.</span> <span id="s341">I think my father's death was the worst time in my life.</span> <span id="s342">The second worst thing I told you about was how the man told me, "Your mother was not your mother because she is not a Soviet citizen."</span> <span id="s343">That was very upsetting, it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">The third bad thing was that I told him, "Okay, you do not allow us to leave the country forever, but I will go just for a visit - I haven't seen my mother and my sister for ten years."</span> <span id="s345">He told me, "No, it is an enemy country, we cannot accept your application to go for a visit."</span> <span id="s346">So I didn't have any opportunity to see my relatives, and I didn't have anyone in that country, so I decided I had to leave.</span> <span id="s347">Anywhere and anyhow, just to leave the country.</span> <span id="s348">It made no difference to me where I went, just to go anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">I miss nothing from Russia.</span> <span id="s350">I don't lie about it.</span> <span id="s351">As for my fear, I passed the medical residency exam so fast, I didn't expect it.</span> <span id="s352">I thought I would try it for three years.</span> <span id="s353">We arrived in November, 1988.</span> <span id="s354">I passed the exam in January, 1990.</span> <span id="s355">I will start the residency the first of July.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">I hope, if I become a doctor here, my sons will have the opportunity to study in good colleges.</span> <span id="s357">They have everything here.</span> <span id="s358">They always have a future, because in that country, we did not have any future.</span> <span id="s359">I told our older son, he is already fifteen, he is going to high school this year, that I hope he knew this.</span> <span id="s360">He is studying computers and I think this is his future.</span> <span id="s361">As for my small son - I don't know, he is too young.</span> <span id="s362">He is like an American.</span> <span id="s363">He speaks English perfectly.</span> <span id="s364">He says to me, "don't speak it if you cannot."</span> <span id="s365">I want to become involved in the Jewish community but I don't have time.</span> <span id="s366">Our small son is going to a Hebrew school at B'nai Emunah synagogue.</span> <span id="s367">We'd like to be a member of the synagogue if we could afford it.</span> <span id="s368">We want to get things that we missed in our lives.</span> <span id="s369">This year we spent Rosh Hashona with Shelley Stone's family, and for Passover.</span> <span id="s370">It is fun, it's so interesting to know about it, especially about Israel.</span> <span id="s371">Our dream is to go to Israel to see everything and to study.</span> <span id="s372">Boris knows Jewish history very well, from what he could get in our country, he knows everything.</span> <span id="s373">I never had time for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">(Several months before we left Russia, I was very sick.</span> <span id="s375">All my life I had believed what I was taught.</span> <span id="s376">When I knew about the truth of the past of the country, I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s377">I had believed Communism was a good idea, I worked for them.</span> <span id="s378">But when I read about the truth, I understood that I was stupid.</span> <span id="s379">I could have left the country ten years ago.</span> <span id="s380">I had risked losing the opportunity to leave for my children, for my wife, for myself, everyday.</span> <span id="s381">One man in the government could say "Kill them."</span> <span id="s382">and they would.)</span> <span id="s383">When everything became open in the newspapers, Boris became ill and went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s384">He was so discouraged that he believed them all the time, and everything was false.</span> <span id="s385">It was a country with no past and no future.</span> <span id="s386">I tried to treat him myself for three months, but nothing helped.</span> <span id="s387">He was in the hospital for a month.</span> <span id="s388">The same day he was discharged from the hospital, I called my Mom and I told her we were leaving the country.</span> <span id="s389">She could not believe it because just two months before I had asked her to send me an invitation for a visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">We were on our way to Israel, but when we got to Vienna we changed our minds.</span> <span id="s391">It was through the Joint Distribution Committee, HIAS.</span> <span id="s392">We were rushed.</span> <span id="s393">(They asked, 'who wants to go to Israel, come with me.'</span> <span id="s394">Only two people went.</span> <span id="s395">We both wanted to go to Israel, but my mother decided, because of my father living in Israel, she didn't want to share me with my father.</span> <span id="s396">We promised my mother not to force her.</span> <span id="s397">If possible, we would go to the United States.</span> <span id="s398">She came together with us.</span> <span id="s399">She didn't have anybody.)</span> <span id="s400">The last thing that happened when we left the Soviet Union is that the customs officer wouldn't let me take my wedding ring, because he saw it was too big.</span> <span id="s401">It was just plain gold, but it was big.</span> <span id="s402">And we bought it sixteen years ago and it cost 170 rubles.</span> <span id="s403">Now it is worth much more because gold is more and more expensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">We did not have a religious background.</span> <span id="s405">We did not have a past so it will be easier for us to have something in the future.</span> <span id="s406">We would like the children to have something to believe in.</span> <span id="s407">We may not be religious but we will study Hebrew and if there is an opportunity for us to join a synagogue, we will want to.</span> <span id="s408">I just want to say that it is a pity that there are still Jewish people left in Russia.</span></p></body></html>
