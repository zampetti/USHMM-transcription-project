your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: My father was the foremost jeweler in Budapest, was decorated at an international exhibition by Prince Joseph from the Habsburg Court, and he was given the equivalent at that time Master of the Gold, of the Golden Wreath.</span> <span id="s75">That would have been an equivalent to being knighted in England and being called "sir".</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s77">And what kind of jewelry did he make?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: He was making -- of course, in those days it was all fine handmade jewelry, and he designed them all, and he had all the, the nobility and the, and the stars from movie and theater as his customers.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Okay, and so would you have considered your family pretty well off?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: At the time we did not know.</span> <span id="s81">My parents did, never divulged what they were worth, for the right reasons, because later on it was proven that the Hungarian police and the Nazis were picking up children and giving them candy and chocolate and asking them a lot of questions about the parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s83">To try and find out where the money was?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Right, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s86">And did you have, did you have household maids or servants?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Yes, we did; we did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s91">And did you receive religious instruction?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s93">We went to a Jewish elementary school and a Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s94">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s95">And what do you recall about your relations with non-Jews?</span> <span id="s96">Obviously your father had customers who weren't Jewish.</span> <span id="s97">A: Yes, of course; but my relation was, and my brother's, only that when we were beaten up by other kids on the street because we were so identifiable because of the emblem of our school, gymnasium on our caps.</span> <span id="s98">Q: Okay, so that –-</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: -- you definitely experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: It was never, it was not a amicable encounter.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Okay, and was the neighborhood that you lived in, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: It was the central --</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: -- a Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, it was the central part of Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: What street was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It was the H-A-J-O Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s109">And what synagogue did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: We went to the -- well, it's what's called the Rumbach.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: If you've heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s115">And sometimes to the Dohany, the largest one in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: But mostly to the Rumbach, and that's where both my brother and I were bar mitzvahhed.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Okay, and did you, did you -- did your family attend services regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s121">So, so obviously your, you know, you suffered at the hands of anti-Semitic school children?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, yes, I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: And what about on a political level, were you old enough to be aware of –-</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No.</span> <span id="s127">The only thing that I -- I mean, I knew that they were electing people to parliament, but I mean from what party or who they were, I really did not, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And did you feel anything from your parents that they were worried as things got worse or --</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s130">My father was quite -- well, he, he was cognizant of the fact what was going on starting in 1938, and later on there were refugees coming from Poland, and he was one of the places they came for funds to help them go to, to Italy or, you know, leave the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Okay, so he helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: He helped, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: But he -- did you feel like your family felt that there was any imminent threat in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Well, from -- you know, as Germany sort of expanded and started taking over other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well, only inasmuch that the Hungarian government, an ally of the Nazis, was bringing in laws that would curtail Jewish activities like attending college –-</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: -- becoming a doctor or engineer.</span> <span id="s141">They had a very, very small percentage that they accepted, only the top, top students, and later on that too was done away with.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s143">And were you aware of the Arrow Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">And, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: As a matter of fact, they were marching many times under our windows.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Okay, and so I assume you feared them and, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Well, I mean, you know, at that time that was the, way before the war, we didn't fear them because they were not, they did not have any real power –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: -- because just the demonstrations that they -- the same thing like the Ku Klux Klan has done here.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: You didn't want to get in their way and you didn't want to face them; but, no, we were not particularly scared –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: -- at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And so how much did you know, how many details did you or your family know about the treatment that Jews were receiving -A: Oh, that we knew, that we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: -- in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: You knew about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well, at that time we did not know about Kristallnacht, but we knew about what was going on in Germany because, you know, at the dinner table these things were discussed–</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: -- and mentioned, and so we were -- I mean, we didn't really -- my brother was 13, I was 14 at the time, so, you know, we did not, we were busy with our own activities --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Concerns.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: -- more or less; and, but, yes, we were aware because we belonged to the Boy Scouts, but we could not be called Boy Scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s168">Okay, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Because there was no such thing as a Jewish Boy Scout Q: Okay, okay, and, but at that point your family didn't consider trying to immigrate or --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes, my father did.</span> <span id="s171">Oh, it was in 19 -- in 1934, I think if I'm correct, he did get an American visa, and he was one of -- let's see, my uncle and my aunt, one of five children, and one of the girls came to the United States, and the other, the rest of them were over there.</span> <span id="s172">One, one passed away, and my grandmother said to my dad, he was the supporter of the family, more or less, his parents, I meant –</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: -- and she said, If you're leaving, who will be left to be with me?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: And he didn't leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And did he feel like he wanted to try to leave because of the political situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s179">He wanted my brother and I to have a better life.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: But it wasn't necessarily related to anti-Semitism or to what was happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, to be honest with you, that I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: I do not -- I know he also tried to leave in 1938.</span> <span id="s184">Again, it was an American visa, and the unfortunate thing was that he had a choice of leaving from Genoa or Bremen --</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Okay</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: -- and he picked Bremen, and the Germans wouldn't give us transit visas.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: So he couldn't leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Okay, okay, and so at, at what point -- I guess you were conscripted into a forced labor battalion?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Well, it was at that time not a forced labor battalion, it was a -- well, in Hungary they had the equivalent of the Hitler ?</span> <span id="s191">Ugan?</span> <span id="s192">.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: But Jews could not be, belong there and get their military training, et cetera, et cetera.</span> <span id="s195">What we had to do is wore a yellow arm band, and we were taken out to the shooting ranges and had to pick up the leads from the bullets that they were firing.</span> <span id="s196">Of course, not while they were firing, but clean up the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: That was our job.</span> <span id="s199">And we had to have, I think if I recall properly, twice a week for two hours each day.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And how old were you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: At that point I was four -- in 1938 I was 10 years, 10 years</span></p> <p><span id="s202">old.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s204">And so -- but later on you were injured, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: No.</span> <span id="s206">I mean, not injured, but, you know, just beaten up on</span></p> <p><span id="s207">the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: But I have -- I'm just looking at my notes here –</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: -- and it says that you broke your collar bone or something or that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: That was later?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: No, that's the whole -- that's the miracle story of our being still alive today.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: That was my dad, and it was -- all right, you want me to tell my story now?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s218">We have escaped death by being able to get into the Kasztner Group.</span> <span id="s219">I don't, I don't know if I have to elaborate what the Kasztner Group was.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: No -- if you want.</span> <span id="s221">I know what it is –-</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: -- and I'll be asking you more questions about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s225">In 1938, I mentioned my father had customers from Germany, from Italy, from Hungary, Austria, who have heard of the quality and the, the design styling that he was known for; and this woman came up from Berlin, and she came to my father's jewelry salon to buy some jewelry, and she bought nice amount, and she came back every year to buy more jewelry.</span> <span id="s226">And in 1940 -- I'm not sure if it was '40 or '41, he brought up a little charm bracelet that she owned, and she asked my father to clean it up and bring it back into ?</span> <span id="s227">varible?</span> <span id="s228">shape.</span> <span id="s229">And my father, when working on the bracelet, he noticed that there was a tiny Star of David hidden among the, close to a hundred different tiny charms; and when she came back, my father put the bracelet down on the counter, and in a way that the Star of David was showing, telling her that he noticed that she had the Star of David; and she bought more jewelry, and she told my father that if things in the future will get really, really rough, and you would like to take your family to Palestine, I'll give you a name and a phone number whom to call, and you can tell him, if you come to that, who sent you.</span> <span id="s230">My father thanked her, put the paper away in his safe and more or less forgot about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Do you remember what her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, I do not.</span> <span id="s233">I know one thing that -- well, I'm giving away the punch line, but her husband was also executed in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Ah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: He was the, he wasn't, obviously a Jewish person from Romania who was the appraiser for the Nazis for all the stolen goods and valuables that they stole.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: So then I think that progressed, and the 1944 march, the Germans entered Hungary and occupied it, and life has changed totally.</span> <span id="s238">And my father was also conscripted for forced labor, and he was -- I mean, they surmised that he'd, they'd be taken to the Russian front; and, of course, my mother and him had acquired warm winter clothing, and he had a pair of waterproof boots made for himself to go; and he told the shoemaker because in those days everything was custom made, there was no off-the-rack stuff, and that he doesn't want any hobnails on those boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I don't know if you know what a hobnail is.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Vaguely, yes</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: It's a metal iron, like a cleat.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: What you do, you hammer it into the sole and the heel of the boots so when you are in grass or in terrain, you will not slip.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: And he had to go in on a Saturday, Friday evening everything was delivered; and to his greatest anger, the shoemaker forgot about it and studded the bottom of the boots with hobnails.</span> <span id="s247">There was nothing he could do any more to it because it was much too late; so he put the boots on, and carrying a heavy backpack, he went to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s248">And over there the platform is not in level with the steps, but he had to climb up on the three or four steps to the train; and as he was climbing up, he slipped on those iron steps and twisted out because of the weight of the backpack, and he was hanging on his one arm, and that's where he broke his collar bone.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Oh, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: But he went in about an hour's train ride away, and he went to the sergeant there and said to him what, told him what happened; and the sergeant asked him, You want to come in here to the military hospital or you want to go back to Budapest and have your own doctor treat you?</span> <span id="s251">And he said, Of course.</span> <span id="s252">I want to go back to Budapest and have my doctor treat me.</span> <span id="s253">And he came back, and to my mother's greatest amazement -- I mean, the poor thing was heartbroken when he left and couldn't stop sobbing and crying; and he came back, and, of course, he was put into a cast, and he got six week of furlough.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: And when the cast was taken off after five weeks and he was flexing his arm and moving it and maybe two or three days before he had to go back, my mother told him, Do you remember that woman who gave you that phone number and that name?</span> <span id="s256">I mean, let's see what could happen, I mean, let's try it.</span> <span id="s257">Maybe the guy won't even be there.</span> <span id="s258">So my father -- they were looking in the safe, and my father found it; and he made the phone call, and he got an appointment for the following day.</span> <span id="s259">The only thing he was told that to cover up the star when you come to the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Because he was already forced to wear a star at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s262">What was it, maybe a month after the Germans came in we had, everybody had to wear stars, yellow stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: And he went there, and as he turned the corner, he stopped cold because it was Gestapo Headquarters.</span> <span id="s265">And he said, Well, for a minute, I was thinking, it's a trap.</span> <span id="s266">Finally he said, You know, what's the difference?</span> <span id="s267">If I'm going in here, I'm going back to the army, you know, the forced labor unit.</span> <span id="s268">So he went in, and they waited, made him wait an hour, and then he saw the man; and he told them he has a family and he has 11 people that he would like to bring into his group; and the guy gave him a name from the Jewish Committee to see and tell the person that he sent my father over and he should take care of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: What, what was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I'll be honest with you, I don't know because there were several --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: -- that later came out.</span> <span id="s273">There were five or seven different people handling the group.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: It was a woman, that's about the only thing I can recall.</span> <span id="s276">Q: Hansi Brand?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I don't know whether it was her or her assistant.</span> <span id="s278">I'll be honest with you, I don't know because my father was not giving out names.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: He was not speaking of names.</span> <span id="s281">He just mentioned that it was a woman or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: And do you know who at Gestapo Headquarters your father spoke to?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: No, that's the same thing, I don't know.</span> <span id="s284">If you have a list of all those that were executed and convicted in Munich, his name will be there.</span> <span id="s285">It's not a German -- I mean, it's a German-Jewish sounding name.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: We used to have -- actually my father after the war got a manuscript from one of the members of the group of seven who were handling it, his name was Engineer Biss or Bliss (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: He gave my father a typed copy of that, and they became very friendly in Switzerland and –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Do you still have that?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No, I don't, I don't.</span> <span id="s292">I don't know what happened to it.</span> <span id="s293">We were moving around, and I don't really know what happened to it --</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: -- unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: It was actually, it was the history of the entire Kasztner</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Group.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Oh, that would be so interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I know, I know.</span> <span id="s301">It was written in German and -- but I think part of it, part of it was also included in the book Jews for Sale.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s305">Okay.</span> <span id="s306">So, anyway, your father got the name of someone to go see.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s308">And he went there, and there was a, thousands of people waiting outside the building; and when my father told him who sent him there, he went right in; and then when he talked to the people, they said, Well, whom do you have, you, your wife, your children?</span> <span id="s309">And he said, No, I have 11 people.</span> <span id="s310">They said, You're out of your mind, there's no such thing.</span> <span id="s311">And he said, Well, such and such told me that it's okay.</span> <span id="s312">So what they said, well, okay, you said the magic word, used the right name, and they did accept 11 people.</span> <span id="s313">And, of course, they told my father that he would have to pay, and it has to be either in Persian rugs, known artists' paintings, jewelry, diamonds.</span> <span id="s314">No money, they didn't accept any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q. Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: So my father paid what they asked, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: In jewelry, I take it?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In diamonds, yes.</span> <span id="s319">And we were told four, three days later, I think, three days later, that everybody should pack a suitcase; and they didn't want to let us out, and in those days every building, Jewish building had -- well, what would you call it, like a ?</span> <span id="s320">kapo?</span> <span id="s321">--</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Um-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: -- that he was, he was a Gentile man who was responsible for every pair of shorts or socks or handkerchiefs that the Jews owned, he had to make a inventory and turn in the entire list; and he didn't want to let us out from the building.</span> <span id="s324">So my father went to see him, and he said, Look, I have these papers here that we are ordered to be deported; and if you don't want to let us out, we'll thank you because we won't have to go and then the Germans will come.</span> <span id="s325">So that scared him, and he said, Go, go, go.</span> <span id="s326">so we went, and we were collected in a yard of a synagogue on the outer boroughs; and we stayed there for a day and a half, and then we were put on, on the cattle wagons; and we were traveling for, for I think it was six or seven days.</span> <span id="s327">The train was -- and the train actually stopped on the border of Austria for two days because the negotiations between, the group who was negotiating with the Nazis broke down, and they -- the leadership wanted to get assurances where we were going because at the border they didn't have a destination, and maybe two or three months before us there was another group also did the same thing.</span> <span id="s328">And at the border they stopped, and instead of Osterreich that is in Austria, they were shipped by mistake to Auschwitz, and they were all killed.</span> <span id="s329">So our leader, he knew about it, and they were -- he wanted to get a definite answer before he was willing to, you know, give any more of the loot, so to speak, to the Nazis.</span> <span id="s330">And then, then after two days, it was cleared, and we headed for Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: So when you, when you left Budapest on the train –</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: -- what month was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: That was in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: In June, okay.</span> <span id="s336">And, and what were the conditions like on the train, was it crowded?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes, it was the same.</span> <span id="s338">Yes, of course it was crowded, yes.</span> <span id="s339">I think there were, if I remember, now this I cannot vouch for, we were either 80 or 90 people to the wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: And we had a bucket and, and, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And did you have adequate food or drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Well, everybody was bringing food with themselves, so, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: -- you ate your own.</span> <span id="s346">You were not getting any from whoever was in charge of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And did you know the name Kasztner at that point?</span> <span id="s348">Did you know that he was one of the organizers of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: I think, I think -- my parents definitely did --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: -- but I don't know it for, my brother and I knew who Kasztner was.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And when you left Budapest on the train, did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: -- we did not.</span> <span id="s356">Oh, we thought we were going through Romania to, to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: That's what we were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s360">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: We were not -- they did not talk about any concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Okay, and just to go back for a minute, so in general before March 1944 was life relatively normal?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Relatively, relatively.</span> <span id="s364">I mean, you know, as far as us children were concerned, besides beaten up once and a while on the street, we led a normal, we led a normal life.</span> <span id="s365">We went hiking with Jewish Boy Scouts and, and -- yes, more or less --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: You know, go to the movies and --</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: -- still able to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, the thing was that there was a curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: So, you know, we could go out I think from, if I recall, from 11:00 to 1:00.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Because there were no more schools left open any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Okay, so you weren't in school any more at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And so things changed pretty abruptly after the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Oh, very abruptly, very abruptly.</span> <span id="s378">I mean, you know, you had -- many times, not many times, a lot of times they closed down a street, and everybody on that street was taken under doorways and checked that they were Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s379">They were looking if they were circumcised or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: And did you have to move like to a new house?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, we did not, that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Okay, that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: That came after you had already left –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: -- and they started concentrating people?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: So -- and how were you, how was your father able to make a living at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: He was not.</span> <span id="s390">I mean, he couldn't -- he had to turn in most of his inventory to the Hungarian government.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: But he managed to save some things?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Well, they, they -- we found out that they were, they'd hidden some of the stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Right, which he then later used –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: -- to pay for passage?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Yes, yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s398">So did you know anything about the other people who were on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No, we didn't know anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: On the entire train there was one other guy that I later on found out once we were in Switzerland that he went to the same gymnasium a grade higher than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: That was the only thing that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: And after March 1944, were you aware of the stuff that was happening outside of Budapest, the concentration and deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes, because, as I said, because of the people who were coming to my father for help–</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: -- to further enable them to, to, you know, travel out of -- they were all going to Italy–</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: -- because things in Italy were not quite as bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And did you know, do you remember at what point you realized what Auschwitz was and what it meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Well, no, not by name.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: But my father told the story that those people who came from Poland, a couple of them who had escaped from Auschwitz, or anyhow some concentration camp, and they mentioned, they mentioned that they are killing the Jews and gassing them and, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And so your father had heard of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: We had heard of that, but somehow it was not given the full credit that, you know, it deserved because they said, That's impossible.</span> <span id="s416">I mean, how can people do this thing to children; and, and, and, you know, the stories were so horrific that some people doubted it that they were true, and then some of them said that, you know, these people are also embellishing on things so you give them more money to escape and all this and all that; but as it turned out later on, they did not embellish on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: That's right, yes.</span> <span id="s418">So did you or any of your family members at any point in time ever meet Kasztner or --</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: -- Joel or Hansi Brand or any of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No.</span> <span id="s422">My father only met, I don't know who the people were at the Jewish Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s424">Okay.</span> <span id="s425">Let me see here.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: We have a -- he did meet, I mean we, Eichmann once.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Oh, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I mean, we didn't know who he was, but at the Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s429">Because what they had done in Bergen-Belsen, when all, the first group of 370 people left, they kept back one member from each family to have as a hostage until the negotiations were complete.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: And one of my aunts was held back, and the other aunt who was her sister said that she is staying with her, she would not leave her alone there.</span> <span id="s432">And, of course, when we got to the embarkation point, the train spur, the count did not jive --</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: -- because they were having -- they had a roll call, and her name came up, and nobody answered.</span> <span id="s435">So my father stepped out, and he told him that -- I don't know if it was Eichmann or not.</span> <span id="s436">In my mind's memory it couldn't have been, but it was of an equal rank -- that she stayed with her sister; and this guy pulled out his gun, pointed it at my father and started screaming at him that, you know, What do you think you're doing?</span> <span id="s437">Who do you think you are?</span> <span id="s438">You can't -- anyhow, after he berated him and screamed, I mean, we were afraid they were going to shoot him.</span> <span id="s439">At that time we didn't know that the Germans, there was no such thing, they had to account for everybody, so he wouldn't have shot; but they sent an SS guard back to the barracks, and he brought back my aunt pulling her by her hair, and then we loaded onto the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: So were all of the 11 people family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: They were my father's brother and his wife and two daughters and my mother's two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s445">Okay.</span> <span id="s446">And do you, do you remember there was a point where they traveled, the train traveled through Linz?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes, we did, and we got disinfected there.</span> <span id="s448">And the word spread around that, you know, they were going to kill us because that's how they do it with the showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s450">And, and that really, people were fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, right, right.</span> <span id="s452">Some of them were really panicking; but, you know, they just made everybody take all their clothes off, and they went to inspection, and, and the long hairs were all sheared, and you were sprayed in the, wherever hair, under the arms and the pubic area with whatever kind of a –-</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: DDT?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Whatever it was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Okay, and what did you think when you arrived in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Well, there was nothing much to think, but we knew that this was a camp.</span> <span id="s457">I mean, we saw the barbed wires, the watch towers and the other inmates, and -- but we were, we didn't have to do any work.</span> <span id="s458">As a matter of fact, we were, to one side of us they were Belgian Jews and the other side there were French Jews, and, and they were, they were not allowed to talk, of course, because the guards were walking the perimeter.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So you were kind of set aside?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: You were kind of isolated or set aside?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s463">I mean, we were in an enclosure with two barracks, and they tried to motion to us with their hands that, you know, this is the end; but we didn't have to wear a star there.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s465">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: So we were not, we were not there like Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Could you wear your own clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes, yes, we did.</span> <span id="s469">Yes, we did.</span> <span id="s470">As a matter of fact, we had the, we had Teitelbaum in our group, and he had, of course, a long beard and a peyos; and the group leader said, you know, do something with your beard.</span> <span id="s471">He would not cut it off, but he wore a scarf, you know, like when you have tooth ache, and he tied up his beard that way so it was not overly obvious.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Okay, and did you feel like, I mean, because originally you had sort of thought you were going to Palestine –</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yeah, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: -- did you feel like you were betrayed in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Well, we didn't know what to think, we didn't know what to think.</span> <span id="s476">I'll be honest with you, there were all kinds of rumors.</span> <span id="s477">As usual, in all these places there is rumors and rumors and rumors and --</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: What kind of rumors?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: I mean, you know, all kinds, that this is it, we're not going to go anywhere and the negotiations must have broken down and we're going to be just, we're handed over to them on a platter, and this kind of stuff</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: But were you aware of sort of the overarching deal making that was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No, that was in secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: That's something you learned later?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s486">Once, you know, the whole thing came to light.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: But you were certainly aware that the war, that the Germans were losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Well, yes, because we saw the bombers flying over during the day; and every time that happened, we were told we had to move, get back into the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: The same thing happened when a new transport came.</span> <span id="s491">I mean, you know, you saw looking out the window because you would not be able to stand outside, but diagonally looking to the main road, we saw these thousands of women, some, some of them in rags and dragging, and, you know, and I would not call it walking any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Like a death march?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No, not death march but someone -- the people who were, who were extremely tired and exhausted, so they could have been in a transport that was on the way maybe for a week or 10 days or whatever.</span> <span id="s494">I mean, that's -- we only surmised, we didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: But from the shape that they were in, we saw that they didn't come from any party.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s498">Bergen-Belsen ended up receiving thousands and thousands of --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: -- people from other --</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Every three, four days there was a group walking by.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And so what did you do, you weren't forced to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Well, most of the time, well, most of the time we were standing in line for roll call –-</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: -- sometimes for two, three, three and a half, four hours before they came, rain or shine, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: And did your parents try to sort of comfort you or give you any schooling or did you--</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No, no, no, they did not.</span> <span id="s508">I mean, there was, you know, no need for that, no time for that really.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: They were just trying to be kept alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Just about, just about, yes.</span> <span id="s511">I mean, you know, in the morning you stood in line for that black coffee that you got.</span> <span id="s512">Once a week they gave you a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s513">At lunchtime you got some -- well, I would call it slop because potato peelings and, and the carrot peelings and actually, what you call it, poison ivy, that was cooked into the soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Well, I mean, you know; and but there was still, for the first two or three months everybody still had a little bit of their food left.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: A little bit, I mean a little, you know, some extra crackers or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: And did you have any personal possessions with you, you know, photographs or –-</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And do you still have those?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s524">That was another thing that I was able to save because when we left the camp to go to -- before they put us across the Swiss border, we were searched for all the papers.</span> <span id="s525">As a matter of fact, Dessi Dorant (ph) from the Metropolitan Opera was in our group also, he was a bass baritone; and he had all of his photographs with him from the operas that he was in, I mean, it was his portfolio; and they wanted to take that, and he begged them and he begged them; and an officer came over, he says, All right, let him keep it.</span> <span id="s526">So he did.</span> <span id="s527">But what you had to do, you had to empty the wagons one by one.</span> <span id="s528">When we got to the Swiss border, there was maybe a table, I would say, I don't really know, maybe, maybe, maybe a hundred or 200 feet long tables one next to the other, and behind it soldiers; and you had to unload the wagon with all your belongings and put it in a row and then put it up on a table one by one, and they, they took whatever paper, prayer books, ?</span> <span id="s529">truins?</span> <span id="s530">, if somebody had a small Torah, they just took all that.</span> <span id="s531">And I said to my mom that put all the photographs in one bag.</span> <span id="s532">It was a, those were like, you know, like travel bags –-</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Um-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- and she did; and I was putting up the stuff in two rows, they were in two rows, one checked, one to be checked; and I put up the bags in order to have it examined, and while I was doing that, I kicked the bag with the photographs over to the already checked bag.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Oh, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: And then I told my brother, You put up the stuff; and I started taking the stuff back into the wagon from the check point.</span> <span id="s537">That's how we saved the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: That's how you saved the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: But I interestingly, I had a diary from our Stay in Bergen-Belsen written, I would say, microscopic size on a, I would say, four by three piece of papers; and in my attempt to save the pictures and being so busy, I put them in -- I had knee socks on, and I put them inside my socks; and I forgot about it, and one of the soldiers noticed it; and I remember he said, What does this young guy have here in his socks.</span> <span id="s540">And so they took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: So they took it.</span> <span id="s542">Oh, that's unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s544">Oh, I felt heartbroken –-</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I imagine, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: -- because it was a daily diary.</span> <span id="s547">So, anyhow, that's how we got to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: And so how long were you in Bergen-Belsen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: If I recall, we were, we moved to Switzerland end of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: And did you know that's where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: No, no, we did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: They just put you on a train and said --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Right.</span> <span id="s554">I mean, don't forgot the allies were advancing already, so they went in a little bit circumvent, circum -- circuitous way to reach Basel; but, you know, it was whenever, some time we were stalled on an open track.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: And how long did it take you to get to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: I don't know, two days maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Two and a half days.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: And it must have been a big relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Well, I can tell you this, when we pulled into Basel, and I was standing in the doorway of the train, and there was a Red Cross woman on the platform, I remember many of them, but this one said to me, Please be careful, please be careful, because the train was still moving; and that struck me, the first person, stranger who really showed some concern.</span> <span id="s561">So -- but it was certainly a happy day, and then we were treated to a great meal.</span> <span id="s562">I mean, great meal, it was pasta and cheese, but to us it was, you know _____.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Sounds good after carrot shavings and --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah, yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: So, so where did you live, was it like a DP camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: No, it was a refugee camp.</span> <span id="s567">We were taken to Montreaux to the hotel.</span> <span id="s568">Hmm, what's the name of the hotel?</span> <span id="s569">Sorry, escapes my mind.</span> <span id="s570">But it was a fantastic view from, on the Lake of Geneva, and that, that, that -- Bellevue, Bellevue, that was the name of the hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: We were in quarantine for 30 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And given medical care and --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Yeah, they had a doctor there; but, I mean, we had a doctor amongst our people also.</span> <span id="s575">So they, they opened a little office, and then if you had something was hurting you or something, you went to see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: And in the door there was a Swiss soldier with a rifle guarding us; and it's a known fact that the Swiss rifles are very long.</span> <span id="s578">When, when -- I would say, well, five feet, maybe.</span> <span id="s579">And my father, we went to one of the soldiers and said, Is this a good rifle?</span> <span id="s580">And he said, This is the best, it hasn't killed anybody, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And so how long did you stay in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: We stayed in Switzerland until 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: And you were in a refugee camp that whole time or –-</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Not the whole time.</span> <span id="s585">My brother and I were in a school learning English and French for about a year and a half; and my parents were, were first sent to Randa, that's right under the Matterhorn in a tiny Alpine village; and that was a real miserable spot.</span> <span id="s586">It was cold, and, and there was no heating at night in those old hotels.</span> <span id="s587">What they did in the winter, they took these warm water bottles, and they slept with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And did you, did your family want to immigrate to the U.S. from the beginning –-</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: -- did they ever think of Palestine or --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Sure, sure, he was able to use his old visa number.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: That _____+ I don't know how many thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: And he never thought about Palestine or --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, he did not</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: -- or going back to Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s598">Well, he went back to Hungary in 1946 to see what was left, and he was able to bring out his tools and, and other things, and, and so he was able to work in Switzerland in a jewelry shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: And where has -- where had his tools been stored?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: In his, in his shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: They were never looted or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: No, that was sealed and left intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: The only thing that later on by 1967 -- I'm sorry, 1947 they cut the apartment and the business in two, and they put in some other people in half of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And did he ever try to get reparations for anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s607">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s608">We did, and we got $200 worth.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: You got how much?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: $200.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Oh, geez.</span> <span id="s612">Well.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: But he was, as I said, he was able to bring out his tool set, and he came with another lucky thing, he came and got out the last day of his permit.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: He was able to find a transport to, to go back to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: And he brought his tools, he brought some winter clothing and stuff, whatever he thought.</span> <span id="s618">So, as I said, he had his tools, and he was able to work, and they were happy to have him.</span> <span id="s619">One of the companies that hired him he did work before the war, and, you know, they took him on as a jeweler, and he was able to -- but he didn't like it because he had to live off alone by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: And so he didn't -- so you didn't think about staying in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No, I don't think we could have.</span> <span id="s622">They wouldn't let you.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: As a matter of fact, by 1947 they were, they were pushing you to, you know, get out, get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: And what -- so you took a ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: What was the name of the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: The ship was Queen Elizabeth the -- Queen Elizabeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Okay, and when did you, when did you take, make the journey to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: We arrived in New York in the 1948 blizzard.</span> <span id="s631">Yes.</span> <span id="s632">I mean, it, it -- all we had was just summer clothing because in Montreaux it was a very balmy climate, so we had to wait till our stuff arrived.</span> <span id="s633">And, interestingly, when we arrived, we did not know that under those snow mounds on the streets there were cars, and they were burning the garbage on the streets and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: My father wanted to go -- if he could have gone back the next day, he would have gone back.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s637">Was it a hard adjustment?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: For them it was because they didn't speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: But you had been learning English, you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes, yes, my brother and I were pretty fluent, and it was the King's English.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s642">And where did the rest of the family go to, all to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: They went back to Budapest, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Oh, they went back to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: One daughter of one of my cousin's got married in Switzerland, and she stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: The other one, the rest of them went back to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: And stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: It's always interesting to think why people would go back.</span> <span id="s651">A: Well, look, my uncle, he was a furrier, he did not have anything that he was out talking without knowing the language, he felt that he could survive.</span> <span id="s652">My two aunts, they said, What do we want to do there?</span> <span id="s653">I mean, you know, we don't have children, so why not go back, you know, where we are familiar with the place and the -- even after what has happened, we don't really have a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And do you know if they felt any resentment or repercussions because a lot of Jews that went back to -- well, especially to, you know, Poland and places like that –-</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: -- they weren't treated very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Well, that I do not know, I'll be honest with you.</span> <span id="s658">I know they, they, they had a lot of fighting with the people who were put in to the other half of the apartment at that time; but, finally, they, they moved out of there, and they got another apartment somewhere else.</span> <span id="s659">But other than that, no, I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: And have you ever been back to Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes, I have because, as I said, I visited my aunt a number of times because she was, you know, she was in her early 90's already, and she kept -- I talked to her more, maybe, of course, you know, we sent money every month for them to survive; and when her sister passed away, she sort of gave up, and she said, What the heck am I living for?</span> <span id="s662">I mean, what's the life?</span> <span id="s663">It's meaningless, et cetera, et cetera; and I said, Well, listen, you just hold it together, and next summer I'll come and visit you; but you have to, you know, make do.</span> <span id="s664">So she did, and every other year I talked to her, and I said, I'm coming, so hold it together, and, you know, just -- so I was hoping that I kept her alive for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: That's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: But after she passed away, I went only back once, and I took my children and grandchildren with me to show them the house I was born and, and to take -- we went to the cemetery, and, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: And that was it, and I don't feel like going back any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Again.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Unfortunately, I always told them that, you know, the place hasn't -- is beautiful and all that, but the faces haven't changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Well, the political situation there is --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Right.</span> <span id="s673">I mean, this was also during the communist, and, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s675">So your family stayed in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Okay, and never went to any place else?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s680">And your father reestablished his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s682">Eventually, yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: And you became an artist?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No, I was, I was -- I only started -- well, I mean, I was designing jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: But my brother retired five years ago, he, he had it; and I -- you know, we closed the shop, and I just have now a small studio, and that's where I do my thing and, and enjoy what I'm doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s688">And so I'm sure you know that the Kasztner rescue mission even to this day is somewhat controversial.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yes, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: And what do you, what do you think of that, what do you think about it in retrospect?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, look, when the group was formed, we did not know the background of it.</span> <span id="s692">After the war, it came out that he actually picked a select few from that is today Cluj, Transylvania, and told the rest of the people in the ghetto that, you know, they'd be safe and they'd be just taken to work and all that and so that they should remain ?</span> <span id="s693">restive?</span> <span id="s694">.</span> <span id="s695">Now, having spoken to the younger guys who were from Cluj and in the group, they said that, you know, what they tried to do is save the cream of the crop, all the rabbis, the scientists, the, the writers and musicians, whatever, that that was the idea.</span> <span id="s696">And they were not -- if they would have picked more people, this thing would have never come to a, to be.</span> <span id="s697">So that's what we were told from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: You know, it's, it's, it's difficult to make, to find out what exactly, what is the true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: And, I mean, unfortunately, he had to pay for his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s703">Do you remember when that happened --A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s704">Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: -- and made the connection with your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s707">One of the, one of the offsprings from the people from that ghetto who killed him in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Safe revenge.</span> <span id="s710">I mean, did that bring his parents back?</span> <span id="s711">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: But, look, there were, there were a number of people, there was someone like this in Holland also, who, who everybody thought that he was a Jewish renegade, and he saved children, hundreds of them, from the Nazis by smuggling them into Christian homes through an orphanage, so I'm sure you know about it also.</span> <span id="s714">It's -- I have the, I have a, a DVD on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: And did you, speaking of movies, have you seen there's a movie that came out a couple of years ago called "Killing Kasztner"?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: A documentary?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: No, I did not see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: It's very, very interesting and well done, I think, and I would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Where can you get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: I'm sure it's available on DVD, maybe even at a library or something.</span> <span id="s724">You can certainly order it.</span> <span id="s725">You have an e-mail; right?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Oh, you don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I mean I have, but I don't use it.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s730">I'll send you the information –</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: -- through the mail or something, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Because I have the 11 DVD's from the, the, the Simon Wiesenthal Center where they give the entire history of the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Starting with Churchill.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s737">Well, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: But it has no mention of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s740">No.</span> <span id="s741">This film is very interesting and well done, so I would recommend --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yes, I would definitely like to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: And I will send it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: But the -- let's see, my other question was -- okay, just to go back to one question that I thought was a little confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: The woman who came into your father' shop –-</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: -- with the Star of David bracelet.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Now, you said her husband was executed at Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Right.</span> <span id="s753">He was the appraiser for, for the SS Order of the Gestapo for all the artwork that they have stolen.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So he was not a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: He was a Jew, that's what we were told, his name was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: But he was executed after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yes, yes, in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Okay, I'll have to look that up.</span> <span id="s759">That's interesting A: Yeah, yeah, he was a Romanian Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Romanian Jew, okay.</span> <span id="s761">And, let's see, and have you ever been -- you know, they do have these Kasztner train reunions of these survivors, have you ever been to anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: No, I have not, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: No.</span> <span id="s764">And then the final question I have is –</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: -- do you, the photographs that you have that you -- do you still have them?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Would you be willing to loan them to the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s770">I mean, you know, they're photographs, old family photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: My uncle in his uniform in the first world war, you know, that kind of stuff, and mostly family shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s774">So I might have someone get in touch with you about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: -- from a different department.</span> <span id="s777">And then the note -- I don't suppose you still have the note from the safe that had the phone number?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: That would be a very interesting artifact.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Wouldn't that be, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s781">I would bring that.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: And how about photographs or artifacts from your time in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Well, we didn't really have a camera.</span> <span id="s784">I have maybe one photograph of myself and -- well, I have, wait a second, I might have a few with my cousin and my brother and then another one with a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I might have those.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Okay, so I'll have someone get in touch with you about perhaps loaning that to us because we do collect that type of material.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Yeah, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: So, I guess that's about it.</span> <span id="s790">I think –-</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: -- we've covered everything.</span> <span id="s793">Thank you.</span> <span id="s794">You have a fantastic memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s796">Thank you.</span> <span id="s797">Well, I have to repeat a couple of times to my grandchildren because they made it a project in school to, to –-</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: It was a home movie that they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Oh, that's great.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Oh, that's great.</span> <span id="s803">And do you have any questions for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: The only question, you know, I still don't understand what, why this whole thing started out that, oh, about three or four years ago, even maybe more than that, I went to the Holocaust Museum, and I had a piece of soap from Bergen-Belsen, and I gave it to them, and it was never displayed; and when we went back a year and a half ago, I asked them, why, you know, you're not displaying it; and they said, Well, you know, there are some things that it might not be what it's cracked up to be, that it might not be pure Jewish fat like it's stamped.</span> <span id="s807">And I'm also, that you have to look, that you have to realize that the museum has more non-Jewish visitors than Jewish visitors, and they -- it would be too gruesome.</span> <span id="s808">I said, How can it be more gruesome?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Well, you know, the thing is too that we have, we have so many artifacts and very few of them actually end up being on display.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I understand that.</span> <span id="s811">Like I questioned them, why, why didn't you display any of the lamp shades that use a corpse, made out of the tattoos from the prisoners.</span> <span id="s812">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s813">I think it's also partly a consideration of human remains, like actually showing human remains.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: But they are showing them in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s816">No, I know.</span> <span id="s817">I wasn't here when the museum opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: But it was a big, it was a big question whether to –</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: You know, that they, and they decided against it in the end --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: -- because they didn't want to offend, I think especially the Orthodox people.</span> <span id="s824">So, I don't know.</span> <span id="s825">I mean, I can't answer that.</span> <span id="s826">I don't make the decisions –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: -- but those are just a couple of the things I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s830">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: But it's here, it's in the collection; right?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: The bar of soap is in the collection?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: No, it's not.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: I mean, it's in our --</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Possession, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: In your possession, yes, because at the time they said they had one from Auschwitz, they had one from Birkenau, but they didn't have one from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s839">I think they did have one from Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Well, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: Thank you very much for taking the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: Well, my pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: And I guess they will -- this is the first actually one of these interviews I've ever done, but I assume they will send you, you know, a copy of it at some point.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: I would appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: I would appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s849">Well, it was great to talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s852">Bye-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
