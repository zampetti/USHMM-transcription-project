punished (inaudible)…</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: When you think about this…today, when you have to explain it to yourself, how it’s possible, for Jews who-that why, do you ask the question, Why did G-d single out the people who were the biggest tzaddikim.</span> <span id="s49">Who had the biggest mi?es, who were the finest people.</span> <span id="s50">You know the Jews who came here in the

slogans…A Jew is a Jew with the money, The Jew with the Money, Money, Money, Money, Money.</span> <span id="s90">As a matter of fact (inaudible)---even there, you know, with the great poverty, but yet some of the Jews which are-even in Poland, you know, they used to say ‘Polish Streets are Jewish houses.’</span> <span id="s91">You know?</span> <span id="s92">They were the owners who they-you know?</span> <span id="s93">…the big difference,--we still were dancing to the Golden Calf more than anybody else.</span> <span id="s94">Of course we can’t find historical justification.</span> <span id="s95">But don’t forget, the average goy is not a philosopher.</span> <span id="s96">You understand what I’m saying?</span> <span id="s97">-He’s a simple man---(inaudible-needs translation)…In

the truth, here.</span> <span id="s109">I don’t want to hear that…(needs translation)…there were Jewish girls with me, they told me that time, we’re talking about it, ‘cause I couldn’t tear it out of myself, you understand, I wouldn’t do it, but if they get married, they’ll never have circumcision for the children.</span> <span id="s110">You understand?</span> <span id="s111">‘Cause they still have the fear that someday it’s going to be- again…</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: So, you didn’t want to go to Israel, you had enough, you felt you suffered enough as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span

id="s233">I remember there was a book (needs translation) ‘It’s not the Criminal What is Guilty.</span> <span id="s234">It’s the Victim which is Guilty.’</span></p> <p><span id="s235">WH: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">JC: You had a mumbo-jumbo.</span> <span id="s237">You understand?</span> <span id="s238">Because the victim created the situation.</span> <span id="s239">You know?</span> <span id="s240">And the same thing what you go through today.</span> <span id="s241">Same thing what you hear, they say, ‘Homosexualism is nothing but a different lifestyle.’</span> <span

Jewry!</span> <span id="s255">…I forgot to tell you…A German Captain, one time he called me…and in English he says, ‘I got you!’</span> <span id="s256">‘What do you got me?’</span> <span

CONNIVING—the epitome of a lie, a cheated, you know, the (inaudible) of the wealth.</span> <span id="s260">You see?</span> <span id="s261">This is what a Jew writes about Jews!</span> <span id="s262">Huh?</span> <span id="s263">Now, what do you got to say now!</span> <span id="s264">I said…I know nothing about America…(inaudible)…are you going to put me in jail?</span> <span id="s265">…’No,’…</span></p> <p><span id="s266">WH: Do you think that Jews are more conniving than other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">JC: Well, of course they are.</span> <span

not the goy…(needs translation)…(inaudible)…</span></p> <p><span id="s277">WH: So, if that’s-if what you’re saying is true, the way you say it now, that means that those who survived, in general, were the most conniving.</span> <span id="s278">Were the most cunning.</span> <span id="s279">The cleverest.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JC: No…the clever died.</span> <span id="s281">I’m talking about,

I’m not going to, I wouldn’t make a summation as saying together those Jews were wonderful Jews, which, they were Jews which didn’t want to eat nothing but trefe, chas yeshilem, even there-.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">WH: And they survived too.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JC: And they survived too.</span> <span id="s290">As a matter of fact, I would, if somebody would ask me, who impressed you more, and who showed more compassion, you know, who those which came and helping out, (inaudible-the ones from?)</span> <span id="s291">the warm, Jewish home.</span> <span
