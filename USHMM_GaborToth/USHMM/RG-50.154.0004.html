allowed.</span> <span id="s24">Of course afterwards it was difficult for the Jewish children to go to the public school so....</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Yeah, did you....</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: So what was done you know so there was special Jewish schools in Czechoslovakia, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: When did it start being difficult for Jewish children to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: 39, after 39.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: But you were already an adult at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Yeah, but....</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: I want to know more about your childhood?</span> <span id="s32">Did you go....</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My childhood was nothing was quite normal, because....</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Did your parents have a business?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My, no, we had no business, you know my father was an engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: He was an engineer, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: And so we had no commercial, uh, connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And your mother was a housewife?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My mother was a housewife, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And you completed how many years of formal education?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: That is, of course, the formal education was five classes which they called public school, you know, and after that you know, we went to the so-called middle school, you know, that was higher after the fifth class, the higher schools, you know, and then you see I didn’t know, you see what, what I would decide, because....</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: As a career?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yeah, then I went to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s44">You know I was in Hamburg because of a friend, a cousin of mine invented fermentation of molasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: What made you, how old were you when you left Prague, Czechoslovakia to go to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: I was 20, 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did you, had you gone to University at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yeah, but I didn’t go directly to the University, I only went to the classes for fermentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: You know because Hamburg had a special department for fermentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: What made fermentation so special?</span> <span id="s52">Can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Fermentation was made so special because up to that point, uhh, every alcohol, every alcohol was done so fermentation but we had better luck you know that we can fermentate molasses, you know.</span> <span id="s54">It was a special bacteria which when heated, you know, started to produce citric acid, you know, and that citric acid of course is well-known because it replaced the lemons, you know up to then there was no synthetic, uhh, lemons.</span> <span id="s55">Of course people dealt with citric acid the synthetic.</span> <span id="s56">It was a natural product from sugar, you know.</span> <span id="s57">The bacteria transferred the sugar in citric acid, you know, that is what was done.</span> <span id="s58">And therefore, you know the citric acid was so important because up to now we didn’t have such a think which was developed in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: So the chemical fermentation process interested you and you moved to Hamburg in what year, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: In 1920.</span> <span id="s61">I went to Hamburg because I knew that in Hamburg I was informed that Hamburg had a special department for fermentation in the university of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s62">So I attended, you know, I went to the evening courses of the university to attend the fermentation of the different products especially molasses, you know, which was at that time something quite new.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Now we are talking about several years after the end of the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: When, was the Wehrmacht Republic already in existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: It was already in existence, because Czechoslovakia was built in 1918.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: It was declared a state?</span> <span id="s68">An independent country?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Yah, you know in 1918 it became an independent state.</span> <span id="s70">Czechoslovakia because we had been Austrian-Hungarian Empire.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Empire?</span> <span id="s72">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: And that you see,</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: We in this country need to have some of these things explained to us because this country has always been the way it is now and it’s hard for us to realize countries were changed, boundaries were changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: But for the children, you know who are listening, it would be very interesting that Wilson, President Wilson came up with the 14, so-called “14 Points.”</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: You know where they said that certain region can be independent.</span> <span id="s78">So President Masarek was a very great philosopher, also political minded like Dr. Benesch, you know they came together and started, you know, to take Czechoslovakia, Moldavia, Bohemia, you know and they built the Czechoslovakia state and Slovakia which partly belongs to Hungary at that time because (words missing in original transcript).</span> <span id="s79">So then we became the Czechoslovakian state, you know from the Hungarian part, Slovakian part, Bohemian and Moravian state with the capitol in Prague, you know; that was in 1918 and from then of course we became the Czechoslovakian Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: When you were growing up and at this time in your life that you’re describing, did you ever experience any anti-Semitic acts directed towards you or any anti-Semitism going on at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: No, we didn’t because the principle I would say the Czechoslovakian people were not anti-Semitic you know.</span> <span id="s82">They liked Jews and they liked to inform you, you see, that every Czech had a special friend which was a Jew.</span> <span id="s83">Because it’s my Jew, that is of course the Czechoslovakian people were not anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s84">Of course you must understand then we had also, when Czechoslovakia was built, there were also many Germans.</span> <span id="s85">You know we had the Sudetenland which had about 7 million Germans: Of course you know The Germans were always a bit of anti-Semitic, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s86">But that belongs to the Czechoslovakian state.</span> <span id="s87">You know the German separate, you know, which was the Sudetenland which became incorporated into the Czechoslovakia state.</span> <span id="s88">So there was political situation which you know with the Czechs and Slovaks and the Poles and the Hungarians, You know there was a mish-mash from different nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: It’s helpful to have you explain this.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yah, so anyway you see for that time it is very important to know that it was based on the whole.</span> <span id="s91">The whole situation was based on the “14 Points” of President Wilson so that every region could be independent, you know.</span> <span id="s92">That happens, that happens, especially with the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy because they split it.</span> <span id="s93">The Austrian-Hungarian monarch was very, very old, one of the oldest, oldest monarchy in Europe.</span> <span id="s94">But of course the Hungarians split it, Slovakians split it and Czechoslovakia was a conglomary of the different kind of the smaller nations under President Masarek.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And it was at this point of your life that you went to Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yah, we went to Hamburg, you know and lived in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s97">As a matter of fact I lived about 10 years in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Did your parents go too, or just you?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Uh, unfortunately my mother died when I was very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: So you see I have no parents anymore because my mother died when I was 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: My father was in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: And was killed in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And was killed in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: He was killed in the war.</span> <span id="s108">So I didn’t, so I grew up without parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: That was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s111">But it was a time you know it was a time, a more crucial time in my life.</span> <span id="s112">But it was nothing to do with my later studies.</span> <span id="s113">You know it was my later undergoing what I did.</span> <span id="s114">And, as a matter of fact, you know it happens because I was forced I was forced not to be employed, you know, because as a Jew you know you couldn’t find a normal job.</span> <span id="s115">Only afterwards I became the director of a big chemical works, you know in Czechoslovakia when I returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Was it because you were Jewish that it was hard to find a job or were jobs just difficult to find?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No it was, no, it was that you know because Jews couldn’t be a bribe.</span> <span id="s118">So we couldn’t find a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: So there was some discrimination at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Yah, but not by the Czechs, only after the Germans occupied us and I’m speaking about after ’39.</span> <span id="s121">After ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Go back now work towards that from the 1920 period?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: From 1920?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: You said you were in Hamburg about ten years?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s126">Yah, then I came back to Prague of course when I came back to Prague of course then I found immediately a job, you know, special in the fermentation factory producing from molasses citric acid.</span> <span id="s127">It was very easy because I knew already what was going on.</span> <span id="s128">So it was not afterwards.</span> <span id="s129">It was not very difficult anymore but before, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you have a university degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: No.</span> <span id="s132">I didn’t because I didn’t have any degree in university because I only attended the classes you know not as a..</span> <span id="s133">.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Not a formal degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Not a formal degree.</span> <span id="s136">Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: So you went, about what year was it when you went back to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: In 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: And Hitler came to power in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: ’35 I remember he come to power ’33, ’35, ’34.</span> <span id="s141">He became fuehrer I think in ’35 after Hindenburg made him....</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Made him fuehrer of the Nazi party.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Did you have uncomfortable feelings when you heard about Hitler that he could be a very dangerous person or did you not pay very much attention, can you describe that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yah, I can only describe the time I listened to his speeches.</span> <span id="s146">You know, he was absolute against Jews and he, of course was not alone, he had other people like Himmler and I don’t know what names all of them were.</span> <span id="s147">But there were absolute, you know Jews were out of any field, you know.’’</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: They were forbidden to be in any of the professions?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: We couldn’t have any profession as long as Hitler and the Germans occupied therefore, what was...</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: But it was still a few years before they came to Austria?</span> <span id="s151">Were you married at this time when you returned back to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, no, I was not married.</span> <span id="s153">I married later.</span> <span id="s154">Yah.</span> <span id="s155">And so</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: When was the first inkling that you had that there was going to be a real problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: A real problem for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: For the Jewish people, can you remember a specific incident when it became clear to you that there were problems coming up?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yah, the peculiar time was when the Germans declared the Nuremberg Gazettzer which was the Nuremberg anti-Jewish laws in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: And when was that?</span> <span id="s161">Can you give the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: ’35 I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: 1935?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: ’35.</span> <span id="s165">In 1935 the official information, you know, was that the Jews are out.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: But in Prague you were not subjected to this yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, No.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: In Prague, we were only subjected after Hitler occupied Prague.</span> <span id="s169">Before there was nothing against the Jews except maybe in Sudetenland where they were anti-Semitic because they got it from the Germans.</span> <span id="s170">But there was nothing against the Jews.</span> <span id="s171">Every Jew could work, you know, in every kind of job he wanted I believe, a factory or a bank or what else.</span> <span id="s172">There was no difficulty, no.</span> <span id="s173">It was quite normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: When the Germans marched into Czechoslovakia were you expecting it or were you shocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, we were, we were, of course we heard it on the radio, you know, that the Germans are coming to occupy Czechoslovakia, they are marching in.</span> <span id="s176">You know, it was done, we had the information that the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s177">But, of course when the Germans came we got the insignia to wear.</span> <span id="s178">From that moment you know, if you were a Jew you couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s179">After 5 o’clock you have to be at home, you know.</span> <span id="s180">We couldn’t go into a coffee house, a cafeteria because we weren’t allowed because Jews were not allowed you know to go in public, public center.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Were you frightened or angry or just what kind of reaction did you have to all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: It’s difficulty to describe you know we were always afraid that something worse could happen, we didn’t know what else could happen.</span> <span id="s183">It was enough that we could work, we couldn’t go for our living at days at a time and I decided, you know, to become a teacher because we didn’t have any teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Because the children the Jewish children were at that point not allowed to attend school?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Only Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Could you have uh, at the point which Hitler marched into your country, could you still have left if you wanted to?</span> <span id="s187">Could you have fled from Czechoslovakia and gone somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Afterwards you mean”</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Well at that point, at the time they occupied the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: After they occupied the country we had no choice; we have to wait until the German decide and, therefore, you know, they sent the Jews out from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s191">So in 1941, you know they deported the Jews to Poland to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: All of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: All of them including the children, 4,000 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yah, I can describe that.</span> <span id="s196">Of course you know when we came to Lodz, to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Describe how it was to leave your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: There was no, you know, one day you got and you got a letter that you had to be there to a certain place and from there they assembled all the Jews.</span> <span id="s199">Always, you know, they sent always 1,000 Jews in one lot.</span> <span id="s200">There were 5,000 Jews going to Lodz.</span> <span id="s201">You know to Poland to send them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Did you have to just leave all of your possessions?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Everything you have to leave, you know you couldn’t take anything with you, because we had to leave everything there and bank accounts and everything and we were deported to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And you could not even take your money with you?</span> <span id="s205">Or your clothing?</span> <span id="s206">Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Of course only what you would just need for the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Like a small suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: A small suitcase; that’s all what you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: You know of course everything was to be leave there.</span> <span id="s211">Because it was not allowed to take with you because it was controlled because you were assembled in a big, big, big hole you know where they all, of course, find out what you have and what you don’t have and you have been sent out by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: By passenger train?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Passenger Train?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: No passenger train, it was a train you know where they load the animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Cattle car, yah, and then you went I don’t know how many nights and day we went before we came to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What did you do for food, what did you do for water and what did you do about keeping clean or going to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: That was very difficult.</span> <span id="s220">First of all to go to the bathroom was the most difficult situation, because many people died on the way too, you know, and did their thing on the train.</span> <span id="s221">Because you know there was no opening.</span> <span id="s222">Water sometimes you know at one of the other stations people came and gave you a little water, as you needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Did you have food with you?</span> <span id="s224">Or were they supposed to...</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: We had a little food which we took with us but we didn’t get any food before we went when we came to Lodz...Then you got some soup or so I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: But that was many days from the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: It was three days, three or four days.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: That’s a long time without food.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yah, so that’s what we could take with us in the small suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did they tell you that you were going to Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No, no, nobody was told where we were going because we thought we were going for work.</span> <span id="s232">You know, they told us we were going for work and of course we didn’t know you see it was a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s233">We worked in the Ghetto too but we didn’t know before.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: when you left Prague did you have any family there?</span> <span id="s235">You said your parents had died.</span> <span id="s236">Did you have grandparents, aunts or uncles?</span> <span id="s237">Did you just go with people from the community who were not related to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, as a matter of fact because, you see, you had to be, because I was in Maccabee you know so I had to...</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Maccabee is like a group, a sports group?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Yah, it’s a sports group, a Jewish sports group you know.</span> <span id="s241">I was one of the leaders and of course, you know, we organized the people.</span> <span id="s242">Sure we have to organize them so that they would follow to the train and go, because to load, to be loaded.</span> <span id="s243">It was a peculiar situation.</span> <span id="s244">But then we arrived in Lodz.</span> <span id="s245">Then of course...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: You arrived in Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: When we arrived in Lodz, we had been taken care of by the Jews over there.</span> <span id="s248">Because there were only Jews.</span> <span id="s249">It was a Ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s250">They were Jews and you know they sent, give us shelter and we got some food: We got soup that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: About how many people, you said they sent them in groups of a thousand.</span> <span id="s252">About how many people from the first 1,000 that you were with died before they got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: I would say that, in the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Hm, Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Maybe three or four, not more.</span> <span id="s256">I mean there were, they died because they couldn’t, they were too weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: This was all kinds of people, young people, old people or did they make a selection process before they put you on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: It was mostly young people.</span> <span id="s259">I would say the age group was about, I would say about 15, you know to 60 or 70.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: A very wide range of ages?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: The people who came to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: All

they will gas you.</span> <span id="s471">All the children had been gassed.”</span> <span id="s472">There were thousands and thousands of children sent to Auschwitz and had been gassed and here was

id="s492">A: Now, now you must understand how it was when you arrived in Auschwitz, you know, there was a man what we called afterwards Mengele.</span> <span id="s493">He was decided whether you go to work or to gas, you know, but I had a courage.</span> <span id="s494">You know when I saw I didn’t know it’s Mengele until afterwards.</span> <span id="s495">So I saw. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q” This is the infamous Dr. Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: The infamous Dr. Mengele who tortured and killed so many youngsters?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yah, afterwards I was told he was Mengele.</span> <span id="s500">When I saw, he was saying left, right, left, right, so I approached him because I spoke perfect German, you know and the attention, you know, I knew the mentality of the Germans very well.</span> <span id="s501">So I stepped in attention. . . you understand German?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: I said I would very much like for work, to go for work.</span> <span id="s504">So he pinched me.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Felt your muscle?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Felt my muscles right, you know.</span> <span id="s507">Left was the gas so that, you know, that the people knew who was going left was gassed who was going right was for work, so all my colleagues which survived---three, four---because they did the same like I did.</span> <span id="s508">You know to Mengele and he sent them to work you know.</span> <span id="s509">I would like to work, so all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: He decided you were strong enough to work after he felt your muscle?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: What was the reaction of the people who were selected to die?</span> <span id="s513">Did they understand what was happening to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: No, how could they know.</span> <span id="s515">We came from Lodz and this. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: You knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s518">But you see the question was only, you know, he said left, right, left, right.</span> <span id="s519">Of course I thought there must be something wrong so I wanted to go right for work.</span> <span id="s520">And left I was going on and going on and going on.</span> <span id="s521">It was the gas chambers so I had the feeling that I had to have the courage to tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: So then of course, when we went right for work, you know, we came to a big hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: A big hall?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: A big hall and uh, what happened then.</span> <span id="s526">They were, you know, sending people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Out to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: To work, you know so of course we came and asked if we could go for work.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Was your wife with you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s531">Only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Where was your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: The wife was on the other side, women were separated and men were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: But she was not sent to the gas chambers, she was allowed to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: She lived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s536">As a matter of fact she died, my wife lies in Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s537">You know she went to Germany, to Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s538">You know because they separated the women immediately.</span> <span id="s539">You know, in Auschwitz, separate the women and separate the men.</span> <span id="s540">And then come, you know, and then came every second night then came Mengele and decided who is going left and who is going right and so you didn’t know if you were going to be lucky to be sent out to work; otherwise you have been gassed, you didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: So we have been, I have been in Auschwitz about six weeks and then you know I was sent to a camp that is called Lidalow.</span> <span id="s543">From Auschwitz we went to Naap.</span> <span id="s544">From Auschwitz we were sent to Dachau and in Dachau we were organized for the different camps; you know, the different camps for work, also, for work, you know.</span> <span id="s545">So we went there from (words missing in original transcript) Dachau, we went in different. . . .I worked for instance, as a foreman for Messerschmidt.</span> <span id="s546">Messerschmidt was the jet people you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: So I established an example with jets as a foreman, you know, of my lot.</span> <span id="s549">The only peculiarity was against the women, because the women you know were separated; there were men and women separated.</span> <span id="s550">Women came to work but they were under the guidance of a woman Nazi.</span> <span id="s551">Women Nazi, you know and I remember, you know, one night you know came because I had about 200 women at Messerschmidt and one of the Nazi girl came to me it was at night, because at night the SS came to control and she came to me and we were not allowed to talk to a Nazi.</span> <span id="s552">She came and I was afraid and she talked to me and she said, “Can you tell me how many people you’ve killed?”</span> <span id="s553">I said, “Why do you think I killed people?”</span> <span id="s554">“Because they told us all the Jews are murderers.”</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s556">And she believed that?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And she believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: And she believed that all the Jews were murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Were murderers and I said, “Do you think that the women, you know, you are very nasty to them, are murderers?”</span> <span id="s560">She said, “I don’t know; I was told that you are murderers.”</span> <span id="s561">I told her that the difference between you and me because she was German and I spoke German, I said I was born in the 2nd floor and you are born on the 1st floor.</span> <span id="s562">That’s the only difference between us.</span> <span id="s563">We are not murderers and the women are not murderers.</span> <span id="s564">Please be nice to them.</span> <span id="s565">She started to cry and of course you know I was afraid and the SS came and she cried.</span> <span id="s566">They could send me to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: They could think you did something to her to make her cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yah, she could have, yah she could have told them I told her something.</span> <span id="s569">So that was their cruelty of the women, they were very cruel.</span> <span id="s570">Because they were all told that we are all murderers.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: And they were gullible enough to believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: They believed.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s574">So how long were you in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: In Dachau, Dachau I was before I went to Auchsberg to (words missing in original transcription) five weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: They moved you around a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Five weeks you know and then we came to a nasty, nasty camp.</span> <span id="s578">I was already asked from the Germans about this camp, Riderlo, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Can you spell that.</span> <span id="s580">It’s not a familiar name to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: R-i-d-e-r-l-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And where was that, in what country?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: It was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: In Germany.</span> <span id="s586">It was of course I would say it was partly in Germany, partly in Poland, you know.</span> <span id="s587">It was partly in Germany, Riderlo.</span> <span id="s588">It was nasty, the people, there was typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: That was always the danger in camps wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s590">Typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Danger of typhus, many people died.</span> <span id="s592">You know from the 600, about 400 died.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I had black typhus, you know it’s a different typhus, from the lice.</span> <span id="s595">You know, I had the very sick black typhus.</span> <span id="s596">This came from water.</span> <span id="s597">I never drank water.</span> <span id="s598">I always waited until it is cooked up in the evening.</span> <span id="s599">And I worked, you know, without water.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">QW: And then you drank boiled water.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Boiled.</span> <span id="s602">Only boiled.</span> <span id="s603">And I got the black typhus which the Americans saved me.</span> <span id="s604">You know when...</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Talk a little louder.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s607">When I got this black typhus, the Americans were already on the way, you know, to one of this camp.</span> <span id="s608">It was in Ehrlach.</span> <span id="s609">And my friend drove me to the Americans and the Americans came and brought me, you know, to the American lazeret.</span> <span id="s610">You know they built up a fake lazeret.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: I’m not sure what a “lazeret” is.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: A lazeret is in the hospital.</span> <span id="s613">They call it lazeret.</span> <span id="s614">And then I got high fever and they took me and washed me and put some DDT on me and now I was lying on the bed and then came an American doctor.</span> <span id="s615">He looked at me helpless.</span> <span id="s616">He said...</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: He couldn’t do anything for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: But I understood English that he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s619">And I started to shout, to cry, and I said “Doctor, why, why?”</span> <span id="s620">He came back, he sat down.</span> <span id="s621">“My boy, tell me your story.”</span> <span id="s622">So I told him what’s going on and that we came from Lodz and da, da, da, da.</span> <span id="s623">And now you see that I came.”</span> <span id="s624">And he said, “Wait a minute—I don’t let you die.</span> <span id="s625">I don’t let you die.</span> <span id="s626">Don’t worry, I don’t let you die.”</span> <span id="s627">So he asked two men nurses. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Male nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Male nurses to give me a prescription.</span> <span id="s630">Every two hours I had an injection.</span> <span id="s631">I had 80 injections against this typhus which I had, you know.</span> <span id="s632">I had black spots, it’s called the black typhus.</span> <span id="s633">And they saved me; the Americans saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: How long were you in that hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: In the hospital, you know, that was already s funny thing.</span> <span id="s636">In the hospital, I was about three weeks.</span> <span id="s637">Then they sent me to another hospital, you know where I stayed four weeks.</span> <span id="s638">But when I had typhus, your balance us disturbed.</span> <span id="s639">So I always fell on the left side and I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s640">So I was in the other hospital I was about six weeks and I lost my muscles.</span> <span id="s641">You know I couldn’t walk. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: From weakness.</span> <span id="s643">Your muscles became weak.</span> <span id="s644">Was the war over at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s646">Not yet.</span> <span id="s647">But the Germans were already starting to run, you know.</span> <span id="s648">When we came to Ehrlach, they starting to run.</span> <span id="s649">So I was in Munich, you know, in a building which belonged to the American supply.</span> <span id="s650">And they took care of me.</span> <span id="s651">And then I was sent to the hospital there.</span> <span id="s652">In Munich I came to German hospital.</span> <span id="s653">There was a German doctor.</span> <span id="s654">My luck was that I spoke perfect German.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: You spoke how many languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: How many languages do you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I speak English, French, German, Czech, Polish.</span> <span id="s659">So my luck was that I helped many of my colleagues because I was able, you know, to communicate German.</span> <span id="s660">I came to the doctor.</span> <span id="s661">“My boy, you are really sick.</span> <span id="s662">But I will tell you, I am able to give you 20 marks a week, as supplement in Munich.”</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Why would he give you 20 marks a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Because I was sick.</span> <span id="s665">He could give the sick people 20 marks a week.</span> <span id="s666">So he gave me the 20 marks.</span> <span id="s667">And I could come every week for the 20 marks.</span> <span id="s668">And when I got the 20 marks I said, “No I will go to buy something.”</span> <span id="s669">For the first thing, I went to a butcher.</span> <span id="s670">You know, in Munich everything was available.</span> <span id="s671">Food, sausages, everything was available.</span> <span id="s672">In Munich they had everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Almost as though there were no war?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s675">They said they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s676">So I asked the doctor, “Doctor, I would like to have a bath.”</span> <span id="s677">He told me where the bath was.</span> <span id="s678">There was a big line and because this sickness, they said, “Don’t stay here.</span> <span id="s679">We didn’t know what happened to you.</span> <span id="s680">But I will refer you the bath and you can come every week for a bath.”</span> <span id="s681">So I....</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: This was like a public bath house?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s684">A public bath house, yes.</span> <span id="s685">Then I went to buy some sausages, some ham, you know, I cost 20 marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Twenty marks was a lot of money?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: A lot of money.</span> <span id="s688">It was about five dollars at that time.</span> <span id="s689">So I said, “Give me 10 decas this, 10 decas that.</span> <span id="s690">Here I pay.”</span> <span id="s691">“No, no, no, you don’t pay.”</span> <span id="s692">You see, you went through so much.</span> <span id="s693">We didn’t know everything.</span> <span id="s694">You can always come and you have nothing to pay.</span> <span id="s695">You are a poor boy; you have nothing to pay.</span> <span id="s696">Come again.”</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Why do you think they were so nice to you, all of a sudden?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Because, you know, they thought that by telling me that they didn’t know anything, and you know, and they had fooled everything, and so they were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: They were hoping you would remember and speak up for them when the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s701">Then I had, you know, I wanted to have sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s702">I had the feeling I want to have sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s703">So I went to another shop.</span> <span id="s704">They had a barrel of sauerkraut.</span> <span id="s705">“Can I have a kilo?”</span> <span id="s706">“No, you have not to pay.”</span> <span id="s707">In Munich I didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s708">Before they brought me to Prague, I didn’t pay.</span> <span id="s709">I had always still the 20 marks.</span> <span id="s710">You know, I could go buying everything, but....</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: And every week you got another 20 marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: If I went to the doctor.</span> <span id="s713">That was my nicest time, because I could get.</span> <span id="s714">.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: How did anyone keep clean in places like Dachau and Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: You see, that was a difficult situation.</span> <span id="s717">I was the spokesman used, you know, to take a cold bath in the morning.</span> <span id="s718">There was water, cold water.</span> <span id="s719">But that was all that we had and the shirts with lice.</span> <span id="s720">I would take the shirt off and wash myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Was there soap?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: No, no, just water.</span> <span id="s723">There was no soap, no paper, you go to the toilet, no paper.</span> <span id="s724">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s725">Only a whistle.</span> <span id="s726">You had to go to the toilet when he whistles; you sit down when he whistles, you get up.</span> <span id="s727">.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And no toilet paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Nothing, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: The conditions and the smells must have been indescribable.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Therefore, you see, most of the women they had no water, they had no baths; they came to work, you know, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s732">They didn’t have a bath maybe for two months.</span> <span id="s733">They couldn’t wash.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Your wife described to me how she very carefully washed every day, because she knew it was important.</span> <span id="s735">And the water was cold, but it was important to keep as clean as she could.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: But these women, you know, come to Messerschmidt.</span> <span id="s737">They come from outside,I didn’t know if they washed or not.</span> <span id="s738">But anyways, they didn’t wash there, because they had no warm water.</span> <span id="s739">But the most disquieting for the women, which Hitler did, because you see, they had nothing to put on, you know.</span> <span id="s740">Their breasts were hanging out.</span> <span id="s741">The women, you know . . . for me, I said okay, I have to work because they send me out again, so I go to work.</span> <span id="s742">So it was not so difficult for men, but for the women, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s743">Besides, you know, they were under the guidance of these girls, which . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Of the matrons?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Who were very cruel to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Very cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: What was it like when you learned that the war in Europe was over?</span> <span id="s750">Was there any special . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: That was a very interesting case.</span> <span id="s752">You know we marched.</span> <span id="s753">We had to march, because we were walking.</span> <span id="s754">We slept in a forest on snow, because there was nothing.</span> <span id="s755">But we had to march from one town to the other town.</span> <span id="s756">You know, we took . . . before we came to Ehrlach.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Ehrlach?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Ehrlach.</span> <span id="s759">It is near Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s761">Who made you march?</span> <span id="s762">The soldiers, the German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: The Germans, the Germans, you know, they called them police, but it was the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s764">So, sometimes, you know, I stayed back.</span> <span id="s765">So they sent the soldier, with the gun, to fetch me.</span> <span id="s766">So, because I spoke German, I said, “Listen, I am hungry, what about you?”</span> <span id="s767">“He said, “I’m hungry too.”</span> <span id="s768">“Okay, let’s go to the farmers.”</span> <span id="s769">“Okay, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s770">So we went to the farmers and the farmer’s wife asked the soldier, “Can I give him something?</span> <span id="s771">A piece of cake or a piece of . . . ?”</span> <span id="s772">Sure, because he wanted also.</span> <span id="s773">So these days we went together, begging from the farmers.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: You just left the group?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s776">So, before we came to Munich.</span> <span id="s777">We had the feeling that the war is over.</span> <span id="s778">Why?</span> <span id="s779">Because the Germans came and stopped us, you know.</span> <span id="s780">Will you come with us and when the Russians come, you tell them that we are nice to you.</span> <span id="s781">so my colleague would say, “Let’s go, Ossie.”</span> <span id="s782">I say, “Oh, no, when they come the war is over.</span> <span id="s783">We go to the end.</span> <span id="s784">You know, we don’t want because I don’t know, maybe they shoot us, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s785">So we didn’t go.</span> <span id="s786">But then we knew the war was over, because the English, the French and the Russians and the Americans. . .</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: How did people behave when they heard the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: In every town we have celebrate very nicely.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Did they cry or did they laugh?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: No, no, they say they didn’t know what’s going on, you know.</span> <span id="s791">They never knew what’s going on.</span> <span id="s792">They behaved against us later on very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Was there any kind of celebration?</span> <span id="s794">Did the people you were with celebrate in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: No, I was not...see, I was only with the people from the camps, so we didn’t celebrate, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s796">The main point for us was to get a piece of bread and to get something, you know, where we can beg for a piece of sausage.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t think that the Germans celebrated, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: I didn’t think the Germans would celebrate, but maybe the other people would celebrate.</span> <span id="s799">When the Germans actually left, did they just walk away?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: They walked away.</span> <span id="s801">From the (words missing in original transcript) barracks, they walked away.</span> <span id="s802">And they left us alone.</span> <span id="s803">They walked away.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Did you understand the war was over when they walked away?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s806">We knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: So here you are, in a camp and now you don’t have to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: But, you see, I was in a very good position because at Messerschmidt I worked with French engineers and they had a radio.</span> <span id="s809">So every evening I knew what was going on because as a foreman, I was taken care.</span> <span id="s810">When the SS came, I shouted, so they put up a radio.</span> <span id="s811">I shouted, you know, till they heard me.</span> <span id="s812">But then, you see, the French did a fantastic thing.</span> <span id="s813">They screwed the (words missing in original transcript); we had no laces.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: On your shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: They screwed the cables in such a way and the jets start to vibrate...</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: The Messerschmidts started to vibrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: So the screw went loose and the jet didn’t fly.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Like sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Sabotage.</span> <span id="s820">So one day, you know, the SS came and they saw the yellow cable in my shoes because we had wooden shoes with textile uppers.</span> <span id="s821">But they had no laces.</span> <span id="s822">So we took what is left...</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: The cable wire...</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: The cable wire.</span> <span id="s825">Ah,sabotage, sabotage!</span> <span id="s826">In the meantime, you know, I get friendly with the German foreman and he told the SS that is waste.</span> <span id="s827">That is not the cable; we didn’t pick it.</span> <span id="s828">Because they said we made the cable--we cut the cable...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: You cut the cable too short, so you could tie your shoelaces.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Tie your shoelaces.</span> <span id="s831">So I saved us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: So there were a few decent people?</span> <span id="s833">There were a few decent Germans who helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: They had to be, because otherwise we couldn’t survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Can you think of any other outstanding things, like somebody of the Germans who was helpful?</span> <span id="s836">Were there other Germans who were helpful to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s838">One thing you must understand--a piece of bread when he brought you, because when he marched with us--I spoke German.</span> <span id="s839">For instance, one soldier, they called him False SS.</span> <span id="s840">They were taking care of us, the workers.</span> <span id="s841">“Can you give me a piece of bread?”</span> <span id="s842">“ Don’t worry, I bring you.”</span> <span id="s843">Oh, yah, they were helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Were there people throughout your experiences, Jewish people, that you stayed with and that you all kind of looked out for each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: During when?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: While you were in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: In the camp.</span> <span id="s848">There was no possibility to look after one another.</span> <span id="s849">There was no possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: And you said your wife was at Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yah, afterwards.</span> <span id="s852">After she came to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s853">You know, that was a special woman’s camp.</span> <span id="s854">Bergen-Belsen was...I met many...I met a few women who knew that my wife died in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Oh, she died in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: In Bergen-Belsen, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: She died in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s858">So you were very much alone again?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Oh, yah.</span> <span id="s860">In Prague I was alone, sure.</span> <span id="s861">Because I met my Lilly muchy later.</span> <span id="s862">Sure I was alone.</span> <span id="s863">She didn’t come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Well when you were free to leave the camp, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: We didn’t go free, because they brought us by trucks to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: The Russians brought you or the Americans brought you?</span> <span id="s867">Who brought you to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: The Americans.</span> <span id="s869">The American trucks, you know, brought us from Munich to Prague and in Prague you see we have been at home.</span> <span id="s870">There was no difficulty any more.</span> <span id="s871">And we could go where we want, because nobody controlled us any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: How long did you remain in Prague after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: After the war was over, the whole time until 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Quite a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yah, because I worked in Prague.</span> <span id="s876">I told you that I was director of one of the chemical works in Prague.</span> <span id="s877">In ’48 we emigrated to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: What made you decide to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s880">The question is...we didn’t feel very well and Lilli wanted to go out...</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: You’d already met Lilli and you got married then.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yah, yah.</span> <span id="s883">I was already married to Lilli in ’48.</span> <span id="s884">we emigrated together.</span> <span id="s885">I met Lilli.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: You met her in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: In Prague.</span> <span id="s888">And I knew her husband.</span> <span id="s889">He died in the camp.</span> <span id="s890">I knew her husband, you know, and so we met through friends.</span> <span id="s891">You know, I don’t know whether Lilli told you, you know, we went to a street which I shouldn’t go and there was a friend from home.</span> <span id="s892">“Ossie, Ossie, come up, come up.”</span> <span id="s893">And there was Lilli.</span> <span id="s894">Of course I didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s895">So I married her later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: And then you decided to move from Prague to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Because I had a worker permit.</span> <span id="s898">You know, I did a big job for the English and I got, you know, the home office gave me a worker permit, which was very difficult to obtain in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Was it limited, like so many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: For one year, you know.</span> <span id="s901">So then we came to the immigration in London.</span> <span id="s902">“Mr. Baron, you are expired.”</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Your work permit expired?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: “You are expired.”</span> <span id="s905">He looked at me and say, “What will you do after one year?</span> <span id="s906">You cannot go back to Prague.”</span> <span id="s907">Because it is in the passport, you cannot go back.</span> <span id="s908">I said I will do the same what I did already several times.</span> <span id="s909">I will go ahead.</span> <span id="s910">“I give you one year.</span> <span id="s911">In one year you have time, you know, to settle with the home office, because the home office gave them the order to let me in, because I did a great favor to them, to the English.</span> <span id="s912">I worked for the English very big scale.</span> <span id="s913">But I did something for them, you know, and they never forgot it.</span> <span id="s914">I can always go back to England, you know, because I have a permanent stay I can always go to England because I helped the English and they know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Helped them with your knowledge of chemistry?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Yah, but they were in great trouble.</span> <span id="s917">They needed material which they couldn’t get and I supplied them the material from Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: Much earlier on?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: I worked with them, with the English many years before.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Yes, you told me about that before we started talking on the tape.</span> <span id="s921">If you could pick up one thing that happened to you during your experiences in Europe and in the camps, what would be the most outstanding thing that you would talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: In which way?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Any way.</span> <span id="s924">Is there one thing about your experience that stands out in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: You see, when you have been in so many camps, like I have been, you know there were eight camps, it is very difficult to pick out one special item or special camp, because everything was bad.</span> <span id="s926">I would say I think Dachau was the worst.</span> <span id="s927">No, Liederlau was the worst.</span> <span id="s928">You know, that’s very difficult to say what happened just in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Is there any one thing that you felt was most contributory to your surviving?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I was sick in one camp and I talk to myself, “Ossie, it’s finished.”</span> <span id="s933">You know, I had diarrhea, I couldn’t keep it any more.</span> <span id="s934">And then you see there was a Polish doctor and he said, “what happened to you; you look so pale?”</span> <span id="s935">“It’s finished.”</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Having diarrhea when you don’t have any medicine is pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: “I cannot keep it and I’m giving up,” I told him.</span> <span id="s938">He said, “You cannot give it up; we need you, because we need your language.</span> <span id="s939">You know, you have to negotiate for us.</span> <span id="s940">You cannot die.”</span> <span id="s941">I said, “what shall I do, Doctor?”</span> <span id="s942">He said, “I have two pills here--two pills in the whole camp.”</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Two pills that would help the diarrhea?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yah, that would stop--what is it called--—two pills, yes, who could stop it?</span> <span id="s945">And he gave me the two pills.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: That would seem to be a memorable experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: You know why?</span> <span id="s948">Because three days later he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: The doctor died?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: The doctor died.</span> <span id="s951">And that was the most memorable thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: I can understand it would be very memorable.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: He gave me the last two pills, which stopped my diarrhea.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: How long were you in London before you went to Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: And you have been in Canada ever since?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Yah, in ’51 we came to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Well, I certainly thank you for sharing this with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I share it with you because that is all what I can tell you.</span> <span id="s960">The questions only that you see, if you are in different camps, and every camp has something different, you know.</span> <span id="s961">And you had to try to survive in one way or the other, you know.</span> <span id="s962">Either you stole potatoes somewhere, you had to do something, you know, to survive.</span> <span id="s963">Because one potato was life.</span> <span id="s964">One potato was very important, because you couldn’t stop because you had nothing firm to put in your tummy, besides the ration of bread when you worked.</span> <span id="s965">So every camp was different and, so what else was outstanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Do you think about these experiences very often?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Very often.</span> <span id="s968">Yes, sometimes I wake, sometimes I think so, you know, that sometimes it came to me.</span> <span id="s969">I thinking about, you know, what you said about special experience.</span> <span id="s970">I go from one camp to the other camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">QL: It must be hard to remember the sequence, if you were, you said in eight camps altogether.</span> <span id="s972">It must be hard to remember the sequence of the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: It is very difficult to remember, you know, what was just in connection with this.</span> <span id="s974">For instance, when I worked at Messerschmidt, putting the jets together, before we went to Augsberg to work on the big Messerschmidt.</span> <span id="s975">When you put the jets together, we got everything back, so we put it together.</span> <span id="s976">And then, you see, we work day and night, one week night, one week day.</span> <span id="s977">So I came to the idea when I come in the morning, you know I could maybe go for the SS, you know, because the SS had--you know, what you had to carry on the...you had to go with the small.</span> <span id="s978">.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Small hand truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Like a hand truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Not a hand truck, but you know it was not a truck, it was like a wagon.</span> <span id="s983">So I came to the idea that I come from the work in the morning, I can go for the SS for the food for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Good thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: So I ask, you know, they say, “Okay, you can go.”</span> <span id="s986">So naturally because I expected, that I can always beg for something.</span> <span id="s987">Sausages or bread.</span> <span id="s988">Some people are very nice; some people were less nice.</span> <span id="s989">So we had to get bread for the whole camp.</span> <span id="s990">So, so many bread loaves.</span> <span id="s991">So I came to a fantastic idea, that I tell you for joking.</span> <span id="s992">I said, “How can I manage to control how many bread we took from his bakery you put on the wagon.”</span> <span id="s993">And he had to control it.</span> <span id="s994">So I put it round; I put every loaf round.</span> <span id="s995">So he always forget, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Where he started to count...Instead of putting it in rows, you put it in circles.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: He always counted and he always made mistake, because he never came to the same.</span> <span id="s998">And that, you see...</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: You could get extra bread that way.</span> <span id="s1000">I am going to turn the machine off now, but I did want to thank you so much for contributing to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: You are most welcome.</span></p> <p><span
