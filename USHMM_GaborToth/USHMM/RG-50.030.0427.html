1, 1996.</span> <span id="s12">My name is Arwen Donahue and we are conducting this interview at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and we are going to begin this interview by looking at some of the photographs that Mrs. Ware has brought.</span> <span id="s13">Would you like to start with you're family?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Yes.</span> <span id="s15">Now, this is a photograph of a wedding of my father's youngest brother.</span> <span id="s16">And this was probably 1924.</span> <span id="s17">It was summer of 1924 and the reason I brought the picture is because it shows the whole ____________ family that I and my little cousin are the only survivors.</span> <span id="s18">My little cousin is just an infant, _________ Frank.</span> <span id="s19">To the left is my father, my mother, myself and my brother.</span> <span id="s20">And on the other side is my Uncle, my father's sister, my cousin, and my two cousins.</span> <span id="s21">And these are the ones with whom I ended up living in New York City.</span> <span id="s22">But the rest of them, we can go over the photographs later, but anyway, the rest of them all perished.</span> <span id="s23">And I don't know how much more detail would you like in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Well it looks like there are about fifty people here?</span> <span id="s25">Are they all relatives of you're father?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well these are the family, that's the way they were taking pictures in those days, this is the family of the bride and this is the family, this is my family on this side.</span> <span id="s27">And there are about twenty-some people of my immediate family that are on this side and, altogether they are about fifty people in the picture probably.</span> <span id="s28">All perished except two.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: And where was this wedding?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: This wedding was in Grodno.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: In Grodno?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: In Grodno, Poland.</span> <span id="s33">At that time it was Poland, now it is Russia.</span> <span id="s34">See, Northern Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: According to what I can figure out with my age and being still in Grodno.</span> <span id="s37">I look like my brother, maybe one-year-and-a-half, I probably am three.</span> <span id="s38">And then this one was even the younger cousin, this was the youngest one right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: So it's about 1925?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: 1924, 25.</span> <span id="s41">It may be the summer of '24.</span> <span id="s42">And this one, life goes on.</span> <span id="s43">This is me . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: You today.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: And this is my oldest daughter.</span> <span id="s46">This is my next daughter, this is my son and my youngest daughter.</span> <span id="s47">And these are the four grandsons and a princess.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: It was taken Thanksgiving, 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: 1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: 1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: That's wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: And the rest of the pictures, we can go over them later but I just thought that this is sort of an introduction to the whole thing.</span> <span id="s56">That I survived and I go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Yes, now you said right at the beginning that you and you're cousin were the only two that survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Survived.</span> <span id="s59">Well actually there were four cousins who are in the picture here and their mother who went to Israel just before the war took, so they survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Let's start at the beginning, with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Would you please just repeat you're name at birth and you're place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I was born in Grodno, Poland.</span> <span id="s64">Anna ____________.</span> <span id="s65">And in 1922, January 31, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: And tell me something about you're parents, starting with you're father?</span> <span id="s67">Where was he from?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: My father lived in Moscow and he was a tanner.</span> <span id="s69">I suppose he was a chemist knowing about tanning skins and the whole family really was involved in the tannery business.</span> <span id="s70">And his three brothers and himself, they all lived in Moscow.</span> <span id="s71">Now my father married my mother also in Moscow and she was studying at the Russian, at the Moscow Piano Conservatory, I mean Music Conservatory, she was studying piano.</span> <span id="s72">And she was studied then, history.</span> <span id="s73">Now as far as I know, after the Russian revolution in 1919, they moved to Poland to Grodno where the brothers and there were three sisters, they all opened a tannery and it was a large tannery and they all worked in there.</span> <span id="s74">My father was primarily involved in actual tanning of the skins and one of the brothers was primarily involved in traveling and making the business contacts.</span> <span id="s75">And the sisters were married.</span> <span id="s76">Now one of my father's sisters's was married to an Arian German and they lived in Klinicksberg (ph) but the two other sisters were married to Russian Jews and they all lived in Grodno.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Could we backtrack just a little bit and I'm interested in hearing whether you're father's family were tanners back for generations and whether this was a tradition in you're family?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: I think this was a tradition as far as I know.</span> <span id="s79">And there was always talk about skins and hides.</span> <span id="s80">Now what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Now they came, do you know why they decided to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Because they didn't want to be under the Russians in Russia, you know, in the Bolsheviks.</span> <span id="s83">They were intelligencia.</span> <span id="s84">They were cultured, they were well educated and they just were free thinkers.</span> <span id="s85">They didn't want to be in the revolution.</span> <span id="s86">They weren't Communists.</span> <span id="s87">They were proprietors.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And so they all came together?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: They all, well one by one.</span> <span id="s90">I don't think that they just came by covered wagon, you know, all together.</span> <span id="s91">But all I know is that they all moved before I was born.</span> <span id="s92">And there were four girls of my father's oldest sister.</span> <span id="s93">And the grandmother was there too.</span> <span id="s94">Grandfather was dead already, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: And you're mother's family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Now my mother's family, I believe they lived in Riga for some time but they also moved to Grodno because I remember my mother's step-mother and my mother's father.</span> <span id="s97">My mother's father died just about, I was about three-years-old.</span> <span id="s98">Because I have a picture of my mother in a black veil and that was traditional, to wear for mourning for one year.</span> <span id="s99">You wore a black veil and this is a picture after my grandfather, her father, died a natural death.</span> <span id="s100">And then the grandmother, the step-grandmother, you know, lived with us.</span> <span id="s101">And I don't know when she died.</span> <span id="s102">I think it was quite a while after we moved away from Grodno.</span> <span id="s103">And then my mother had a sister who was married and they lived in a small town in Northern Poland called Sue-vow-key (ph) and they had two children, a daughter and a son.</span> <span id="s104">And when the war began, you see they were in Northern Poland and as far as we know, when the Germans invaded they perished.</span> <span id="s105">We just lost contact with them completely.</span> <span id="s106">So I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s107">My mother's brother, the only brother, stayed in Russia and after the war immigrated to Israel.</span> <span id="s108">And he had two children and they still live in Israel.</span> <span id="s109">I visited them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Was you're mother's family intelligencia as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s112">Her brother and the cousin, actually it was the cousin, not her brother, they were both dentists.</span> <span id="s113">That's why my mother studied dentistry too.</span> <span id="s114">So they were all very well to do and very, very university graduates and so-called intelligencia.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Where did you're mother and you're father meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Where what?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Where did your mother and your father meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: I suppose they met in Moscow as far as I know.</span> <span id="s119">You know?</span> <span id="s120">It was a different kind of life at that time.</span> <span id="s121">The children just didn't participate very much in the parents' doings, so I don't really, I'm not sure how they met and whatever happened.</span> <span id="s122">I just know that when we lived in Krakow, when I was already about four or five-years old, we were very well to do.</span> <span id="s123">We went on vacation for two months to a resort like Klen-neet-sa (ph) was one of the resorts or ___________ and sometimes Marienbad and Germany and anyway, we lived like the rich people lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s126">I had, one sister died before I was born and I guess she had convulsions as far as I knew.</span> <span id="s127">Then about a year later, or two years later, I was born.</span> <span id="s128">And then I had a brother a year-and-a-half younger.</span> <span id="s129">And when I was sixteen years old my mother had another child, a little girl, Felicia.</span> <span id="s130">I have pictures of her too.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Your oldest sister's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Was Mila.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And you're younger brother's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: My younger brother's name was Sherman and we called him Cenia (ph), was Russian.</span> <span id="s135">But then later on, when we lived in Krakow, he was called Shermake (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: And you're family, was the household very religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: No.</span> <span id="s138">We were, it was the free thinkers of Russia.</span> <span id="s139">They were Jewish and they considered themselves Jewish, but we had a Passover Supper and I know my father went to the Synagogue for the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s140">And I think, I don't know whether it was also for Passover too or not, but we did have a Passover supper at home.</span> <span id="s141">And that was about, but they did go to the Synagogue on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s142">But we did go, my brother and I went to what was called the Sunday school where we were taught mainly the history of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s143">That's what the Sunday school consisted of.</span> <span id="s144">There was no praying but just learning the history of the religion and history of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s145">And then my brother went to a High School, to a Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s146">Because they opened a very good private school and I went to a private High School, with non-Jewish, this Polish private High School.</span> <span id="s147">And my brother went to a Hebrew High School.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: This was after you had moved to?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: To Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: So you're family came from Russia and were living in Poland.</span> <span id="s151">What language did they speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: At home?</span> <span id="s153">They spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s154">And I spoke Russian until the age of four or four and a half when we moved to Krakow.</span> <span id="s155">And then they hired a nanny, a German nanny.</span> <span id="s156">Not Jewish, German.</span> <span id="s157">And she taught me German.</span> <span id="s158">And then I went to school, it was a public school, where I learned Polish.</span> <span id="s159">So I was really trilingual by the time I was about seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Do you have any memories of Grodno in you're very early life?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s162">I have a little bit.</span> <span id="s163">Now I don't remember the wedding but I remember that we had a very nice apartment and, but I really don't remember too much.</span> <span id="s164">My earliest recollection is that we use to go to the beach and I think it was the beach on the river Nemen (ph) and I remember my mother dunking herself in the water and my brother was just crawling around and I found a bunch of keys in the sand.</span> <span id="s165">That's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Were you particularly close with either your mother or your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s168">You see, we were really, well we were brought up like rich children are brought up.</span> <span id="s169">You know?</span> <span id="s170">We had everything we needed, nice clothes, and we just lived a very happy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: What kind of activity did you do for fun?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: You mean when I was little?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Actually I don't remember what was Grodno, but when we came to Krakow, I had dancing classes.</span> <span id="s175">I had piano lessons.</span> <span id="s176">It was always a joke that after the third teacher my mother decided it wasn't the teacher's fault, so I gave up the piano lessons and I also gave up the singing lessons.</span> <span id="s177">Those were two things I could not do.</span> <span id="s178">But I continued with my dancing and acting.</span> <span id="s179">I liked to do that very much.</span> <span id="s180">And I even wrote a couple of plays that were performed in my school, my elementary school.</span> <span id="s181">And then I started serious studies in High School.</span> <span id="s182">It was a private High School.</span> <span id="s183">And I was going to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s184">So, never happened, but that were the plans.</span> <span id="s185">In spite of my loving to dance and, you know, I was performing through the dancing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So these weren't your plans, to become a doctor?</span> <span id="s187">Where they your parents plans for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s189">My parents.</span> <span id="s190">Even though they didn't think that a girl should be a doctor, they agreed to that.</span> <span id="s191">And they supported me very strongly in that.</span> <span id="s192">I almost gave up dancing by then, but they, which made them very happy because they were, they really didn't think that I should be a ballerina.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: Why didn't you become a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Because the war started.</span> <span id="s195">And I was in my second year of ___________, which was equivalent to the Junior College here and the schools were closed in December and there was also the time where the Universities were closed and the Professors were in Krakow, they were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s196">That's the first time we found out about the Auschwitz, at that time it was just a prison-like camp, and so anyway at that point I gave up my studies until I got back to the United States and in 1948 and 1949, 1949 I graduated from the University of Michigan and then for one year I went to, well it was actually a year and a half, to graduate school for medical technology.</span> <span id="s197">I married a doctor.</span> <span id="s198">That's as close as I got to medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: I'd like to go back a little bit and hear how it was that your family moved from Grodno to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Well I really don't know the business part of it but I think that there were more opportunities.</span> <span id="s201">I think that the family was growing and that might have been some kind of, maybe even disagreements, you know, as far as how the business should be run and I know that my father had the opportunity to purchase this tannery set-up in Krakow.</span> <span id="s202">And that's when we moved.</span> <span id="s203">And then his oldest brother decided to move too.</span> <span id="s204">They didn't have any children, he was married, but no children.</span> <span id="s205">And he decided to move also, but a few months after we moved to Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: What year was it that you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Now that was 1926.</span> <span id="s208">I think it was summer of '26.</span> <span id="s209">Because I remember there was some kind of a business inflation and there was something wrong with the Polish __________ at that time because our rent, we rented an apartment, the whole flat, and I know that the rent had to be paid in dollars.</span> <span id="s210">The dollar was good even then.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Did you live with your father's brothers and sisters or did they live elsewhere in Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No, in Krakow?</span> <span id="s213">No.</span> <span id="s214">My brother, I mean my father's brother and his wife had a separate apartment.</span> <span id="s215">Right around the corner from us.</span> <span id="s216">But much smaller than ours because they just didn't have a big family but we had a large apartment.</span> <span id="s217">It's still, we visited the people that own it just a year ago and they remodeled it.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Do you have any, I was interested in hearing whether you have memories of your father's family since they always seemed to be around during your childhood?</span> <span id="s219">Were you particularly close to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Well I know that they all worked together because I know there were long distance phone calls so I think that my father's tannery was sort of a, still connected somehow to the Northern part of Poland family.</span> <span id="s221">So I know that they were all working together.</span> <span id="s222">And my father's sister, that's the one with the, that eventually ended up in New York, he was mainly in the business part of this skin and hide business and they lived in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s223">And actually they decided to move, at first they moved to England and then to the United States.</span> <span id="s224">They decided to move.</span> <span id="s225">My cousin was about three years older than I am and he went to the University just before the war and was beat up by the university students who were very, very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s226">There was a quota and Jewish students and so there was everything, things were very hopeless.</span> <span id="s227">And that's where my Uncle decided that they will move.</span> <span id="s228">And that was still in 1938.</span> <span id="s229">And they moved to England and then they moved to the United States.</span> <span id="s230">That's how they were able to take all of their possessions with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: And in Krakow were there people who you were particularly close with in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s233">Our family was just the Uncle, that's this one over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Marella.</span> <span id="s236">And his wife's name was Ida or Eda.</span> <span id="s237">And we were very close but they didn't have children so they were treating us like their children, so this was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s238">And especially my, the Aunt loved to read to us when we were small.</span> <span id="s239">And so we were quite close.</span> <span id="s240">Then my father's youngest brother, David, and his wife Nina, here on the picture, and they were divorced.</span> <span id="s241">And he remarried and they were deported by the Russians to Siberia.</span> <span id="s242">And at that, the first year of war, my Uncle was in New York procurer of Honduras passports for everybody.</span> <span id="s243">And my cousin was fourteen.</span> <span id="s244">And he lived with some Uncle or somebody in Vilna at that time and he just took the passports and went to Russia.</span> <span id="s245">He traveled through the entire Russia all the way to Siberia where he found his father with the wife and the stepsister.</span> <span id="s246">And they all had typhus.</span> <span id="s247">Now the two women recovered but my Uncle died.</span> <span id="s248">And Steve didn’t want to stay there of course, by then he was fifteen or so, but his stepmother was afraid to leave.</span> <span id="s249">And he gave them the passports and left.</span> <span id="s250">They survived and, but he went via Tehran to Israel.</span> <span id="s251">And so he spent the rest of the war in Israel and then now he lives in Paris.</span> <span id="s252">He is married and has a son.</span> <span id="s253">So that's another part of the family that survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Did any of your mother's family . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: As far as my mother's family, the only one that I know is my cousin who is married and has two children and they live in Israel.</span> <span id="s256">I mean, after the war, they spent the war in Russia and they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s257">But my mother's sister and her husband and two children, who lived in Poland, perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Were they in Poland near you when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, they were, yes, not during the war.</span> <span id="s260">I mean, they were in Poland, in the northern part of Poland, in Sue-bow-key (ph), which was closer to Grodno.</span> <span id="s261">Also the youngest brother of my father, his wife, that's the one from the wedding, and they had one daughter.</span> <span id="s262">They were in Grodno and they perished.</span> <span id="s263">There were a whole bunch of cousins of my father's that I didn't really know very well and I don't think that any of them survived.</span> <span id="s264">At least the ones that were in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: As a child did you play with your brother a lot or did you have other playmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Well actually, as long as we had the nanny, which was from about the age of ten or so, we played together and we were sort of living in a secluded kind of an environment.</span> <span id="s267">We were supervised very much and we were not allowed to just roam around on the streets and all the activities were very much supervised.</span> <span id="s268">But then I had a friend who's mother was partially paralyzed and her name was Irene Gottlieb (ph) and they lived very close to us so my mother sort of took over and the girl always went on different excursions with us and she was the only child and her father was in some kind of a business, movie house or something like that, and so he didn't have very much time.</span> <span id="s269">And the mother couldn't get around very much so Irene was my best friend.</span> <span id="s270">Irene survived the war but died young because she had a heart condition.</span> <span id="s271">And she married a Polish, and also when the war started her mother was dead already.</span> <span id="s272">And the father bought Polish papers for himself and the girl and her name became Irena Ravitch instead of Irena Gottlieb and so she was sort of in Polish side in hiding.</span> <span id="s273">She married a Polish man, they had a Catholic wedding.</span> <span id="s274">He didn't know she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s275">And they had one daughter, who until last year did not know anything about it.</span> <span id="s276">But my daughter met her.</span> <span id="s277">They corresponded for years and my daughter met her and Vanda wanted to know more about her mother and she suspected that there were some other things that she didn't know about but my daughter knew all about it and she told Vanda.</span> <span id="s278">Because last year, I say, "Why did you tell her?"</span> <span id="s279">and she didn't know anything and my daughter says, "Well, now she knows."</span> <span id="s280">And she was very grateful.</span> <span id="s281">And now she knows where she comes from.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">[End of Side A of Tape 1]</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: You were just telling me about the amazing story of you're friend's daughter.</span> <span id="s284">And you mentioned that you had a nanny at this time and that you, all the way up until you were ten years old, you had this nanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: At least ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did you and you're brother spend most of your days then with this nanny?</span> <span id="s287">Would you say that you spent more time with her than with you're parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s289">Well we had several nannies.</span> <span id="s290">There were different ones.</span> <span id="s291">I think _________ lasted about a couple of years or so.</span> <span id="s292">But also there were different stages.</span> <span id="s293">When we were little, we had a nanny that primarily taught us the language and nice behavior and all that and then when we were older, it was more or less a chaperone.</span> <span id="s294">I mean, she walked me to school and my parents were very, very protective of us.</span> <span id="s295">And then finally, I think after my tenth birthday I refused to have somebody walking me to school.</span> <span id="s296">It was not very far to walk because when we visited Krakow and took pictures it was just about a five-minute walk, but still, I was walked to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: You went to a secular school?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: No.</span> <span id="s299">It was a public school and an elementary school and while I was there, usually the system was that you went to school for four years and then you could go to High School.</span> <span id="s300">However, when I was in my fourth grade, instead of moving onto High School, they changed the system.</span> <span id="s301">More like the American, that you went to school through sixth grade and then you went to High School for four years.</span> <span id="s302">Before that the High School was six years.</span> <span id="s303">And so I stayed on because I wanted to stay with all my friends and I went to elementary school through sixth grade and then I went to a private High School for four years.</span> <span id="s304">And then to public ___________, which was as I said very equivalent to Junior College for two years.</span> <span id="s305">It was suppose to be for two years, however, it was only a year and a little bit less than a year and a half because in December the schools were closed.</span> <span id="s306">And the teachers tried to teach us privately but then the law was written that it was forbidden even to have any kind of education so the schools were closed and the teachers would not teach because they would have gone to jail.</span> <span id="s307">So we were just waiting.</span> <span id="s308">My education was interrupted for quite a few years until I got back to the University of Michigan.</span> <span id="s309">Well, actually I went to a High School in New York after the war and they mainly taught, just learned English and the American History because I needed that for my citizenship.</span> <span id="s310">And in High School I studied English 10, 11 and 12 and in English 10 we read what every woman knows and in English 11 Hamlet and in English 12 MacBeth.</span> <span id="s311">And you can just image the language that I spoke when I got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: In what language did you read those?</span> <span id="s313">Were you reading them in English?</span> <span id="s314">You're talking about when you were in High School?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: In High School I read it in English.</span> <span id="s316">That was in New York already.</span> <span id="s317">So that was about, the English wasn't quite the English that was spoken.</span> <span id="s318">Strange, but I learned awfully fast that it wasn't really the English I should use on the street.</span> <span id="s319">So I got a diploma and I was accepted to Hunter College but instead I got a job in Dallas, Texas, as a Medical Technologist.</span> <span id="s320">Well, actually as a Lab Assistant.</span> <span id="s321">And I lived there.</span> <span id="s322">And that's where I met my husband, my first, I mean my second husband who is a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I'd like to talk more in detail about that, but it seems a good point to ask, how it was that you became interested in medicine and what it was that made you?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Oh, they say I was interested in, my mother was studying Dentistry.</span> <span id="s325">I don't think she ever finished, but as I say her whole family was or had something to do with Dentistry.</span> <span id="s326">And I was always very much interested in science.</span> <span id="s327">Even though I was very interested in acting and dancing, I also was a very good student in science and that's what, medicine was very interesting to me.</span> <span id="s328">So the closest I got to medicine was to marry a doctor and get a degree in Medical Technology.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: And you said that you wrote plays.</span> <span id="s330">What were the plays you wrote about?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Oh yes, well, this one play, that was still in High School and all that.</span> <span id="s332">One was in elementary school.</span> <span id="s333">Oh it was, you know, plays that a little girl that was very mean and then she got very nice again after she saw whatever.</span> <span id="s334">I don't really remember what happened but I know that they were very, very serious plays.</span> <span id="s335">And I remember that there was a performance, oh and I played the lead in the play too, and then I got a standing ovation and people were calling for the author.</span> <span id="s336">That I remember!</span> <span id="s337">And I remember I had a pink dress with a big bow in the back, it was organdy.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Would you say you were very serious?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: I was very serious and I was very talented.</span> <span id="s340">At least that's what I was told.</span> <span id="s341">Or I believed.</span> <span id="s342">I still do.</span> <span id="s343">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: So do you remember from these early years any incidents of anti-Semitism?</span> <span id="s345">Did you experience anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s347">I know I was different.</span> <span id="s348">I know I didn't, all the little girls were studying to go to the First Communion and they believed that if you die, right after you're Communion you go straight to Heaven.</span> <span id="s349">And I wasn't going to go straight to Heaven because I wasn't going to study for the First Communion.</span> <span id="s350">And then tuberculosis was very prevalent in Poland.</span> <span id="s351">And my best friend's sister died of tuberculosis at the age of ten, I guess, right after her Communion.</span> <span id="s352">And she was buried in her white dress with the veil in a white coffin.</span> <span id="s353">And we saw her in the coffin and everybody was crying.</span> <span id="s354">But then we were told not to cry because she was going straight to Heaven.</span> <span id="s355">And then my friend died too.</span> <span id="s356">Also of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s357">And I was very unhappy because I did not go to the Communion and I did not deserve to be in Heaven.</span> <span id="s358">And then the, most of my friends that I socialized with, they knew I was Jewish but they did not, really they did not make any nasty remarks.</span> <span id="s359">But once in a while there might have been boys on the street that would, you know, just tease.</span> <span id="s360">Like they tease the girls and then they would call me Jewish because my hair was curly.</span> <span id="s361">Most of the kids, my hair was reddish-brown or reddish-blonde and curly, and most of the kids, their hair was straight and blonde.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So just because you're hair was curly, they thought that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: And my eyes were dark.</span> <span id="s364">And I just looked a little different than the Polish girls with blue eyes and straight, blonde hair.</span> <span id="s365">Even my mother had blonde hair, but her hair was wavy and she had blue eyes.</span> <span id="s366">So, I wasn't exposed too much to anti-Semitism as let's say people who lived in the Jewish section of town.</span> <span id="s367">And my brother, who is in the Hebrew school was in the Jewish section of town so he was, not beat up, but you know, sort of roughed up a little bit on the way home and very often he didn't want to go to school but my father insisted that he goes to the Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Did you have any idea of what it meant to be Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes, because as I said, I went to Sunday school so we studied the history, mainly history, and some of the religious observances.</span> <span id="s370">But at the same time, I was the only, no, I and Irene, we were the only two Jewish girls in my elementary school.</span> <span id="s371">So, and there were religious instructions in school.</span> <span id="s372">So we would go to those classes because what else could we do?</span> <span id="s373">They were part of the curriculum.</span> <span id="s374">So we would go to the classes, so I knew all about the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s375">It was very interesting too.</span> <span id="s376">So, you know, I liked to study just anything that I didn't, wasn't familiar with.</span> <span id="s377">So I probably know as much about the Catholic religion as all the kids that were being prepared for their First Communion.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Did you have any other Jewish friends besides Irene?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s380">Yes, after I got to High School.</span> <span id="s381">Yes, I had Marella.</span> <span id="s382">Marella was another one who was very, very intelligent and very, very good student and I went to High School with her.</span> <span id="s383">And then there was another one, Lucia.</span> <span id="s384">That's right.</span> <span id="s385">She was also in my High School.</span> <span id="s386">So these were, I had about three Jewish girlfriends and I had an awful lot of non-Jewish girlfriends.</span> <span id="s387">And we really didn't make any distinction at that time.</span> <span id="s388">As far as I was concerned, that they were Jewish friends and these were non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s389">We were just really, I dressed just like the girls and I acted like them, except that, sometimes I even went to Church with them.</span> <span id="s390">I knew all the prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: How did you're parents feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: They didn't mind.</span> <span id="s393">They just, they really didn't mind.</span> <span id="s394">They had a lot of non-Jewish friends too.</span> <span id="s395">As a matter of fact, they had more non-Jewish friends than Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: So you lived in the non-Jewish section of town and will you tell me a little bit about the place where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s398">It was a very beautiful house in a very nice section of town.</span> <span id="s399">It was right next to a garden, nursery business, so it was always in flowers.</span> <span id="s400">The building belonged to Professor Boo-e-vid (ph) who was, had sort of a Pastor Institute right in the building.</span> <span id="s401">He was a student of Pastor.</span> <span id="s402">He was quite an older man.</span> <span id="s403">And he died in 1942 at the age of 80-something, I mean he was an older man.</span> <span id="s404">And they made vaccines for diphtheria and small pox and rabies.</span> <span id="s405">And the laboratory was right downstairs on the first floor.</span> <span id="s406">Now, Professor Boo-e-vid's (ph) apartment was the entire second floor and our apartment was on the third floor and then Dr. Boo-e-vid's (ph) daughter, who was a physician also working in the laboratory, was married to a lawyer and they had two sons.</span> <span id="s407">They, we moved in I think in 1926, and they moved and they had an apartment on the fourth floor.</span> <span id="s408">They moved in in 1928.</span> <span id="s409">And I was very friendly with the two sons.</span> <span id="s410">We walked to High School together because you had to walk quite a ways from the apartment.</span> <span id="s411">And the older son died last summer at the age of 80 and the younger one is still around and we visit them in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: What was the name of these sons?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Professor Boo-e-vid's (ph) daughter married a lawyer who's name was Way-geem-ish Mo-stof-ski (ph) and he, the son's was Ches-wef Mo-stof-ski (ph) was the younger son and Yes-g Mo-stof-ski (ph), who is a doctor, also he was a medical doctor, he was the older son and that's the one that died.</span> <span id="s414">Yes-g (ph) had a law degree and right now he doesn't practice law, he is a painter, fine arts painter.</span> <span id="s415">He paints pictures and has exhibits.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What was the apartment like?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Well I had a bedroom to myself.</span> <span id="s418">My parents had a bedroom and my brother had a, which was also my father's study, but it was my brother's bedroom.</span> <span id="s419">And then we had a, there were usually no living rooms, in Poland you had a dining room which served as the living room and family usually gathered around the dining table and this was just like sitting in a living room, you know, drinking tea from a _____________, which was a big, brass _______________, it was a silver _____________ for special teas.</span> <span id="s420">And we sat around.</span> <span id="s421">There was a big chandelier made out of _______ cloth, a lamp over the table, and this was one of the family gatherings.</span> <span id="s422">And when the guests came they were served tea and cookies and pastries in the dining room.</span> <span id="s423">We had a modern bathroom.</span> <span id="s424">As a matter of fact, we had a bathroom and a half.</span> <span id="s425">And we had fairly nice kitchen and a maid's room.</span> <span id="s426">So it was a rich people's apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Did you have company over often?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s429">My mother was a very popular, evidently among her friends, and she had _________ and we had a huge back stained piano, grand piano, and she performed.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: We haven't said much about what you're mother did.</span> <span id="s431">You said that she studied to be a dentist but then she . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: But actually, well you know, she got married and started to have children so, I know that she had a whole bunch of things for the dentist.</span> <span id="s433">Dental tools and false teeth and things like that and she let us play with it.</span> <span id="s434">That was one of the treats.</span> <span id="s435">Either with the collection of the buttons or the teeth.</span> <span id="s436">But actually she studied at the Moscow Conservatory and she was a performing pianist.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did she perform in Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I don't really know whether she performed, I think she performed mainly privately, you know, like they had ___________, musical ____________ or something like that, but she didn't perform as a performing artist, you know, for pay.</span> <span id="s439">My father didn't believe in my dancing as a performing artist, he didn't.</span> <span id="s440">But my mother played the piano all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Now when you were in High School, the German occupation began, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: No, I was in __________.</span> <span id="s443">I finished High School in 1938 and then in 1938-1939, I attended the ____________, in 1939-1940.</span> <span id="s444">In December, 1939 they closed it, so I had a year and a half there, which was, and mine was specializing in science, pre-med.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Do you remember the beginning of the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s447">I remember, first of all, we all belonged to something like R.O.T.C.</span> <span id="s448">We all had to have military training.</span> <span id="s449">And we had, my fiancée had to report and I remember we went into a, it was August, and we talked about war and mobilization.</span> <span id="s450">And he got called in, he was a year older than I so he was ahead in school, and he was called in to report to the, they got the uniform and a gun to shoot.</span> <span id="s451">And then I had to report and I also had a uniform and I had a gun.</span> <span id="s452">But I never had to really shoot it, anybody.</span> <span id="s453">But we did have military training because I'm still pretty good at the aim.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Was it mandatory?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: It was mandatory.</span> <span id="s456">Oh, there was one thing that anti-Semitism probably got to me.</span> <span id="s457">Was that we had scouts, girl scouts and boy scouts.</span> <span id="s458">And I couldn't join them.</span> <span id="s459">Because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s460">But I could join the military training.</span> <span id="s461">So that's what I joined.</span> <span id="s462">But I couldn't be a Girl Scout.</span> <span id="s463">And that probably bothered me the most because I really, and I was so surprised, you know, even after all these years, when I came to the States, to find out that my children were Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s464">And they were selling Girl Scout cookies.</span> <span id="s465">And I helped them.</span> <span id="s466">Because I could never do it.</span> <span id="s467">So anyway, when the war started, we knew that something was going to go on.</span> <span id="s468">And they had airplanes flying and whatnot.</span> <span id="s469">And then we woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s470">We heard explosions and we stood on the balcony and we saw the planes flying up and down and we couldn't really see it, all their maneuvers, and you would see that the higher planes are probably the enemy and the lower are our plans and they are just diving into each other.</span> <span id="s471">And then somebody said it was for real.</span> <span id="s472">Anyway, the German army destroyed most of the plans, Polish planes.</span> <span id="s473">I think in Krakow, the first day.</span> <span id="s474">Also, I think, they were instructed to preserve the city.</span> <span id="s475">And what they were bombing was mostly the military compounds, which were on the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s476">And then everything stopped and I think a week later the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s477">We could hear them marching at 8 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s478">In the meantime, people were leaving the city by whichever means they could.</span> <span id="s479">And the Mo-stof-ski (ph) family, they had a car, and motorcycles, and they left.</span> <span id="s480">But my father would not leave because my mother was not well and we had an infant child.</span> <span id="s481">So we decided to stay and see what happens.</span> <span id="s482">And then I know it was early in the morning when we could hear [stomping feet sounds], marching.</span> <span id="s483">We looked out through the window and there were the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s484">And then the occupation began.</span> <span id="s485">I know I wouldn't go out of the house for about five days.</span> <span id="s486">I was very depressed and I just, we had enough food because we were told to have food and we had a maid who brought sacks and sacks of potatoes and sugar and everybody said to stock up on potatoes and sugar and flour.</span> <span id="s487">I don't know what we were supposed to do with all those pounds of sugar, but we had a lot of sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: And all of your family was in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s490">So we all stayed in the house and we had enough food until things started, you know, we had the radio so we could listen to what was happening.</span> <span id="s491">I don't remember that the telephones were working or not, but I know that we could hear on the radio what was going on and that Germany invaded Poland and the occupation began.</span> <span id="s492">That Warsaw was still being under the siege.</span> <span id="s493">I mean, they were siege for at least three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Did you observe anything from your window, what was going on in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yes, that they were marching back and forth and, you see, we had the black out.</span> <span id="s496">So, but then we didn't have to have a black out anymore.</span> <span id="s497">But before September 1st, well actually for a whole week we had to keep the windows dark, but there were no bombings and things were pretty normal.</span> <span id="s498">Except that you couldn't buy anything in the store.</span> <span id="s499">Of vinegar.</span> <span id="s500">There was a lot of vinegar on the shelf because I don't think anybody needed vinegar.</span> <span id="s501">[Laughter]</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: I'd like to go back a little bit, about you had mentioned that you had to stop school at some point and then you were continuing private lessons in the home after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No.</span> <span id="s504">This was not private lessons just for me, but the teachers organized private schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: In December.</span> <span id="s509">When the schools closed in December and I think they tried to teach for another, maybe just a few weeks really.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: December of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: And then it was forbidden because they would have been arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And this was 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: That was December, 1939.</span> <span id="s514">And then starting in January, 1940.</span> <span id="s515">But I think by January we did not study anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So after that five days that you spent in the home, did you go back out to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Oh yes, we went out and I went, the first thing I went, I went was, you know.</span> <span id="s518">Well actually it was my fiancée that, __________, and that he came to visit and then we just went about our business.</span> <span id="s519">We went to the park and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s520">You see, this was probably the biggest tragedy.</span> <span id="s521">Why the Germans could just so easily subdue people.</span> <span id="s522">Because at first we were absolutely free to go where ever we wanted to and then a proclamation is that all the Jews have got to register.</span> <span id="s523">And then they have to wear the bands.</span> <span id="s524">And so everything was done in such a slow motion that you sort of got use to it.</span> <span id="s525">Oh, register?</span> <span id="s526">So we registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: We left off just at the beginning of the German occupation.</span> <span id="s530">And there was one thing that you mentioned which we didn't talk about a little bit.</span> <span id="s531">You said that you had a fiancée at the time and you said that you were considering yourselves to be engaged.</span> <span id="s532">What did you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Well you know, I met him just the Summer before and he was one of the boys, young men that was very popular and we started just going out, dating.</span> <span id="s534">And in those days you just held hands.</span> <span id="s535">That's all.</span> <span id="s536">And then we were talking that eventually maybe we will get married because we had a lot of things in common.</span> <span id="s537">And he introduced me to his family who liked me very much, but there was nothing about getting married really because nobody was getting married until they finished school and started to make a living.</span> <span id="s538">And so we were just beginning.</span> <span id="s539">We were going together steadily.</span> <span id="s540">And so that's the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: His name was Yannosh Fanyo (ph).</span> <span id="s543">He was Hungarian but everybody called him Yannick, which is Polish 'John'.</span> <span id="s544">And his family spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s545">They spoke a little bit Polish, a lot of German and English, but mainly Hungarian.</span> <span id="s546">And so at home he was called Yannosh or Yanchie, but I called him Yannick.</span> <span id="s547">And he played the violin very, very, well he played piano too but he was a very good violinist and his sister played the piano and his mother played too.</span> <span id="s548">And his father was in some kind of an import-export business, I don't know exactly what it was, but they were quite well-to-do and they had Hungarian passports and they lived in a very beautiful apartment, also in a very nice section of town, and they were very cultured people and they had musical ____________ too, which use to be a very popular past time in Poland.</span> <span id="s549">Especially during the war where the movies were closed, movie houses were closed, theaters were closed and there was really no place to go.</span> <span id="s550">Everything was taken over by the Germans.</span> <span id="s551">NightClubs were always very popular in Poland.</span> <span id="s552">There were a lot of them in Krakow.</span> <span id="s553">And cafes.</span> <span id="s554">They were all taken over by the Germans so there was really no place to go and nothing to do, so a lot of people entertained at home.</span> <span id="s555">And so, especially the Fanyo family was very musical and these were very, very pleasant things, times where they had the ____________.</span> <span id="s556">So that's how the story went.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Did he spend any time at your home with your family as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s559">He would come to our house and stay for dinner and my parents liked him very much.</span> <span id="s560">And he was a very, very pleasant fellow to be around.</span> <span id="s561">And also we entertained some friends until things started to get pretty bad.</span> <span id="s562">I mean as far as the Germans were concerned.</span> <span id="s563">And the family still lived quite well because they, as Hungarian citizens, and at that time Hungary was sort of partners with Germany, they could purchase food and necessities in the so-called volk-doych (ph) stores, which were off limits for the Polish people and definitely off-limits for the Jews.</span> <span id="s564">But people of German descent could register themselves as volk-doych (ph) and they could participate in purchases in those special stores.</span> <span id="s565">Which were full of food and anything you wanted, really.</span> <span id="s566">So the Fanyo's (ph) lived quite well and I enjoyed being with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: The swimming pool.</span> <span id="s569">This was another past time that we had in the summer.</span> <span id="s570">Starting when school was out in June, we all would gather in a public swimming pool.</span> <span id="s571">It was a huge, huge pool and that's where we would spend days.</span> <span id="s572">That was the past time.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Do you remember feeling afraid during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: No.</span> <span id="s575">At the beginning, now I felt very uneasy about the Germans and about the whole situation.</span> <span id="s576">But we were, at the beginning, we were very free to do whatever we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s577">I don't remember exactly when they started registering, but it was right at the beginning, that Jews had to register and then I think that we didn't have to start wearing the white, in Krakow you wore the white arm bands with the blue star of David, and everything, the Germans had a system.</span> <span id="s578">You see they didn't just file everything, all the bad things all at once.</span> <span id="s579">It was very, very gradual so you somehow seemed to get use to it.</span> <span id="s580">And at first it was registering, then it was the armbands, then you couldn't ride in the front of the streetcar, then you couldn't ride the streetcar at all.</span> <span id="s581">You couldn't go into the park.</span> <span id="s582">You couldn't do a lot of things but it was all so gradual that you almost didn't realize that that was happening.</span> <span id="s583">And then they started talk about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s584">That all the Jews will have to live in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s585">But that didn’t happen until really 1941.</span> <span id="s586">And so a whole year went by where we moved around and things were quite, you may say even safe.</span> <span id="s587">And my parents were getting ready to go to ghetto and I said that I did not want to go to ghetto because, I just felt, that's when I really started to get afraid.</span> <span id="s588">And I remember I even said something that, what would happen if they would just close the ghetto one beautiful day and set fire to it.</span> <span id="s589">And everybody thought I was just being ridiculous.</span> <span id="s590">I mean, nobody would do a thing like that.</span> <span id="s591">Why would they do it?</span> <span id="s592">I said, I don't know.</span> <span id="s593">We read about Christalnaught (ph).</span> <span id="s594">We read about things that happened in Germany and why wouldn't they happen here?</span> <span id="s595">Everybody thought I was just ridiculous and exaggerating.</span> <span id="s596">And the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) made arrangements to take over the tannery.</span> <span id="s597">And have my father, my Uncle and my brother work there as essential to running the tannery so they would be safe and, at that time, we still lived in our apartment.</span> <span id="s598">And since they couldn't conveniently go by street car, the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) had a horse and buggy right in their back yard instead of in the garage.</span> <span id="s599">And there was a stable in the back and they would transport my father and my brother and my Uncle to the factory, which was quite a ways away.</span> <span id="s600">It was at the other end of the town.</span> <span id="s601">And so everything seemed to be going quite well and the business was good.</span> <span id="s602">Mr. Mo-stof-ski (ph) was running it and he was a lawyer, he knew all kinds of angles as far as business was concerned, and they gave my father and my Uncle money to live on.</span> <span id="s603">And plenty.</span> <span id="s604">Then the Germans started invading people's apartments and homes and they simply taking whatever they wanted to take.</span> <span id="s605">They came one evening to our house and they tagged furniture and they tagged the ___________, which was our most precious possession, and several other things, and that's when my father started to get a little bit concerned, not scared.</span> <span id="s606">And then again the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) came to the rescue.</span> <span id="s607">Oh, the Jews were forbidden to own any furs, fur coats, and being in the leather business, of course, my mother had not one but several fur coats, and the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) took those.</span> <span id="s608">And we had some very beautiful furniture, especially my parent's bedroom set was mahogany and some very exotic woods.</span> <span id="s609">There were large wardrobes and dressers, so they took that.</span> <span id="s610">And several other things.</span> <span id="s611">And also jewelry.</span> <span id="s612">So things were still not bad.</span> <span id="s613">But then when the talk about ghetto was closer and closer, I just said, "I will not go to ghetto".</span> <span id="s614">And that's when a friend of ours suggested that Yannosh and I get married.</span> <span id="s615">And this way I would be a Hungarian citizen, I would be on his passport.</span> <span id="s616">I didn't have to go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s617">And my parents were sort of opposing to it.</span> <span id="s618">They thought I was way too young to get married.</span> <span id="s619">I was only nineteen, but I had just turned nineteen that January, 1941.</span> <span id="s620">And they, but they agreed.</span> <span id="s621">And as a matter of fact, my mother gave me her wedding band and my father gave Yannosh his wedding band.</span> <span id="s622">So that we could have wedding bands for getting married and we did get married by some Rabbi.</span> <span id="s623">It was a very short ceremony.</span> <span id="s624">My mother was too ill, as I mentioned before, she was sick after the birth of my sister.</span> <span id="s625">And so she was not witnessing, but my father went and my brother and Yannosh and I and we had a very brief ceremony.</span> <span id="s626">But we were married legally and I moved into his parent's house, or apartment.</span> <span id="s627">And then I went to visit my, by then my mother and father and Uncle and Aunt and my brother and my sister moved to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s628">They had a fairly large apartment, which they shared, but not for very long because they put more and more people into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s629">They also brought people from other towns and they had to, they were allowed only one bedroom.</span> <span id="s630">And then my Uncle and my Aunt had another very small bedroom, but my father, my sister, my brother, they all were in one bedroom.</span> <span id="s631">And then they all shared the kitchen and one bathroom.</span> <span id="s632">So it wasn't exactly the luxury we lived in but still my father was working and they had enough food because he could, he went to work every day and he brought back food and there were no really preserves and refrigerators as such at that time.</span> <span id="s633">In Poland they were in very bad __________.</span> <span id="s634">You went shopping everyday for food and so he brought fresh food everyday.</span> <span id="s635">And my mother was able to, with the help of my Aunt, to run the household up to a point.</span> <span id="s636">So things weren't really bad.</span> <span id="s637">And I went and visited them practically every day.</span> <span id="s638">Because I was free to go whereever I wanted.</span> <span id="s639">I didn't have to wear the band.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Why not?</span> <span id="s641">Why didn't you have to wear the band?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Because I was a Hungarian citizen.</span> <span id="s643">At least I thought I was.</span> <span id="s644">There was something scribbled in his passport, I didn't have a passport of my own.</span> <span id="s645">But we went to some office and they scribbled my name on the passport.</span> <span id="s646">Evidently it was still a German consul, but he couldn't issue me a passport, but he put my name on my husband's passport, so I was, at least I considered myself safe.</span> <span id="s647">Until one beautiful day, there was what is called _____________, which means 'to catch'.</span> <span id="s648">There was a catching business going on.</span> <span id="s649">The German police would stop every streetcar and let all the people out and check their identification.</span> <span id="s650">And that was the first time that I got a taste of what could happen.</span> <span id="s651">Because I did not have an identification.</span> <span id="s652">I told them my husband has the identification.</span> <span id="s653">I got a slap over my face to shut up.</span> <span id="s654">And I was put on a truck with another girl and there were several other people on it.</span> <span id="s655">And we were taken to the Gestapo office.</span> <span id="s656">And I don't remember the address exactly, but I know it was the main Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s657">And the girl that was with me was Jewish too and she had no identification at all.</span> <span id="s658">And she was crying and wailing and she said, "they are going to kill us."</span> <span id="s659">And I said, "Oh, don't be ridiculous."</span> <span id="s660">I mean, I just gave them my husband's phone number.</span> <span id="s661">They still were allowed to have a phone, the Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s662">So they will get in touch with him and everything will be all right.</span> <span id="s663">And what I didn't know about the girl, evidently she was outside the ghetto without papers, hiding.</span> <span id="s664">And she was waiting for some false papers to be given to her.</span> <span id="s665">But at that point she didn't have them.</span> <span id="s666">Well anyway, the Gestapo were quite mean to her.</span> <span id="s667">They were all uniformed and they were quite mean to us.</span> <span id="s668">They were shouting and then asking questions and I kept on insisting that I was a Hungarian citizen and they should get in touch with my husband and let me go.</span> <span id="s669">And I remember they put us against the wall, facing the wall.</span> <span id="s670">And it was a little creepy because the girl started to cry and she started to point at the spots on the wall and she says, "That looks like blood and they are going to shoot us, and I know they will shoot us".</span> <span id="s671">And they did have guns.</span> <span id="s672">And, but that was the first time when I faced that maybe they will shoot me.</span> <span id="s673">And it's a very funny feeling.</span> <span id="s674">You know?</span> <span id="s675">You are completely helpless.</span> <span id="s676">You cannot do anything.</span> <span id="s677">And you just stand there.</span> <span id="s678">And you feel kind of a creepy feeling on the back of, between you're shoulders, and you wonder, are they going to shoot between the shoulders or are they going to shoot you in the head?</span> <span id="s679">And I think I got a little bit sick to my stomach but I didn't cry.</span> <span id="s680">I just was waiting.</span> <span id="s681">And then one of the guys walked up to us and just turned us around by the shoulders and started to ask more questions.</span> <span id="s682">And they took the girl away, but they were asking me more questions and more questions, and they wanted to know where my parents were and why I was there and what was I doing?</span> <span id="s683">And I don't exactly remember all the answers I gave them, but I know that I insisted that they call my husband.</span> <span id="s684">And finally they brought some woman who took me to a, I guess a kind of a mass prison for other women that they were catching or who ever they were, and we just slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s685">There was a bucket in the corner.</span> <span id="s686">And no sanitary facilities of any kind except the bucket.</span> <span id="s687">And I didn't like it, but I decided I am going to just sit and wait.</span> <span id="s688">And the next morning, I didn't get anything to eat, the next morning they gave us some coffee and some bread and anyway, I stayed there for about two days.</span> <span id="s689">And low and behold, my husband came to get me and they let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did they know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s692">But they let me go because I was a Hungarian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Were you registered?</span> <span id="s694">Did you go to register when it was required?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No.</span> <span id="s696">I didn't register because, you see, I was not going to go to ghetto.</span> <span id="s697">So I didn't have the, it was called the chem-card (ph).</span> <span id="s698">So I wasn't registered Jewish because that's when you had to register, when you went to ghetto and I did not register because I wasn't going to go there.</span> <span id="s699">But anybody who couldn't prove they are either Polish identity or German identity was Jewish.</span> <span id="s700">Or had something to hide.</span> <span id="s701">So they let me go and we still were in the apartment at that time.</span> <span id="s702">And that was the end of my going out.</span> <span id="s703">Because I just would not go out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: That was about the beginning of 1941.</span> <span id="s706">It was spring of 1941 because I know I still had my nice, winter coat with the sable fur no less.</span> <span id="s707">My mother had sables that she brought from Russia and she finally, one day, it was still before the war, she decided that I can have a coat trimmed with these sables.</span> <span id="s708">And I had a big muff and a fur collar and a hat.</span> <span id="s709">And I have a picture of that someplace, in a family album.</span> <span id="s710">So anyway, I stayed home.</span> <span id="s711">I would not leave.</span> <span id="s712">But then things happened to the Hungarians too.</span> <span id="s713">And we were evicted from the fancy apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: This was in 1941 also?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No that was already in 1942, I believe.</span> <span id="s716">Because that was after Hungary, no, I really don't remember exactly the dates, but I know that it was, in 1942 we lived in an apartment near the barber, near the castle.</span> <span id="s717">And then they decided to tear this down, tear the building down because they were going to build something else there.</span> <span id="s718">And we found an apartment near the ghetto in the basement.</span> <span id="s719">And my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law made a living by teaching English in secret.</span> <span id="s720">And that's where these friends of mine came into picture.</span> <span id="s721">I wrote the whole story about them to, how they were helping us throughout it.</span> <span id="s722">They were helping us with the apartments and with other things because it was one of my school friends and her mother.</span> <span id="s723">The mother had a small jewelry store and perfume store and she had all kinds of connections.</span> <span id="s724">And, but this is a story for itself and I have about fourteen pages written up for the _________ ______ _______ about it.</span> <span id="s725">And she was very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s726">My mother-in-law had quite a bit of jewelry, which Mrs. ____________ was her name, would sell it for us for a good price.</span> <span id="s727">And she was very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s728">And then finally, she also permitted my sister-in-law and my mother-in-law to use their apartment for classes, for the English lessons.</span> <span id="s729">Because this was the only means of support we had at that time.</span> <span id="s730">My husband was working in a German furniture store but after a while he lost that job and so he wasn't working anymore.</span> <span id="s731">Then we moved, when the ghetto was being enlarged and the apartment in the basement where we lived was going to be enclosed in the ghetto, we had to move.</span> <span id="s732">And we moved to a village called Why-give-neek-ee (ph), which was a suburb of Krakow.</span> <span id="s733">And we rented a house out in the country from a man called Borcha Hur-oog (ph), to this day I remember, and it was a Krakow-ofska 493, or something like that address and I tried to find it.</span> <span id="s734">And Why-give-neek-ee (ph) is a big city now.</span> <span id="s735">At that time it was a country-kind of a small house with no indoor plumbing and the water was from the well, you had to put a bucket down and then crack up a bucket and bring the water up.</span> <span id="s736">And it was an outhouse in the yard.</span> <span id="s737">Also another thing that happened in the meantime is that my father-in-law had a stroke and he had a heart condition and he was partially paralyzed.</span> <span id="s738">He was in a bad shape.</span> <span id="s739">But slowly he recovered somewhat that he was able to walk around but one arm was paralyzed and his speech was slightly slurred, so he stayed home most of the time with me and the grandmother while the sister, my husband's sister and his mother went to town to give English lessons.</span> <span id="s740">So that was my country living.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: So tell me again, how many people you were living with in you're husband's house?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: There were six of us, including me.</span> <span id="s743">There was the grandmother, the father, the mother, the sister, my husband and I.</span> <span id="s744">There were six of us.</span> <span id="s745">And we had a kitchen and a bedroom.</span> <span id="s746">And the grandmother, the father and mother slept in the bedroom and this is their, my husband and I slept in the kitchen on sort of a rolled out mattress.</span> <span id="s747">During the day we rolled it up and put it aside and at night you unrolled it.</span> <span id="s748">Sort of an old-day futon.</span> <span id="s749">And it was very primitive type of living.</span> <span id="s750">And we lived there until 1944, April of 1944.</span> <span id="s751">When Germany invaded Hungary, they were not alias anymore, they were conquered country and that's when the Hungarian Jews started to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Okay, before we go into that, would you, when you lived in this country spot, in this smaller place in the suburb of Krakow, did you continue to go to the ghetto to visit you're family?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s754">I continued.</span> <span id="s755">And not only that, but I took the streetcar.</span> <span id="s756">I did get some kind of a paper from the consulate at that time, some kind of an identification so then I started walking to town again and I was a little bit more free.</span> <span id="s757">I remember even, I baked cookies, which I would take to town and try to sell.</span> <span id="s758">I sold them most of the time, they were very good cookies.</span> <span id="s759">They were wartime cookies, they weren't really delicious but they were as good as you could get them at that time, so I was in cookie business for a while.</span> <span id="s760">And also, by then, in 1943 the ghetto was closed.</span> <span id="s761">By that time, it was liquidated.</span> <span id="s762">By that time my father was gone, my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s763">And my brother was in Poroshkov, in the camp, labor camp.</span> <span id="s764">And Ches-waf (ph) was giving him the money in food and also giving me some.</span> <span id="s765">So he was supporting us quite generously.</span> <span id="s766">Because they were still running the factory.</span> <span id="s767">But that was after March, 1943.</span> <span id="s768">Still April, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So when did you're father, when was you're father deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: My father was deported with the first transport from Krakow, which was, as far as I remember, it was first few days in June when they rounded them up.</span> <span id="s771">I think June 3rd or June 5th, I think June 5th is when the train left and June 3rd, Wednesday, June 3rd was when I was standing and discussing all with my husband, waiting for the people to leave the ghetto and be marched to the train station.</span> <span id="s772">And when we were in Krakow, the first time, I was telling Robert, describing it, and we were looking for it and we couldn't find it until . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s773">[End of Side A of Tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: And could you just start at the beginning with that story again?</span> <span id="s775">You and you're husband went back to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Robert, this husband.</span> <span id="s777">Because that's already a third husband.</span> <span id="s778">Okay.</span> <span id="s779">Anyway, Robert and I went back to Poland and we went to the ___________ for the ____________, which was, the __________, a drug store which was in the ghetto, and right now it is a museum.</span> <span id="s780">And Mrs. Swaveka Karlingska (ph) is one of the, was one of the, I don't know if she still is there, people that ran the museum, and she told us that the people from ghetto.</span> <span id="s781">You see, I only thought that they went to the main train station but she told us exactly where they went and so we traced that road and we found the grassy knoll and I told Robert that there was a little religious statue on it and we found it.</span> <span id="s782">Because I remember standing right next to it when the people from ghetto in rows of four started coming out and very slowly they were marched with the SS men and the dogs and the whole business.</span> <span id="s783">Right through the streets.</span> <span id="s784">And I did see my father.</span> <span id="s785">And after that, I think I started to cry and my husband grabbed me.</span> <span id="s786">Because there were a lot of people, Polish people standing there and jeering really, and "Getting rid of the Jews", and so on.</span> <span id="s787">And I know he was afraid that somebody will notice that I am crying so he grabbed me and led me out of there, against my better judgment, but anyway, I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: You knew about the deportation before it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Well we were told that they are going, that some of the people have to deport and have to report at this particular office.</span> <span id="s790">And that they will be resettled to a, to some factory.</span> <span id="s791">And they wanted people who were trained in certain jobs.</span> <span id="s792">And Mr. Mo-stof-ski (ph), _____________ father, was trying to get my father out of that registration because he said that he needed him to run the factory.</span> <span id="s793">But they said that he had my Uncle to do it so he didn't need my father.</span> <span id="s794">You see, my father was really just in his fifties but he had white hair and so he looked probably much older than he really was.</span> <span id="s795">And Mo-stof-ski (ph) couldn't do anything to get him out of that.</span> <span id="s796">So I knew that they are going to be deported but I wasn't sure whether my father was rescued or not.</span> <span id="s797">Mo-stof-ski (ph) didn't know either.</span> <span id="s798">So that's why I went to the knoll, to see who was really going, and I saw some friends of mine and another girl that I went to school with and her father and her sister.</span> <span id="s799">But they were very heavily guarded and one could not do anything.</span> <span id="s800">And my father, I remember him standing there with a small suitcase and he had this mannerism of scratching his head when things weren't so, I remember him scratching his head.</span> <span id="s801">And then my husband took me away from there.</span> <span id="s802">And then, you see, I could go to the ghetto by just showing that piece of paper that I had from the government.</span> <span id="s803">And so I went to the ghetto the next morning because they kept the ghetto closed that day, but the next morning they again let the workers go out and people come in.</span> <span id="s804">So I went to visit and my mother, of course, was very, very upset.</span> <span id="s805">But she said that she was hoping that everything will be all right.</span> <span id="s806">They promised that they will be put to work and then maybe even she will be able to join him later on.</span> <span id="s807">And it seems to me now, I don't quite remember whether it was my Uncle or whether it was my father, but she got a post card from somewhere, that the transport arrived and that everybody was all right.</span> <span id="s808">And then there is a crazy thing, my mother was superstitious or something, she believed in all kinds of signs and, if a bird knocked on the window it was a bad sign, and my father left her his watch, his pocket watch, and she said the glass cracked.</span> <span id="s809">I saw it.</span> <span id="s810">I saw the glass cracked.</span> <span id="s811">And she said he was dead.</span> <span id="s812">And I told her, "This is silly."</span> <span id="s813">Maybe somebody knocked the watch over and what not, and she said "No", it was by her bed table and all of a sudden the glass cracked.</span> <span id="s814">And I didn't believe that, I felt it was all crazy.</span> <span id="s815">And anyway, I would come to the ghetto and bring her the food and whatever else they needed and I went there practically every day.</span> <span id="s816">My brother was in _________ and I saw him and he could come out and visit too.</span> <span id="s817">And then he had a girlfriend on the outside, a Polish girl that use to work in the lab, the __________ laboratory.</span> <span id="s818">And then, when Mo-stof-ski (ph) took over the factory he transferred her to the factory and she was a secretary there and she was helping my brother.</span> <span id="s819">And one day, she told me that he was taken on a transport to Czestochowa, to some factory.</span> <span id="s820">And I never heard from him again.</span> <span id="s821">Though her brother, Da-new-chef (ph) was her name, her brother lived in Czestochowa, and he kept in touch with my brother.</span> <span id="s822">But when we went back to Poland, I tried to find out what, whether it was a camp or a factory, what happened to those people in Czestochowa and I just couldn't find it.</span> <span id="s823">Na-new-sha's (ph) brother died and I had her address and I wrote to her many times, but she's not a young woman anymore.</span> <span id="s824">And she may be dead for all I know.</span> <span id="s825">So she is the only one who really was in touch with my brother before I was arrested.</span> <span id="s826">So I have no idea what happened to him.</span> <span id="s827">And every year we go, I try to find her, I try to find anybody that would know about anybody from ____________ taken to Czestochowa, and I wasn't able to find anybody.</span> <span id="s828">So that's the story on that.</span> <span id="s829">And then we are coming closer to the march, thirteen's or whenever that was, that was 1943, which was the like liquidation of the Krakow ghetto.</span> <span id="s830">My mother was partially paralyzed too, I mean her arm was bad.</span> <span id="s831">But she still could get around.</span> <span id="s832">And my sister was five years old, she was born March 6th.</span> <span id="s833">And I was there for her birthday.</span> <span id="s834">I brought her chocolate and stuff, and some toys.</span> <span id="s835">And you could, the streetcar went from ________________, the place that I lived out in the country.</span> <span id="s836">It had to go through the ghetto.</span> <span id="s837">So I would cross the ghetto and then get out and go through the gate.</span> <span id="s838">And it took three days for the ghetto to be liquidated, but I made arrangements with Dan-o-sha (ph) to get my sister out.</span> <span id="s839">My mother didn't want to, but she was very realistic and she thought, yes, that I should take the girl.</span> <span id="s840">We had false papers for her and I brought Dan-o-sha (ph) the girl's clothes and I remember there was a little coverlet for her crib, she was five years old but she still had it, and we bribed the guard and I was suppose to go in and take her out.</span> <span id="s841">And the ghetto was closed.</span> <span id="s842">I could not get in.</span> <span id="s843">They still let the streetcar go through because that was the only way that people could get from one end of the town to the other.</span> <span id="s844">But the doors were closed.</span> <span id="s845">The SS men were hanging on the cars to make sure that nobody even opened the window or anything and let people go there.</span> <span id="s846">I don't know how many times I went back and forth the first day.</span> <span id="s847">And there was no way I can get the child out.</span> <span id="s848">And that was it.</span> <span id="s849">And then, you probably saw enough of the photographs and pictures, from Schindler's film and from this and that, and you know what it looked like.</span> <span id="s850">It looked probably much worse than anything you saw in the movies.</span> <span id="s851">And so, I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s852">I know some people were taken on transport to Prostejov but these were young people who could be still working.</span> <span id="s853">Then most people were killed right in the ghetto, but then they said that there were several transports of women and children taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s854">And I could not find, I was in Auschwitz and I tried to find out whether there were transports that came.</span> <span id="s855">There was another crazy story, that there was one truck with the children and women that broke down and didn't come with the main transport.</span> <span id="s856">And that the people on that truck were put in the camp and not killed right away.</span> <span id="s857">And I had this imagination that my mother and sister were on that truck.</span> <span id="s858">But even then, my mother was crippled really and I know she couldn't possibly survive.</span> <span id="s859">And my little sister, every time we go to Auschwitz, I watch the movie that they show and there is one little girl with these big eyes, showing her number on her arm, and I always think maybe it was my sister.</span> <span id="s860">Sorry.</span> <span id="s861">And Ches-wap (ph) gave me pictures of my sister when she was about three years old.</span> <span id="s862">My father, Ches-wap (ph) was an amateur photographer too and he's the one who, my father asked whether he could make pictures of my sister and a couple of years ago when we were visiting, he said I have something for you.</span> <span id="s863">And yet I didn't bring the large one, but I just brought these small ones.</span> <span id="s864">And I had this fantasy that, they say that you can take photographs and make computer pictures to see what a child would look at an older age, and I always have the fantasy that maybe I could have that done, but it's just crazy.</span> <span id="s865">Even if I find out that the little girl, or some other little girl in the picture was a survivor, how am I going to find my sister?</span> <span id="s866">So, one thing that I knew, that she had a mole on her left shoulder.</span> <span id="s867">And several years ago there was a story of a Israeli actress.</span> <span id="s868">She was exactly the same age as my sister would have been.</span> <span id="s869">And she was in Auschwitz as a little child and she survived.</span> <span id="s870">And I was going to write to her but I thought she would think it was some crank, you know, writing her.</span> <span id="s871">And I was going to write to her to ask her whether she has a mole on her left shoulder.</span> <span id="s872">But you know, you live with these things, and, oh, stop, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">[Pause here while interviewee is overwhelmed with emotion]</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s875">You were just telling me about the liquidation of the ghetto, the Krakow ghetto.</span> <span id="s876">It was in 1943, and you were talking a little bit before that about your father and that your mother had this bad experience of . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: A premonition.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: A premonition.</span> <span id="s879">Did you ever hear anything about your father again?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No.</span> <span id="s881">Not until we got to the ___________ or when the museum in the former ghetto, in Krakow.</span> <span id="s882">And we found the chronology of the bands, that people were transported from, with the first transport from Krakow, that they were transported to Belzec and then she pulled out, Mrs. Kar-ling-ska (ph) pulled out the book and said, this is what happened in Belzec.</span> <span id="s883">And that was the first time I found out what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s884">And then the next transport was in October, I believe, and my Uncle and his wife went on that transport.</span> <span id="s885">So, and that was the first time I found out that there was such places, at Belzec.</span> <span id="s886">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s887">After all these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: You thought that you're father might still be alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: No.</span> <span id="s890">Not according to the description of the book, in the book.</span> <span id="s891">I mean, I know, well, the book that we got, there was one survivor that escaped and no body else.</span> <span id="s892">And I know that there is, well first of all, my father would be 100 years old, so that wouldn't be possible, of course, but I know that he did not, nobody survived from that transport.</span> <span id="s893">So, at least I may say I felt a little bit better knowing exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s894">Because I think not knowing is probably the worst part of it.</span> <span id="s895">And it is a little bit late for me to start searching because, even if my brother survived, he would be 72 years old.</span> <span id="s896">And how many people do you know that lived to be 72 years old?</span> <span id="s897">I don't know too many.</span> <span id="s898">So it is kind of little late to start really searching.</span> <span id="s899">But I still somehow believe that maybe my little sister survived.</span> <span id="s900">Maybe I should have looked for her.</span> <span id="s901">When we go back, we can look.</span> <span id="s902">I know she was not in Bergen-Belsen, but maybe she was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s903">And maybe she was in Bergen, no, they didn't have children in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s904">Because when they liquidated Auschwitz, they were transporting everybody, just the grown-ups.</span> <span id="s905">And I don't know how those children did that in the movie, survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: What did you do with your days, now that you were spending so much time in the house?</span> <span id="s907">Did you go out at all after the ghetto was liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, I didn't go out at all.</span> <span id="s909">I was really afraid.</span> <span id="s910">And I was very depressed.</span> <span id="s911">And I had a garden and I grew vegetables and flowers and I remember it was just lots of sweet peas, and I still love gardening to this day but I spend a lot of time gardening.</span> <span id="s912">It was spring when the ghetto was liquidated and then I, I did a lot of meditating and thinking about things.</span> <span id="s913">And also this friend of mine that I mentioned, Irene, came to visit me several times with her husband.</span> <span id="s914">And they were in business smuggling vodka.</span> <span id="s915">What they were doing is, it was something more than illegal, but this was their business.</span> <span id="s916">They would bring Absolute alcohol and bottle it and they had the whole paraphernalia, you know, to seal the bottles and put the labels on and what-not, and there was a eating place in Wa-give-neek-a (ph), the only one at that time, a drinking place, and that's where they were selling the vodka.</span> <span id="s917">And their headquarters were at my place.</span> <span id="s918">They would sleep in the basement and bottle the vodka for three days and then go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s919">They lived in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s920">And they use to bring another friend of theirs with them.</span> <span id="s921">And he was studying to be a doctor but he couldn't do it because all the medical schools were closed, but he did finish medical degree.</span> <span id="s922">He got a medical degree after the war and he was a cardiologist.</span> <span id="s923">He wasn't Jewish, but he was a very good friend of Irene and her husband.</span> <span id="s924">And when I went to Krakow and Warsaw the first time after the war, I called up.</span> <span id="s925">Fren-ya-vet-ski (ph) was his name, Dado Fren-ya-vet-ski (ph), and his wife answered and said he died a year ago of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s926">So, I lost another friend that was from the past, you know.</span> <span id="s927">And Irene died, I told you before, and her husband is still alive, and when we go to visit, we see him and see the daughter.</span> <span id="s928">But, what I did was I read, I loved to read.</span> <span id="s929">So I read and I studied the English a little bit, and I just tried to keep busy.</span> <span id="s930">I did some artwork and I ended up in the States here, when I started going back to school, I got a Masters Degree in Art.</span> <span id="s931">I think I had a Masters Degree in Drama.</span> <span id="s932">So I can get busy with things, so that's what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Was Yannosh still working at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Well he got into some financial troubles.</span> <span id="s935">I don't know exactly what was.</span> <span id="s936">And then he lost the job.</span> <span id="s937">So he wasn't working either and he was sitting around the house doing nothing.</span> <span id="s938">So, things were kind of sad.</span> <span id="s939">We were just waiting out time.</span> <span id="s940">Waiting for the war to be over.</span> <span id="s941">Waiting for things to change and nothing seemed to be changing.</span> <span id="s942">And, I don't know, he was in black market.</span> <span id="s943">And this is also possible, that that contributed to our being arrested.</span> <span id="s944">Because they considered us as political prisoners or whatever that was suppose to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: What about his parents and his sister?</span> <span id="s946">Were they working?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: His father was paralyzed, partially paralyzed.</span> <span id="s948">And he spent most of his days playing solitaire.</span> <span id="s949">The grandmother was doing the cooking, whatever cooking she could do, because there wasn't very much food at that time either, so I think we had goulash made out of potatoes and a little bit of meat everyday.</span> <span id="s950">And she could cook very well.</span> <span id="s951">And the sister and mother went every day to the Cheen-ska (ph) apartment in the city and taught English.</span> <span id="s952">Sometimes they stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s953">Because there was a curfew, and so they couldn't come, the streetcars stopped running at a certain time so sometimes they stayed overnight.</span> <span id="s954">And Mrs. Cheen-ska (ph) was taking big chances and then that's why they did, they were honored by Yad-vash-am (ph) because I described the whole thing.</span> <span id="s955">Little by little, how they helped us.</span> <span id="s956">And Yad-vash-am (ph) honored them as the righteous Polish people that helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Were they teaching English to other Jews for the most part?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No.</span> <span id="s959">There were no Jews already to teach to.</span> <span id="s960">They were always there in ghetto or in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s961">They were teaching to Polish people.</span> <span id="s962">And a lot of Polish people were very interested in learning English.</span> <span id="s963">And they were very good teachers.</span> <span id="s964">They had a lot of students.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: What happened with you're arrest?</span> <span id="s966">How did you get arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: You mean when the ___________________?</span> <span id="s968">We have no idea what happened.</span> <span id="s969">Whether somebody said that the Jews were living there and whatever happened, it was five o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s970">The big truck drove up.</span> <span id="s971">And they were shouting in German, "Rouse!</span> <span id="s972">Rouse!"</span> <span id="s973">But they let us pack out belongings.</span> <span id="s974">We all packed a big suitcase and a small suitcase and we took most of our stuff with us.</span> <span id="s975">And they put us on an open truck, in the back of the truck.</span> <span id="s976">There were benches on the truck and we sat on the benches with the suitcases.</span> <span id="s977">And I expected to be taken to the same station that my father was taken to, which was really a cargo station with cattle trains.</span> <span id="s978">But they took us to the regular train station in Krakow.</span> <span id="s979">And I remember sitting on the back of the truck and looking back and trying to remember and thinking, I'll never see it again.</span> <span id="s980">And the first thing that I did when we came to Krakow, I went to the train station and stood there and looked at the view.</span> <span id="s981">I saw it again.</span> <span id="s982">Anyway, they put us on a regular train.</span> <span id="s983">Not a cattle train, on a regular train in a compartment, the six of us.</span> <span id="s984">And after a while, the train, the German soldier was standing outside with his gun, but they treated us very nicely.</span> <span id="s985">And they had a bunch of papers with them.</span> <span id="s986">Very, very carefully had it folded.</span> <span id="s987">And we sat and waited and the train started and we didn't recognize really the stations.</span> <span id="s988">We didn't stop.</span> <span id="s989">The first stop was Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s990">And we knew all about Auschwitz by then.</span> <span id="s991">You go there and you don't come back.</span> <span id="s992">And we waited for them to get us out.</span> <span id="s993">And the train stood there for quite a while and then it started and it meant we are not going to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s994">That was a big relief.</span> <span id="s995">And, as I say, we were all together, the whole family, in the one compartment.</span> <span id="s996">And I don't remember what the first stop was, but it was sometime in the evening.</span> <span id="s997">This train stopped, they got us out, and sometimes they transported us in an open kind of a truck and sometimes it was like a van.</span> <span id="s998">And we either went, most of the time we went to a prison.</span> <span id="s999">And we were put, you see, I have not very much of a recollection.</span> <span id="s1000">Whether we were separated or whether we were all put into one room with bunks.</span> <span id="s1001">I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s1002">I just know that we traveled for almost six weeks.</span> <span id="s1003">Maybe four weeks.</span> <span id="s1004">Because we came to Bergen-Belsen sometime in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: This was May of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: 1944.</span> <span id="s1007">Well actually, now I remember, see things come back.</span> <span id="s1008">When we were arrested that morning, we were taken to the Gestapo again.</span> <span id="s1009">The same prison that I was in before.</span> <span id="s1010">And the men were, the father and brother and my husband were separate, and the four women were together.</span> <span id="s1011">And the reason that I remember is that when we finally got to Bergen-Belsen, after seeing the train station and the prison, a couple of times we were in a camp.</span> <span id="s1012">And I don't know, if it was Ravensbruck or some other camp, just for overnight.</span> <span id="s1013">And then they took us back on the train and back until we got to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1014">And they let us have our suitcases and I remember I had two favorite dresses.</span> <span id="s1015">And I noticed that my suitcases were open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Can you backtrack just a little bit to the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1020">When we got to Bergen-Belsen, I opened the suitcases and I found out that half of my things that I had packed in Krakow were missing.</span> <span id="s1021">And I figured out that when they took us out from that room, it was a large, large room with many women in it, that they thought that we won't come back.</span> <span id="s1022">And they just took stuff from our suitcases.</span> <span id="s1023">And then the Germans came and got the suitcases and brought them to us.</span> <span id="s1024">So I figured out that they must have stolen them then.</span> <span id="s1025">But anyway, all our belongings otherwise were there.</span> <span id="s1026">And we arrived in Bergen-Belsen and, as you can see from the book, we were registered all right, the whole family.</span> <span id="s1027">And we were treated quite well.</span> <span id="s1028">We got three meals a day.</span> <span id="s1029">They weren't anything fancy.</span> <span id="s1030">We had a sandwich for lunch and coffee and a piece of bread in the morning, but sometimes it was with margarine.</span> <span id="s1031">And soup with a little bit of meat in it, but lots of potatoes.</span> <span id="s1032">And you could get two bowls if you wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: And you were still with all of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: And still with the family.</span> <span id="s1035">And we all slept in the same room.</span> <span id="s1036">It was a long room with bunk beds.</span> <span id="s1037">It wasn't those shelves like you see in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1038">They were just, you were like in a summer camp.</span> <span id="s1039">Really.</span> <span id="s1040">It was clean and it was nice and the mattresses were quite good.</span> <span id="s1041">It wasn't just straw and a blanket.</span> <span id="s1042">And we did get blankets, I don't remember having linens, but I think there were blankets.</span> <span id="s1043">Maybe there were some rough sheets.</span> <span id="s1044">But anyway, the work that we did, the first week we didn't do anything and then I think in a sewing room somewhere.</span> <span id="s1045">And that's where I learned to sew.</span> <span id="s1046">Well I did know how to sew but not as well as I know now.</span> <span id="s1047">Anyway, I was sewing things and I don't remember what they were and most of the time there it was just day by day.</span> <span id="s1048">It was killing time.</span> <span id="s1049">There were a lot of people from Holland there already and especially the diamond cutters.</span> <span id="s1050">Because I remember that they were really being treated very well because they couldn't do any dirty work because their hands would get insensitive to the fine tools with the diamonds and so this whole time in Bergen-Belsen, it's sort of a blank.</span> <span id="s1051">I don't really remember much, the first time we were there.</span> <span id="s1052">Except that we were treated quite well.</span> <span id="s1053">That it was fairly clean.</span> <span id="s1054">That there were bathrooms, latrines you might say, but there was running water.</span> <span id="s1055">The faucets with water and we could wash up.</span> <span id="s1056">And I think there were even showers.</span> <span id="s1057">And I know that we could wear our own clothes.</span> <span id="s1058">And there was a laundry we could wash things in.</span> <span id="s1059">And then in August, all of a sudden, we were gathered up and we were told to pack up our suitcases and that's when we were put back on a truck and taken to the train station and put in a cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s1060">And straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Before we go on, I realized that we skipped over a little bit about the German invasion of Hungary and how you're life changed after that, while you were in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: That's when, well, okay, now in Krakow, you see, I kind of don't remember the details.</span> <span id="s1063">I know that they couldn't purchase anymore things in the _____________ store.</span> <span id="s1064">That we were selling all the jewelry that we had.</span> <span id="s1065">That Ches-wap (ph) was bringing me money and that things weren't very good.</span> <span id="s1066">And then, you see I didn't go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1067">I was afraid to leave the house, I stayed in the house most of the time, all the time, except when my friend came to visit I might have gone to the village with her.</span> <span id="s1068">Irene from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1069">And then, you see I don't remember the dates when actually the invasion happened.</span> <span id="s1070">And I would have to look it up I suppose.</span> <span id="s1071">And what caused the arrest, I again will never know.</span> <span id="s1072">Whether they decided that we were not the protected Hungarian citizens, that we were just Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1073">But there must have been something more to it because then we would have been transported as Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s1074">But we were treated as political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1075">We had the papers.</span> <span id="s1076">And as I say, at first we were sort of interned in Bergen-Belsen and then we were still treated as prisoners because the transport was very small and of the things that happened when we arrived in the camp.</span> <span id="s1077">That we were tattooed with the serial number of the prisoners and not just, you know like the Prussia people for example, had an A dash and some number.</span> <span id="s1078">We had the serial number of this particular group of prisoners.</span> <span id="s1079">Mine was ____________, I have the vial with the number and it was 81000 with the triangle, and the triangle is still on my arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: In Bergen-Belsen, you started working in the sewing room soon after you arrived, or how long did it take before you had started?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: It seems to me that I didn't do anything for at least a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1082">Maybe more, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1083">It just, that whole period is just very, very vague.</span> <span id="s1084">I know I got very friendly with Betsy.</span> <span id="s1085">I did not have much contact with my husband, definitely no intimate contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Tell me about how you met Betsy and would you just say her full name, for the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: How I met Betsy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: How you met Betsy and if you would just say her full name for the tape because I don't think we've mentioned her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Betsy Gordon.</span> <span id="s1090">I mean, I knew her as Betsy Gordon.</span> <span id="s1091">And I met her when we arrived in Bergen-Belsen, on the transport.</span> <span id="s1092">Either she was already there or we picked them up in some camp, the other Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s1093">There were, Betsy was the only woman and the rest were men.</span> <span id="s1094">And they were sort of middle-aged men and Betsy was Italian, I mean, Betsy was Hungarian dancer who lived in Italy and she had dyed, auburn-red hair all the way to her waistline.</span> <span id="s1095">Very beautiful woman.</span> <span id="s1096">And she spoke fluent Italian.</span> <span id="s1097">She spoke some German and, of course, Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1098">And she was born in Budapest but she lived in Italy.</span> <span id="s1099">And her full name was Elizabeth Gordon.</span> <span id="s1100">But she wanted to be called Betsy.</span> <span id="s1101">That's all I know about Betsy.</span> <span id="s1102">And I was with her the entire time, from the day we were, our heads were shaved until the day we left, I mean, until I left Bergen-Belsen, the camp, with my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: What about the rest of your husband's family?</span> <span id="s1104">Were you still with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1106">The father had to have his nitroglycerin, which he didn't have, and he died I think about two weeks after we arrived in camp, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1107">He was doing okay in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1108">We had the medicine for him and he had angina __________ in addition to the stroke and he had to have nitroglycerin.</span> <span id="s1109">And it seems to me that he got it from the Germans, the medication, when we were in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1110">Because he did get, he had the drops that you put on the tongue, you know, when you would get choked up.</span> <span id="s1111">And I think he had some pills.</span> <span id="s1112">Otherwise, nobody else did any medication but when we arrived in Auschwitz, I know that Yannosh came and told us that father died.</span> <span id="s1113">And Yannosh, I don't know whether he had tuberculosis of the bone when he was a child or was it a birth defect, I just don't remember what it was, but he had a deformed hip.</span> <span id="s1114">He was a very handsome guy, he danced and everything, the leg didn't bother him.</span> <span id="s1115">But he did limp.</span> <span id="s1116">But still he could get around and he was not put in the gas chamber, you know, at the beginning when, I mean, after we were rescued from the gas chamber he was put in the camp.</span> <span id="s1117">And I saw him several times, he came to visit because some of the men could come into the camp with some errands and they would bring food or they would bring something and he would sneak out and say hello or, sometimes, he could even come to the fence.</span> <span id="s1118">And the only thing I know about him is that when we were in Paris, when I was in Paris with Vickie, trying to get the exit visa, and there were many other people from all over Germany and there were several people from Auschwitz, several men.</span> <span id="s1119">And I wanted to know if they knew because he wasn't just like one of the prisoners, he really had very ___________ distinct limp and he was a little bit different.</span> <span id="s1120">And they knew him.</span> <span id="s1121">And they said that one day there was a selection and he was selected out.</span> <span id="s1122">And they never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1123">So I assume that he was gassed and done with.</span> <span id="s1124">And then the mother, the sister, Betsy and I were together all the time, except for the short time when I was very ill and I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1125">And then they were going to have a selection in the hospital and the nurses got me out the day before because they said that the hospital was going to be liquidated.</span> <span id="s1126">So whomever they could get out.</span> <span id="s1127">What was wrong with me is that I got some kind of an infantago infection, or whatever it was, on my legs.</span> <span id="s1128">And I had sores all the way to the bone, oozing, and then it was ____________.</span> <span id="s1129">It was a big mess and my legs were extremely swollen.</span> <span id="s1130">But still they said I have to be able to walk out of there because otherwise I will be finished.</span> <span id="s1131">And they put some bandages on my legs and they got me out.</span> <span id="s1132">And then I still had to go on the roll call every morning, get up.</span> <span id="s1133">But I was able to walk and I was able to go to work.</span> <span id="s1134">And so that's how I survived that ordeal.</span> <span id="s1135">But if you look closely you can still see the spots on my legs.</span> <span id="s1136">For years and years I had big blotches.</span> <span id="s1137">And mother, just before, in December, just before the camp was evacuated we had another selection and they separated there with us and Doot-sie (ph), Ida, we called her Doot-sie (ph) wanted to go with her and they separated them and the mother was put in what they call Schul-Newtz (ph) block, which was preservation block, and all the old and weak women were put there.</span> <span id="s1138">And we went to visit her a couple of times and she said she knew that they were going to be just gassed because they couldn't, they had the work and they couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1139">She was extremely emaciated and she was getting really weaker and weaker and one day we went to see her and the block was empty.</span> <span id="s1140">They took them all out.</span> <span id="s1141">And Doot-sie (ph) was very, very close to her mother and I think that really shocked her terribly and she cried and cried for days and we couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1142">And she got terribly skinny in the last couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1143">Betsy and I were pretty skinny too, but nothing like Doot-sie (ph) was just started to look like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s1144">And then when they selected us again, they selected me and Betsy for the train and Doot-sie (ph) stayed.</span> <span id="s1145">And this was the 29th of December and I don't have the date when the Russians came to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1146">But I am sure it is dated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: But before we go on . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Doot-sie (ph) survived.</span> <span id="s1149">Because you asked me what happened to the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1150">So it was just Betsy and I were taken to Bergen-Belsen and Doot-sie (ph) stayed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1151">And then I understand that she was rescued by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1152">And when we watched the movie, it seems to me, one of them looked like Doot-sie (ph), one of the women that was being taken by the nuns, you know.</span> <span id="s1153">But then when we got in touch with Renya Chich-en-ska (ph) whose house they taught English, I got an exact report on what happened.</span> <span id="s1154">Doot-sie (ph) was rescued by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1155">She stayed in Auschwitz in whatever camp they had them until they evacuated them, and then she came back to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1156">And she came to the Deit-chin-ski (ph) house and she stayed with them for six months.</span> <span id="s1157">She also had these sores on her legs.</span> <span id="s1158">But they got her cured.</span> <span id="s1159">And something horrible happened to Doot-sie (ph).</span> <span id="s1160">She got a job with the joint, United joint, what was it?</span> <span id="s1161">The Jewish Joint Institution, it was working in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1162">And Rayna (ph) did not know why, but there was some kind of improprieties in the Joint.</span> <span id="s1163">By then the Communist government was, took over Krakow.</span> <span id="s1164">And Doot-sie (ph) was arrested by the Communists and put in prison for eight years.</span> <span id="s1165">She was in prison for eight years.</span> <span id="s1166">Since 1954 or so until 1962.</span> <span id="s1167">And then she was released and went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1168">Now there was a cousin of theirs in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1169">The family, they were first cousins, and the Uncle and Aunt I suppose and the young cousin, immigrated to Stockholm and he came to Krakow, or he came and took her to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1170">And he came to visit her several times.</span> <span id="s1171">I got it all from Deitch-chin-ski (ph) and from the cousin from Stockholm, he wrote me a letter.</span> <span id="s1172">That Doot-sie (ph) got married and her husband died after three years.</span> <span id="s1173">And then she got a stoke and she was very ill for quite some time, paralyzed, and she died in Budapest in 1982.</span> <span id="s1174">But she did survive the war but it was very, very sad, what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1175">So that's what happened to the Fanyo (ph) family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Okay, we're continuing with the interview with Anna Ware.</span> <span id="s1177">And we left off yesterday.</span> <span id="s1178">Today is April 2, 1996.</span> <span id="s1179">And you had just talked about the Fanyo (ph) family and what was the fate of each of those members of the family.</span> <span id="s1180">And I am interested in going back to Bergen-Belsen, the first time that you went there.</span> <span id="s1181">And I believe you mentioned you arrived in May of 1944 and you were there until August, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: That's as I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: And I wondered if you could tell me, you mentioned that you met a friend, Betsy Gordon, and that you were, at first you weren't working but then you were working doing sewing with her?</span> <span id="s1184">And I wondered if you could say how it happened that you came to, that you met her and you started working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Well it seems to me that Betsy, now I don't remember whether we arrived in the camp and then she arrived later or she was already there.</span> <span id="s1186">Because we were together with the other Hungarian people.</span> <span id="s1187">And even though she came from Italy and she lived in Italy and she was a dancer, I don't know exactly what kind of dancer, but I know that she looked like an actress with lots of make-up and the dyed hair.</span> <span id="s1188">And she was very beautiful.</span> <span id="s1189">And she was there.</span> <span id="s1190">It seems to me like she already was there.</span> <span id="s1191">That she was deported just like we were, as a Hungarian citizen living abroad.</span> <span id="s1192">Living in a country that was occupied or in some way connected with Germany.</span> <span id="s1193">And we were all in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s1194">And the barracks were very clean, they were very well kept.</span> <span id="s1195">And we slept in bunk beds which were just regular bunk bends, you know, lower bunk and upper bunk.</span> <span id="s1196">And the older people slept in the lower bunks and the younger slept in the upper bunks.</span> <span id="s1197">And I don't quite remember whether, I know we had blankets.</span> <span id="s1198">I don't think we had linens as such.</span> <span id="s1199">I can't remember, I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s1200">But I know there were mattresses, there wasn't just a board with maybe some straw or maybe just a thin blanket.</span> <span id="s1201">But there were, they might have been straw mattresses, which are very popular in Europe, or they might have been just some kind of things, sacks filled up with whatever filling they had.</span> <span id="s1202">And anyway, they were not as bad as we had come later in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1203">And everything was very clean.</span> <span id="s1204">We had to clean it ourselves but there were brooms and there were cleaning supplies and there was a wash room and a bathroom with running water.</span> <span id="s1205">So the things weren't really, it was not as primitive as some other camps.</span> <span id="s1206">And I know that at first we didn't do anything and it was rather boring.</span> <span id="s1207">And there were a lot of people from Holland, I think I mentioned that, diamond cutters.</span> <span id="s1208">And they definitely would not work in anything.</span> <span id="s1209">They were kind of sheltered because their hands could not get ruined because they wouldn't be able to do the precision work evidently that's required of a diamond cutter.</span> <span id="s1210">So they were more sheltered.</span> <span id="s1211">And I don't really remember exactly what we were doing and what we were sewing, but it seemed it wasn't on sewing machines.</span> <span id="s1212">It seems to me that we were repairing things, maybe they were uniforms, maybe they were just things from the camp.</span> <span id="s1213">I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s1214">But I know that we didn't just sit idly the whole time.</span> <span id="s1215">And again we had three meals a day, I mean there were no scrambled eggs for breakfast, there was just maybe a piece of bread with some margarine and coffee, which was usually kind of brown water but at least it was sweetened with saccharine I suppose.</span> <span id="s1216">And then for lunch we had sandwiches and again coffee.</span> <span id="s1217">And in the evening there was some kind of soup with maybe some meat and lots of potatoes and vegetables.</span> <span id="s1218">And we weren't hungry.</span> <span id="s1219">As a matter of fact, I, you know, we could get seconds on soup.</span> <span id="s1220">It was very surprising to us that that was a concentration camp and we were wearing our own clothes.</span> <span id="s1221">All the suitcases came with us and we had them right in the barrack.</span> <span id="s1222">And so we could change and that's when I discovered that our suitcases were pilfered, still in Krakow, because a lot of things were missing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: How much did you know, or what did you know, about the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: We really didn't know very much.</span> <span id="s1225">The only contact with a person that actually was in a concentration camp was Yes-cho Mo-stof-ski (ph) who was the young man, the older brother of the two sons of _________ Mo-stof-ski (ph).</span> <span id="s1226">And he was arrested very shortly after the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s1227">And, as I found out now from his brother and from Yesh-if (ph) and we visited them last summer, that he was involved in Boy Scouts and he was higher ranking official in the organization.</span> <span id="s1228">And he was arrested.</span> <span id="s1229">And I think in 1940, as early as that, and sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1230">And at that time, we really didn't know what Auschwitz was except that they were sending people there.</span> <span id="s1231">And also the university professors were arrested and sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1232">Now we rarely didn't hear from him, and then he came back about eight months later, and as I say the dates, I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s1233">I know that he has stacks of books of his memoirs left because he showed them to us and they were all in Polish and I said I would love to read them and translate them into English so that people knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1234">Because one of the things that he told us last Summer, or maybe I should just say what happened when Yesh-e (ph) came back, and I don't remember, it was 1940 or 1941.</span> <span id="s1235">I know it was at the very beginning.</span> <span id="s1236">And two years was still the beginning.</span> <span id="s1237">And he came back and he was really in seclusion.</span> <span id="s1238">And it was, I was still very young then and I really didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1239">But the thing that I remember was that Yesh-e (ph) would not talk to anybody about things.</span> <span id="s1240">What happened to him.</span> <span id="s1241">What he was doing.</span> <span id="s1242">Why he was let go.</span> <span id="s1243">And he just wouldn't say anything of what happened to him in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1244">But then when Robert and I were visiting them last summer, Yesh-e (ph) showed us his memoirs and also he was an amateur painter, well he thought of himself more than an amateur, but anyway, the walls of his apartment were just filled with paintings.</span> <span id="s1245">And some of the paintings were depicting his life in Auschwitz, in the white and blue uniforms and the thing that he told us was about Father Colbert who was sanctified by the Pope and we happen to be on an excursion in Italy with our university and we stayed in a monastery which was converted into a hotel.</span> <span id="s1246">And it was named after Father Colbert.</span> <span id="s1247">And also, at that time, the Pope sanctified him, that year, he was some 82 or so, and I know that everybody was extremely respectful of Father Colbert because we had some runaround with some Italian police.</span> <span id="s1248">And because of, I think it was something about the tickets on the bus, but anyway they wanted to know where we were staying and we said that we were staying in the Castle Colbert.</span> <span id="s1249">And they were very impressed and let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">[End of Side A of Tape 3]</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Mrs. Ware, could you start from the beginning of you're sentence and you were talking about Father Colbert?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1253">Father Colbert was a Catholic priest in Poland and he was arrested like all the other priests, well many other priests, and sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1254">And he was there at the same time that Yesh-e Mo-stof-ski (ph) was there.</span> <span id="s1255">And Yesh-e (ph) witnessed his execution and he had it depicted in one of his paintings and he told us about the tortures that Father Colbert went through just because he was a Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s1256">There was no other reason.</span> <span id="s1257">He had no other sins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: So from the stories that you heard from Yesh-e (ph), you didn't have the impression that there was a mass extermination of Jews going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: No, you see, all that we got last Summer but when Yesh-e (ph) came back, when he was released from Auschwitz, he must have been told the same thing that we were told when you have not seen or you haven't heard anything.</span> <span id="s1260">He was forbidden, he was let go on the basis that he is not going to talk about what he saw or what happened to him in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1261">And even his closest family, according to his brother to whom we talked recently, he said nobody ever knew what happened to Yesh-e (ph) during the six or eight months that he was away.</span> <span id="s1262">And also he doesn't know why they let him go except that maybe they needed the space for somebody else that they wanted to do in.</span> <span id="s1263">So we just knew that there was a place that people didn't want to talk about.</span> <span id="s1264">But we had absolutely no idea what actually was going on in Auschwitz or in any of the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: So when you were in Bergen-Belsen, did you have any fears or expectations of what might happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: No we didn't.</span> <span id="s1267">Just because, we heard that the concentration camps were camps where they put the people there and they were suppose to be working and we just had glimpses of it, but here we were in a so-called concentration camp and it was nothing like anybody would have thought.</span> <span id="s1268">That it was bad, that there were starving people or, we weren't beaten, we weren't, on the contrary, everybody was quite polite and quite nice to us.</span> <span id="s1269">And I don't know, is it because the type of camp they were running at that time was a, sort of a holding camp for people that they wanted to use for some other purposes or whatever.</span> <span id="s1270">And it was very, very strange when I, later on when I told somebody that I was in Bergen-Belsen before, they just couldn't believe that it wasn't as bad as it was when we were there later.</span> <span id="s1271">And on the way to Bergen-Belsen as I told you before, we would stop in prisons.</span> <span id="s1272">But a couple of times we did stop in some concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1273">I don't remember the names, but I know that they were camps because we were put in a barrack, but again, they were bunk beds, they were, maybe these were spaces that they were reserving for temporary guests, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1274">But not for the actual inmates because we really, on all these excursions we never saw what we saw later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: When you were in Bergen-Belsen in the middle of 1944, did you hear any news of the war?</span> <span id="s1276">Did you know where the Russian front was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: No.</span> <span id="s1278">We never knew what was going out on the outside world.</span> <span id="s1279">We had, there were no radios, there were no news whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1280">We heard the __________ in Auschwitz because there were radios, there were contacts but in Bergen-Belsen it was just like a, sort of poor man's resort almost, compared with what was going on later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Were you in a separate barrack from the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: No.</span> <span id="s1283">The whole family was together.</span> <span id="s1284">And Betsy was with us and then the other men that were in the same transport.</span> <span id="s1285">We were all in the same place.</span> <span id="s1286">And the only privacy you would have is, you know, we were on the bunk beds so, I think there was even electric lighting there.</span> <span id="s1287">As I recall.</span> <span id="s1288">You see, some of these things are very, very vague because a lot of them I was trying to sort of forget, but I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s1289">I just know that definitely we were, the family was all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Tell me about the deportation to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: As I said, we were living day by day and it seemed to be rather boring.</span> <span id="s1292">And then one beautiful morning they walked in and they were quite different in attitude, the soldiers or the guards or whoever they were, they were in uniform.</span> <span id="s1293">I guess they were all SS men.</span> <span id="s1294">And they told us to pack and also to hurry.</span> <span id="s1295">Everything from then on was to hurry.</span> <span id="s1296">And so we packed and they brought a truck and they loaded us all on the truck with all of our suitcases.</span> <span id="s1297">And transported us to the train station.</span> <span id="s1298">And then we didn't feel so good anymore because it wasn't a passenger's train, it was the regular wagon train.</span> <span id="s1299">And they put us all in one wagon and there was just straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s1300">And we were given little packets of sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1301">And these were like sliced bread with some kind of a paste in between, a paste a little bit like meat paste or whatever, but anyway they were edible, they were quite edible.</span> <span id="s1302">And there was a bucket in the corner I guess for sanitation.</span> <span id="s1303">And I don't remember getting any water in addition but I remember the sandwiches.</span> <span id="s1304">And then we rode the train with the soldiers at one end and we were at the other end.</span> <span id="s1305">And as I say, I don't remember how many of us were, there might have been fewer than twenty people.</span> <span id="s1306">And there were six of us and Betsy and then there were several men.</span> <span id="s1307">So there might have been fifteen, there might have been more, but less than twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Were they all Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: They were all Hungarian citizens who didn't live in Hungary.</span> <span id="s1310">They all lived in different places.</span> <span id="s1311">Just like we lived in Poland, Betsy in Italy, and those people might have been in Romania, Czechoslovakia, and I don't think there were any from Poland.</span> <span id="s1312">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s1313">But I know that they were all Hungarian citizens.</span> <span id="s1314">Now I don't remember how long the journey lasted.</span> <span id="s1315">I know we slept.</span> <span id="s1316">I know we got more food so it might have been two days, it might have been two-and-a-half days, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1317">And then they never let us out.</span> <span id="s1318">We had to go to the bathroom in the bucket in the corner.</span> <span id="s1319">But there was a bucket.</span> <span id="s1320">And I don't remember whether they had us carry out and empty the bucket, whether the train stopped, I just don't remember.</span> <span id="s1321">It seems to me that maybe it was on the way to Auschwitz or maybe it was on the way back to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1322">But I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Would you say that that was a point that which you couldn't retain the same dignity any longer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: No.</span> <span id="s1325">At that point it was, well just the fact that we didn't have privacy to go to the bathroom was already something that was very humiliating.</span> <span id="s1326">And probably this was something that, well, I don't know whether I want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1327">But I still am having problems, you know?</span> <span id="s1328">I mean, when I travel, I have problems.</span> <span id="s1329">But this was the taste of what we were going to go through probably and we were scared.</span> <span id="s1330">We were scared because all of a sudden we were not treated nicely.</span> <span id="s1331">The soldiers were shouting at us and the grandmother was not very well and they were shouting at her because she was moaning and they yelled that we should keep her quiet and we were already having a premonition of what was waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: And then you arrived in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: Then we arrived in Auschwitz and we were told to gather up our belongings and get out and we had to carry them out.</span> <span id="s1334">And the grandmother still could sort of walk, I mean with help, so it was very difficult because at that point we didn't carry about the suitcases but we wanted to help her and we had to help the father to get out of the train and they were shouting, they wouldn't let us leave the suitcases in the train.</span> <span id="s1335">We had to carry them out.</span> <span id="s1336">And when we arrived at the station, things you know are pretty, I kind of tried to push them out of my mind, you know, and not remember.</span> <span id="s1337">But as I recall, the first place we stopped was some kind of an office where they tattooed us and they even tattooed the grandmother.</span> <span id="s1338">And they tattooed, you had to hold the arm still and it seems to me like it was one of the Jewish workers that was assigned to do that.</span> <span id="s1339">And she, and I think I pulled my arm because she stuck the needle, and then she, there it is, she stuck the pen right into me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Into the end of you're finger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: At the end of my finger, I mean, she decided to test her pen on me.</span> <span id="s1342">And then she tattooed me and it wasn't very painful.</span> <span id="s1343">It was sticking some needles into somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: What was you're number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: My number, I don't remember, but it was something like 81 or 86, 87, it was 81,000 or 86,000, but it was in thousands.</span> <span id="s1346">And I saw numbers that was like 4, I mean I think Yesh-e (ph) number was something like 800 or something like that, and Father Colbert was 1,000, so there were quite, and then also there were different, I think there were different designations of the numbers.</span> <span id="s1347">Then depending on what group you belonged to.</span> <span id="s1348">So I don't think that if we had 86,000, I don't think that they only had 86,000 people in that camp because it looked to me like there were many more than that, but, you know, you can't tell out of the mass of people how many actually there are.</span> <span id="s1349">And things went very fast from there on.</span> <span id="s1350">And I just can't exactly remember the sequence, but I know I can remember certain highlights of that whole trip.</span> <span id="s1351">That we still had our jewelry, no, that's right.</span> <span id="s1352">We had the suitcases and we were all dressed up and then we had to carry the suitcases to a different place where there was, and to this day I will never forget the sight of it, there was a, sort of a small building and there was a big basket, just heaped with gold.</span> <span id="s1353">And they wanted us to take off our rings and just throw it on the heap.</span> <span id="s1354">And I had pierced ears, I had earrings, and I was having trouble to get it out and one of the soldiers was already grabbing my ear and I said, "I can take it out, leave it", and I was able to undo the earring and throw it on the pile, so that's the only jewelry I had.</span> <span id="s1355">I think Doot-sie (ph) had earrings, Betsy had earrings, all women had all these earrings and, anyway, Yannick (ph) put his band, anyway, all of our wedding bands and rings and jewelry was thrown on that pile.</span> <span id="s1356">And then we were put in sort of a row, walking, and carrying the suitcases we had to walk.</span> <span id="s1357">So each of us carried other suitcases because the grandmother had to be helped.</span> <span id="s1358">And we kind of dragged her along.</span> <span id="s1359">Now we walked on a road that was quite empty and it was not paved and there were fields on both sides of the road.</span> <span id="s1360">And we walked, I don't know how much, until the grandmother collapsed.</span> <span id="s1361">And she could not move and one of the soldiers walked up and pulled out a gun and was going to shoot her.</span> <span id="s1362">Now we all screamed and cried and we said, "we will carry her", and we tried to carry her, and then there was another SS man, I suppose they were all SS men, that's what we called them, had this bunch of papers.</span> <span id="s1363">Evidently these were the papers with which we arrived so we were all registered.</span> <span id="s1364">And I couldn't understand exactly what they were arguing about but evidently there was something about the fact that they couldn't shoot her because she was, they had the documents on her.</span> <span id="s1365">And then, again, I don't quite remember whether somebody on a motorcycle went by and they might have told him to send a truck for us.</span> <span id="s1366">Or, I don't know how it happened that they did send a truck for us.</span> <span id="s1367">And one of the open bed trucks, I mean, no cover, and they helped us on the truck and we dragged the grandmother on and she was lying on the floor.</span> <span id="s1368">And at that point I, there were benches on each side too, at that point, should I tell you?</span> <span id="s1369">Well, it's not, but who's going to read it?</span> <span id="s1370">You stop Robert, please.</span> <span id="s1371">Please?</span> <span id="s1372">Use Kotex pad on the floor of the truck.</span> <span id="s1373">Actually two of them, and nobody looses Kotex pads.</span> <span id="s1374">And that was the first inclination I had that something was very, very wrong.</span> <span id="s1375">You didn't recall that, did you?</span> <span id="s1376">Or do you want to recall it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1379">After I was arrested for the, the second time, and put in the prison while we were waiting to be transported to Bergen-Belsen, I was suppose to have my menstrual period which I did not get and I didn't menstruate all through the ordeal until 1945.</span> <span id="s1380">After I came to New York.</span> <span id="s1381">That's about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So we have you're number here.</span> <span id="s1383">Could you read it to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1385">It is 81,867.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Now when you were on the truck and you saw that image with the two Kotex pads.</span> <span id="s1387">What did you think it indicated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Well that indicated to me that there was something wrong.</span> <span id="s1389">That, we knew a little bit about the, it was called in Polish 'wa-pon-ka' (ph), that means 'catching', catching people.</span> <span id="s1390">And we knew that they did catch people, they put them on the trucks and drove them away, and they were rounded up and so I thought, well, I think that's the end of the people being nice to us.</span> <span id="s1391">That something is very, very wrong.</span> <span id="s1392">And it was sort of a, not only a premonition but really we realized that things are not going to be good.</span> <span id="s1393">So that was my first indication that something was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Where did the truck take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: The truck took us to Birkenau and they brought us to, again, I tried to find the place when we were in Auschwitz, to know exactly where we came.</span> <span id="s1396">I know we came through the gate and we came to near the crematoria.</span> <span id="s1397">Because there is another thing that happened.</span> <span id="s1398">That's later, because first what happened to us, the suitcases were still with us on the truck and the grandmother was on the truck.</span> <span id="s1399">And then when we got off, they told us that we didn't have to get the suitcases off and they just took us to this one room and there was quite a commotion, that we were delivered on a truck and there was this half-dead grandmother.</span> <span id="s1400">And from all the description that I remember, from Dr. Mengala (ph), it seems to me that it was Mengela (ph) who came in and gave the grandmother a shot and she just died, just like that.</span> <span id="s1401">And then there was shouting going on and we really didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1402">They separated the men and they separated the women.</span> <span id="s1403">And they told us to undress.</span> <span id="s1404">I mean, we were the four women and the men were somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1405">And we saw quite a big crowd of people outside.</span> <span id="s1406">Just like you see the pictures of the refugees, these children and women and men, just walking very slowly.</span> <span id="s1407">And then they, some women came in and took us to a corridor and there was a door that opened and they put us into the chamber.</span> <span id="s1408">And it was room not bigger than maybe 10 by 12, maybe, I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s1409">The door opened from the other side and they pushed in the men.</span> <span id="s1410">And so here we were and they closed the doors.</span> <span id="s1411">And here we were in that little room, it was made out of brick or plaster, I just don’t quite remember.</span> <span id="s1412">I know there was a blue light on top and there was a drain in the floor.</span> <span id="s1413">It seems to me like there was a pipe on the ceiling but it didn't look like a shower at all.</span> <span id="s1414">There were, what I think today it was, that when we were being de-loused, they were putting, we would undress in one room and put out clothes on a cart, which was wheeled into a sort of chamber, the door was closed.</span> <span id="s1415">Then we went through showers.</span> <span id="s1416">That wasn't when, that was later when we were in the camp.</span> <span id="s1417">Then we went through showers, and then on the other side we would get our clothes.</span> <span id="s1418">And it seems to me that they had several chambers like that because there were thousands of us at one time that they were giving us the baths.</span> <span id="s1419">And it seems to me that that was the chamber that we were locked into.</span> <span id="s1420">And after a while, I mean, we just stood there, but for just a few moments, a few minutes, the door opened and they pushed in two women, naked.</span> <span id="s1421">And they threw in a little baby that looked kind of crippled, they just threw it on the floor and shut the door again, and then we knew that we were done for.</span> <span id="s1422">And nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s1423">And you know, sometimes you can't, sometimes time goes very fast and sometimes time stands still.</span> <span id="s1424">And at that time it was standing still and we didn't cry, we didn't scream, we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1425">And the door opened and one of the SS men, I think he had papers in his hand, he says, "The people from Bergen-Belsen are here, are they here?"</span> <span id="s1426">, in German.</span> <span id="s1427">And somebody said, "Yah-vol" and then they said "Rouse".</span> <span id="s1428">So we started walking out and the two women, they were counting us.</span> <span id="s1429">Evidently they knew how many of them were suppose to be.</span> <span id="s1430">And they pushed the two women back in.</span> <span id="s1431">And shut the door and put us in an identical room, right next to it.</span> <span id="s1432">And I don't know how long we stayed in there but, maybe ten minutes, maybe twenty, maybe five, I couldn't tell.</span> <span id="s1433">And we could hear muffled screams and it sounded like the baby mostly.</span> <span id="s1434">But not, it was, and then it was quiet.</span> <span id="s1435">And then they opened our door and they said, "Rouse", so we went out and they told us "________ ________ __________ _________", and we all nodded.</span> <span id="s1436">And then they took the men again on one side and us the other side, the four women.</span> <span id="s1437">And there were a whole bunch of, there was a large room with the big windows on each side and these were Jewish women who were evidently in charge of preparing the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1438">And they were quite friendly, they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1439">The first thing they did, they put us on small stools and with what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1440">Clippers, they weren't electric clippers, they had to do it like this in order to shave your head, and they shaved our heads and the pubic hair and the hair under the arms.</span> <span id="s1441">And it all was in a pile and I had very beautiful hair, sort of reddish-blonde curls, and they were all on the floor.</span> <span id="s1442">And there was Betsy.</span> <span id="s1443">She had black roots already because her hair was dyed, so all her hair was on the floor.</span> <span id="s1444">Anyway, we looked very, very strange.</span> <span id="s1445">After a while we got use to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">End of Tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: We're going to go back just a little bit to before you entered the room that you were just describing.</span> <span id="s1449">And were you undressed while you were in that room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: No.</span> <span id="s1451">Right out, when they, now I don't, it seems to me, in which room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: In the room that you were waiting and that the two women with the child were pushed in.</span> <span id="s1453">Were you undressed before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: No, we were naked in that room, but we were told to undress.</span> <span id="s1455">You see, they separated the women, us, the Hungarian women from the men.</span> <span id="s1456">We were in two separate rooms.</span> <span id="s1457">And we were told to undress, the four women.</span> <span id="s1458">Evidently the men were told to undress too.</span> <span id="s1459">And then we came into that small chamber from one side and the men came in from the other side.</span> <span id="s1460">There were two doors to that chamber.</span> <span id="s1461">And so we were naked in that room.</span> <span id="s1462">And then when they let us out again, they separated.</span> <span id="s1463">We went to one side and the men went to the other side.</span> <span id="s1464">And we were all naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: So when you went to get you're hair shaved, were you still naked?</span> <span id="s1466">Had they given you any clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Yes, we were still naked.</span> <span id="s1468">We were naked when we had our heads shaved and after they were shaved, we were given clothes from a big pile that was on the side.</span> <span id="s1469">And I was given some underwear, just a pair of bloomers.</span> <span id="s1470">Because I remember they were very large, kind of long, old-fashioned.</span> <span id="s1471">And no bra, no slip, just the bloomers and a dress that was way too big.</span> <span id="s1472">And then two shoes, one shoe looked like a small man's shoe and the other one was just a regular woman's shoe.</span> <span id="s1473">And they barely fit, they were falling off my feet.</span> <span id="s1474">And I remember later on I found some string or something, or maybe tore out a piece of my dress, and made a tie for the shoe.</span> <span id="s1475">The dress had a cross painted on the back with oil paint and actually the girl painted that cross on my back.</span> <span id="s1476">And so I was looking at that and we were talking, that we couldn't run away anywhere with a cross on you're back and two different shoes.</span> <span id="s1477">But also I remember we were standing there waiting for things to happen.</span> <span id="s1478">When we saw all these people outside the windows and the girls who were working there, they just very casually said, "You see all these people?"</span> <span id="s1479">.</span> <span id="s1480">"Yes".</span> <span id="s1481">"Well, in ten minutes they will be going out through the chimney".</span> <span id="s1482">And there were chimney's smoking.</span> <span id="s1483">So we were in that entire compound where there were the saunas and the gas chambers and the crematoria was, it all seemed to be in that space.</span> <span id="s1484">So anyway, after we were dressed and we were taken to the barrack of the Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s1485">And then we were given, each of us was given, that's right, each of us was given a blanket and a bowl, about this big, enameled bowl with a little hole on the side.</span> <span id="s1486">And that was very important because you could put a piece of string though that hole and tie it up to you're dress because if you lost the bowl you couldn't get any food because nobody would loan you their bowl because they, if they can get another bowl of food they will eat it, so the bowl was probably you're most precious possession.</span> <span id="s1487">And I made a whole art piece for my thesis about the bowls.</span> <span id="s1488">I'll tell you about it later if you want to, but anyway, we were taken to a quarantine barrack.</span> <span id="s1489">It wasn't the barrack that we stayed in later on, this was a barrack that we stayed in, I think, for two weeks, two or three weeks, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1490">But I know it was a quarantine and they just wanted to make sure that we don't have some kind of a disease and spread it all over the camp.</span> <span id="s1491">So we stayed there for, we still had to stand the role call every morning about 3:30 in the morning or so, and they counted us and then they gave us this bowl of soup with a small piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1492">That was suppose to last us for the whole day.</span> <span id="s1493">And for the first week, it seems to me like we didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1494">The second week, after the role call, they lined us up and some of us went, still inside the camp, to dig ditches.</span> <span id="s1495">And some where doing or taken somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1496">I was taken to dig ditches.</span> <span id="s1497">And I remember, another reason that I remember it, it was sometime in the middle of the summer was because the sun was very hot and I was getting sunburned on the top of my head.</span> <span id="s1498">And I took off my bloomers and I made a turban to protect my skin.</span> <span id="s1499">So this was the quarantine and after, I think it was after two weeks, we were transferred to the barrack that we were suppose to stay in.</span> <span id="s1500">And that's where we stayed for the entire time until we were evacuated to Bergen-Belsen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Was this barrack in Birkenau as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: That was in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1503">All that I described to you happened in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1504">And so the barrack was the Hungarian women's barrack in Birkenau and it was just a regular barrack with the three tiers of bunks and I was on the top tier.</span> <span id="s1505">Like when we were in Auschwitz, I showed Robert one of those bunks and we had a window on top.</span> <span id="s1506">And this was the only air that we were getting, the windows from the roof.</span> <span id="s1507">There were no windows on the walls.</span> <span id="s1508">And we were very cold.</span> <span id="s1509">It was in the fall already.</span> <span id="s1510">And the windows were just propped up with a stick and then I got the idea that maybe we should close it because the rains started to fall.</span> <span id="s1511">And so I climbed up, I mean I stood up and I reached over and I pulled the stick out.</span> <span id="s1512">That was crazy, I was crazy because the window came crashing down and broke.</span> <span id="s1513">So here, we not only had rain coming in, but we also had glass all over.</span> <span id="s1514">And that's when the thing happened.</span> <span id="s1515">The cappo (ph) came and she made me get down and screamed at me, and I said something to her, that why is she screaming, that I didn't want to break the window.</span> <span id="s1516">And she started to hit me.</span> <span id="s1517">And she was a woman just like I so I hit her back.</span> <span id="s1518">Well, I didn't know any better.</span> <span id="s1519">And she almost killed me.</span> <span id="s1520">I mean, she started hitting me on the head.</span> <span id="s1521">She knocked out one of my teeth, she broke another one.</span> <span id="s1522">And then I was deaf for about, I don't know for how long.</span> <span id="s1523">I think I have been deaf ever since.</span> <span id="s1524">So, I just, that was probably one of the, one of the worst experiences because she was a young woman just like I. And she was very, very strong.</span> <span id="s1525">Evidently she was trained and her number was like 400.</span> <span id="s1526">She's been there, one of the first ones, from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1527">And all those cappos (ph) that I came in contact with were from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1528">They were the cruelest people I have ever met.</span> <span id="s1529">They were Jewish girls that were trained and they survived.</span> <span id="s1530">They had a little room off the main hall of the barrack and that's where they, some of the barracks had two little rooms like that, and that's where the cappos (ph) stayed.</span> <span id="s1531">And they had a bed and they had all kinds of goodies.</span> <span id="s1532">And they would steal bread from us.</span> <span id="s1533">When we got a loaf of bread, it was like about this size, a square loaf.</span> <span id="s1534">And what they did was each of us was suppose to get 1/4 of the loaf, and what they did was they didn't cut it into four pieces, they cut it one piece here and one piece there and the center was theirs.</span> <span id="s1535">And then the center from the two other pieces were theirs too.</span> <span id="s1536">So they actually took almost half a loaf to themselves.</span> <span id="s1537">And then they could trade that for the people from Canada.</span> <span id="s1538">And I don't know, you probably heard about the people from Canada because they were called, you know gold was discovered in Canada, and in Poland Canada was paradise.</span> <span id="s1539">And these were the people that were working on the transports, getting all the stuff that was smuggled in and, before the Germans got to it.</span> <span id="s1540">They were sorting the clothing, they were sorting things out, so the cappos (ph) had everything because for bread you could get anything.</span> <span id="s1541">And they were just trained to survive and they were surviving.</span> <span id="s1542">So that was probably one of my worse experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: How did she, did she leave you unconscious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1545">Then the girls took care of me.</span> <span id="s1546">My sister-in-law and Betsy and whoever else was there, evidently they got water and poured it on me and I had bruises all over and I bruise very easily so I was really black and blue and luckily she didn't break my nose or whatever.</span> <span id="s1547">So I just had black eyes and shiners under my eyes and then I was deaf.</span> <span id="s1548">And I don't know whether she broke my eardrums or whatever she did to me, but I couldn't hear anything.</span> <span id="s1549">But eventually my hearing came somewhat back but not enough to really hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Did you have any problems getting by in the camp without hearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: I wasn't completely deaf.</span> <span id="s1552">I could hear but not enough to really get along in the hearing world, that's why I have to have hearing aids.</span> <span id="s1553">I mean, I take my hearing aids out when I am at home alone with my husband and I can still hear, but, if he doesn't get too annoyed, but most of the time I learned to survive with hearing.</span> <span id="s1554">No, it was all right.</span> <span id="s1555">I could still hear.</span> <span id="s1556">It wasn't just that I was, eventually the hearing came back and I was not completely deaf so I could get along.</span> <span id="s1557">I could hear the shouting, "Rouse!"</span> <span id="s1558">, or whatever else they were shouting.</span> <span id="s1559">So that was all right.</span> <span id="s1560">And when I started working, I decided to get the hearing aids.</span> <span id="s1561">But otherwise, I was always trying to, my children were use to it, that you shout or get my mother's attention, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1562">So that was one of the souvenirs that I have from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Did you have to go to work again the next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: No, I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1565">I couldn't even get out of the bed but I had to go to the roll call so they dragged me out.</span> <span id="s1566">You see I was on the third floor so they let me sleep.</span> <span id="s1567">Somebody else moved over and they let me sleep down.</span> <span id="s1568">And then they kind of dragged me over to the roll call.</span> <span id="s1569">And I know I didn't go to work that day.</span> <span id="s1570">I don't know what happened, I don't know whether they, how they let me stay, but I know I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1571">But I don't think it lasted more than a day because the following day I did go to work.</span> <span id="s1572">And the work that I did in the camp really varied.</span> <span id="s1573">I know that sometimes we walked outside the camp and with hoes and we made little, small pieces of clumps of dirt out of big clumps of dirt.</span> <span id="s1574">And I don't, to this day I don't know what, we weren't planting anything, we were just chopping the dirt into small clumps.</span> <span id="s1575">And so that was for weeks I was doing that.</span> <span id="s1576">And then when the winter came we did, now the snows came pretty early, maybe October, and we were going into the fields whether it was sunshine or rain.</span> <span id="s1577">It didn't matter.</span> <span id="s1578">Then when the weather got a little colder, we did get either a sweater or some kind of a jacket or an over coat, but nothing that would fit.</span> <span id="s1579">But we did get another outer garment after one of those ___________ experiences were.</span> <span id="s1580">The lice were, I swear I probably will never see a bigger louse in my life, but when we were through working and after we got our so-called dinner, we spent most of our time on the bunks killing lice.</span> <span id="s1581">And these weren't head lice because we didn't have any hair.</span> <span id="s1582">The hair was growing about a quarter of an inch or so, but these lice live in, they are body lice, and they live in the seams of you're garments.</span> <span id="s1583">They are very hard to get rid of.</span> <span id="s1584">And so every so often we were supposedly de-loused, but according to our theory, they might have killed the live lice but the eggs they just probably, I don't know, they made them hatch faster in this area.</span> <span id="s1585">It seems to me like we had more lice after de-lousing than before, but the lice probably were one of the biggest tortures because here you couldn't rest at night because you had to scratch.</span> <span id="s1586">And I still itch sometimes when I think about it.</span> <span id="s1587">So, so much for the lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: Did you have, tell me about the food that you ate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1590">In the morning we got the coffee, which was brown water.</span> <span id="s1591">And we didn't have cups, it was all, the bowl was the cup and everything.</span> <span id="s1592">And we got the piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1593">Sometimes we got it in the morning and sometimes we got it in the evening.</span> <span id="s1594">And in the evening also, but anyway in the morning we got a piece of bread and that had to last us the whole day.</span> <span id="s1595">And at noon we might have gotten a bowl of soup, which was mostly water with a few potatoes, a few turnips floating in it.</span> <span id="s1596">And it tasted horrible.</span> <span id="s1597">And we still think they were putting salt peter into it.</span> <span id="s1598">That was the story, that they were putting salt peter to keep us quiet.</span> <span id="s1599">I don't know whether this is true or not, salt peter is quite poisonous.</span> <span id="s1600">It is sodium nitrate as I know, but that's what we were told, that it was full of salt peter, that that's suppose to quiet you're nerves and you become more obedient.</span> <span id="s1601">And then in the evening we got more soup, it might have been a little bit thicker, that might have been, so we're just two pieces of potato, might have been four pieces of potato and maybe two turnips, and another piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1602">And sometimes there was a tiny little square of margarine or a tiny little slice of a kind of a sausage, but that was maybe just once a week.</span> <span id="s1603">Most of the time it was just dry bread.</span> <span id="s1604">And bread became a, had monetary value.</span> <span id="s1605">If you wanted something else you could trade it for bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: When you were working did you work with Betsy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yes, with Betsy and Doot-sie (ph) and the mother, we all stayed together.</span> <span id="s1608">Somehow for all that time we were always together.</span> <span id="s1609">And then another work that I was doing was, to this day I have no idea what it actually was, somebody said this was something in connection with ammunition, and it was a, we were led into a room with long tables.</span> <span id="s1610">And there was a nail on the table and there was a pile of rags and strips of rubber, just flat rubber strips.</span> <span id="s1611">And we were suppose to plate braids.</span> <span id="s1612">The hook was to hook on the beginning, you tied it up and then you started to plait and roll the ball and hook on again.</span> <span id="s1613">And in the morning an SS woman, well fed, would come in and she would sit down and start plaiting, and then somebody would, an SS man with a stopwatch, would time her, and then they measured it.</span> <span id="s1614">And then they multiplied it, I don't know, for how many hours we were working.</span> <span id="s1615">Sometimes ten, sometimes twelve.</span> <span id="s1616">So that's how many meters of that stuff we were suppose to weave or plait.</span> <span id="s1617">And at the end of the day we measured it, forever.</span> <span id="s1618">I mean, there was an awful lot of measuring going on.</span> <span id="s1619">And if you were one meter short, you get whipped with a whip.</span> <span id="s1620">And I'd rather be whipped with a whip than pounded with fists because the other thing what they were doing is pounding you with fists.</span> <span id="s1621">So the whipping left welts but they were less painful than, there was just skin that was, you know, injured.</span> <span id="s1622">But if you were beaten up with fists, then you're bones hurt and everything else.</span> <span id="s1623">So I was very good with my hands and I rarely, I think I just got whipped once, that I was short, because I think I wasn't feeling well that day, but most of the time I was able to plait the quota.</span> <span id="s1624">It wasn't exactly the number of meters that the woman was plaiting and calculating, but we had to come within a sort of a reasonable amount.</span> <span id="s1625">Most of the time I filled up my quota so I was okay.</span> <span id="s1626">And then I was also sewing on sewing machines.</span> <span id="s1627">And I guess these were uniforms or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1628">And as I recall, this was about the variety of work that I did.</span> <span id="s1629">There was the fieldwork and then the sewing rooms again, and probably the longest I was in those plaiting rooms.</span> <span id="s1630">And somebody said that they were using it in cannons or, who knows what.</span> <span id="s1631">Oh yes, then also that wasn't only the number of meters that we had to plait, also how strong they were.</span> <span id="s1632">So you have to make sure that if the two SS women start pulling on them, they will not break it.</span> <span id="s1633">Because you got beaten up if they broke.</span> <span id="s1634">And then you had to fix it.</span> <span id="s1635">So I was very careful that I plaited them to their satisfaction.</span> <span id="s1636">And that's so much for the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Did you mostly speak Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Yes, I spoke only Hungarian at that point because Betsy spoke a little bit of German but we did not want to speak German.</span> <span id="s1639">But I spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1640">Another thing that was happening and was probably very strange, but we were cooking.</span> <span id="s1641">When we were standing for hours in the roll call waiting to be counted and waiting for the time to pass by, we were talking about food.</span> <span id="s1642">We were exchanging receipts.</span> <span id="s1643">And we were making up receipts.</span> <span id="s1644">I mean, you know if you would add this to that I think it would really taste much better, don't you think so?</span> <span id="s1645">And we spend a lot of time cooking like that.</span> <span id="s1646">And one time a very strange thing happened.</span> <span id="s1647">Because one of the women came by, she was late for the roll call, but she made it on time though, by the time we were counted.</span> <span id="s1648">We said, where were you?</span> <span id="s1649">She had her breakfast.</span> <span id="s1650">Well, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1651">She had scrambled eggs and she had ham and she had white bread and everything.</span> <span id="s1652">Well it turned out that she was assigned to bring water or something to one of the SS women in one of the barracks and she brought it in when the woman was eating breakfast.</span> <span id="s1653">And then the prisoner woman walked out and through the window she watched her eat.</span> <span id="s1654">And then she described it all to us.</span> <span id="s1655">It happened several times, you know, the prisoners watching the cappos (ph) or the SS women eat regular food and then thinking that they ate it, or imagining that they ate it.</span> <span id="s1656">There were all kinds of very strange things happening.</span> <span id="s1657">There were homosexual women when we went to work, a couple of them were grabbing at the girls.</span> <span id="s1658">They were Ukrainian women.</span> <span id="s1659">One of them bit me on my neck.</span> <span id="s1660">But other women pushed her away and then I stayed away from anybody that looked strange, that at least I felt they looked strange, so I really didn't have too much of that kind of experience.</span> <span id="s1661">But other girls told me that they were raped by other women, but I didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1662">And I didn't want to know anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: Did you have anything on you're uniform other than that cross on the back?</span> <span id="s1664">Did you have a badge or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">A: No.</span> <span id="s1666">Not that I recall.</span> <span id="s1667">Maybe I did have a triangle, you see I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1668">I know I had the cross on the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: And the other people in your barrack, were they all Jewish prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: They were all Jewish Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s1671">They were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s1672">Now one woman gave birth to a baby.</span> <span id="s1673">And that woman was, there were a couple of pregnant women.</span> <span id="s1674">One disappeared.</span> <span id="s1675">I know that the pregnant woman always asked for a little bit more food because she was pregnant and then one gave birth to a baby and the baby was taken away.</span> <span id="s1676">And I know she screamed and screamed and the cappo (ph) said that if she doesn't shut up she will be taken away.</span> <span id="s1677">So, but that was right at the beginning when I was there.</span> <span id="s1678">Another thing that happened was that some people got Red Cross packages.</span> <span id="s1679">And I remember one woman, you see there were stoves in the barrack, it was already winter, and I remember she cooked all kinds of stuff that she got in the package.</span> <span id="s1680">And I remember she gave me a little bit of the potato water that she cooked the potatoes in, she didn't give me the potatoes but she gave me potato water in the bowl, and I shared that with Betsy.</span> <span id="s1681">But I don't know that, we heard that the Red Cross was bringing packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">[End of Side A of Tape 4]</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: If you would just go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: We can start with the hospital.</span> <span id="s1685">I got some kind of an infection.</span> <span id="s1686">I think it started with probably some chigger bites or some bug bites that I got working outside.</span> <span id="s1687">And I always was quite sensitive and would scratch.</span> <span id="s1688">I know that I scratched my legs and then I guess because of the dirt and things that we lived in, I got some kind of an infection.</span> <span id="s1689">It might have been also fleabites or whatever.</span> <span id="s1690">And it was getting worse and worse to the point where my legs were very, very swollen.</span> <span id="s1691">And I could not walk even.</span> <span id="s1692">Pus was oozing and these were big, round circles all over my shins.</span> <span id="s1693">And so they took me to the hospital and they really didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s1694">I think they put some Vaseline or something over the wounds and covered it with some gauze and there I was lying and hoping that it will heal.</span> <span id="s1695">But at the same time, the German doctors were coming in and drawing blood from us.</span> <span id="s1696">And then injecting us with something and I have no idea whether these were suppose to be medications or whatever, but anyway.</span> <span id="s1697">Then they were also doing vaginal and rectal examinations with their fingers.</span> <span id="s1698">Which wasn't exactly what I considered pleasant.</span> <span id="s1699">And it was rather very humiliating.</span> <span id="s1700">I just didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s1701">I was not the only one.</span> <span id="s1702">There were several women that were singled out and we were sort of in a group and it was extremely humiliating.</span> <span id="s1703">I was only 20 or so and I just didn't feel that this was exactly the treatment I wanted to have but I was probably worried more about my legs.</span> <span id="s1704">And then I think I mentioned it before, that the women, there was a couple of Jewish women doctors and they said that they knew that there was going to be another selection in the hospital so they dismissed me together with some other women because they were afraid that the state I was in, I would have been selected to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1705">So I was put back into my regular barracks and I barely could walk.</span> <span id="s1706">But at that time, I was still working in that weaving business so I didn't have to walk into the fields and I was able to stand during the roll call and then just go to the barracks, which were right on the premises.</span> <span id="s1707">So it wasn't like I had to go very far.</span> <span id="s1708">And eventually my legs healed but they were, I had sort of scars all over, from my ankles to my knees, and I tried to be much more careful with scratching and things that may aggravate the condition.</span> <span id="s1709">My legs eventually healed.</span> <span id="s1710">It took about another month or so, but anyway, I was all right.</span> <span id="s1711">So this was another thing that I wanted to talk about.</span> <span id="s1712">The other thing that I wanted to say was that about two months before, two or three months before we were arrested, it might have been around Christmas time or maybe a little bit later, I discovered that I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s1713">And I went to a Polish doctor, a gynecologist who determined that I was about two months pregnant, maybe two-and-a-half, and he did an abortion right in his office.</span> <span id="s1714">And I was very sad that I had to do it but in the circumstances I couldn't possibly have a baby.</span> <span id="s1715">And if I did have one, I would have been pregnant when they arrested us and I probably wouldn't have survived anyway and the baby definitely wouldn't have been alive today.</span> <span id="s1716">But if you do think like that, if you just keep on thinking all you're life about the child that wasn't born.</span> <span id="s1717">So, this was another trauma that I had to live with.</span> <span id="s1718">Then I didn't give it much thought of course when I was in the camp, as I said before, that nature takes care of itself and I didn't menstruate since we were put in the prison in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1719">And I didn't menstruate until I came to New York.</span> <span id="s1720">And I really think it was a blessing because I just cannot image thousands of women without any sanitary facilities having their periods.</span> <span id="s1721">Now the ones that were in the camp a long time, they and the cappos (ph), some that knew how to get around because their number was just maybe 400 or 300 or so, and they were the rich ones and they might have been normal already, but the rest of us just were sterile I suppose.</span> <span id="s1722">But what amazed me was that really, it was almost like a miracle that we didn't menstruate because it would have been a big, big mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: When you were in Budapest and before you were arrested . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: We were in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Oh, I'm sorry, of course.</span> <span id="s1726">You were in Krakow before you were arrested and you discovered that you were pregnant.</span> <span id="s1727">Did you have any thoughts that the war might end soon?</span> <span id="s1728">Did you have a feeling that there was just no way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: No.</span> <span id="s1730">We didn't really have any hope.</span> <span id="s1731">We didn't know how long, how much longer we could survive in the conditions that we were in and the circumstances that we were in.</span> <span id="s1732">But it was so absolutely hopeless that we just did not think that this is the time to bring a child into the world.</span> <span id="s1733">So it was a very hard decision to make but I made that decision.</span> <span id="s1734">And after that, I didn't sleep with my husband anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Can you talk a little bit about how these two events that you just mentioned have effected you're life since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Well, as I said, you never stop thinking of the child that you, well I can't say killed, but didn't permit to be born.</span> <span id="s1737">And I have four wonderful children and you always think how wonderful that one might have been.</span> <span id="s1738">So my life was very much effected by everything that happened to me because to this day I have nightmares and I wake up and I don't know where I am, and I have all kinds of physical problems.</span> <span id="s1739">What was it, a year and a half ago I finally was sort of diagnosed with an ailment that I've had for about twenty years or so.</span> <span id="s1740">That I would come down with, or maybe more than twenty years, I came down with, suddenly, with high fever.</span> <span id="s1741">But it was like 104, and shaking and practically being unconscious.</span> <span id="s1742">And it would come on quite suddenly.</span> <span id="s1743">It would last for several days and usually I got better.</span> <span id="s1744">And it would happen like about every three to four months.</span> <span id="s1745">And eventually I got sort of use to it and I paid no attention to it anymore.</span> <span id="s1746">But a year and a half ago I had my neurosurgery, but two months later, again I got this fever.</span> <span id="s1747">And this time it was much more serious because I, well, Robert knows because he was taking care of me.</span> <span id="s1748">It was so bad that, you know, you don't call you're doctor after hours, and he got to call the doctor and find out what to do.</span> <span id="s1749">Whether he should take me to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1750">And my doctor, who is a physician, said that I have something called the Brill Zincer Syndrome (ph).</span> <span id="s1751">And she researched it and found out that a lot of people who had typhus in the concentration camps, the ________ which causes the typhus just becomes dormant and every so often it wakes up and causes the fever.</span> <span id="s1752">But usually they are mild attacks and very few people paid much attention to it.</span> <span id="s1753">But this time I was really seriously ill.</span> <span id="s1754">It was 104, you are not joking you know.</span> <span id="s1755">My doctor put me in the hospital and just to do the tests, and they ruled out every possible disease that could cause this kind of symptoms, like tuberculosis and _________ and fever, and what is the one in ________ working, the Valley Fever, and anyway, I don't know how many tests they did and they send my blood to a clinic and they were testing it for ____________, but the strain that they had wasn't exactly, the results were quite inconclusive.</span> <span id="s1756">But when I went to Poland the following Summer, Yesh-e (ph) was still alive and he said that he was a ____________ and he said that the strain of ______________ was a specific strain that was in Eastern Europe and it was called Ball-in-netsa (ph) or whatever, and he said that they should have tested for that and that definitely would have been positive.</span> <span id="s1757">But my doctor wasn't going to wait for any tests and he put me on very high doses of tetracycline.</span> <span id="s1758">And I was on tetracycline for about six weeks and the fever subsided and the tests were negative again.</span> <span id="s1759">And he says, well, let's wait for the six months and see whether you get anything again.</span> <span id="s1760">And I was sort of use to it, you know, it was just matter-of-fact.</span> <span id="s1761">I was getting use to it and that was it.</span> <span id="s1762">But it is already two years and I haven't had the fever anymore so they decided they killed off the __________.</span> <span id="s1763">And evidently you have to do it when the ____________ are active, when you have the fever.</span> <span id="s1764">And another symptom which was described in the book, because that was the first thing that the doctor asked, where is the rash?</span> <span id="s1765">And I had a rash going from the armpit down the arm and that was the first thing that he asked, whether I had the rash because that was one of the very typical symptoms of this sort of syndrome.</span> <span id="s1766">So that's another thing that I had.</span> <span id="s1767">And another symptom that, now since we are talking about diseases, is that after I had, well maybe when we come to Bergen-Belsen the second time we can talk about it.</span> <span id="s1768">Or should we talk about the diseases now?</span> <span id="s1769">Because another thing was I had typhus in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1770">Everybody had typhus.</span> <span id="s1771">I didn't have tuberculosis, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1772">But there are spots on my lungs that are calcified, but it's sort of secondary symptoms.</span> <span id="s1773">It's really is not too significant.</span> <span id="s1774">I mean, I have something that's called a B Lung picture, but its, the thing that was was the typhus.</span> <span id="s1775">And another thing that people where getting was starvation edema.</span> <span id="s1776">And this was something that was really frightening because you woke up in the morning and you're eyes were swollen with bags under the eyes and they were getting more and more swollen during the day.</span> <span id="s1777">And that was it.</span> <span id="s1778">In three days you were dead.</span> <span id="s1779">I mean, it was just unbelievable because you could see the people swelling.</span> <span id="s1780">The faces would get swollen and the legs, the feet and the hands, and then eventually the whole body.</span> <span id="s1781">And as I understand this was diagnosed as starvation edema.</span> <span id="s1782">And I didn't get it to that extent.</span> <span id="s1783">And my legs were very swollen, my feet were swollen and my face just a little bit but somehow I recovered from it.</span> <span id="s1784">I didn't die.</span> <span id="s1785">But it was very, very frightening and I have absolutely no tolerance for salt.</span> <span id="s1786">I am on an almost salt-free diet most of the time.</span> <span id="s1787">If I go to a restaurant, like for example today, and I had the tuna fish sandwich, I will have to take medicine when I come home.</span> <span id="s1788">And I am on medication the whole time, the dietetics.</span> <span id="s1789">And my doctor who is fairly new in town because my old doctor retired and I got a new one, and he was very much against the dietetics and he just didn't think that I should take them.</span> <span id="s1790">And he asked me to stop it.</span> <span id="s1791">And two days later, Robert took me to the doctor's office.</span> <span id="s1792">I couldn't go to work.</span> <span id="s1793">I gained about twelve pounds on the scale.</span> <span id="s1794">I couldn't open my eyes.</span> <span id="s1795">I could not talk.</span> <span id="s1796">I was so swollen that I couldn't even walk.</span> <span id="s1797">And Robert took me to the doctor's office and the doctor could not believe it.</span> <span id="s1798">He said he has never seen anything like it.</span> <span id="s1799">He says, you go back on you're pills and renewed my prescription.</span> <span id="s1800">And so these are still things that I've had since I left the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: Did you ever learn what kinds of experiments were being conducted at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: No, I never learned.</span> <span id="s1803">All I knew is that they took quite a bit of blood from us and they were injecting us with something else and they were taking, but they were doing so many things of that sort that you just didn't pay any attention to it.</span> <span id="s1804">And I don't think that that cause any, that was in Auschwitz, and the edema came in Bergen-Belsen, so I don't think that those two have anything to do with each other.</span> <span id="s1805">And I don't know why I didn't get typhus in Auschwitz, maybe because they were de-lousing us.</span> <span id="s1806">But the typhus was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1807">And of course the psychological effects of the whole experience is something else.</span> <span id="s1808">Because I go to the hairdresser, I put make-up on, and I was going, you know, I got three graduate degrees and I did very well.</span> <span id="s1809">I was on the Dean's list and I was, I got one of my Master's Degree's in art with distinction, and I entertain and I go out and I think I look very pretty.</span> <span id="s1810">But a lot of it is also a façade.</span> <span id="s1811">Because Robert knows that there are times that, I call it I'm out of my head.</span> <span id="s1812">And I have to have a nanny for the kids because I couldn't always take care of them.</span> <span id="s1813">So I was very fortunate that I could afford, or my husband could afford it.</span> <span id="s1814">So we had a nanny for seventeen years, until Sir-re-high (ph) started High School, so she was sixteen.</span> <span id="s1815">Well actually I had a nanny for longer than that because Margaret was with us for seventeen years and before that we had a nanny for five years.</span> <span id="s1816">So, I mean different nannies, but then we found one that stayed with us for seventeen years because I could not take care of the children.</span> <span id="s1817">And very few people know that because I, my kids were brought up and I participated in PTA and I just pretended that I lead a normal life.</span> <span id="s1818">And so I think I finish on the fact that I had a good façade and everything, but every so often the children would say, well mother you never really took care of us, it was Margaret who did.</span> <span id="s1819">But I tried to be a very good mother and I think I did do a good job.</span> <span id="s1820">I made sure that they go to school and do well in school and what-not, but there were many times that, I call it I couldn't take care of them the way, you know, I should have.</span> <span id="s1821">And there was something, always, I think I held them when they were babies, but we had very little physical contact when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s1822">And even now, you know, it may be just a peck on the cheek or something like that, but you never see me kissing the kids and really hugging them.</span> <span id="s1823">I do with my grandchildren though.</span> <span id="s1824">My grandchildren I hug and I hold and I play with them, but somehow with my children, there was some kind of a barrier that I couldn't break.</span> <span id="s1825">And I know it was all in my head and I was examined by a German psychiatrist for the restitution and he decided I was nuts.</span> <span id="s1826">Oh yes, they rewarded me restitution all right.</span> <span id="s1827">I get a monthly check because I figured out that they pay wasn't very high because, you know, at first they gave me a lump sum and it came out to about $5.00 per diem for the time that I was in the camp.</span> <span id="s1828">But it was more than nothing, but then they awarded me a monthly pension and they adjusted it since I have been working, and then they said, well, if you are working you really can't or don't deserve the full amount.</span> <span id="s1829">But then I petitioned and I send more letters and I have a stack of correspondence with the German government, through my lawyer who is a German man and very, very helpful and he specializes in the restitutions, so that's another story that maybe worth preserving.</span> <span id="s1830">All the letters that we were sending back and forth to find out whether I am deserving or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: What did you're psychological state have to do with the restitution?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: Oh, well what my psychological state was that I wasn't, okay, my husband was supporting me supposedly.</span> <span id="s1833">They wanted to know how much money he was making and so on and I insisted that in America, women are independent and I am not able to work.</span> <span id="s1834">You see, I didn't start working for money really.</span> <span id="s1835">For making a living, until my second husband died.</span> <span id="s1836">Before that when I was working, it was charity work and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1837">And I was teaching at the university as a student teacher.</span> <span id="s1838">I wasn't really working for money.</span> <span id="s1839">And so the reason that they awarded me the restitution was, it is really a pension.</span> <span id="s1840">Nobody can live on that pension because it was like $300.00 and then every year they adjust it for cost of living, whatever.</span> <span id="s1841">So it wouldn't even pay half the rent for a small room somewhere.</span> <span id="s1842">But I had to have a physical examination by a German doctor and who determined that I had a chronic edema, or whatever he called it, and then, I don't know, whatever else his diagnosis was, and then they decided to have me checked by a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s1843">And he gave me the standard psychiatric examination and I had to fill out all kinds of questionnaires, you know, whether I feel that I am being followed and whether I can sleep or whether I can't sleep, do I have nightmares, and I actually had everything that he was asking for, so I said yes.</span> <span id="s1844">And then he decided that maybe I do deserve some kind of a pension because he didn't think that anybody would employ me in the state of mind I was.</span> <span id="s1845">So that's another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: We can come back in more detail to the restitution later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Well, the thing is that as far as the restitution is concerned, I have copies of all the letters that I sent to the lawyer and the copies of his letters to me and the final judgment in all that.</span> <span id="s1848">It is all very interesting because it took like maybe several years of constant correspondence and wanting more proof and more proof of this and that and something else.</span> <span id="s1849">So, if you think that that would be an addition to it.</span> <span id="s1850">Because I really didn't hear anything about restitution in the whole museum.</span> <span id="s1851">And there are a lot of people that are getting money from the German government.</span> <span id="s1852">One curious thing is that once a month in between the 1st of August, it has to be after the 1st of August and before the 1st of November, I have to fill out a certificate of life.</span> <span id="s1853">And it has to be notarized by a notary public.</span> <span id="s1854">Years ago it had to be also, not certified, but made true, I can't think of the, I can't think of the word, but it was in German and then eventually it started to translate it into English, that it had to be certified by a German authority.</span> <span id="s1855">So I had to send it to the German counsel in San Francisco, and then I had to get it back and then I had to send it to Germany.</span> <span id="s1856">So this is something quite curious that I think very few people know about it.</span> <span id="s1857">Have you known about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: Well then you're the first one to learn about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">End of Tape 4.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: And go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: When I got married in June, 1947 to Dr. Levin, we decided that we didn't want to have children the first few years because we both were going to go to school.</span> <span id="s1864">And I wanted to get my degree from the University of Michigan.</span> <span id="s1865">That's where he was going to be for three years in surgical residency.</span> <span id="s1866">So when we were even still in, we got married in Dallas, Texas.</span> <span id="s1867">And I went to a gynecologist for my pre-marital examination and he examined me and he told me that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant because he thinks I am completely sterile.</span> <span id="s1868">My fallopian tubes were plugged, scarred, and there was no way I could possibly get pregnant.</span> <span id="s1869">And so, of course it was a great shock to me.</span> <span id="s1870">I told him my history and he said, well, this is what contributed to it.</span> <span id="s1871">And I, of course, I didn't want to get married, because my future husband was from a large family.</span> <span id="s1872">There were six children and he was the only son.</span> <span id="s1873">Well, actually he had a half-brother, but he was the only son of his mother, and he, they definitely wanted to have a grandson or granddaughter, or whatever, so it was a great disappointment to him and he didn't tell his parents.</span> <span id="s1874">But he said he didn't care.</span> <span id="s1875">He still wanted to get married, even though I didn't, but we did get married.</span> <span id="s1876">And I just tried not to think about it.</span> <span id="s1877">But I tried to plan my life.</span> <span id="s1878">Definitely go to school and have some kind of a profession so that I can be working and not missing the fact that I can't be a mother.</span> <span id="s1879">So, actually I was so busy with the university studies that I did not really have time to worry about anything else at that point.</span> <span id="s1880">But then, he was finishing his residency and I was finishing my graduate degree and we were going to move on.</span> <span id="s1881">And looking for a place to settle.</span> <span id="s1882">And I thought that maybe I should do something about it.</span> <span id="s1883">But we moved to Detroit and I got a job as a Medical Technologist at Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital and he was a surgeon there.</span> <span id="s1884">And we had a very good friend who was a gynecologist and we told him my predicament and he said that he will see what he can do.</span> <span id="s1885">He gave me a very thorough examination and then I had, he put me on high doses of penicillin, back then penicillin was very much in use.</span> <span id="s1886">And so if there was any kind of infection, then it would definitely get cleared.</span> <span id="s1887">And then in addition he put me through quite painful treatments.</span> <span id="s1888">It is kind of a little complicated, these are uterine injections of lapydol (ph), which is a very heavy oil with, first he tried to blow the air through and he wasn't able to, my tubes were definitely plugged.</span> <span id="s1889">And then lapydol (ph) is a very heavy oil and it has some kind of an additive to it that it will show up on x-rays, and so he injected that and the lapydol (ph) is suppose to go through the tubes and if they, and the weight of it sometimes will open them.</span> <span id="s1890">And the tubes are really opened into the abdominal cavity and the good sign is when the lapydol (ph) spills into the abdominal cavity.</span> <span id="s1891">And it's quite painful because there is some kind of a nerve connection, especially if, the pain is hitting the shoulders.</span> <span id="s1892">And nothing happened with the injection.</span> <span id="s1893">And he repeated it and after two days there was a spill on the right side.</span> <span id="s1894">So he said, well, that was sufficient indication that things may be all right.</span> <span id="s1895">And a few months later I did get pregnant.</span> <span id="s1896">And so we spent a year in Detroit and then I was about three months pregnant when we left.</span> <span id="s1897">And we came to Fresno.</span> <span id="s1898">And my daughter was born in August, we came to Fresno in December and my daughter was born in August.</span> <span id="s1899">So things turned out for the best.</span> <span id="s1900">But without medical treatments and all, I probably would have not been able to have children.</span> <span id="s1901">The American doctor who examined me the first time, when I went there for my pre-marital examination, because I was getting married and I didn't think that I wanted to get pregnant right away, said that I probably would never get pregnant because my tubes were scarred and plugged up.</span> <span id="s1902">And that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant.</span> <span id="s1903">And he wanted to know what could have caused it.</span> <span id="s1904">And I wanted to know what the cause might have been and he says, well, one of the causes that usually plugs up the tubes is an infection and its mainly gonorrhea and I said, well, how on earth would I have gotten gonorrhea and he says, well, you just think.</span> <span id="s1905">And you know you can get gonorrhea by an intercourse with an infected person, which I did not have, and so I told him about the gynecological examinations that I was getting in the camp.</span> <span id="s1906">And that when I was in the hospital with the skin infection, there were also doctors coming in and poking their fingers into us, and I did not think that they were having sterile gloves on because they were going from one woman to another without changing the gloves.</span> <span id="s1907">They were protecting themselves but not us.</span> <span id="s1908">And these were vaginal and rectal examinations and the doctor, the American doctor who examined me in Dallas, he said yes, that was sufficient to get you infected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: How long all told were you in the hospital at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: I really don't quite remember.</span> <span id="s1911">It could have been, probably around ten days.</span> <span id="s1912">And one thing that I remember very distinctly was that sometimes they were dressing the wounds on a table.</span> <span id="s1913">We were in bunks all the way around and there was a space in the center and they would put the patient there and several doctors would be standing around her and doing all kinds of things so that we couldn't really see, but one time I saw her legs.</span> <span id="s1914">I thought mine were in a bad shape, but her's were so bad that you could see the bone.</span> <span id="s1915">The flesh was just practically rotted away.</span> <span id="s1916">And one of the things that they would, they didn't do the maggot treatment to me, but it was very popular in Europe to use maggots to treat this kind of wounds.</span> <span id="s1917">And I know that her legs were just crawling with maggots.</span> <span id="s1918">And evidently maggots were putting some kind of an enzyme or whatever, that was killing the dead tissue.</span> <span id="s1919">Or maybe they were eating the dead tissue and that stimulated the granulation and growth of the new tissue.</span> <span id="s1920">And that was one of the cures.</span> <span id="s1921">So they did use maggots, but they didn't use penicillin.</span> <span id="s1922">They didn't use maggots on me, I somehow got better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Were they treating you in any way that was productive?</span> <span id="s1924">That was helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Well, as I say, it seems to me that they put some kind of an ointment on my wounds and they were somewhat helpful, so that the oozing stopped.</span> <span id="s1926">It looked like Vaseline, but I can't believe that Vaseline alone could have cured, but anyway, at least the things were not full of mud and dirt, which I would have gotten in the regular barracks, or even going to work.</span> <span id="s1927">So there were bandages, they bandaged my legs and they were at least kept clean.</span> <span id="s1928">I was a pretty healthy and strong person at that time and I guess it was my resistance and just my natural ability to heal.</span> <span id="s1929">And to this day I heal very well.</span> <span id="s1930">I get a cut on my finger and two days later it is gone, so maybe it was just my ability to heal well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: And you mentioned that you left the hospital before you were completely healed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1933">I left the hospital because of the on coming selection.</span> <span id="s1934">And the doctors that were there, the women doctors, they were Jewish women doctors.</span> <span id="s1935">They were afraid that the selection may not be very selective and they may just reduce the number of patients so they didn't want anybody who was well enough to walk out, was asked to walk out.</span> <span id="s1936">And as I say, after that, I went back to my barrack and I was able to stand the roll call and I was able to walk to that place where we were plaiting the braids.</span> <span id="s1937">And sitting all day, I could still keep my bandages on my legs and then I think a couple of times, as I recall, I went to the hospital and I had the bandages changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">Q: Did you ever see Yannosh (ph), you're husband, during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: Yannosh (ph) disappeared about half way.</span> <span id="s1940">I think I saw him a few times and I said he came on some errands, he brought some stuff with the other workers to the camp.</span> <span id="s1941">And I don't know exactly what, and I was able to say a few words to him.</span> <span id="s1942">But it was not more than two or three times.</span> <span id="s1943">The first time when he came was to, he told us that father died, and that was just maybe like a few days, maybe a week or so, maybe two weeks after we were separated into the different camps.</span> <span id="s1944">He died very soon after he got there.</span> <span id="s1945">But I didn't see Yannosh (ph) maybe for three months and after that I didn't see him anymore.</span> <span id="s1946">I don't think I saw him after October.</span> <span id="s1947">As I remember, the last time I saw him was the weather was still bearable and then in October it started to get very cold and snow, and I know I didn't see him anymore.</span> <span id="s1948">And I told you before that when I was in Paris, that there were two guys that said that they knew him in camp and that he was selected and that they never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1949">And evidently because he was crippled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Do you remember that last time you saw him?</span> <span id="s1951">What you said to him, what you said to each other?</span> <span id="s1952">Anything about that last time you saw him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: I didn't know it would be the last time.</span> <span id="s1954">I didn't think that each time was the last time, but there was very little that we could say to each other.</span> <span id="s1955">It was, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: And you mentioned there was another place that you were working, beside in that, another place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Yes, I was also working on some kind of a brick-laying place.</span> <span id="s1958">And I remember one thing, that one of the guards complimented me.</span> <span id="s1959">That I had a very good ability to measure the distances because my bricks were laid very evenly and I was spreading the mortar, I think I was buttering a slice of bread, and that the bricks were built very, very evenly and very nice.</span> <span id="s1960">And what we were working, and that was a very short time that we were working on it, were large, round, brick structures.</span> <span id="s1961">It doesn't seem to me that they were ever finished, but by then we, of course, we knew exactly about the crematoria and we knew about everything else.</span> <span id="s1962">And what these structures were suppose to be was, and I don't know whether that was the hearsay or whatever, but that's what we were kind of hearing, that these were going to be special extermination places with sort of electrical contraptions that would be electrical crematoria and electrical killing, the high voltage.</span> <span id="s1963">But I don't know whether that was true and I never really found out what these structures were.</span> <span id="s1964">And when we were in Auschwitz, I was telling Robert about these structures and the first time we went to Auschwitz he says, that's what you described.</span> <span id="s1965">And I said, yes, that's what I was working on.</span> <span id="s1966">And we never found out in Auschwitz what these things were supposed to be.</span> <span id="s1967">But it was very, we probably will go again and I'll try to find out what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: They were in Birkenau, these structures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: In Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1970">Right past the crematoriums, or along side the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1971">And I don't think they were ever finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: You mentioned earlier that by the time you got to Auschwitz you were hearing more news of the war and of the outside world.</span> <span id="s1973">Do you recall some of the news that you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1975">I just know that, well actually it was more in Auschwitz than in Belsen-Bergen.</span> <span id="s1976">In Belsen-Bergen, whatever news we got was when the new transport came.</span> <span id="s1977">But all the transports that were coming to Bergen-Belsen were mainly from Holland or from other countries, from smaller countries.</span> <span id="s1978">And they were very small transports.</span> <span id="s1979">And it seems like, as I mentioned before, that they all seemed to be of prisoners or some political people that were rather taken care of.</span> <span id="s1980">As I say, we weren't, we didn't seem to be doomed or anything.</span> <span id="s1981">Just like the Holland diamond cutters, they were being sort of guarded and preserved.</span> <span id="s1982">And so, if a new transport came, they might have told us what was going on.</span> <span id="s1983">But we really didn't know.</span> <span id="s1984">But while we were in Auschwitz, there were underground radios and then also there were a lot of workers who were going outside and coming back in the evening and they would bring some news that what was happening on the front and what was happening with the war.</span> <span id="s1985">And at one point we knew that the Russians were coming and that the siege of Warsaw, and things like that.</span> <span id="s1986">That there was an uprising in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1987">And I just don't remember really.</span> <span id="s1988">We were much more concerned about surviving from day to day than worrying what was happening outside.</span> <span id="s1989">There were raids, air raids.</span> <span id="s1990">There were quite a few air raids and we were hoping that they will bomb but they didn't.</span> <span id="s1991">The airplanes were swooping down but they were never really throwing any bombs on the crematoria and we were disappointed because we thought that maybe they would destroy the crematorium, they couldn't be used.</span> <span id="s1992">But they were saying that it was the American planes that were coming.</span> <span id="s1993">And we could hear the anti-craft shooting, but I don't think they ever shot down any planes either, but they were just shooting at them.</span> <span id="s1994">And so, but we really had very, very little contact with the outside world.</span> <span id="s1995">And when we were in Bergen-Belsen, we didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s1996">But we haven't gotten to Bergen-Belsen yet.</span> <span id="s1997">We are still in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1998">A couple escaped, there were people escaping.</span> <span id="s1999">And we witnessed one hanging of a couple that escaped.</span> <span id="s2000">And we understand that there were more escapes and more hangings, but we did witness one.</span> <span id="s2001">And there were also suicides.</span> <span id="s2002">I mean, it was very easy to commit suicide if you could just get to the high voltage wires.</span> <span id="s2003">And some people did.</span> <span id="s2004">Another thing that happened that was quite a regular occurrence were the latrines.</span> <span id="s2005">I mean, we had to go when we were ordered to go and I don't know whether you saw the pictures, I didn't see any pictures in here of the latrines, but it was a cement kind of a block in the center of the barrack with holes.</span> <span id="s2006">A double row of holes.</span> <span id="s2007">And you were supposed to do your business there.</span> <span id="s2008">And that sure was not a very pleasant sight or a very pleasant time.</span> <span id="s2009">And this one thing that I was really suffering from was constipation and to this day I still have to be very careful what I eat and what I do and the timing because, I don't want to talk about it, Robert.</span> <span id="s2010">But maybe this is important that it is recorded too.</span> <span id="s2011">I mean, you don't like to talk about these things, but I remember one night.</span> <span id="s2012">I mean, at night if we had to go, there was a bucket.</span> <span id="s2013">And I remember one night I had to go and the cappo (ph) would not let, and I think it was Betsy with me, they wouldn't let us until we emptied the bucket.</span> <span id="s2014">And the bucket was about, like a 30 gallon garbage can, maybe 25 gallon garbage can, I know it wasn't as high as that, it was about this high.</span> <span id="s2015">And she said we have to carry the garbage can to the latrine, there was a ditch that you poured it in, before we can use it.</span> <span id="s2016">And that's not a very pleasant feeling either.</span> <span id="s2017">Especially when, if you do have an accident, there's no clean clothes that you can put on.</span> <span id="s2018">And there is no way of washing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: So two people would carry these buckets and these buckets are about two or three feet high?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: About two and a half feet high.</span> <span id="s2021">Like a garbage can, but it was more like a drum with sort of handles, wire handles or something, and we carried that.</span> <span id="s2022">And it was pretty full.</span> <span id="s2023">And we were trying to carry it very carefully so that it wouldn't splash because, as I said, if it splashed on us we had no way of clean up and these probably were the worst times.</span> <span id="s2024">Probably much worse than not having enough food.</span> <span id="s2025">Because you really dealt with, I don't really want to say, but it was shit.</span> <span id="s2026">[Laughter] But that's what it was.</span> <span id="s2027">And I can't understand how I can laugh now, I really can't.</span> <span id="s2028">But I do.</span> <span id="s2029">Maybe that's why I survived.</span> <span id="s2030">Maybe that's why I'm not completely crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: You mentioned that there were hangings going on, or that you witnessed one hanging.</span> <span id="s2032">What was the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: They escaped and they were caught.</span> <span id="s2034">They were brought back.</span> <span id="s2035">There were more hangings in Prostejov and they always made hangings public to scare us, I suppose.</span> <span id="s2036">But my brother was in Prostejov and he had a girlfriend.</span> <span id="s2037">And I think he was quite fond of her and he was still able to go out because he was going to work in the factory, that was after my father was already gone.</span> <span id="s2038">And he came, I never saw him cry.</span> <span id="s2039">He was a very brave guy.</span> <span id="s2040">And that time he came in and I had a place to meet him and I would bring him some food and stuff.</span> <span id="s2041">And he said that they were, that they did hang the girl and some other people with her.</span> <span id="s2042">And why?</span> <span id="s2043">Somebody tried to escape and they caught them and then they just took people at random and she was one of them.</span> <span id="s2044">And he said, it could have been him, it could have been anybody else, but they did hang her.</span> <span id="s2045">So, I try not to think about these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape or do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: No.</span> <span id="s2048">Because we knew that it was impossible.</span> <span id="s2049">I mean, the people that did escape, I really don't know of anybody that escaped and wasn't caught.</span> <span id="s2050">Because the way the camp was situated, it wasn't like there were woods and you can just hide and whatnot, unless you had really help from the outside.</span> <span id="s2051">And I really don't know much about it.</span> <span id="s2052">All I know is that between the barbed wire, electrified, and the guards in the towers, and the dogs, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s2053">That anybody who would try might as well finish off on the wires.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: When were you deported to Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">[End of Side A of Tape 5]</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: I had just asked you when you were deported again to Bergen-Belsen from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2058">It was December and I believe it was December the 29th because the trip lasted about four days, maybe three.</span> <span id="s2059">I don't know, but all I know is that New Year's Eve was on the train because the German soldiers, the SS men, the guards were celebrating.</span> <span id="s2060">And __________, that's the toast they were making, and yelling and drinking.</span> <span id="s2061">And I swore that if I ever get out, I will always be very happy on New Years Eve.</span> <span id="s2062">I will always remember the night on the train.</span> <span id="s2063">And I do remember it.</span> <span id="s2064">I even remember thinking, my hair was about maybe an inch and a half long or maybe a little bit longer but it was still very, very short, and I was just wondering, just dreaming that maybe by the next New Years Eve my hair will be long enough to go to a party.</span> <span id="s2065">And I was in Paris a year later.</span> <span id="s2066">And I had a big barrel of champagne and I think I got really, really plastered.</span> <span id="s2067">My hair wasn't long enough to be really good but it was long enough.</span> <span id="s2068">It was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">Q: The train ride took how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s2071">I think, I am quite sure that it, you see, some of the dates I try to remember, but I think it was the 29th in the evening because it was dark and I remember Doot-sie (ph) jumping up and down trying to join us.</span> <span id="s2072">They separated her from Betsy and me because we were going to go on the train.</span> <span id="s2073">And I don't know what was better, whether to stay in the camp or to go on the train, but we had no choice.</span> <span id="s2074">And I felt very, very bad about leaving her because her mother was gone all ready and she was just left alone.</span> <span id="s2075">And I know she was crying and she looked like a skeleton all ready and we didn't look much better, but she looked really bad.</span> <span id="s2076">And that's why they didn't let her go.</span> <span id="s2077">They selected people that were in a better shape I guess, so I didn't think that I'll ever see her again, and I didn't.</span> <span id="s2078">But I also thought that I wouldn't see her again because she wouldn't survive the ordeal.</span> <span id="s2079">But she did survive.</span> <span id="s2080">And I think I mentioned all about her before, but anyway Betsy and I were put on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">Q: Can we go back just a bit to when you mentioned Doot-sie (ph) mother had already been separated from you.</span> <span id="s2082">Will you tell me when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Well that happened about two or three weeks before.</span> <span id="s2084">You see, we went to sauna and the de-lousing so-called.</span> <span id="s2085">And when we were completely undressed, you see the routine was as I said we bundled our clothes and put it on this cart which was wheeled into the de-lousing compound which I think were the temporary, provisional little gas chambers, but anyway, that's where we were.</span> <span id="s2086">In a room where we undressed and then the SS men came in and started to whip right and left, right and left.</span> <span id="s2087">And Doot-sie (ph) mother was by then, she was an older woman, I mean today its not an older woman if you're in you're late 50's or so.</span> <span id="s2088">But she was in a bad shape and she was really very, very skinny and very old looking.</span> <span id="s2089">And so she was pushed away together with some other older women and Doot-sie (ph) and I and Betsy were pushed to the right to go to the sauna.</span> <span id="s2090">And I remember Doot-sie (ph) really went into hysterics and she ran to her mother and they were holding onto her and the guards were just whipping her and pushing her and really separated us.</span> <span id="s2091">And they pushed us into the sauna and closed the door.</span> <span id="s2092">And Doot-sie (ph) was in complete hysterics because she was really, really always very close to her mother.</span> <span id="s2093">Then we went through the bath and went back to our barracks.</span> <span id="s2094">And I know she cried all night.</span> <span id="s2095">But then we found out that the mother was in so-called Shonin's (ph) block where they kept people supposedly that weren't able to work anymore and they were kind of sheltered.</span> <span id="s2096">And taken care of.</span> <span id="s2097">And she cried and she was very philosophical about it when we saw her.</span> <span id="s2098">She says, well, I suppose I'm going out through the chimney.</span> <span id="s2099">And Doot-sie (ph) went into hysterics and the mother said that she was very, very thirsty.</span> <span id="s2100">That the soup that they got was terribly salty and they didn't get any water.</span> <span id="s2101">And there was no way we could bring her any water.</span> <span id="s2102">I mean, we couldn't carry it in the bowl because they would have seen it and there were no bottles and she said that she really just lost the will to live.</span> <span id="s2103">Mainly because she was so terribly thirsty.</span> <span id="s2104">And we came the next day again to see her and she was in a worse case even.</span> <span id="s2105">And she said that she was just too weak to even walk.</span> <span id="s2106">And then I guess that evening they finished them off because we came the next day and, I'm quite sure we saw her at least twice.</span> <span id="s2107">And then the next day they were all gone.</span> <span id="s2108">The barrack was empty.</span> <span id="s2109">You see, we could move around after work.</span> <span id="s2110">I mean, we sometimes would get a permission to go out and go to the other barrack.</span> <span id="s2111">So they were just taken to the gas.</span> <span id="s2112">And evidently we were told too by the old timers that the people that they were going to gas, they were fed salty food, very salty soups so that they were so thirsty that they would just going half crazy and they would just as soon go into the gas chamber than to suffer.</span> <span id="s2113">So they just went.</span> <span id="s2114">They were not fighting or they were not trying to save themselves.</span> <span id="s2115">The faster the better.</span> <span id="s2116">So, she was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Was Doot-sie (ph) younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: Oh no, Doot-sie (ph) was quite a bit older.</span> <span id="s2119">No, she was, I don't remember, in the book it says what year she was born, but Yannick (ph) was born in 1921 and Doot-sie (ph) might have been five years older, five or six years older.</span> <span id="s2120">They were the only two children that they had.</span> <span id="s2121">But she was quite a bit older.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: And when the day of the selection came, did you have any forewarning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A: No.</span> <span id="s2124">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s2125">We had no idea of what was going on.</span> <span id="s2126">And again, it was, they gave us a bath again.</span> <span id="s2127">All the selections were taking place in saunas.</span> <span id="s2128">And I had no idea whether Doot-sie (ph) was taken to the gas chamber or whether she was just selected out to stay.</span> <span id="s2129">But I know that the people that were selected to go, we had to, I think we were bathed again.</span> <span id="s2130">I mean, we took a shower.</span> <span id="s2131">And then got the clothes from the de-lousing cart and after that we were kept in a sort of a compound by the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s2132">And I think we were allowed to take the blanket.</span> <span id="s2133">Because we used the blankets for shawls and for, and the blankets had to go through de-lousing, so I am quite sure that we came to Bergen-Belsen with blankets, because we were not given any when we were there.</span> <span id="s2134">Because in Bergen-Belsen we, it was just bare floor and some bunks.</span> <span id="s2135">But Betsy and I were sleeping on the floor, not on the bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: And when you left were you taken in a train immediately or did you go in a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: No, I think we were loaded on the train and I don't think it was more than an hour or so that the train left.</span> <span id="s2138">I think they loaded us up and it wasn't like the other transports.</span> <span id="s2139">You know, that they kept us on the train and we weren't really very squished either.</span> <span id="s2140">I mean, it was squishy but we could sort of stretch out.</span> <span id="s2141">I mean it wasn't like standing room only.</span> <span id="s2142">And it was more like they were transporting us to use us for something and not to exterminate us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: But you had no idea where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: We had no idea where we were going.</span> <span id="s2145">And we just knew that we were going away from the crematoria.</span> <span id="s2146">So we were rather hopeful.</span> <span id="s2147">We were rather hopeful.</span> <span id="s2148">And when we arrived in Bergen-Belsen, somehow we heard that it was Bergen-Belsen, and Betsy and I were very happy and we were telling everybody what a wonderful place it was after Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2149">That, oh, oh, we are so lucky that we are in Bergen-Belsen because this will be really just a resort compared with Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2150">Resort my foot!</span> <span id="s2151">It wasn't a resort.</span> <span id="s2152">By then it was pretty crowded.</span> <span id="s2153">It was quite crowded.</span> <span id="s2154">And the facilities, I don't know what they did with the bathrooms and I don't know what they did with the lavatories and everything else because I just don't remember running water anymore.</span> <span id="s2155">And I don't remember latrines.</span> <span id="s2156">I think we were using buckets.</span> <span id="s2157">Because I just don't remember that there was bathrooms or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2158">If there were any they were not in our barrack.</span> <span id="s2159">And at that time, I was, the barrack that we were in were not just the Hungarian women.</span> <span id="s2160">There were Polish women and from all over and there were Czech women and there were different nationalities.</span> <span id="s2161">There were no gypsies as I recall, but our barrack had women of all nationalities and I remember the three sisters from Poland.</span> <span id="s2162">Carmella was the oldest one, and then there were, I don't remember the names of the two others, but one couldn't have been more than thirteen.</span> <span id="s2163">She was a skinny little thing and not very pretty.</span> <span id="s2164">And then there was the middle sister who was quite nice looking and Carmella was just simply beautiful.</span> <span id="s2165">And Carmella was very, very talented and she could draw beautifully and I don't know where she got the paper from, but the whole time, and she had pencil, and the whole time she was drawing and writing poems.</span> <span id="s2166">And I don't know whatever happened to them.</span> <span id="s2167">Carmella was the first one to die.</span> <span id="s2168">And I remember waking up in the morning and hearing the younger sister cried, that Carmel-ka is dead, Carmel-ka is dead!</span> <span id="s2169">And they were both sobbing and whining.</span> <span id="s2170">And there were many more people that were dead and when they died, we just dragged them outside.</span> <span id="s2171">And at that time there were still the commandos for the dead people and they would tie straps to the wrists and to their feet and they would drag them.</span> <span id="s2172">Two people would drag each cadaver to the ditch.</span> <span id="s2173">And then, three days later the middle sister died.</span> <span id="s2174">And then the little one died probably a week later.</span> <span id="s2175">And I remember waking up in the morning and seeing the little one on all fours, sort of scrunched up and I think she went to the bathroom, just being scrunched up like that.</span> <span id="s2176">And she was dead.</span> <span id="s2177">And we dragged her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Was it typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: Typhus.</span> <span id="s2180">Now the little one died of typhus and Carmella I think died of typhus and the edema.</span> <span id="s2181">And the middle one died, she wasn't swollen.</span> <span id="s2182">The two younger ones weren't but Carmella was.</span> <span id="s2183">And then I remember this one woman, we woke up in the morning and she was on the upper bunk and she was so swollen that she looked Japanese.</span> <span id="s2184">Her eyes were just slits in her face and it just was, this was something that was really amazing.</span> <span id="s2185">That it's really not, I came across a medical report book in Poland, in polish, and I tried to find that syndrome and I don't think it was ever really described.</span> <span id="s2186">So I don't know, I didn't really research it very much but I would like to spend some time in the library and see what, if they have anything of that sort described.</span> <span id="s2187">But it was just amazing that, if you woke up with you're eyes swelling you were dead in less than three days.</span> <span id="s2188">And as I understand just a good dose of dietetic probably would have cured everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: When was it that you arrived in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: We arrived in Bergen-Belsen after New Years, that was 1945.</span> <span id="s2191">I think it was January 1st because it seems to me that when they were toasting and screaming and yelling it was New Years' and I think that we arrived in Bergen-Belsen the next day.</span> <span id="s2192">Sometime late in the evening, late in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: Did you work at all while you were in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: No.</span> <span id="s2195">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2196">We didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s2197">We just sat there and we still had our bowls.</span> <span id="s2198">The bowls were more precious than gold because if you didn't have a bowl you did not, you couldn't hold soup in you're hands.</span> <span id="s2199">Maybe I, no, I don't remember whether I, I think I wanted to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s2200">Because you could steal a potato.</span> <span id="s2201">It seems to me that maybe I did because I remember eating raw potatoes because we had no way of cooking them.</span> <span id="s2202">But I remember that I was surprised, I had never ate a raw potato before, that it tasted a little bit like an apple without the apple taste, except the texture was more like an apple.</span> <span id="s2203">But, maybe I did.</span> <span id="s2204">But I just don't really remember.</span> <span id="s2205">The whole time in Bergen-Belsen is just one big fog.</span> <span id="s2206">And one thing happened and it was like a miracle because I was outside and I looked up and there was Mrs. Gi-gen-ska (ph).</span> <span id="s2207">I saw Mrs. Gi-gen-ska (ph) and I thought I died.</span> <span id="s2208">And I was back in Krakow.</span> <span id="s2209">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2210">And she didn't have her hair shaved or anything and she was with her cane, she was limping because she had something wrong with her leg.</span> <span id="s2211">And she had her cane and she recognized me.</span> <span id="s2212">Actually I recognized her because she looked just like she did.</span> <span id="s2213">She was blonde and she had sort of wavy hair and she had her nice clothes on.</span> <span id="s2214">Not the rags that we had.</span> <span id="s2215">And I looked at her and I called her _____________ and she recognized me of sorts.</span> <span id="s2216">She couldn't believe that Anya (ph), Anya (ph) was my name, and we hugged and we kissed and I wanted to know what she was doing there.</span> <span id="s2217">And she was in a different part of the camp but she just happened to be in that common area.</span> <span id="s2218">You see, we were not standing up hill anymore, we were not counted.</span> <span id="s2219">We just kind of existed.</span> <span id="s2220">And she was in a very good shape.</span> <span id="s2221">And you know that except hugging with her and kissing her, I had no recollection anymore of what happened.</span> <span id="s2222">And I don't think I saw her again.</span> <span id="s2223">And not until three years ago when Rena Chic-kin-ska (ph), her daughter, got my address.</span> <span id="s2224">Well actually no, she didn't get my address.</span> <span id="s2225">Ches-ruf (ph) wrote to Chin-ut-sa's (ph) wife, I introduced them and they were boyfriend and girlfriend at some time, and Ches-ruf (ph) send me Rena's letter.</span> <span id="s2226">Just like the Red Cross does.</span> <span id="s2227">If you write to the Red Cross and you want an address of you're cousin somewhere, they won’t do it.</span> <span id="s2228">You give them the letter that you want you're cousin to get and then they send it to you're cousin, and then the cousin decides whether he wants to correspond with you or not.</span> <span id="s2229">So Ches-ruf (ph) decided the same thing.</span> <span id="s2230">He send me Rena's letter and he said that Rena said that she knew me from school and she wanted to get in touch with me.</span> <span id="s2231">One of the reasons that she wanted to get in touch, she knew that I was alive, at least that I was alive in 1945 because her mother saw me in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2232">You see, I couldn't even remember whether I saw her in Auschwitz or I saw her in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2233">But Rena wrote that I saw her in Bergen-Belsen and what Rena wanted was, she went to Israel, they were not Jewish but she married a Jewish man after the war, a writer.</span> <span id="s2234">A play writer and a play critic in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2235">That's another story, but anyway she went to Israel and she witnessed the Ad-va-shem (ph) ceremony for the Righteous.</span> <span id="s2236">And she thought that maybe her mother was dead already, she died of a heart attack in I think 1983 or 1982.</span> <span id="s2237">And she thought that her mother was helping a lot of Jews and among them she was helping my family.</span> <span id="s2238">That maybe I could write a testimonial and see whether they could get a medal for her.</span> <span id="s2239">And so I wrote back to Rena and I wanted to know more about her mother and she said that it was Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2240">That what happened was her mother was helping a lot of people and one of them was smuggling weapons to the resistance or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2241">And they caught her finally.</span> <span id="s2242">Just before the Auschwitz was to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s2243">And they sent her to Auschwitz and when the train arrived, they decided they didn't need any more prisoners in Auschwitz and they sent her off to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2244">And she was just plain lucky because if she arrived in Auschwitz three weeks earlier or so she would have been put straight into the gas chamber with her limping leg.</span> <span id="s2245">And this way she had, even she had her cane with her, they didn't take it away from her.</span> <span id="s2246">And she had still her normal clothes and she was never tattooed because the train arrived, as Rena said, the train arrived in Auschwitz and then her mother was sent to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2247">And she stayed in Bergen-Belsen until, that I got all from Rena, until October because she did have typhus too.</span> <span id="s2248">And so she stayed in Bergen-Belsen and then she was sent back to Krakow.</span> <span id="s2249">So that's how Rena knew that I was alive, because her mother saw me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: You mentioned that you had a bowl in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2251">Did you bring it from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: Oh, the bowl was from Auschwitz, the bowl was from Auschwitz, but I didn't bring the bowl.</span> <span id="s2253">I brought all kinds of other things.</span> <span id="s2254">I brought the pill.</span> <span id="s2255">I bought the cyanide capsule for about four rations of bread that I saved.</span> <span id="s2256">Because I wasn't going to go to the gas chamber again.</span> <span id="s2257">They didn't bring that.</span> <span id="s2258">And I had a knife and was going to cut my veins.</span> <span id="s2259">I didn't have to.</span> <span id="s2260">I think I brought the knife with me, but I don't know whether my cousin took it away from me.</span> <span id="s2261">It was just a small pocketknife.</span> <span id="s2262">Because you see, you could buy anything in the camp from the Canada people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: You bought the knife and the pill while you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Yes, that was still in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">End of Tape 5.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Tape 6</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: We're in Bergen-Belsen and you were telling me about you're seeing Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph).</span> <span id="s2268">You were telling me a little bit about after you had seen her and her daughter and you had the correspondence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Oh and about her daughter, that she wrote to me, and anyways to make this story just complete, that I spent quite some time remembering all of the events from the time I decided to get married.</span> <span id="s2270">Because it was Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) that recommended that I, that Yannick and I get married.</span> <span id="s2271">And this way I can, she was a very clever woman.</span> <span id="s2272">She really, she was divorced, separated or divorced from her husband and she had this jewelry store.</span> <span id="s2273">And actually, as I found out, it wasn't, I just met her just after the war started and I found out that the store really was not hers.</span> <span id="s2274">It belonged to a Jewish woman, and I have her name, I forget, but she turned it over just like my father turned over his tannery to the Mos-tof-ski (ph) family.</span> <span id="s2275">This woman, Helena I think was her first name, turned over her store to Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) and it was Chi-chin-ska's Perfumery and Jewelry.</span> <span id="s2276">It was costume jewelry mainly.</span> <span id="s2277">And she was running a very good business and sometimes she was paying some of the profits to the Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s2278">And I don't know exactly what happened, if she survived the war or not, but anyway this is what was happening as far as Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was concerned.</span> <span id="s2279">And she had a lot of connections and a lot of wisdom on how to run a business.</span> <span id="s2280">And as I say, she helped our family to find places to live as we had to keep on moving, and then also we were selling some of the jewelry and things and she always got a very good price for it and sold it for us.</span> <span id="s2281">So I wrote it all up, about fourteen pages, very detailed for Yat-va-sham (ph) and they accepted it.</span> <span id="s2282">And actually, it was not just Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) but Rena at that time was, she was just about a year younger than I and she was helping too.</span> <span id="s2283">And one of the things that she was doing, you know that Doot-sie (ph) and her mother were giving the English lessons in their apartment, and Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was in her store and Rena was directing the traffic of all the students.</span> <span id="s2284">She was sort of on the look-out to make sure that there is no police and there is no suspicion, that there are people are coming and going because they had lessons every hour of the hour.</span> <span id="s2285">So Rena was very much involved in this whole business too.</span> <span id="s2286">So they both were recognized and I have a photograph of Rena receiving the medal, for her and her mother.</span> <span id="s2287">And a certificate, so they got it a year ago.</span> <span id="s2288">So that's the story of Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph).</span> <span id="s2289">Oh, and she said that her mother came home from Bergen-Belsen emaciated and sick, but she recovered very fast and then they lived in Krakow for some time and she died of a heart attack in church.</span> <span id="s2290">One Sunday they went to Mass and she died.</span> <span id="s2291">So I think she was in her late 80's, so Rena was at peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: You came down with typhus as well while you were in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2294">And actually that probably somewhat might have saved my life.</span> <span id="s2295">Because when the British came, I was just recovering from typhus.</span> <span id="s2296">I had edema but it was not as progressive as the ones that killed people in three days.</span> <span id="s2297">I remember crawling on my hands and knees because my legs were so swollen, it wasn't just my ankles but I think they were swollen all the way to my knees.</span> <span id="s2298">And my hands were swollen.</span> <span id="s2299">But somehow my eyes and my face weren't as bad.</span> <span id="s2300">And I remember I barely could walk.</span> <span id="s2301">And there were two or three steps into the barrack.</span> <span id="s2302">I think the barracks were not on a foundation, but on stilts.</span> <span id="s2303">And I know that I crawled up and I just barely could walk.</span> <span id="s2304">Now we are coming very close to the liberation now.</span> <span id="s2305">Because I started, that that saved my life, that I did have typhus, because I had no appetite.</span> <span id="s2306">I know that I hadn't eaten anything for several days.</span> <span id="s2307">I know I was very thirsty and I just don't remember that there was water available.</span> <span id="s2308">I know people can't live without water, but I just don't remember having any water to drink.</span> <span id="s2309">And we knew that something was going on because we could hear shooting, and heavy shooting.</span> <span id="s2310">And it seemed to me like there were air raids all the time because the sirens were going.</span> <span id="s2311">And the guards seemed to be sort of not paying much attention to us and we didn't get any food.</span> <span id="s2312">And I don't remember how long it was that we didn't get any food.</span> <span id="s2313">And then when we woke up in the morning there were no guards.</span> <span id="s2314">And I remember crawling out and seeing people running towards the gates and the gates were open.</span> <span id="s2315">There were big, wooden gates.</span> <span id="s2316">They were not barbed wire gates, they were wooden gates.</span> <span id="s2317">And there were big wooden posts.</span> <span id="s2318">And there were no guards, and in the towers there were no guards, anywhere.</span> <span id="s2319">And we couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2320">And then the first tank came in.</span> <span id="s2321">And they were British.</span> <span id="s2322">They had barrettes and the Germans did not wear berets.</span> <span id="s2323">And they had kind of greenish uniforms, not the blue-green but the yellow-green.</span> <span id="s2324">They had jackets.</span> <span id="s2325">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2326">I don't think that I could believe either.</span> <span id="s2327">I forgot to tell you what the camp looked like by then.</span> <span id="s2328">First of all, there were dead people all over the place.</span> <span id="s2329">And there was, I don't want to use the bad word, but there was shit all over because everybody had diarrhea or there was no, they couldn't get to the latrine and they just did it where ever they stood.</span> <span id="s2330">And you couldn't even walk.</span> <span id="s2331">And there was, I don't know whether it is recorded or not, but there was cannibalism going on.</span> <span id="s2332">I remember.</span> <span id="s2333">It was before the British tanks.</span> <span id="s2334">For several days when we didn't get any food or anything and I saw people with their stomachs open and they were eating liver.</span> <span id="s2335">I saw it.</span> <span id="s2336">Robert likes liver.</span> <span id="s2337">And, don't, please, please Robert.</span> <span id="s2338">I want you to go back and erase it, please.</span> <span id="s2339">Will you erase it now before I . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">[Tape partially erased here]</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">A: People were dying all over and they were just cadavers all over the place.</span> <span id="s2342">And I probably should say dead people.</span> <span id="s2343">And they, the Germans, that was before the Germans escaped.</span> <span id="s2344">They were making us, I didn't because I couldn't walk, but whoever could, say they dragged them.</span> <span id="s2345">They dragged them to the ditches, but they didn't have enough help.</span> <span id="s2346">They didn't have enough help to clean everything so when the British came, the place was just absolutely covered with dead people.</span> <span id="s2347">Just piles of them.</span> <span id="s2348">Some of them were piled up and some of them were just scattered around, everywhere.</span> <span id="s2349">And people just defecating and relieving themselves right where they stood.</span> <span id="s2350">It was just horrible.</span> <span id="s2351">And, and before that, there was this one time, a few weeks before that, when they drowned a girl in a bucket of soup.</span> <span id="s2352">You know, they would bring the, that was when they were still cooking for us.</span> <span id="s2353">The soup was turnips or potatoes or whatever.</span> <span id="s2354">And they brought it in and people were so hungry that they were storming at it and pushing and pulling and one of the women leaned over and they pushed her, just right into the bucket of soup.</span> <span id="s2355">And she couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s2356">The rest were dipping.</span> <span id="s2357">I, I, I, she drowned.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: You described seeing the soldiers coming.</span> <span id="s2359">You knew they weren't German.</span> <span id="s2360">Did you know that they were British?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2362">We knew that they, because I said that they looked different.</span> <span id="s2363">I don't remember the markings on the tanks or anything, or the cars, or the trucks, but they had different uniforms.</span> <span id="s2364">They had round sort of caps and they had jackets.</span> <span id="s2365">And they drove into the camp and stopped the trucks and people who could walk or run just swarmed them the guys really had to protect themselves.</span> <span id="s2366">They had cigarettes and they had chocolate bars and they were throwing them and people were killing themselves for that, and so they stopped because people were just killing each other to get hold of the chocolate.</span> <span id="s2367">And I just don't remember what happened exactly, but it seems to me that more and more of them came and somehow the people that were well enough, more of the newcomers, like Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was one of the newcomers, I think those were trying to put some kind of an order into the place and put us back into the barracks until more soldiers came in so that they could somehow control the crowds.</span> <span id="s2368">And the first thing that they did, they opened the kitchen and they cooked this food.</span> <span id="s2369">They brought out big barrels of the food that they cooked and it was some kind of British rations that were just a fantastic stew with big chunks of salt, pork or whatever, it was fat.</span> <span id="s2370">And it was just absolutely smelling deliciously and people just went crazy and they really had to push them around to be able to ration this stuff out.</span> <span id="s2371">And I remember getting a bowl of it and eating it with my fingers and I think I took one mouthful and I couldn't swallow it.</span> <span id="s2372">I just couldn't eat anything.</span> <span id="s2373">I just got sick to my stomach and I just left the bowl there and I just didn't care.</span> <span id="s2374">I remember crawling back into the barrack and Betsy couldn't eat either.</span> <span id="s2375">Betsy also had typhus and she, we both cried because we were so hungry and we just wanted water.</span> <span id="s2376">There was plenty of water to drink too.</span> <span id="s2377">They had cups and we could drink.</span> <span id="s2378">But we couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s2379">But there were a lot of people who were just gorging themselves with that stuff.</span> <span id="s2380">And they were all dead the next day.</span> <span id="s2381">They all got diarrhea and that place was really then horrible.</span> <span id="s2382">Because they had diarrhea in the barrack, they had diarrhea everywhere.</span> <span id="s2383">And evidently they couldn't eat that kind of food and that caused the diarrhea.</span> <span id="s2384">And people were just sick all over.</span> <span id="s2385">They were throwing up and that was probably worse than anything else.</span> <span id="s2386">And by then, it seems to me like the medical Corp arrived.</span> <span id="s2387">And they cooked up big drums of watery cereal, sort of a cream of wheat or something, but it mostly looked like watery stuff.</span> <span id="s2388">And they gave us that to eat and I remember I ate that, I think it was more like drinking.</span> <span id="s2389">I drank about two cups of it, but a lot of us thought that that wasn't food really and we were explained that our stomachs were not use to the rich food and we had to slowly get adjusted.</span> <span id="s2390">I remember the next portion was a little bit thicker until we finally got gruel, which is the normal thickness, but for at least three days.</span> <span id="s2391">And then also there was bread in storage but we didn't get it.</span> <span id="s2392">I mean, the Germans would not give us the bread but the British finally opened the stores and they found there was plenty of bread, which they never distributed.</span> <span id="s2393">So we did get bread.</span> <span id="s2394">And more and more British came and they started cleaning up the camp.</span> <span id="s2395">But the main thing was that the Germans could not, a lot of them did not escape.</span> <span id="s2396">And they hid in the camp and the Commander, Kramer, I think was his name, he was caught.</span> <span id="s2397">And the woman, I forget her name, the German woman, the main woman that was taking care of the women's camp, she was caught too.</span> <span id="s2398">And many others.</span> <span id="s2399">But Kramer was the one and the woman was the other one that we were all cheering, that they got caught.</span> <span id="s2400">And then what the British did that I never forget either, they had the German soldiers pile the corpses up in trucks and they had Kramer take his shirt off and lay naked at the top of the corpses.</span> <span id="s2401">And drive, they drove to the big ditches and buried the people.</span> <span id="s2402">And I know that the trucks were going back and forth, and back and forth, with all the dead people.</span> <span id="s2403">I don't know, I heard the figure that there were like 30,000 or so that were dead.</span> <span id="s2404">And then they were cleaning up the barracks and cleaning up the whole camp.</span> <span id="s2405">And then I have a vague recollection of what was going on, but I know that they had a scale and I guess the British doctors, they were weighing us and taking photographs.</span> <span id="s2406">And I remember I weighed 71 pounds.</span> <span id="s2407">I didn't know what pounds were, I just knew kilograms, but they were weighing us in pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: How tall were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: 5'1".</span> <span id="s2410">And, oh, but I know we got food.</span> <span id="s2411">That after a while we got bread and we got still a kind of not very thick soup and not much meat, but evidently very nutritious food because it seems to me like I gained weight, maybe five pounds in the first months or so.</span> <span id="s2412">That was April 14, 1945 when the gate opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">Q: Had you recovered from typhus at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: By then I was quite recovered.</span> <span id="s2415">I didn't have fever and I was recovered from typhus.</span> <span id="s2416">And I was, except for the swelling, which was going away, and I was getting stronger after I had the food and I was feeling better and better.</span> <span id="s2417">And it took about maybe two weeks for me to sort of recuperate.</span> <span id="s2418">And I was getting back my appetite.</span> <span id="s2419">But the main thing was that because I had typhus I didn't have any appetite and I didn't eat the gruel, the rich food that they gave us.</span> <span id="s2420">And then the big thing was that they de-loused us.</span> <span id="s2421">But they really de-loused us with DDT.</span> <span id="s2422">The system was that they had these pumped up, you know the containers with the pump, and we had to open our panties and they sprinkled the stuff and behind, into our dresses and into sleeves, and everywhere, and our hair.</span> <span id="s2423">We didn't know that DDT was quite toxic, but not only for the lice but for people, but I think at that point, nobody cared what was toxic.</span> <span id="s2424">The main thing was that we could see the lice just die, right on the spot.</span> <span id="s2425">So that was one of the great things that they did for us.</span> <span id="s2426">And we finally got rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s2427">But I never forget the DDT treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">End of Side A of Tape 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2430">Mrs. Ware, will you tell what happened to Betsy at this point?</span> <span id="s2431">Where was she in the camp?</span> <span id="s2432">Did she still have typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: Well when we were liberated, she was still sick and she was getting worse.</span> <span id="s2434">She couldn't eat anything and they opened the hospital.</span> <span id="s2435">I mean, the British opened the hospital and so that's where she went and I would go and visit her.</span> <span id="s2436">But then she recovered from typhus but she evidently had tuberculosis and so she was in the hospital the rest of the time.</span> <span id="s2437">Until I left.</span> <span id="s2438">So I just went to visit her and I just don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s2439">I searched in the books and the only thing that I found was a record of us being in Bergen-Belsen the first time.</span> <span id="s2440">But under the column of diseased, there was just blanks.</span> <span id="s2441">So I haven't, and then I searched other books and I have not found her name anywhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Will you describe you're memories of the British.</span> <span id="s2443">Did you have any particular recollections of relations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Not a lot because, first of all, we were absolutely overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s2445">I mean we just couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2446">It took a while to sort of sink into our brains that we didn't have to be up in the morning for a roll call, that we didn't have to be scared, that we were going to get food, that we were alive.</span> <span id="s2447">That maybe even we had a future.</span> <span id="s2448">And everybody was absolutely just wonderful to us.</span> <span id="s2449">They had tons of chocolate and cigarettes and they just, they were all for, I mean cigarettes and chocolates and anything else was just for the asking.</span> <span id="s2450">And they took a lot of photographs and I remember that they did weigh me and photograph me, just on the street.</span> <span id="s2451">It was nothing official.</span> <span id="s2452">And I was about 70 or 71 pounds, I was really skinny.</span> <span id="s2453">And still in the horrible clothing because they didn't have anything else to give us.</span> <span id="s2454">And I think we eventually got some better clothing and I don't know whether they brought them in from some warehouses or wherever, but I know that I did not wear the dress that I came in from Auschwitz, when my cousin took me.</span> <span id="s2455">So it seems to me that at one point I, see things went so fast and there is a one big blank of sorts, of the detailed day by day activities, but I know that one thing happened.</span> <span id="s2456">And it was shortly after the liberation when I was feeling better.</span> <span id="s2457">It might have been maybe two weeks later, maybe more, that I joined an excursion into the village.</span> <span id="s2458">And a lot of people were going into the adjoining villages and bringing food and clothing and it seems to me that that's where I got the dress that I was wearing later on.</span> <span id="s2459">And I remember going into one of the houses.</span> <span id="s2460">They were all abandoned, there were no, these were all German house, and it looked like people left in a great hurry.</span> <span id="s2461">And I remember going into one of the houses and there was silverware and a Lika camera and I always was very fond of Lika cameras, I had one and I had to leave it behind in Krakow when we were deported.</span> <span id="s2462">So I was just thrilled with the Lika camera.</span> <span id="s2463">I don't know what I was going to do with it, but somebody found a pillow case and we started to put the things, you know there were some table cloths and napkins and silverware and the Lika camera, and so we were putting those things in pillow cases.</span> <span id="s2464">And then somebody went down to the cellar or the basement and called us.</span> <span id="s2465">And there were about four women, there were four of us at that time, and so we went down.</span> <span id="s2466">And there were sausages and hams and a side of pork, I mean, there was food that we haven't seen for ages and it was just hanging from rafters and I think that's they way usually food was preserved.</span> <span id="s2467">It was all smoked and preserved and then just hanging dry.</span> <span id="s2468">Out went the silver and the Lika and everything else, out of the pillow cases, and we loaded it all up with as much food as we could carry, and we went back to the camp and we shared it with other people.</span> <span id="s2469">At that time we could already eat normal food.</span> <span id="s2470">And we still were hungry all the time even though we could get as much food as we wanted.</span> <span id="s2471">It seems to me that the kitchens were going day and night.</span> <span id="s2472">And we did not have to stand in line.</span> <span id="s2473">They set up tables in sort of cafeteria style and we sat at the tables and ate.</span> <span id="s2474">And it was just such a change that it was extremely difficult for us to grasp it and to really know that it is all for real.</span> <span id="s2475">Every time I thought, well, you know, we were dreaming about being free and going out and doing things.</span> <span id="s2476">And I thought I was still dreaming.</span> <span id="s2477">And we were just living in a completely unreal world.</span> <span id="s2478">And then one day, I met a young soldier, British soldier.</span> <span id="s2479">And he was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s2480">He spoke a little bit German and I didn't speak much English, but he was very friendly and we were not suppose to fraternize, or they weren't suppose to fraternize with the prisoners, so we were just holding hands and going for a walk.</span> <span id="s2481">And then he said that, he was a driver for one of the officers, for an older man.</span> <span id="s2482">And somehow I met his superior and he found out that I could speak several languages and he talked to me and he said, he has a job for me.</span> <span id="s2483">I should go to the hospital and also in the same building, or the building next to it, again I don't, these were all officer's quarters that the Germans lived in, and of course they were all abandoned.</span> <span id="s2484">He told me to go and he wrote it on a piece of papers to whom I should ask for, and I went there and they interviewed me.</span> <span id="s2485">And they thought that I would be just perfect for working in a records room, answering questions to people who are coming in looking for relatives and looking for other people.</span> <span id="s2486">So I thought this would be kind of neat.</span> <span id="s2487">And maybe that's when they gave me a different dress and I just don't quite remember.</span> <span id="s2488">But, oh, something else happened before that phase.</span> <span id="s2489">I went on another excursion into the village and we went very early in the morning, it was still very dark.</span> <span id="s2490">And we got there and the first house that we came to was locked up so we couldn't get in.</span> <span id="s2491">So we went around looking for a way to get in and I know it was not proper to do it, but at that point we didn't care.</span> <span id="s2492">We just wanted things and we wanted to, I don't know why, well, it wasn't called stealing, it was called organizing.</span> <span id="s2493">And in the camp that was the word I learned, that it wasn't stealing, you just organized to get things and to just have things.</span> <span id="s2494">So we went around and I heard, see I lived in the country before I was arrested, and I heard sort of a familiar sound, birds or something, so I was with two other women.</span> <span id="s2495">And we followed the sound and there was a coop with a goose inside.</span> <span id="s2496">A big, fat goose.</span> <span id="s2497">Well, that was more than we could bear.</span> <span id="s2498">I mean, that was the most beautiful sight.</span> <span id="s2499">And I stuck my hand in and the goose bit my finger, you know they snap.</span> <span id="s2500">And I grabbed her by the neck and I could pull her out, I mean she was fighting me.</span> <span id="s2501">It was a female goose I think because we found eggs inside, I mean inside the goose, because I had my little knife, I told you about the knife that I had.</span> <span id="s2502">I did an awful thing.</span> <span id="s2503">I cut the goose's head off with the little knife and it took a while.</span> <span id="s2504">[Laughing].</span> <span id="s2505">It was awful.</span> <span id="s2506">But, I mean, having seen all the blood and all the dead bodies, I mean just cutting a goose head was not that bad, I think.</span> <span id="s2507">But today I think it was awful and I don't know whether I should laugh or cry, but we pulled the goose out and we threw the head back in.</span> <span id="s2508">And we were walking back dragging the goose and then we were thinking what will happen if the people come back and they will just find the head.</span> <span id="s2509">Maybe they wanted to have the goose and the other girls were saying, forget it.</span> <span id="s2510">Nobody was worried about you.</span> <span id="s2511">We have the goose and we sat in a ditch and we plucked the feathers.</span> <span id="s2512">It took about an hour and the down and the feathers were flying all over the place.</span> <span id="s2513">And then we took the goose back to the camp.</span> <span id="s2514">That was before the kitchens were all set up properly and before we were getting the food in the cafeteria style.</span> <span id="s2515">We still were cooking outside on the little sort of stoves and in our bowls.</span> <span id="s2516">I mean, not stoves but on an open fire.</span> <span id="s2517">Anyway, I don't think I ate the goose.</span> <span id="s2518">I don't think I could eat it, but everybody was gorging themselves.</span> <span id="s2519">I think they barbecued of sorts because they baked it on the, they cut it up and they baked it on top of the fire, and I know I couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s2520">But to this day, I can't forget killing that poor goose.</span> <span id="s2521">So anyway, so that was before.</span> <span id="s2522">And then I went to get the job and they told me it was all right so I, they told me I will not be in the camp anymore.</span> <span id="s2523">I mean, stay in the barracks anymore but I will have my own room with a real bed.</span> <span id="s2524">And they told me where the room will be so I went upstairs and sure enough there was a bed and there was a mattress and there was a pillow, but there were no sheets and no blankets.</span> <span id="s2525">And I thought, well, I suppose maybe they will give me something.</span> <span id="s2526">So then I found out that there was a supply room downstairs.</span> <span id="s2527">I don't know whether I should tell you this story because I told it to my children and they said, well, you have to tell.</span> <span id="s2528">[rest of following sentence accidentally deleted from testimony] study.</span> <span id="s2529">So, I could read English much better than I could speak.</span> <span id="s2530">And, you see I didn't know the pronunciation, so I went downstairs and I tried to tell them that I need some bedding.</span> <span id="s2531">But they couldn't understand what I wanted and I said, "two shits for my bed - two shits".</span> <span id="s2532">They almost died!</span> <span id="s2533">Oh, they kept on asking me and they were just laughing and I kept on repeating and they were laughing some more.</span> <span id="s2534">Well, finally they knew what was going on, that the pronunciation was, you know?</span> <span id="s2535">Sheet or shit or whatever, it's all the same to me.</span> <span id="s2536">Well anyway, they gave me the bedding and that was the first time in over a year I slept in a real bed.</span> <span id="s2537">With a blanket.</span> <span id="s2538">Covered with a blanket cover and a sheet and a white sheet, washed, clean, and a pillow with a pillowcase.</span> <span id="s2539">And I couldn't sleep.</span> <span id="s2540">The mattress was not like I was use to, but still it was not the floor.</span> <span id="s2541">It was maybe a straw or maybe a thin blanket, and this is something I don't think I will ever forget.</span> <span id="s2542">So this was my room.</span> <span id="s2543">And it seems to me that I got some underwear and I got some, a change of clothes because I know they wanted me to be dressed up.</span> <span id="s2544">And I had a badge with my name on it.</span> <span id="s2545">I think they took my photograph too.</span> <span id="s2546">So I worked there and many people were coming and asking for relatives and, you know, people were wandering and wandering and wandering from other camps and, I don't know, but there were a lot of people coming.</span> <span id="s2547">Even from our camp.</span> <span id="s2548">People were coming that were separated when they arrived and they wanted to know.</span> <span id="s2549">So I was busy.</span> <span id="s2550">I was mainly sitting there looking through the files and, I don't know, somebody else was preparing the files.</span> <span id="s2551">And I was still kind of seeing this young man who decided he was in love with me and he wants to marry me.</span> <span id="s2552">Well, there was no such thing.</span> <span id="s2553">There was no fraternization and you could not marry anybody.</span> <span id="s2554">And so he talked to his boss and what was happening too is that the officer, I don't know whether he was a General or somebody who was in charge of that particular division and the young man was his driver.</span> <span id="s2555">As a matter of fact, I still have his photograph.</span> <span id="s2556">I didn't bring it with me but there it is, "To my beloved Anna".</span> <span id="s2557">And he said, so the older man, the British officer, wanted to know whether he could take, really get me out of the camp.</span> <span id="s2558">Well there was no way he could.</span> <span id="s2559">And he had a daughter about my age and he just couldn't see leaving me there.</span> <span id="s2560">So he said, now do you have any relatives?</span> <span id="s2561">No, I don't have anybody.</span> <span id="s2562">Not that I know of.</span> <span id="s2563">And he said, well, not in Poland but maybe you have somebody in America?</span> <span id="s2564">I said, oh yes, in America.</span> <span id="s2565">I have an Uncle in America.</span> <span id="s2566">Well they sent us, one time they sent us a package from America, when we were still in Krakow.</span> <span id="s2567">Where in America?</span> <span id="s2568">New York.</span> <span id="s2569">Where in New York?</span> <span id="s2570">What do you mean, where in New York?</span> <span id="s2571">In New York!</span> <span id="s2572">I didn't know that, my geography, American geography wasn't very good.</span> <span id="s2573">I didn't know there was New York State and New York that is Brooklyn and Manhattan, and whatever.</span> <span id="s2574">He says, Okay, New York.</span> <span id="s2575">Well the Red Cross was there already and they, he gave all the information to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2576">This, Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph), New York.</span> <span id="s2577">So the Red Cross got the information and they, I don't know whether they cabled to my Uncle or whether they wrote a letter, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s2578">But my Uncle was notified that Anna Fayno claims to be his niece.</span> <span id="s2579">No, also, New York, the way they found Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph) in New York was they looked in the Brooklyn telephone book, that's where all the Jews lived.</span> <span id="s2580">And there was no Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph).</span> <span id="s2581">So the next thing is Manhattan.</span> <span id="s2582">And there was Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph), the only Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph), its not the very usual name in America.</span> <span id="s2583">On Wall Street.</span> <span id="s2584">So they got in touch with him, that Anna Fayno is in Bergen-Belsen and she says she is you're niece.</span> <span id="s2585">And he said, I don't know any Anna Fanyo.</span> <span id="s2586">And then he decided, talking to my Aunt, that I did get married.</span> <span id="s2587">They remembered because they had a daughter the same age.</span> <span id="s2588">And they remembered that their daughter got married at nineteen and I got married at nineteen.</span> <span id="s2589">So they decided that maybe this is my married name.</span> <span id="s2590">And my cousin, their son, was in the American army.</span> <span id="s2591">And he was sent, he was suppose to, I mean, everything is fate, you know?</span> <span id="s2592">He was also speaking several languages and he was a very good linguist and he had put him in a Japanese school to learn Japanese and he was suppose to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s2593">And somebody came down with measles in his division so they quarantined them.</span> <span id="s2594">And by the time they, it was time for them to go, the other division left and these people stayed, so they decided they will send him to Germany after all.</span> <span id="s2595">And one of his jobs was to go from camp to camp in the American zone to look for the SS men and the guards and the commandants of the camps who were hidden among the prisoners.</span> <span id="s2596">And he, that was his job, and he was stationed in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s2597">And so my Uncle cabled to him, for at that time there was no telex, but anyway, he said there is an Anna Fayno in Bergen-Belsen, check it out.</span> <span id="s2598">Maybe that's Neur-rev (ph) because that's my Russian name, Anna is Neur-rev (ph).</span> <span id="s2599">So he got a jeep and a driver and they proceeded to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2600">And they arrived in Bergen-Belsen and he wanted to know whether anybody knew Anna Fayno and nobody knew Anna Fayno.</span> <span id="s2601">And finally they told him to go to the file with the dead people because we do keep a file on all the people that died in camp and there were many of them that died after the liberation, so maybe you can find her there.</span> <span id="s2602">So, he went to the office and he walks in and he walks up to my desk and he says, in Polish, he started to say, to ask about Anna Fayno, and he grabbed me and started to kiss me and everybody in the office knew that, you know, there was some hanky panky going on, but you know?</span> <span id="s2603">In the dark of the evening or something, but not in the middle of the day, in the middle of the office.</span> <span id="s2604">So, he cried and I cried, I immediately recognized him too in spite of the uniform, and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s2605">Even though my hair was not the same and my face was not the same, but he did recognize me.</span> <span id="s2606">So everybody started jumping around and crying and laughing and, anyway, I think he got more marriage proposals that day than he ever did, except that he had a big band on his hand, he was married already.</span> <span id="s2607">But he didn't even stay over night there.</span> <span id="s2608">He put me on the, I mean he just signed some papers and got released and he put me on his jeep and he says, "what is this?"</span> <span id="s2609">Well I had a bundle with me and these were the two British blankets from my bed.</span> <span id="s2610">They were beautiful, soft wool and I wasn't going to leave them there.</span> <span id="s2611">So, and a couple of my treasures including the little knife.</span> <span id="s2612">So anyway, I wouldn't part with the stuff so he said, "All right, let's go."</span> <span id="s2613">And we drove to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Before we go on I have a few questions about Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s2615">Did you have a desire to leave after the liberation?</span> <span id="s2616">Did you have ideas of where you would like to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: I had absolutely no ideas.</span> <span id="s2618">I thought that first I would try to find whether anybody is alive.</span> <span id="s2619">And actually I don't think that I was thinking very clearly.</span> <span id="s2620">I think that I was just enjoying the fact that I was alive.</span> <span id="s2621">That I had as much food as I could possibly eat.</span> <span id="s2622">I ate all the time.</span> <span id="s2623">I don't want to tell you how much weight I gained.</span> <span id="s2624">But I didn't bring that picture, but there is a picture of me half a year later on the ship, and you wouldn't believe that it could have been the same person.</span> <span id="s2625">I doubled my weight almost.</span> <span id="s2626">And I just enjoyed the fact, or relished the fact that I was alive.</span> <span id="s2627">That I could do almost anything that I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s2628">And I just, I saw Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) several times, so that's how everybody in Krakow knew that I was alive.</span> <span id="s2629">You know, when she went back.</span> <span id="s2630">She went back in October.</span> <span id="s2631">And I just lived in a real, un-real world.</span> <span id="s2632">And it was just as if I pushed everything out of my mind and at that time I didn't even think that it was real.</span> <span id="s2633">I didn't think that, I felt, well, I'm just dreaming.</span> <span id="s2634">I'll wake up and it will be all over.</span> <span id="s2635">So it was really like living from day to day and I just couldn't get use to the fact that it was all real.</span> <span id="s2636">Does that answer you're question?</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: Now you're saying that this young man who fell in love with you, you didn't share that same feeling inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Oh no, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s2639">I mean, first of all we couldn't communicate very well.</span> <span id="s2640">I mean, you know, my English and his German just didn't jive.</span> <span id="s2641">But you know, we sat and he was telling me things about England and I didn't quite understand what he was saying, but just being with somebody and holding somebody's hand and just somebody telling you that he really loves me and that I am wonderful and that I am beautiful.</span> <span id="s2642">It was just about enough.</span> <span id="s2643">And I don't know what I wanted.</span> <span id="s2644">I really don't know where I wanted to go and what I wanted.</span> <span id="s2645">And, I mean, if I was looking back now and maybe analyzing it, the best definition I can say is that I was a little bit out of my head.</span> <span id="s2646">And my cousin thought I was a little bit out of my head evidently because that's what he told his family.</span> <span id="s2647">I don't know that he wrote to them or what, but they expected somebody that was not quite all together.</span> <span id="s2648">The way they were treating me and the way, but he put me on the jeep and they had the . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">End of Tape 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Tape 7</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: And before you left Bergen-Belsen, would you say something about the cultural life there?</span> <span id="s2652">Did you ever go or know that there was a theater being organized in Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s2653">Were you involved with the community in any way, in anything fun or social?</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: You mean in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: No.</span> <span id="s2657">As I said, the only thing that I could think of was being warm, being clean and have food.</span> <span id="s2658">And then I got very much involved in working.</span> <span id="s2659">And I don't even know of any cultural life existing there.</span> <span id="s2660">I was completely, if there was any, I was not involved at all because I think the thing that, as I said, concerned me where more the physical things more than the mental, than the intellectual.</span> <span id="s2661">And I was glad that I had the job.</span> <span id="s2662">Because that was something that really occupied my whole day.</span> <span id="s2663">I started at 8:00 in the morning and I think we, just like a regular job.</span> <span id="s2664">We broke for doing for lunch and then worked until dinnertime.</span> <span id="s2665">And after dinner, most of the time, I went for a walk with this young man.</span> <span id="s2666">And I just don't remember any kind of other activities.</span> <span id="s2667">There might have been a dance.</span> <span id="s2668">But I don't think that, there might have been dances, but I really don't remember actively participating in anything of that sort.</span> <span id="s2669">I just don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Do you remember visits from diplomats?</span> <span id="s2671">Do you remember Earl Harrison coming to visit, Truman's emissary?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: No.</span> <span id="s2673">No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">Q: When was it that you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">A: I left, it was either July, I believe it was either July or August.</span> <span id="s2676">I just, at this point, at this moment, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2677">But I think I remember Red Cross visits.</span> <span id="s2678">Because I know that it was the Red Cross that contacted my Uncle.</span> <span id="s2679">But I don't remember any visits of the diplomats.</span> <span id="s2680">I don't remember any activities.</span> <span id="s2681">I remember that we ate in a room with long tables and curtains and I was eyeing the curtains because I could make a nice dress out of them.</span> <span id="s2682">But I don't know, all I know is that there was a, maybe I did steal something.</span> <span id="s2683">I don't know, but there was a lot of organizing going on and I think I did organize a curtain.</span> <span id="s2684">I did.</span> <span id="s2685">I did.</span> <span id="s2686">And I made that dress.</span> <span id="s2687">So, but I hate to admit that but I did.</span> <span id="s2688">But I don't remember any dignitaries, I don't remember anybody else talking to me except the General and the people in the office.</span> <span id="s2689">I don't know whether he was, everybody was a General as far as I was concerned.</span> <span id="s2690">I mean, anybody.</span> <span id="s2691">I know he was a high-ranking officer in the British army, but I don't even know his name.</span> <span id="s2692">And never tried to find out.</span> <span id="s2693">You see, half the time I tried to forget everything.</span> <span id="s2694">And not tried to think.</span> <span id="s2695">And this is the first time that I'm really looking through any kind of records and doing a thorough search.</span> <span id="s2696">Otherwise, I always said, well, maybe I'll do it tomorrow.</span> <span id="s2697">Maybe because I didn't want to find out that I can't find anything out.</span> <span id="s2698">So, are we in the jeep now or are we still in Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: We can go to the jeep now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2701">So, in the jeep my cousin had, I guess these were the K-rations.</span> <span id="s2702">And he always was telling my Aunt and Uncle that he couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2703">But the K ration was supposed to last a soldier a whole day.</span> <span id="s2704">And I ate five of them!</span> <span id="s2705">And then we stopped for the night.</span> <span id="s2706">I don't remember exactly where, but it was some kind of a guesthouse or whatever.</span> <span id="s2707">And then we went on to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s2708">And he evidently already knew about the place or what because we went straight there.</span> <span id="s2709">It was a house which belonged to some German officer who, as my cousin said, was in a safe place now.</span> <span id="s2710">I mean, he was jailed already.</span> <span id="s2711">And his wife was a very nice lady who said she will take good care of me.</span> <span id="s2712">And she did.</span> <span id="s2713">She cooked whatever I wanted to.</span> <span id="s2714">I think at 11 o'clock at night I woke up and I wanted potato pancakes and she cooked potato pancakes for me.</span> <span id="s2715">There was one thing that I discovered in her house is that her basement was full, and I mean full, with cases of Red Cross food.</span> <span id="s2716">Her husband was a commandant in a, some kind of a small prison camp or Jewish camp, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2717">I don't know which one.</span> <span id="s2718">And all these Red Cross packages were ending up in their basement.</span> <span id="s2719">I was shocked.</span> <span id="s2720">I told, you see I was visited by my, my cousin had to leave because he had orders to go back.</span> <span id="s2721">And, but these good friends who were stationed in Frankfurt were visiting me and bringing me stuff and sort of taking me out for outings and I stayed there until just a few weeks, maybe two weeks, maybe three weeks, and then they took me to Paris in their truck.</span> <span id="s2722">But this time it was a nice truck.</span> <span id="s2723">It was a covered truck and the benches were still only benches but they folded up a blanket and I sat on a blanket.</span> <span id="s2724">And I don't really, the trip was quite long but I remember we arrived in Paris and oh, everybody started to cheer because they were going to go home.</span> <span id="s2725">And then they took me to the place where I was going to stay, which were my cousin's relatives.</span> <span id="s2726">And I stayed with them until I got the visa and I left in February, I think it was February 4th, into the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: From where did you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: It was February, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s2729">Q: So you left, take me back.</span> <span id="s2730">You left Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2731">A: I left Bergen-Belsen in 1945.</span> <span id="s2732">And then I stayed in Paris, I mean I was in Bergen-Belsen, I think it was until, either the end of July or beginning of August.</span> <span id="s2733">And then I was in Frankfurt for a short time, just a few weeks.</span> <span id="s2734">So it might have been September that I came to, or maybe even earlier.</span> <span id="s2735">No, it must have been probably September.</span> <span id="s2736">Anyway, I have a card.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: What does the card say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2739">The card is from, made out to Madame Fayno, Anna.</span> <span id="s2740">And it is _______ _________ in Paris.</span> <span id="s2741">And I enrolled, this card, [reading in French what was on the card], it was the winter session.</span> <span id="s2742">And I started in October.</span> <span id="s2743">And I went October, November, December and January.</span> <span id="s2744">I went for four months to __________ _________ to learn French properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Was this you're decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2747">Yes.</span> <span id="s2748">I wanted to do it very badly.</span> <span id="s2749">Because I did speak french.</span> <span id="s2750">I had some French, you know, I had quite a bit of French in High School in Poland.</span> <span id="s2751">And I decided that I might as well utilize my time because it wasn't very certain when I will get the visa to America.</span> <span id="s2752">It was very difficult to get it.</span> <span id="s2753">So this is what I decided to do and I did it.</span> <span id="s2754">It was very interesting because the teacher did not speak anything but French.</span> <span id="s2755">The method that they were using was just learning just like children learn a foreign language.</span> <span id="s2756">And there were maybe twenty people in the class and I don't think there were two of the same nationality.</span> <span id="s2757">So it was very nice.</span> <span id="s2758">And this number, 113, was my school number.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: And the family that you were staying with, what were you're relations like with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2761">The family that I was staying with were Jewish people that were my cousin's wife's relatives really.</span> <span id="s2762">And they had lived, they were originally from Russia but they moved to Paris and they lived in France before the war.</span> <span id="s2763">And during the war, they had a cottage out in the country and that's where they lived.</span> <span id="s2764">And it was not as bad as it was in Poland, that you would be, you had to move to the ghetto, there was no ghetto in Paris.</span> <span id="s2765">People where deported but they really were not deported from villages.</span> <span id="s2766">And they lost their daughter and granddaughter to an accident because they moved to an apartment and in Europe they have water heaters that turn on when you turn on the faucet.</span> <span id="s2767">So you use only the amount of water, I mean you heat only the amount of water that you actually will use.</span> <span id="s2768">And the husband of their daughter was away.</span> <span id="s2769">It was the daughter and the granddaughter in the apartment and they were found dead in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s2770">They evidently, they took the baths and they shut off the water but the gas did not turn off and they were asphyxiated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">A: That was, I think that happened in 1942 or 1943.</span> <span id="s2773">I arrived.</span> <span id="s2774">There was already another young woman there, Vickie Zamora.</span> <span id="s2775">And she's in the registry.</span> <span id="s2776">Because what happened was when my cousin was stationed in Leipzig, that's when he, in every camp he was looking for relatives and could not find anybody.</span> <span id="s2777">And in Leipzig there was a whole bunch of young women, mostly Russian, from a labor camp.</span> <span id="s2778">I mean, not extermination camp, just labor.</span> <span id="s2779">And there was this young woman who spoke Russian and she also spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s2780">And she looked Jewish.</span> <span id="s2781">And he asked her whether she was Jewish and, of course, she denied, no.</span> <span id="s2782">I mean at that time, because she was in that camp as non-Jewish, and that's a whole story.</span> <span id="s2783">I don't know whether she ever made testimonials in Yad-va-sham (ph) because she does live in Israel.</span> <span id="s2784">But what happened was that my cousin told her that he would take her to America.</span> <span id="s2785">And she wasn't sure whether she wanted to go and all her girlfriends were saying, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s2786">You know America.</span> <span id="s2787">They are full of kidnappers and gangsters and who knows.</span> <span id="s2788">He probably will sell you into white slave labor or something.</span> <span id="s2789">And she decided that there wasn't anything worse than she already went through.</span> <span id="s2790">And he promised her he will take her to America.</span> <span id="s2791">So he did.</span> <span id="s2792">He took her to Paris and he placed her with this Mr. and Mrs. Gar-loose (ph), this was the name of the people.</span> <span id="s2793">So she was there when I arrived.</span> <span id="s2794">And we shared the bedroom and we were together going to the consulate and to all the different offices to get the exit visa, to get the entry visa, and finally we got the tickets for a liberty ship, Rafael Riviera.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">Q: How did you feel about going to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">A: Anything but where I am.</span> <span id="s2797">The future is what will be different.</span> <span id="s2798">I just lived in a completely un-real world.</span> <span id="s2799">I, I, at Italian Francoise, I met some Iranian Prince or God only knows what, who was a handsome guy.</span> <span id="s2800">Very, very wealthy.</span> <span id="s2801">He introduced me to his Iranian friends and they stayed at the Ritz Hotel, no less.</span> <span id="s2802">But this romance didn't last very long because I was going to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s2803">I met him just before we were really leaving.</span> <span id="s2804">And he wrote to me several times and he wanted to come to America and marry me.</span> <span id="s2805">And my Uncle said, you give me the address and now I'm going to write him a letter.</span> <span id="s2806">You don't need that.</span> <span id="s2807">I mean, he sent me his photograph and my Uncle said, no!</span> <span id="s2808">And at that time I still, like I say, I was a grown woman, I still felt like a little girl.</span> <span id="s2809">I never grew up during the five years of war.</span> <span id="s2810">I was still eighteen, I think, or seventeen, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2811">And obeying my parents.</span> <span id="s2812">And, it was very good my Uncle said no because I didn't need to go to Iran.</span> <span id="s2813">But I stayed with my Uncle and Aunt in New York until that summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">Q: Tell me first about arriving, about you're ride on the ship and arriving in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2816">We were on this ship for twenty-one days.</span> <span id="s2817">It was suppose to be much shorter voyage but it was a liberty ship and a big transport of GIs going back home was suppose to go on that ship.</span> <span id="s2818">But they were detained or whatever, they were late, and the ship couldn't wait any longer.</span> <span id="s2819">So there were only maybe fourteen passengers.</span> <span id="s2820">There were the two women, Vickie and I, and the rest there was a, or maybe even less passengers.</span> <span id="s2821">There was a newspaperman, a reporter who was coming back to the States.</span> <span id="s2822">And there were several other, I don't know whether they were businessmen or some officials, or whoever they were, but anyway they were all going.</span> <span id="s2823">And Vickie and I had a officer's cabin and it was very nice.</span> <span id="s2824">There were two bunks.</span> <span id="s2825">And we had all the food.</span> <span id="s2826">I mean, there was so much food on this ship because they expected, I don't know, 140 soldiers or so, and they never arrived.</span> <span id="s2827">So we had all the food in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">Q: From where did the ship leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">A: The ship started from Rue Ane (ph) and we had to go by train to Rue Ane (ph).</span> <span id="s2830">And I made a cloak out of the blanket.</span> <span id="s2831">[Laughter] And I had my suitcase.</span> <span id="s2832">In Frankfurt, my cousin left some money and the German woman took me shopping so I had a nice leather suitcase and I had some nice clothes, but I still wanted my blanket.</span> <span id="s2833">And anyway, we went to, oh, you see there is another thing, I want the past and I don't want it.</span> <span id="s2834">There was another young man that I met at school.</span> <span id="s2835">He was French, his name was Jerrard or Jerold Rosenstein.</span> <span id="s2836">And he came to the train station to see us off.</span> <span id="s2837">And then he came to the United States and I sort of, I saw him in New York several times and then when I left New York I lost track of him.</span> <span id="s2838">And I am a very bad correspondencer.</span> <span id="s2839">There is the San Francisco Holocaust Center and one of the people on the Board is Jerold Rosenstein, a survivor.</span> <span id="s2840">Because they have little dots, they are survivors.</span> <span id="s2841">And I never got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s2842">And I don't know, there is something, some kind of, I mean, my head is not quite all right in spite of my great accomplishments.</span> <span id="s2843">I still have a split personality.</span> <span id="s2844">I sometimes am very nice and sometimes I am completely out of my head.</span> <span id="s2845">So, like for example, I don't do things like that that I would, I don't know why I don't want to get in touch with him.</span> <span id="s2846">On the other hand, every time I see his name when we get the newsletter from the Holocaust Center, I say, oh, I ought to get in touch with him.</span> <span id="s2847">And so, you know?</span> <span id="s2848">It seems to me that something did happen to me in that camp and that after fifty years, I still don't act like I use to.</span> <span id="s2849">So what happened to this ship, okay, in Rue Ane (ph) we arrived by train from Paris and we boarded the ship at about 6 o'clock in the evening and they gave us dinner.</span> <span id="s2850">The ship was not going to start on the river to Le Harbor until probably 5 o'clock in the morning or so.</span> <span id="s2851">Well anyway, we ate and then we read and we sat around and finally we went to bed.</span> <span id="s2852">I was sleeping on the lower bunk and Vickie was in, six years younger so she can climb up and she can have the upper bunk.</span> <span id="s2853">And five o'clock in the morning, I felt rocking like this.</span> <span id="s2854">And it turned out the ship was going, but it was going very slowly.</span> <span id="s2855">And then the rocking start, it was several hours, and then the rocking started to be quite heavy.</span> <span id="s2856">And everybody was saying that we left the port already and we are on the water, on the ocean.</span> <span id="s2857">And I ran up on the deck in my robe, I had a robe.</span> <span id="s2858">Because when I was about twelve years old, I saw a movie with Greta Garbo.</span> <span id="s2859">'Christina, the Queen of Sweden'.</span> <span id="s2860">And the scene that I remembered, she was standing at the back of this ship, there is a name for this ship, I don't know exactly, but anyway it was the back of the ship with her flowing gown and she had a veil which was also flowing, and she looked at Sweden disappearing in the fog.</span> <span id="s2861">And I was going to do this same thing.</span> <span id="s2862">I ran up on the deck and I ran to the end of the ship and I stood there holding onto the railing, seeing the French coast disappearing in the fog.</span> <span id="s2863">And I got so seasick!</span> <span id="s2864">It was not romantic at all.</span> <span id="s2865">I was so sick to the point that they had to take me down to the cabin and lay me down and they gave me some ice cubes and they put cold compresses and a bucket right next to my bed.</span> <span id="s2866">[Laughter] And I was on that bunk for most of the time.</span> <span id="s2867">I would go to the dining room to eat, it was not the dining room, it was the mess, I think.</span> <span id="s2868">And I couldn't eat anything, which was all right because I gained quite a bit of weight in Paris.</span> <span id="s2869">Because the lady in whose house I lived was a wonderful cook and they had a goose too!</span> <span id="s2870">Very often!</span> <span id="s2871">So anyway, once in a while the weather was pretty good and we would be sitting on the deck or in the dining room and talking.</span> <span id="s2872">And the young reporter was asking all kinds of questions.</span> <span id="s2873">And Vickie just loved to talk about her experience.</span> <span id="s2874">She was not in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2875">She was with the Russian girls in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s2876">So she was telling him all kinds of goodies and he was asking me questions but I didn't want to talk very much about it.</span> <span id="s2877">Anyway, he gave us his, he was in Manhattan, and gave us his phone number and address.</span> <span id="s2878">And the voyage was very, very long, but I lived mainly on ice cream because that's what just stayed in my stomach.</span> <span id="s2879">Otherwise I was seasick all the time.</span> <span id="s2880">And we finally arrived in New York to find out that there is a dock strike and we cannot land.</span> <span id="s2881">So they send us to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2882">And we also can't land in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2883">We sat in the New York harbor for quite some time and finally they said, well get the passengers off and they said they couldn't, go to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2884">So we went to Baltimore and somehow they notified my Uncle and my Aunt that we will be debarking in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2885">And so we sat on the ship in the port in Baltimore and finally they said, get a boat and get our passengers off, we have enough.</span> <span id="s2886">So they did.</span> <span id="s2887">So we came on a small boat back to the port and got off.</span> <span id="s2888">And my Aunt, she cried all the time, so she cried again.</span> <span id="s2889">And my Uncle couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s2890">He kept on touching me and grabbing me and, evidently I didn't look much different because I had already gained weight and I looked pretty good.</span> <span id="s2891">And they liked Vickie very much, she was a very sweet and polite young lady.</span> <span id="s2892">Anyway, they said we are going to, by train.</span> <span id="s2893">And we had little packages.</span> <span id="s2894">"And what is that?"</span> <span id="s2895">"Don't touch it".</span> <span id="s2896">"Well come on, what is it?"</span> <span id="s2897">"Nothing".</span> <span id="s2898">"Okay".</span> <span id="s2899">Then we sit down on the train and we open our packages and my Aunt says, "You don't need to do that.</span> <span id="s2900">That's food and we will go to the diner."</span> <span id="s2901">"What's a diner?"</span> <span id="s2902">"It's a dining cart that will have food."</span> <span id="s2903">"Oh."</span> <span id="s2904">So we packed it up and we put it away and she said, "Throw it out."</span> <span id="s2905">"No!"</span> <span id="s2906">So we held onto our food.</span> <span id="s2907">And then my Aunt looked at us and she said, "Well, you know what?"</span> <span id="s2908">She had a beautiful hat on and we had hats that we bought in Paris.</span> <span id="s2909">And I think we bought it in a place where the ladies of the night buy hats because my Aunt said, "Well, you know, in America, when you go to a dining place, you really don't wear hats inside."</span> <span id="s2910">So she took her hat off, and my Aunt wouldn't be caught dead without a hat.</span> <span id="s2911">But she wanted us to take those horrible hats off.</span> <span id="s2912">Mine was with a feather sticking out like that.</span> <span id="s2913">I remember it was a pheasant feather, just like this.</span> <span id="s2914">Well anyway, we didn't want to do that but we took the hats off and we went to the diner and then we started to eat.</span> <span id="s2915">And she couldn't believe that two young women can consume that much food and be still hungry.</span> <span id="s2916">Then we had to learn how to eat the American way.</span> <span id="s2917">Because you see in Europe you hold the fork and the knife and you cut with you're left hand.</span> <span id="s2918">And she showed us right there in the diner that you eat with the fork with you're left hand and you don't pile up stuff on the fork and eat it like that.</span> <span id="s2919">So anyway, she treated us really like two very young girls, which really what we were.</span> <span id="s2920">I mean, with social graces and things like . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">[End of Side A of Tape 7]</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: . . . came to New York.</span> <span id="s2923">So anyway, we arrived in New York and my Uncle had his car parked at the train station and he drove us.</span> <span id="s2924">And then I said, "Oh, could we see that street?"</span> <span id="s2925">"What street?"</span> <span id="s2926">"You know, the street that you just stand on and it goes by itself."</span> <span id="s2927">Evidently at the World's Fair, they had this sidewalk like that.</span> <span id="s2928">And he said, "Well, not today".</span> <span id="s2929">And we came to their apartment.</span> <span id="s2930">And they moved to a new, knowing that we are going to be there, they will have more people living, they moved to a larger apartment.</span> <span id="s2931">It was really a very large apartment on 86th Street in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s2932">And we had a dinner at the dinner table and there were green peas, fresh green peas in February.</span> <span id="s2933">And my Uncle said, "Oh, we have a hot house up on top of the roof".</span> <span id="s2934">Well, he was lying.</span> <span id="s2935">They were frozen peas.</span> <span id="s2936">I didn't know that you can freeze peas and they would taste as if you just picked them out of a hot house.</span> <span id="s2937">Anyway, there were an awful lot of surprises.</span> <span id="s2938">And it took us quite a while to get adjusted.</span> <span id="s2939">But we got a phone call from the reporter.</span> <span id="s2940">And he . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: The same reporter who was on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: The reporter who was on the ship.</span> <span id="s2943">And he wanted us to come for some kind of a party that they had.</span> <span id="s2944">And my Aunt was very leery and says, "Well all these are people that we met on the ship and it will be all right", and it was like maybe a couple of weeks after we arrived.</span> <span id="s2945">And it was somewhere on 14th Street and the neighborhood, we went by subway, and the neighborhood was not exactly like my Aunt's.</span> <span id="s2946">But there was no elevator and we walked up I think to the third floor and it was a very small apartment and there were an awful lot of people.</span> <span id="s2947">But Vickie liked to talk about her experiences and all that, but I really didn't.</span> <span id="s2948">Anyway, there were several people and they were asking us questions and Vickie was telling stories and I was answering in sort of very short sentences, and then the young man, he wasn't in uniform any more and he didn't look as dashing as before, but anyway, so he was very nice.</span> <span id="s2949">He was married and his wife was there, just a young woman.</span> <span id="s2950">And he asked us to come to Madison Avenue, he gave us the address.</span> <span id="s2951">And we did come.</span> <span id="s2952">I think two days later.</span> <span id="s2953">And there were cameras and people and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2954">And there were some other people.</span> <span id="s2955">And they took pictures of us and I went into hysterics.</span> <span id="s2956">Because I didn't know what was going on and I wanted my Uncle and they got him.</span> <span id="s2957">And he came and I know he was shouting at everybody.</span> <span id="s2958">And he took us out of there.</span> <span id="s2959">And then the next morning, there was a picture of Vickie and me and these three other people.</span> <span id="s2960">The people were showing their numbers.</span> <span id="s2961">And there was an article about the two refugee girls that were taken care by Mr. Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph) and it went on and on and on.</span> <span id="s2962">And my Uncle started getting telephone calls of people who wanted to adopt us.</span> <span id="s2963">And who wanted to give money.</span> <span id="s2964">And who wanted to do all kinds of nice things to us.</span> <span id="s2965">And I was very bad because my Uncle got very, very angry.</span> <span id="s2966">He really should have gotten angry at Vickie because it was all her idea really, to participate in that.</span> <span id="s2967">And my Uncle was going to sue the newspaper for $3 million.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: What newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: I think it was either The New York Times or, I don't know whether there was another large paper in New York, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2970">For years I had that article and then I finally threw it out.</span> <span id="s2971">Because, you see, before we arrived, my Aunt consulted with a psychiatrist and she was told that they should keep us in seclusion.</span> <span id="s2972">That they shouldn't ask us any questions and just see how we respond.</span> <span id="s2973">And not to even mention the camp.</span> <span id="s2974">I mean, we should just forget the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2975">And we should live as if it never happened.</span> <span id="s2976">And I think I might have had several sessions with this psychiatrist but I don't remember very much about it.</span> <span id="s2977">I didn't want to talk about anything.</span> <span id="s2978">But anyway, the offshoot was that we should live in seclusion.</span> <span id="s2979">And just try to live as normal life as possible.</span> <span id="s2980">My Aunt's daughter, my cousin, was my age, she was married.</span> <span id="s2981">And she was in Sweden.</span> <span id="s2982">Her husband and she both were working for, I think it was called United States, some kind of book, International Book Association, or something like that, and they were working in Sweden.</span> <span id="s2983">And she had a little year-and-a-half girl, Claudia, with a nanny.</span> <span id="s2984">That one also lived in my Aunt's apartment.</span> <span id="s2985">And I remember one day, I mean these are all sort of anecdotes of remembering things that happened later.</span> <span id="s2986">One day, oh, the nanny use to take the baby out for an outing and then come back late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2987">And then my Aunt calls me in and Claudia is sleeping in the crib, and she had nice, long hair.</span> <span id="s2988">And my Aunt says, "Look how she's, every evening when we put her to bed, she's scratching her head so sweetly".</span> <span id="s2989">Vickie and I look at her.</span> <span id="s2990">"She's got lice!"</span> <span id="s2991">"What do you mean she's got lice?"</span> <span id="s2992">Well, the way she's scratching her head, that means she's got lice.</span> <span id="s2993">Now where can the child get lice but from the two refugees.</span> <span id="s2994">So my Aunt was out of her head.</span> <span id="s2995">Anyway, Vickie was holding the baby on her lap and I was doing the usual.</span> <span id="s2996">And there were lice.</span> <span id="s2997">And my Aunt almost fell to the floor in a dead faint.</span> <span id="s2998">"What do we do now?"</span> <span id="s2999">Edith, the mother of the child, is going to be here in two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s3000">Well, where did she get the lice?</span> <span id="s3001">Of course, from Vickie and me.</span> <span id="s3002">I said, "We don't have any lice.</span> <span id="s3003">We were de-loused before we came here."</span> <span id="s3004">Well anyway, turned out that the child got lice in the park.</span> <span id="s3005">I don't know where the nanny took her but she didn't get the lice from us.</span> <span id="s3006">And my Aunt says, "Well, what do we do?"</span> <span id="s3007">I said, "Well, first of all, you cut her hair as short as possible."</span> <span id="s3008">Preferably shaving, then you don't have any problem at all.</span> <span id="s3009">Well, we didn't shave the child's head but we cut it about half an inch or so and then I think they got some kind of a de-lousing liquid or fluid or something from a drug store and got rid of the lice.</span> <span id="s3010">But there was Claudia, looking like a little boy with very, very short hair.</span> <span id="s3011">And my cousin wanted a picture of her daughter that she hasn't seen for almost a year.</span> <span id="s3012">So my Aunt was very industrious and she got a pretty kerchief and she made a bambooshka and there was one picture of Claudia in a bambooshka and another picture of Claudia as a gypsy girl.</span> <span id="s3013">[Laughter] Anyway, they were really cute pictures and Edith couldn't understand why the child had to be all dressed because she came home maybe three or four weeks later.</span> <span id="s3014">And then she found out.</span> <span id="s3015">And she also suspected Vickie and me, but then the truth came out that it was the nanny that took her somewhere where the child got the lice.</span> <span id="s3016">But anyways, that's another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">Q: Did you're Uncle and Aunt intend to adopt you legally in some way, or was that an issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: No, I was grown up.</span> <span id="s3019">You see the people that offered the adoptions and all that, they had no idea who we were and what it was.</span> <span id="s3020">But no, my Aunt and Uncle, there was no need to adopt me.</span> <span id="s3021">I was a grown up widow and they thought of adopting Vickie but Vickie didn't want to be adopted.</span> <span id="s3022">I mean, she was eighteen.</span> <span id="s3023">No, she was about seventeen or seventeen and a half or so.</span> <span id="s3024">There was no need to be adopted.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">Q: Did you have a citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3027">I applied for the, I mean I had that alien registration card and it would have taken five years to get a citizenship.</span> <span id="s3028">But in the meantime, I decided to learn English really properly and I enrolled in Judy Richmond High School and I took American history and I took English 10, English 11 and English 12.</span> <span id="s3029">In English 10, I read what varies, what plays.</span> <span id="s3030">They were all plays.</span> <span id="s3031">What every woman knows.</span> <span id="s3032">And in English 11, Hamlet.</span> <span id="s3033">And in English 12, MacBeth.</span> <span id="s3034">And then I came home after classes and I sat down with a dictionary and I translated every single word in the reading assignment for that day.</span> <span id="s3035">I stayed until about midnight or 1 o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s3036">And I was memorizing and memorizing and memorizing.</span> <span id="s3037">And my Aunt and Uncle insisted on speaking English, what they thought was English.</span> <span id="s3038">But it wasn't a very good English, so the English I ended up speaking was also not very good.</span> <span id="s3039">But I tried.</span> <span id="s3040">And I remember writing a paper in the American History about the Pilgrims.</span> <span id="s3041">And there was a sentence that, 'profligacy took place of sobriety'.</span> <span id="s3042">That was about the Pilgrims.</span> <span id="s3043">I don't know exactly what they were doing but that was the upshot.</span> <span id="s3044">And because in Polish, the longer the word and the more complicated, the more educated that person is that would be using it.</span> <span id="s3045">So I was looking for the longest words for most syllables and sobriety and profligacy, it sounded very good.</span> <span id="s3046">And my history teacher, I remember her first name was Bernice, I don't remember her last name, but she was a single woman and she really took a liking to me and she helped me a tremendous amount and she thought that was the funniest thing she's ever heard about the Pilgrims.</span> <span id="s3047">And I remember I gave her a bottle of perfume, I think it was Prince Matchabellie, and she wrote me a thanks you note that she's going to use that for some profligacy between her moments of sobriety.</span> <span id="s3048">So anyway, that's another thing.</span> <span id="s3049">So after I finished, I took the Regents, the New York Regents, and I passed, I think I got only seven, but it was a passing grade, and my English wasn't too bad by then and I also was accepted to Hunter College.</span> <span id="s3050">And I was going to start Hunter College in September, but my Aunt had a big family reunion.</span> <span id="s3051">My cousin came back from Sweden with her husband and her husband's brothers came to visit.</span> <span id="s3052">They had a large house in Stamford, Connecticut, so we had a big party and a big family reunion.</span> <span id="s3053">And the older brother of my cousin's husband was a Professor of Bacteriology in Dallas, Texas medical school.</span> <span id="s3054">And he said that instead of going to Hunter College, I could come to Dallas, live in their house and maybe do some babysitting.</span> <span id="s3055">And they had two children, 4 and 7, and I could work in the laboratory and I could go to the Southwestern University, er, Methodist University.</span> <span id="s3056">Southwest at Methodist University.</span> <span id="s3057">So, I thought this was a wonderful opportunity to get away from New York, from my Aunt and from my Uncle.</span> <span id="s3058">Not that I was ungrateful, but they treated me like a little girl and I was a grown up woman.</span> <span id="s3059">So I left.</span> <span id="s3060">And with their blessing.</span> <span id="s3061">And I lived in the Professor's home and I worked in the laboratory and that's where I met my future husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: What did you want to study?</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">A: Well I thought I wanted to study medicine because the laboratory was, and I was very much interested in bacteriology and I was working with mice and there were all kinds of experiments studying polio.</span> <span id="s3064">And the Professor had an idea that if you put mice to sleep, not dead but just with the ether and just prevent them from moving around and sort of living in a twilight zone, even though they are infected with polio, they do not develop the symptoms and they will not get paralyzed.</span> <span id="s3065">So this is what we were doing.</span> <span id="s3066">Watching the mice, whether they get paralysis and whether they died, and if they died we had to take their brains out and preserve them and then examine them, so it was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s3067">So I really thought I would study that and at the University I took biochemistry and a couple of other courses and more English and then, June 1, 1947, I got married.</span> <span id="s3068">And we moved to Michigan.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">Q: What was you're husband's name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">A: My husband's name was Manual Levin.</span> <span id="s3071">There was no middle initial.</span> <span id="s3072">And he was originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan.</span> <span id="s3073">And that's where the University of Michigan was.</span> <span id="s3074">And he was a graduate of the University and the Medical School.</span> <span id="s3075">And there was a whole group of, he was an intern in the Medical School in Michigan when the war started and then he enlisted, well he wasn't an enlisted man, he was in the Navy.</span> <span id="s3076">I have a picture of him here.</span> <span id="s3077">He was a doctor in the Navy.</span> <span id="s3078">And he was in the service for five years.</span> <span id="s3079">And then when he was discharged, he decided to become a surgeon.</span> <span id="s3080">And he had surgical internship and so he wanted to continue his studies and actually, before he left, he was already assistant resident and then he got the three-year residency.</span> <span id="s3081">So I had three years in which I could study whatever I wanted.</span> <span id="s3082">And tried to get a degree.</span> <span id="s3083">So I graduated from University of Michigan in 1949 and I got a degree in Zoology, which was a pre-med.</span> <span id="s3084">But then I decided that it would have been probably very difficult at that time to get into medical school.</span> <span id="s3085">Women were not really, there were a lot of men that came back from the war and applied.</span> <span id="s3086">During the war, two of my husband's sisters were accepted to medical school.</span> <span id="s3087">One of them finished, the other one got a Master's in Biochemistry and married a doctor.</span> <span id="s3088">So I didn't think that, I only had one year, or a year and a half.</span> <span id="s3089">So during that time I decided to go to graduate school and I got a Degree in Medical Technology.</span> <span id="s3090">So I, we moved to Detroit and for a year I worked at Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital as a Medical Technologist while my husband was trying to establish a surgical practice.</span> <span id="s3091">But things were not moving very well, and not only that, but the winter was very hard and we had one bad car accident, not our fault, we just skidded in the snow.</span> <span id="s3092">And then I commuted to the hospital by bus.</span> <span id="s3093">And if I missed the bus sometimes I had to wait for another three-quarters of an hour, in other words, we just didn't like the weather.</span> <span id="s3094">And my husband was always telling me about the fantastic, beautiful, warm California.</span> <span id="s3095">And so we decided to look around and we ended up moving to Fresno, California.</span> <span id="s3096">And that's where I still live, in Fresno, California.</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">Q: When did you decide to seek restitution from the German government?</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">A: Actually I don't remember exactly the date but I didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s3099">And a friend of mine from Czechoslovakia who was not in the camp, I think she came to the United States before the war, no, maybe after the war, but I didn't have the details really, but she was not imprisoned during the camps, and she said that there has been a law passed that all the former inmates and survivors and so on can get restitution.</span> <span id="s3100">And it was suppose to be a lump sum depending on the condition, the health condition of the person, there would be a pension.</span> <span id="s3101">So I really didn't know much about it and I started to investigate and, as a matter of fact, we came to Paris on a visit, with my second husband, and we visited the Ga-loose-es (ph).</span> <span id="s3102">Now the old people, no actually, it was the lady that died, but Mr. Ga-loose (ph) was still alive and his son was a doctor and the daughter was married to a German lawyer who was specializing in the restitutions and he was German, he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s3103">And he gave me a name of a lawyer that I should contact that would be helpful.</span> <span id="s3104">And I contacted him, his name was Mr. Collinger (ph) and we were corresponding back and forth.</span> <span id="s3105">And there is a stack of literature on the subject because, as Mr. Collinger (ph) explained, it wasn't his demands for all kinds of proofs and dates and so on, but it was the German government that was very thorough because anybody could claim and they only had so much money to distribute.</span> <span id="s3106">So I spent quite a bit of time writing letters and then getting an answer from him and asking for even more answers and it was many, many years of corresponding back and forth until finally I got a request that I be examined by a German doctor.</span> <span id="s3107">And that was already after my second husband died so it was after 1977, because I remember my son drove with me to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3108">We had an appointment.</span> <span id="s3109">And evidently that doctor, that's all he was doing is examining people, or I don't know, it was very, very strange.</span> <span id="s3110">The office was very old fashioned in some big office building in San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3111">And I felt very, very uneasy because he was quite rude and he also was not very gentle.</span> <span id="s3112">He again gave me a gynecological examination and he poked me all over and it was a very bad experience.</span> <span id="s3113">And I know that I felt very bad.</span> <span id="s3114">My son was there, I mean, waiting in the waiting room and he didn't know why I came out crying, but I just, I mean, the whole business of camp and everything else just came back to me so vividly that I thought, I'm just going to forget the whole thing and I'm not going to go through with it.</span> <span id="s3115">But I did.</span> <span id="s3116">Then, the next thing they demanded that I be examined by a psychiatrist, also a German man.</span> <span id="s3117">And so that was another trip to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s3118">And that lasted most of the day, because first I was given a whole stack of questionnaires to fill out and I think these were the standard sort of questions.</span> <span id="s3119">Do I feel that I'm being followed?</span> <span id="s3120">Do I have nightmares?</span> <span id="s3121">Do I have delusions?</span> <span id="s3122">Anyway, these were things that, some of them were quite obvious what I'm suppose to answer if I want to get my restitution.</span> <span id="s3123">But anyway, I answered to the best of my ability.</span> <span id="s3124">I didn't have to do much lying because I didn't feel that I am being followed, but I certainly was always aware of what was going on around me.</span> <span id="s3125">And also I did have nightmares and I, sometimes I didn't feel very good.</span> <span id="s3126">There was one incident years and years later, as a matter of fact, it was about six years ago.</span> <span id="s3127">When we came back from Europe, we landed, usually we land in San Francisco, but that particular time we took the Pan Am, I think the last year Pan Am was in business, and we landed in New York.</span> <span id="s3128">And we had to go through customs.</span> <span id="s3129">And the airport in New York was Kennedy's.</span> <span id="s3130">But it was so crowded and we got off the plane and then we had to go through all these different corridors and at one point I got separated from Robert and I started to scream.</span> <span id="s3131">Because people were pushing from all sides and I just couldn't breath.</span> <span id="s3132">And I leaned against the wall and I started to scream.</span> <span id="s3133">And the guard or the stewardess or whoever it was came to me and she wanted to know what was wrong and I couldn't breath, I couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s3134">I was just absolutely petrified.</span> <span id="s3135">I mean, that just felt like I was in a gas chamber with all the people pushing and pulling and, it was absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s3136">And I think Robert finally somehow found me and we went, he pushed me around and we went into the larger space out of the corridor into the main area where we could stand in lines waiting for the customs to go through with us, and the passport control, and so on.</span> <span id="s3137">But I have incidents like that all through my life, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3138">End of Tape 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Tape 8</span></p> <p><span id="s3140">Q: And, you were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s3141">A: So I really cannot stand certain situations.</span> <span id="s3142">And I don't like crowds.</span> <span id="s3143">I don't like loud noises.</span> <span id="s3144">I can't stand anybody screaming at me.</span> <span id="s3145">I cannot, I just lose my mind.</span> <span id="s3146">I just can't communicate and I have to really try to compose and get a hold of myself.</span> <span id="s3147">And I try to avoid situations like that.</span> <span id="s3148">And I cannot stand smell of burning gasoline.</span> <span id="s3149">When we drive in the car, Robert likes fresh air intake and I want it shut up because he cannot smell the gas and I just, I just don't want any fresh air in the car of that sort.</span> <span id="s3150">So some of the things kind of stay with me, but I try to smile, I try to show my happy face most of the time.</span> <span id="s3151">But there are times when I get these attacks of fear, of panic, and sometimes it is very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s3152">But most of the time, I can cope.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">Q: Have you found that you think over the years a lot about you're experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">A: I can't say that I think a lot, but there may be things like certain incidences that will remind me of things and I, we are making those pilgrimages now to Poland and each time I go I hope that I will find something.</span> <span id="s3155">And I know I want, I went through the records here, I mean, that was one of the purposes of the trip, was not just to have the interview but to go through the records.</span> <span id="s3156">But I realize that the records I am looking for, they wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s3157">I mean, there is no reason for them to be here because they are not complete and, as I said, the answers I am seeking, first it is probably too late.</span> <span id="s3158">You know, in the span of time.</span> <span id="s3159">I mean, people are in their 70's and sometimes they don't live that long.</span> <span id="s3160">Normally.</span> <span id="s3161">So I may be looking for people who just passed away, the normal way.</span> <span id="s3162">Like for example, when we were in Poland this last summer, Yesh-ir Mos-tof-ski (ph) was in perfect health we thought.</span> <span id="s3163">And he was.</span> <span id="s3164">And we had a nice visit.</span> <span id="s3165">My daughters, two of my daughters, met both brothers and we had tea and it was just very lovely.</span> <span id="s3166">And three days later I found out that Yesh-ir (ph) just died from a heart attack, and sat down to paint one of his painting and asked his housekeeper to bring him a cup of tea and when she returned with the cup of tea he was stretched out on the floor, gone.</span> <span id="s3167">So I know I am searching and probably the thing that I think most often about is my little sister.</span> <span id="s3168">And I watched Schindler's List, the movie in the house, we seldom go to movies.</span> <span id="s3169">We usually rent laser discs and watch them at home, but we went to the movie and we watched it.</span> <span id="s3170">And I think the scene with that little girl, I just couldn't take it.</span> <span id="s3171">I really thought I would start screaming right in the middle of the movie.</span> <span id="s3172">And I was holding Robert's hand and trying to just say, it is a movie.</span> <span id="s3173">It seemed so real to me that she was about the age of my sister.</span> <span id="s3174">And I just thought that what I was seeing on that movie, what I was seeing in the film, really was happening.</span> <span id="s3175">And that maybe my sister is somewhere there.</span> <span id="s3176">And things like that happen to me all the time.</span> <span id="s3177">I don't know whether I mentioned to you that on one of the visits in Poland, Ches-wef (ph) told me that he had a present for me and he handed me an envelope and they were pictures of my sister.</span> <span id="s3178">And he said that my father asked to take some pictures and Ches-wef (ph) was an amateur photographer, he had a Lika.</span> <span id="s3179">And he took the pictures and he gave me the copies.</span> <span id="s3180">He couldn't find the film but you don't have to have film now to make copies, so.</span> <span id="s3181">These are probably my, I consider them my very precious possessions, and I am still hoping that maybe something happened and she did survive.</span> <span id="s3182">But I don't know.</span> <span id="s3183">I know it just wouldn't be possible.</span> <span id="s3184">But not knowing whether they were killed in the ghetto or whether they were put on the truck or whether they died on the way, or whether they were put in the gas chamber, or what happened.</span> <span id="s3185">Just not knowing is probably much worse than if I really was told.</span> <span id="s3186">That this and this and this happened.</span> <span id="s3187">And then you just sort of put it away.</span> <span id="s3188">This is the same thing like funerals and wakes or memorial services, that you just sort of say good-bye to the person, say good-bye to the event, and that's it.</span> <span id="s3189">But in this way, you just don't know.</span> <span id="s3190">You don't want to consider the person dead because you don't know that they are dead.</span> <span id="s3191">And that's probably what keeps me awake very often and makes me sort of lead a double life.</span> <span id="s3192">And it's probably the hardest thing.</span> <span id="s3193">Because most of the time, I look pretty.</span> <span id="s3194">As I told you that the first time when we talked on the phone, I am not a little old lady, 74 years old.</span> <span id="s3195">I take care of myself, I go to the hairdresser, I put make-up on.</span> <span id="s3196">And I get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and I go through my exercises and I get dressed and I read the newspaper, eat breakfast, and we get in the car and I go to work.</span> <span id="s3197">And all day long I work with young people.</span> <span id="s3198">I have a very responsible job in the area that I am working because I'm the one who has to see to it that all the costumes are ready for the performance at the specific time.</span> <span id="s3199">And they are.</span> <span id="s3200">And this is one of the things that I pride myself, that we haven't, were never late.</span> <span id="s3201">That all the costumes are in lockers, all in order, a week before the dress rehearsal.</span> <span id="s3202">And then we are already working on the next production.</span> <span id="s3203">So I feel that I am doing my job and I am always smiling, and very few people know what really is happening to me.</span> <span id="s3204">But I feel that even though I lead sort of a double life, most of it is only maybe 15% of my existence.</span> <span id="s3205">And that's why I don't like to be alone and most of the time Robert has to go on a trip, I go with him.</span> <span id="s3206">And very often when he has to go back to the office in the evening, I go with him, and I can always work in my office or in my area, in the shop, and wait for him.</span> <span id="s3207">But I don't like to be home alone because then, I mean, I don't particularly like to watch television, I like to read.</span> <span id="s3208">But it is when I am alone is when I really sort of go back.</span> <span id="s3209">And I don't think that one can ever, ever forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: Do you still have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Well yes I do.</span> <span id="s3212">And Robert can tell you.</span> <span id="s3213">And I can't describe exactly what happens but sometimes I wake up and I don't know where I am and sometimes I don't wake up and then I wake up, Robert is shaking me, and I say, "What's the matter with you?"</span> <span id="s3214">And he says, "Oh nothing, just go to sleep".</span> <span id="s3215">But sometimes he wakes me up and I'm in another room and not in the bedroom.</span> <span id="s3216">And I really can't exactly describe what happens.</span> <span id="s3217">Probably the most recurring thing is that I'm somewhere in Poland and I am looking for my parents or I'm looking for my sister, or I am running away from something.</span> <span id="s3218">But I can't really describe it.</span> <span id="s3219">And I don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s3220">I don't even want to talk about it to Robert.</span> <span id="s3221">And I did talk about it to Manny, that's my second husband.</span> <span id="s3222">But because I was in a much worse state when we got married, and I told him, I didn't want to get married because I didn't think that I was well enough.</span> <span id="s3223">But I knew that he wanted to have children and I didn't know that I should have any children.</span> <span id="s3224">And as I told you before, that I really did not, I wasn't a very good mother, and like my kids say, "Well, Margaret brought us up", and I don't think that they really feel deprived and they feel that I deprived them of something, letting Margaret bring them up, but it was better that Margaret was mothering them than, you know, in a good way, than me not doing it.</span> <span id="s3225">It was better for me to not do it at all than do it in a bad way.</span> <span id="s3226">But I did, I think that the worst part was when the children were little.</span> <span id="s3227">Then later on, when they were teen-agers, I did a lot of things with them and we went on trips and we went on a lot of camping trips.</span> <span id="s3228">Manny liked to go on camping trips and we had a house trailer and food and then also I participate in the kid's education and I drove them to music lessons, to whatever lessons they had to go to and they all did very well in school.</span> <span id="s3229">I mean, when it came to their studies and things, I was able to participate.</span> <span id="s3230">But I think that the emotional part, I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s3231">I somehow feel that I could have done much more, you know, watching my friends with their children, that I haven't done as much as they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3232">Q: You mentioned that you go back to Poland quite often.</span></p> <p><span id="s3233">A: We go once a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">Q: Is that difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">A: No.</span> <span id="s3236">This is why, it is not difficult now because the first time when we went it was a sightseeing trip for Robert.</span> <span id="s3237">We went from one town to another and then the Krakow trip, part of the Krakow trip was to go to the different places and to see Ches-waf (ph) and that was the first time I saw Ches-waf (ph) after the war.</span> <span id="s3238">And it really was catharsis, I think.</span> <span id="s3239">It was rather good for me.</span> <span id="s3240">It was a very short trip, but the following year, we went for a whole month, or even five weeks.</span> <span id="s3241">And we did a lot of things, going back to the places.</span> <span id="s3242">We went to the camp Poroskov (ph) where my brother was and we walked through the fields and looked at the monuments.</span> <span id="s3243">And I think it really was good for me to do it.</span> <span id="s3244">And now we are going to go again, the 4th of June, we already have the tickets.</span> <span id="s3245">And we will be there this time only three weeks because we want to be one week in London, Robert wants to go to the theatres, and we plan to see our friends, and we planned again, we may even go to Auschwitz again and walk the road from Auschwitz to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s3246">I did walk it with my daughters a year ago.</span> <span id="s3247">And of course, it isn't the same, you walk on a sidewalk, on a paved road, and it is not very difficult.</span> <span id="s3248">But I would have preferred to go before they made the paved road, but anyway, we may walk again.</span> <span id="s3249">And I think it is, I don't think it is painful as much as it is just getting it out of my system and realizing that life goes on.</span> <span id="s3250">That I am alive.</span> <span id="s3251">That I walk the road.</span> <span id="s3252">There is another thing.</span> <span id="s3253">When I learned to drive, and before we came to California, we bought a little Nash Rambler for me.</span> <span id="s3254">And we towed it behind the big car so we had two cars.</span> <span id="s3255">And I drove the Nash Rambler for several years until finally I was in a car accident and it kind of curled up when I was through with it.</span> <span id="s3256">And so we went shopping for a car.</span> <span id="s3257">And it was several years ago because I remember Bobby was 4 years old then.</span> <span id="s3258">So we went to a Chrysler agency I believe because we were going to look at another Chrysler, and there I backed into a little car.</span> <span id="s3259">And I turned around, because I wanted a small car, and I said, "Oh, that's my size!</span> <span id="s3260">And it is robin egg blue!"</span> <span id="s3261">I loved that color.</span> <span id="s3262">And my husband said, "Stay away from it".</span> <span id="s3263">And I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s3264">"We can't afford that, you can't drive anything like this."</span> <span id="s3265">"Why not?"</span> <span id="s3266">"This is a Porsche".</span> <span id="s3267">"What's a Porsche?"</span> <span id="s3268">"A Porsche is a German car and I don't think you want it.</span> <span id="s3269">And it is very expensive."</span> <span id="s3270">You can get a Volkswagen at that time for about $1,000.00 and that Porsche was $3,000.00.</span> <span id="s3271">And I said, "I want it".</span> <span id="s3272">I wanted that car.</span> <span id="s3273">It was a two-seater with a jump seat in the back.</span> <span id="s3274">And he says, "Well where will you put the kids?"</span> <span id="s3275">And I said, "In the back.</span> <span id="s3276">Besides, I'm going to drive it."</span> <span id="s3277">We bought the Porsche and I brought it home and Bobby, my son, came out and, "Did you get a car for mother?"</span> <span id="s3278">And he says, "Oh yes, and it is your size".</span> <span id="s3279">And so he opened the door and jumped in the car and says, "How do I make it go?"</span> <span id="s3280">He says, "When you grow up.</span> <span id="s3281">This is mother's car."</span> <span id="s3282">Well anyway, I was going to write a book and I drove a Porsche and . . ., and I drove a Porsche.</span> <span id="s3283">Eleanor, my middle daughter, said that she's going to write a book, there was a book written by, I forgot who it was, but, you know, Mama's bank account.</span> <span id="s3284">I Remember Mama, they made a play out of it.</span> <span id="s3285">She was going to write, Mama's Little Porsche.</span> <span id="s3286">And the Porsche became a symbol.</span> <span id="s3287">This was a wonderful catharsis because really, every time I drove the Porsche, I remember Kramer, the Commandant of Belsen-Bergen lying on top of the truck with the dead people.</span> <span id="s3288">And I drove a Porsche.</span> <span id="s3289">And Robert is crying.</span> <span id="s3290">[Laughter] No really, this was a very, very, a lot of people ask me, "How on earth can you drive a German made car?"</span> <span id="s3291">And I said, "That's the whole point".</span> <span id="s3292">That's the whole point.</span> <span id="s3293">That I lived to drive a German car.</span> <span id="s3294">And not just, well, I didn't like Mercedes Benz because it was too expensive and in those days it was too big, but the Porsche was just my size.</span></p> <p><span id="s3295">Q: What happened to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">A: It became very, very expensive.</span> <span id="s3297">And everybody wanted my Porsche.</span> <span id="s3298">People would, when I came to a stop light, people would be honking and, roll down the window, "Hey, want to sell it?"</span> <span id="s3299">Or, "Do you want to sell the hub caps?"</span> <span id="s3300">It had the big enameled emblem of the Porsche on the hubcaps.</span> <span id="s3301">It's hub cap was about $200.00.</span> <span id="s3302">And I had it sitting on the driveway and came home one night and I found all four hubcaps gone.</span> <span id="s3303">And the side view mirror half unscrewed and the backlight completely unscrewed and gone.</span> <span id="s3304">So it was about, I forget, almost $800.00 worth of replacement.</span> <span id="s3305">And it didn't have air conditioning.</span> <span id="s3306">Robert said no.</span> <span id="s3307">And said, "Well, I can get new hub caps".</span> <span id="s3308">"Yes, you get new hub caps and sell the Porsche".</span> <span id="s3309">I said, "No, I can't sell the Porsche.</span> <span id="s3310">I want to drive the Porsche".</span> <span id="s3311">He says, "Yes, and we'll go to a Chinese restaurant and park the car just in front in the parking lot and they will start serving, you pick up you're chop sticks and you put them down and then say, 'Robert, I think somebody's taking off the hub caps, will you go and look at the Porsche?'</span> <span id="s3312">.</span> <span id="s3313">And he says, "I want to eat dinner and not to watch you're Porsche'.</span> <span id="s3314">So we are not going to drive the Porsche anymore.</span> <span id="s3315">Well, we cleaned up the garage and we drove the Porsche into the garage.</span> <span id="s3316">And once in a while I would go and look at it.</span> <span id="s3317">We replaced the hubcaps, and the back light, but I didn't drive it anymore.</span> <span id="s3318">And one beautiful day, I made a decision.</span> <span id="s3319">That the Porsche served its time and it's purpose and life goes on, and we knew a builder who said, "I will build you a dining room for the Porsche".</span> <span id="s3320">And I did have a very, we have a very nice house, but the dining room was very small.</span> <span id="s3321">And we had a special dinner for a group of friends, about fourteen people.</span> <span id="s3322">And we had to put up bridge tables and all kinds of things to make enough room for everybody.</span> <span id="s3323">And I always said, "I wish I could have a long table in the dining room".</span> <span id="s3324">And Robert said, "Well, this is you're opportunity".</span> <span id="s3325">And we get rid of the Porsche.</span> <span id="s3326">Al was the name of the builder and he said, "I'll take good care of it and you will have a beautiful dining room".</span> <span id="s3327">And I made the decision.</span> <span id="s3328">All right.</span> <span id="s3329">And he brought his flat bed because he didn't want to drive it after sitting in the garage for ten years or so, and they put the Porsche on the flat bed and he drove away.</span> <span id="s3330">And the next morning he started ripping up the old dining room and now I have a beautiful, big dining room with a table that will seat fourteen people.</span> <span id="s3331">Drexel.</span> <span id="s3332">A beautiful dining room set.</span> <span id="s3333">And the Porsche, the Porch is in good hands and I don't even want to know what happened to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">Q: Could you talk a little bit about the work that you've done?</span> <span id="s3335">I know you mentioned that you've gotten three Master's Degrees?</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">A: Well yes.</span> <span id="s3337">There is the Medical Technology, and then I did work for about a year and a half in Detroit but then when we moved to Fresno, I discovered I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s3338">So I, and then my husband worked in the hospital and I thought of getting a job there but then I really didn't want to work because I really was afraid that maybe that might hurt the baby and being in the hospital with diseases and things, so I decided to stay home.</span> <span id="s3339">But I still kept my Registry, you had to be registered in California for several years, until I eventually gave that up.</span> <span id="s3340">I decided I don't want to be Medical Technologist after all.</span> <span id="s3341">And I, when the children were little, especially when, even through my first pregnancy, I took painting lessons.</span> <span id="s3342">And I was doing a lot of painting and I enjoyed that very much.</span> <span id="s3343">Then I joined Community Theatre.</span> <span id="s3344">And they found out that I can paint and act, so I was acting in some plays.</span> <span id="s3345">And also they wanted me to help with the scenery.</span> <span id="s3346">And since, I really, I knew how to paint pictures but I didn't know that much about scenery, I went to college.</span> <span id="s3347">At that time it still was college, now it is a University.</span> <span id="s3348">And I enrolled in the Drama Department.</span> <span id="s3349">And then they said, well, why don't you just work on you're degree instead of just taking courses.</span> <span id="s3350">So I said, fine.</span> <span id="s3351">And I acted.</span> <span id="s3352">And I was an assistant to the scene designer.</span> <span id="s3353">I designed scenery for the Community Theatre and then I designed scenery for our University Theatre and I got a Masters Degree in Theatre.</span> <span id="s3354">And, at the same time, I wanted to polish up my skills in painting, so I went to the Art Department and I started getting, you know, just to get some classes in drawing and painting and sculpture.</span> <span id="s3355">And then they said, you've got enough credits now, you can really get you're Master's Degree.</span> <span id="s3356">So I started to take more graduate classes and I did get a Master's Degree in Art.</span> <span id="s3357">And that I got with distinction because I did some innovative process on my sculptures and the thesis was ceramic bowls.</span> <span id="s3358">And it was really stone ware.</span> <span id="s3359">And then I _____________ silver, copper and silver.</span> <span id="s3360">Over the stone ware.</span> <span id="s3361">And the whole thing was, again, a wonderful catharsis though, because the symbol of the bowl.</span> <span id="s3362">When we came to the camp we got a bowl.</span> <span id="s3363">One of those big, enamel bowls that were made in, probably in Schindler's factory.</span> <span id="s3364">And they are on display.</span> <span id="s3365">And here there is just a small case, but in Auschwitz there is a case the size of a small room filled with bowls.</span> <span id="s3366">And this was probably, once more, most precious possession.</span> <span id="s3367">Because if you didn't have a bowl, you could not get food.</span> <span id="s3368">That was the only way you could get you're cup of coffee or you're bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s3369">So the bowl was something that you put under you're pillow made out of blanket or a rag.</span> <span id="s3370">And you really guarded it with your life, because this was your life.</span> <span id="s3371">So I decided to make bowls that are completely useless.</span> <span id="s3372">I like pretty things so I made everything very pretty.</span> <span id="s3373">But you can't put anything in that bowl, they are either too small or too big or too crocked or too pretty.</span> <span id="s3374">You wouldn't put soup in a bowl that has beautiful design inside.</span> <span id="s3375">But then it is all goocked up with some kind of acid to make it shiny and polished and whatnot.</span> <span id="s3376">I don't think the soup would taste very well mixed with the chemicals.</span> <span id="s3377">So I made a lot of bowls.</span> <span id="s3378">And they are not just bowls, they are containers.</span> <span id="s3379">Different types of containers.</span> <span id="s3380">And I was making them just in the Art Department.</span> <span id="s3381">Some of them are thrown on a wheel, some of them are just built up.</span> <span id="s3382">And then when I got through with the stone ware and the enamel, I would move on to the chemistry department, which they gave me a lab there.</span> <span id="s3383">And that's where I would perform the ________ forming.</span> <span id="s3384">It is quite a complicated process.</span> <span id="s3385">If you use copper sulfate and the silver cyanide, and sulfate acid and electricity.</span> <span id="s3386">And I had a lot of fun connecting wires and doing things...</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">[End of Side A of Tape 8]</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">Q: Go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3389">A: Anyway, he gave me a cyanide resuscitation kit.</span> <span id="s3390">Just in case I have an accident with the silver cyanide or the gold cyanide that I was working with.</span> <span id="s3391">And the cyanide has a bitter almond smell that you can really smell it if it gets spilled and whatnot.</span> <span id="s3392">Anyway, the resuscitation kit is a, I don't know exactly what it was, I still have it.</span> <span id="s3393">This big syringe of something or other.</span> <span id="s3394">I don't think I, I told him I don't want to even think of using it, but anyway, and I was laughing and I said, "I know what cyanide is".</span> <span id="s3395">And I know it smells like bitter almonds.</span> <span id="s3396">That was probably one of the best cures for me in a certain way because I was working with materials that were the deaths in some, and the hopelessness.</span> <span id="s3397">And here I was doing and making beautiful things for the future.</span> <span id="s3398">So it is sometimes very difficult, but on the other hand, it is easy if you really want it.</span> <span id="s3399">So this is what I was doing and when I finished I had an exhibit at the University.</span> <span id="s3400">And then I had an exhibit at the Art Center.</span> <span id="s3401">And then everybody was admiring the bowls and Manny wouldn't let me sell any.</span> <span id="s3402">And I says, "Well, just a few".</span> <span id="s3403">I had made some little ones and those were for sale, but everybody was very upset that I don't want to part with them.</span> <span id="s3404">So I said no.</span> <span id="s3405">And then my Professor suggested that I send them to several exhibits and every time I send them to exhibits they were accepted.</span> <span id="s3406">Most of the time I send slides and then I have to send the real thing and the one at the Oaken Museum, they specialize in crafts and __________ and _________, they have one of my bowls.</span> <span id="s3407">They purchased it.</span> <span id="s3408">It was a purchase award.</span> <span id="s3409">And it is in the permanent collection.</span> <span id="s3410">And then the big thing was a traveling exhibit, which was in St. Paul, Minnesota and at the Renwick Gallery in Washington, and it was photographed for the album, for the souvenir album.</span> <span id="s3411">So it was all great honors.</span> <span id="s3412">And also I had one bowl exhibit at, and in the catalogue, actually it is more of a book, it’s a California Design 11.</span> <span id="s3413">So these were the great honors I had.</span> <span id="s3414">And when I finally got my Master's Degree, I finally got a job at the University in the Art Department, teaching crafts and design and ceramics and elementary art education.</span> <span id="s3415">And I took the class for the elementary art education, which was training teachers who were in child development.</span> <span id="s3416">At that time the major in child development because very hard and so we had a lot of students and we taught them, among other things, the basic art procedures that they can use with children.</span> <span id="s3417">And I enjoyed that very much because I never did any art with my kids and here I was teaching future teachers and I did quite a few innovative things.</span> <span id="s3418">I think I was quite successful at it.</span> <span id="s3419">One thing that I would say is, after being this sterility case, I ended up having four children.</span> <span id="s3420">Three cribs in one room.</span> <span id="s3421">I had four children and none in school and they are supposed to start at the age of five.</span> <span id="s3422">They were just about a year and a year and a half apart.</span> <span id="s3423">And that they all became very successful citizens, I suppose.</span> <span id="s3424">Maxine, the one that lives in Silver Springs, that's her second time in the Washington, D.C. area.</span> <span id="s3425">She is a soil scientist and she, after all these years, she finally worked up to a little bit higher position than she started with.</span> <span id="s3426">And that's where she gave up the job in Davis, California, because she got another promotion and she decided to come to Washington.</span> <span id="s3427">And Maxine is not married.</span> <span id="s3428">But Eleanor is a physician, she is a cardiologist.</span> <span id="s3429">And she is the Chief of Cardiology at Kaiser Permanente in Santa Clara.</span> <span id="s3430">They live in Los Altos and she is married to a physician who is an endocrinologist but he works in research.</span> <span id="s3431">And then the next one is Robert, Bobby.</span> <span id="s3432">That's the only son.</span> <span id="s3433">And he is in New York in finances, whatever that is.</span> <span id="s3434">He's a broker and he's also an author of two books on politics.</span> <span id="s3435">'Democratic Blueprints' and one that was sort of a promotional book for Bill Clinton.</span> <span id="s3436">'Bill Clinton, the Politician', or whatever the title was.</span> <span id="s3437">And then the youngest daughter graduated from, well she went to Berkley and then she graduated from Humbolt University, which is in Northern California, in environmental science.</span> <span id="s3438">And she was a backcountry ranger for eleven years.</span> <span id="s3439">And she was patrolling the area in Kern River Canyon for six months and going to school for six months.</span> <span id="s3440">And she finally graduated and then she got her credentials and now she is a sixth grade teacher married to a music teacher.</span> <span id="s3441">And she herself is an accomplished musician.</span> <span id="s3442">She has played the bassoon and the violin.</span> <span id="s3443">And Eleanor, who is the doctor, is an accomplished harpsichord player.</span> <span id="s3444">I sort of mention that because, again, life goes on.</span> <span id="s3445">And I am looking forward to my grandchildren growing up.</span> <span id="s3446">Eleanor has three boys and __________, the youngest, has a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s3447">And that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">Q:
