1990</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Please tell us your name, where you were born, and when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: My name is Helene Baraf, named Zupnik.</span> <span id="s16">I am born in Antwerp, Belgium, the 24th of July 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell us about your family and your childhood before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Uh...I will start to tell you a little bit about my...uh... ancestors.</span> <span id="s19">Uh...I come from two very famous branches... uh...of...uh...the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s20">My great grand uncle was...uh...Rabbi Meisels (ph) who has a synagogue named ... uh...after him in Prague and on my father's side I have Rabbi Dovelando (ph), who was very famous too, who has another synagogue named...uh...after him.</span> <span id="s21">Uh...my mother came from a very religious family.</span> <span id="s22">She had four brothers and four sisters.</span> <span id="s23">And...uh...she was the only who survived the Holocaust, and they all had many, many children because that was the way of life in that time.</span> <span id="s24">And...uh...she was already...uh...an older person when she met my....my father who came from Czechoslovakia and she accepted to...to marry him after refusing many, many suitors.</span> <span id="s25">And...uh...they lived in Krakow for one year...uh...where my brother was born in 1924, in July 26, 1924.</span> <span id="s26">And after the...they stayed uncast.</span> <span id="s27">That means that....uh...her brother was...uh... keeping them for a year where my father...when my father was studying.</span> <span id="s28">And then after the time was gone, they came to Belgium where I was born the 24th of July 1927.</span> <span id="s29">Uh...I grew up there, and we lived...uh...nicely.</span> <span id="s30">My father and my mother...in the beginning were working in the diamonds business.</span> <span id="s31">She was a Schleifer which means she was, I don't know how to say that in English...she...they were...he...she was not a cutter.</span> <span id="s32">A Schleifer is what a polisher...a diamond polisher and...uh...little by little my father became...uh...courtier.</span> <span id="s33">Is that an English word?</span> <span id="s34">Courtier?</span> <span id="s35">Uh...He was selling for other diamonds and...uh...uh...life became easier and...uh...I was going as a child in...uh...in the...and my first language was French so I went to grammar school in Belgium and on Wednesday afternoon and Sunday morning I went to Jewish school.</span> <span id="s36">My brother went to a Jewish school for...uh...the whole day where he learned Hebrew and Jewish and...uh...French and Flemish.</span> <span id="s37">Uh...in...in 1940 when I finished...uh...no...let's go back to 1937...uh...when I came to American.</span> <span id="s38">To tell you the story why we came to America is because...uh...by great grandfather died here in America in 1936.</span> <span id="s39">They came, I think, after the First World War here with all the children but my grandmother was already married in...uh...in Czechoslovakia so she was...uh...I think she was the oldest daughter.</span> <span id="s40">So she remained with her husband and her children there in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s41">This is why I have...uh...in reality I am a third generation already American because... uh...my family is here.</span> <span id="s42">So my father came here to America to...for the question of the inheritance.</span> <span id="s43">And he liked it so much because he found all the family here that he didn't know.</span> <span id="s44">His cousins, his uncles...uh...it was...uh...very happy situation for him.</span> <span id="s45">So he wanted to immigrate.</span> <span id="s46">And we immigrated really to America in September of 37.</span> <span id="s47">For me as a child it was a shock because it was in the depression era and...uh...we lived in the low east side.</span> <span id="s48">We...compared to what...how we lived in New York or...in Antwerp, was a big difference.</span> <span id="s49">It was a misery compared to that.</span> <span id="s50">And...uh...although I..</span> <span id="s51">.</span> <span id="s52">I loved to be with all these cousins that I didn't know but...uh...unfortunately they send me to school...uh...as a....with the beginners.</span> <span id="s53">I was already 10 at the time and it was very hard for me because I didn't spoke the language.</span> <span id="s54">My brother, who was three years older, and finished already grammar school, immediately entered to high school and instead to be in the sixth...I don't know...in the first year, they sent him immediately in the third grade.</span> <span id="s55">I don't know to compare that with the American.</span> <span id="s56">So he was very happy.</span> <span id="s57">I was very unhappy here, and I cried a lot and...uh...it...because it was a very difficult time at that time with the depression and my...my mother and father had a lot of difficulties making out.</span> <span id="s58">So we came to the conclusion that...uh...maybe it would be easier for my father if we send...we went back...uh...to Antwerp and...uh...this is what they decided to do.</span> <span id="s59">We went...me and my brother and my mother, we went back to Antwerp and my father stayed here in America.</span> <span id="s60">My mother was from...uh...the...from Galicia, and she spoke a beautiful Polish and beautiful German and she was great admir... admirer of...uh...of German poetry from Heine and...uh...and she sang German Lieders to me, so I..</span> <span id="s61">.</span> <span id="s62">I never studied German, but I do speak and I do understand it.</span> <span id="s63">And...uh... she never believed that...uh....</span> <span id="s64">German with their culture could do anything to the Jews she said.</span> <span id="s65">Although we saw all the people coming from Germany in 1939, she said...but...it's not so terrible.</span> <span id="s66">My father was very scared because he heard all the rumors and he came to bring us back to America in September of 39.</span> <span id="s67">And my mother refused to go back to America.</span> <span id="s68">She said, "Not back and forth.</span> <span id="s69">You come back to...to Europe."</span> <span id="s70">My father said, "No," so he stayed in America.</span> <span id="s71">So unfortunately because of this...uh...dispute between them we stayed in Belgium.</span> <span id="s72">Uh...The German invaded Belgium in the beginning of May.</span> <span id="s73">I think...uh...around the 10th of May...I cannot know exactly...uh...and 10 days later we...my mother decided we cannot stay.</span> <span id="s74">Uh...It was the war.</span> <span id="s75">So we took some of our possessions and we took the train direction of France.</span> <span id="s76">The train was stopped at the...uh...I don't know how you say that.</span> <span id="s77">At the frontier?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: At the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: At the border.</span> <span id="s80">And...uh...we couldn't take...uh...although we had little...few suitcases and we started to go across the border and walk in...because we didn't know where we wanted to go, but as far as possible.</span> <span id="s81">And we started to walk through Moucron.</span> <span id="s82">I remember the border was Moucron, and we walked with the suitcases and with a lot of other people who were stopped there too who...and we went to Amiens, to Cambrai and...uh...it took us about two weeks under the bombing...the uh...the German with...uh... How do you say that their...their planes they were...uh...shooting at us and we were...had to run in the...uh...in the ditches for...for protection and a lot of people were killed in front of us.</span> <span id="s83">But...uh...finally we arrived in Lille where they put us in a school.</span> <span id="s84">No, it was more a college, a college where they had dormitory and where we slept and we stayed there for a month.</span> <span id="s85">And...uh...then the German occupied all France, so we had to go to...towards...uh... normal life.</span> <span id="s86">So we...my mother rented an apartment in Lille.</span> <span id="s87">I remember it was rue Solferino 142.</span> <span id="s88">It's funny how my memory can remember certain things and others.</span> <span id="s89">Rue Solferino 142, and not far from there, I had my high school.</span> <span id="s90">And my husband went to his high school.</span> <span id="s91">And...uh...my mother had a little money so for a time things were alright.</span> <span id="s92">We lived...uh...and...uh...and days went by and the years went by because it was from May 40 til...I cannot say exactly when the Germans started to do all the miseries.</span> <span id="s93">I think it was from...uh...the beginning of 42.</span> <span id="s94">Uh...they asked us to register as Jew.</span> <span id="s95">We were forced to wear the...the Jewish...uh...star and...uh...we obeyed what we were...uh...uh...we're supposed to do and...uh...life went on.</span> <span id="s96">Unfortunately, my...my brother had a birthday in July 42 and for his birthday my mother bought...brought... bought him...uh...a trench coat.</span> <span id="s97">And...uh...this trench coat, unfortunately, cost him his life because...uh....the Jews were forced to...couldn't go where they wanted in a cafe.</span> <span id="s98">There was one cafe where the Jews could go and where they gathered.</span> <span id="s99">And...uh...my...uh....my brother was a very quiet boy and very shy and very straightforward, very honest...uh...no haughtiness.</span> <span id="s100">Uh...he played there...him with his friend, he played chess there.</span> <span id="s101">And one day when he was playing there...uh...the guy of the Gestapo came and asked...uh...to whom does belong that trenchcoat.</span> <span id="s102">And my father...my brother stupidly answered, "It's mine."</span> <span id="s103">And...uh...there was no Jewish...uh...cross...uh...Star of David on it, so they took him to jail.</span> <span id="s104">My mother immediately went to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s105">She saw the guy of the Gestapo, and begged him to release him and say...telling him it was his birthday.</span> <span id="s106">It's a mistake.</span> <span id="s107">He had it on his suit, the Star of David, but not on the coat so.</span> <span id="s108">But nothing doing.</span> <span id="s109">They...they wouldn't release him.</span> <span id="s110">Uh...he stayed in jail in Loos.</span> <span id="s111">It's a section of Lille, and from there they sent him to...through Belgium, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s112">There were a few of them that were taken at the same day.</span> <span id="s113">And I know well that he was in Auschwitz because one of the guys who was taken together with him came back, and he told me that he was well liked with the German...they liked him because he...he has such a serious...uh...he was a serious nature, so he did whatever he had to do.</span> <span id="s114">And he was alive til July 1944 because...uh...he saw him at that time and then he...they were separated, and he doesn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s115">He was in Auschwitz-Birkenau, and he gave me his number, but I cannot remember it.</span> <span id="s116">He...uh...I know that for a fact that he was waiting because he was born in Poland, but he was very little...a baby when he came to Belgium so he didn't know the family.</span> <span id="s117">So he was waiting... uh...all the family there, and he introduced himself to the family so he...he learned to know his family...and between them was a cousin who...who...to whom he told that he came from Lille and...uh...and that we...me and my mother, we were there.</span> <span id="s118">So after the war, this cousin by accident met...uh...a girl from Antwerp and...uh...uh...he himself was the son of a very extremely rich man who had buildings and...and...uh...uh...petroleum pit....</span> <span id="s119">I don't know how you call that...uh...so he sold something and...uh...because he...he couldn't take the money so he bought some gold and put it in his shoe and because he didn't want to go directly to Antwerp, he came through France and was looking a way to go through the...uh...frontier.</span> <span id="s120">And when he passed Lille, he remembered...he remembered that he had an aunt there, so he went to the Jewish community and asked if there was a Mrs. Zupnik here.</span> <span id="s121">And he found us.</span> <span id="s122">And he told us that he saw my brother there in the concentration, but he lost him also in 44, and he doesn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s123">Uh...and he went to live in Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: Tell us what happened to you and your mother after your brother was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s126">Because...uh...my mother went to the German Gestapo, she was scared to do anything because she thought if she would escape...she would run away, there would be retaliation against him.</span> <span id="s127">So we stayed.</span> <span id="s128">We continued for one month our life and on the evening of Yom Kippur in...uh....in very early in the morning, two men of the Gestapo came into our house and...uh...took us.</span> <span id="s129">My mother put some stuff, some money away, and gave it to the...the lady...uh...where we lived to put it way in case...uh... uh...we escaped...uh...we wouldn't be without anything.</span> <span id="s130">So, but the story that happened is really like a miracle.</span> <span id="s131">We went to the...uh...railroad.</span> <span id="s132">The German took us to the railroad where there were about 3,000 families...Jewish family were there and...uh...from the early morning.</span> <span id="s133">It was a very hot day.</span> <span id="s134">We stayed...uh...there at the railroad waiting what the German would do with us.</span> <span id="s135">And I saw a lot of people because it was the eve of the holidays, they went to their homes and brought back chicken and food and it was like an entertainment party, and suddenly I see my mother and she said, "Come.</span> <span id="s136">Come.</span> <span id="s137">We have to go somewhere."</span> <span id="s138">And she says...and I said, "No, I..</span> <span id="s139">.</span> <span id="s140">I have my friends here.</span> <span id="s141">I want to stay here."</span> <span id="s142">Said, "Come.</span> <span id="s143">Come.</span> <span id="s144">Come.</span> <span id="s145">You have to come."</span> <span id="s146">So I followed my mother and we were taken to a room...uh...a very tiny room.</span> <span id="s147">We were about 13 persons there.</span> <span id="s148">And the door they put wood on the door so the Germans wouldn't know that room existed.</span> <span id="s149">After awhile, we heard...uh...the train...uh...leaving and the whole place was very quiet because...uh...3,000 people do a lot of noise.</span> <span id="s150">And we stayed there and it was a very scary night because we had a few...a few men who were very nervous.</span> <span id="s151">There was a window and we heard the Gestapo walking back and forth.</span> <span id="s152">And...uh...I was...uh, I was already 14 at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Who...who came to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: A man...a man of the underground.</span> <span id="s155">And he asked her, "Do you want to be saved?"</span> <span id="s156">And my mother said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s157">And as a matter of fact I asked my mother later, "How come that you decide to...to be saved because you were scared...uh...that something would happen."</span> <span id="s158">Well...then she answered me, "I realized at that time there was nothing any more to be lost because they were taking us so I wanted to save you and myself."</span> <span id="s159">And so we were...uh...put in that room and men are men...very selfish...some people start to...want to smoke cigarettes and they put the lights and the matches and we were scared...uh...terribly because...uh...they could see the lights.</span> <span id="s160">So we stayed...uh...in.</span> <span id="s161">.</span> <span id="s162">uh...all night there.</span> <span id="s163">I think around 1 o'clock men came through the window.</span> <span id="s164">They put a ladder at the window and they took us out.</span> <span id="s165">And since that time we were taken over by the underground.</span> <span id="s166">They took us...which is...uh.</span> <span id="s167">.</span> <span id="s168">very curious story.</span> <span id="s169">And it is an explanation.</span> <span id="s170">They took us to a whore house because this where people who were...the whores.</span> <span id="s171">I didn't know, but they have very big hearts.</span> <span id="s172">They (pause)...they are known for that...that...that they will do lot of things for...to save people.</span> <span id="s173">And we stayed in a whore house for a few days, and we saw the underground coming back with guns and all things and it was a very scary story.</span> <span id="s174">And then they came back with ...uh...false identification for me and my mother and for the other peoples and we were separated.</span> <span id="s175">And I, as a girl, young girl, I could go to a convent.</span> <span id="s176">My mother could not, unfortunate, for her.</span> <span id="s177">So she had to go on her own and...uh...it was very painful.</span> <span id="s178">She told me that many times she slept in the streets.</span> <span id="s179">She had no where to go.</span> <span id="s180">She was in the hiding and for her, the situation was worse because she went to the Gestapo and they knew her face.</span> <span id="s181">And she had the false identification.</span> <span id="s182">Uh...they gave me the name...I kept my...uh...my...uh...real date of birth because I was scared to...uh...to be mixed up, and I became Helene Delcombre.</span> <span id="s183">And...uh...I went to the convent and...uh...they were very nice to us and I..</span> <span id="s184">.</span> <span id="s185">uh...my mother was...uh... worried because I was going to high school and for her the studies was a very important thing so she made me...uh... subscribe at a school where you could send.</span> <span id="s186">.</span> <span id="s187">uh... correspondence school.</span> <span id="s188">But it wasn't working.</span> <span id="s189">And I stayed there from...from September til...I think a little bit after the Easter holidays.</span> <span id="s190">Then from...and...uh...I heard a lot of times that the German were coming in...uh...the convent looking for Jewish children.</span> <span id="s191">There I met a lot of other Jewish children and I met a girl that I knew and I know a lot of babies were taken.</span> <span id="s192">A lot of people of saved that we don't know about it but...uh...uh....one person were telling the other.</span> <span id="s193">Just by ear we found out that...uh...that the French people were extraordinary.</span> <span id="s194">And...uh...to them when they...when the people say that they were anti-Semites, they didn't even know what it was to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s195">They thought we were....uh...like...uh...des Auvergnats.</span> <span id="s196">They were cheap with the money.</span> <span id="s197">It's a part of section of France where people are very...I don't know the right expression...one penny is a penny.</span> <span id="s198">They don't want to spend it.</span> <span id="s199">So they thought Jews are like these people.</span> <span id="s200">So to say that they were anti-Semite, it's the wrong thing because they didn't even know that...uh...what exactly is a Jew and physically the Jews looked like I and my mother who comes from an extremely religious fam...family.</span> <span id="s201">She looks like a Polish girl, like a Polish peasant with...uh...the cheeks and the nose.</span> <span id="s202">Uh...it's amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: What was life like daily in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: In the convent?</span> <span id="s205">I was supposed to have the normal life from the children.</span> <span id="s206">I was not supposed...I didn't tell no one that...uh...only one girl that I knew from the outside.</span> <span id="s207">I recognized her.</span> <span id="s208">The other children didn't know that I had to conform to the rules.</span> <span id="s209">I had to go everyday to Mass with the...I..</span> <span id="s210">.</span> <span id="s211">I was doing except I didn't take...uh...I don't know...the...uh...I didn't take the whole because I didn't go to confession.</span> <span id="s212">But except of this, I was doing exactly like the...uh...the other girls because....uh...I didn't want to attract attention...uh...to whom I was.</span> <span id="s213">I was normal to do exactly like the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: And what did you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Well, early morning we went to Mass.</span> <span id="s216">Uh...They were children that...uh...uh...uh...our Lady of the Good Shepherd...that was the convent that I went...and there were children that...uh...had thing...they were children how...I don't know how to say that.</span> <span id="s217">That did things that were not right.</span> <span id="s218">They were...or vagrant or children that did things that were not...uh...right for children to do.</span> <span id="s219">The rebellious children...uh...were...but they were very young.</span> <span id="s220">Some...uh...some were from...uh...the age of six til...uh... til...uh...16 because...uh...16 you are...in France you could work.</span> <span id="s221">So....</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: How did you get along with the other children?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Very well because...uh...why not?</span> <span id="s224">(Chuckle) I am a French girl like every French girl and I don't look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s225">Nobody could...uh...guess...uh...anything and I..</span> <span id="s226">.</span> <span id="s227">and I was smart enough...uh...not to talk about this things.</span> <span id="s228">Uh...I went to Mass.</span> <span id="s229">I ate.</span> <span id="s230">I..</span> <span id="s231">.</span> <span id="s232">uh...I..</span> <span id="s233">.</span> <span id="s234">uh...we had...uh... religious... uh...blessings...uh...I did whatever the other children...we did...uh...some work...uh...some hand knitting, some...uh... embroideries.</span> <span id="s235">Whatever the other children did, I did.</span> <span id="s236">And...uh...a little bit I did some school by correspondence, but it wasn't good.</span> <span id="s237">So my mother decided that I had to go back to high school.</span> <span id="s238">So then we were taken over by the Protestant community.</span> <span id="s239">Uh...I remember the name was Mr. Pausch, and this was in...I was staying in Lille, and this was in Roubaix which was... uh...there were three cities around Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, which were about...uh...half an hour distant one of the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Did you see your mother often?</span> <span id="s241">How did you get from the convent to the Protestant community.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I never went out from the convent...uh...unless I had an operation from the amigdales.</span> <span id="s243">How do you say that?</span> <span id="s244">How do you say that.</span> <span id="s245">I had to have the...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Tonsils?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: The tonsils removed.</span> <span id="s248">That's the only time I went out.</span> <span id="s249">My mother came to see me and brought me food.</span> <span id="s250">I don't know how she did it, but...uh...she still found the time to and the money to give me...uh...because it was...uh...very very hard time.</span> <span id="s251">We were eating bread with...uh...sawdust in the bread.</span> <span id="s252">It was...uh...very bad bread.</span> <span id="s253">The food was terrible.</span> <span id="s254">It was war, and many times we had...uh...we heard English plane coming and bombing.</span> <span id="s255">It was war.</span> <span id="s256">It wasn't... uh.</span> <span id="s257">.</span> <span id="s258">easy time for no one and... So she decided I should go to school.</span> <span id="s259">So she...I don't know how she found out the Protestant community, and they gave us some lodging somewhere outside of Roubaix and I was enrolled in the Roubaix High School.</span> <span id="s260">It was very difficult thing because in that school I met a girl that I was in school in Lille and she knew my real name.</span> <span id="s261">And suddenly from Helene Zupnik, I became Helene Delcombre.</span> <span id="s262">And I didn't know how to do it.</span> <span id="s263">I was young.</span> <span id="s264">I was 15 years old and I was very childish at the time.</span> <span id="s265">But then I had an idea.</span> <span id="s266">I knew she was...uh...a scout.</span> <span id="s267">So I took her on the side, and I told her, "You know I want to tell you a story, but you have to tell...to swear me on your scout's honor that you will not tell nobody...uh ...what's the true story.</span> <span id="s268">I am a Jewish girl, and I have false identification paper and nobody's supposed to know it."</span> <span id="s269">She said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s270">I will not tell anyone."</span> <span id="s271">And the irony is that I didn't know that at the time, but that girl herself was half Jewish.</span> <span id="s272">And so...uh... uh...I stayed in that school...uh...til the end of the war.</span> <span id="s273">But I didn't stay...you see the thing is that every day life to be in...uh...people get tired to be...uh...helpful to others.</span> <span id="s274">You know it's not easy to take the...uh...uh...the mother and the daughter.</span> <span id="s275">They live and after awhile, the cohabitation with that person was difficult so we had to move and my mother found a place in Tourcoing.</span> <span id="s276">She found a lot...a very miserable place, but we didn't have where to go so we were happy to go there.</span> <span id="s277">And I continued to go to Roubaix.</span> <span id="s278">And...uh...I spoke to that girl because...uh... she...she...she was the only knew...one who knew her...my identify and I told her, "You know, we are living in Tourcoing in a miserable place and with the bombing all the time and the cold.</span> <span id="s279">We didn't have what to heat."</span> <span id="s280">So she came her...her parents were very rich, extremely rich.</span> <span id="s281">Uh...uh...Her father was a kind of...uh...nobility and she said...she spoke to her parents and she said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s282">I have an idea.</span> <span id="s283">I will take you in my...uh...we have the gardener's house there.</span> <span id="s284">And she presented me to her mother and her father who were very nice and she took me out...in their house where we stayed til the liberation.</span> <span id="s285">And they never told us what they really were.</span> <span id="s286">After the war in December of 44, I had the surprise of a cousin who came and found me there.</span> <span id="s287">His name was Jerry Balomich from...uh...he lives in (pause)...at the time he lived in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s288">And he found me.</span> <span id="s289">By miracle.</span> <span id="s290">How he found me, he first looked at the first high school, and he met somebody that I met a few days before who I told I was going to the LycÃ©e of Roubaix and it's unbelievable, but he found me.</span> <span id="s291">Then...uh...he could report to my father that we were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Had you had no contact with your father at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I received...uh...a letter of the Red Cross in...in 1941 from my father.</span> <span id="s294">That's the only contact I had.</span> <span id="s295">So he knew we were alive in 41, but afterwards he didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What happened after the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: ...happy time and we were waiting that...uh...my brother would come back and my father was writing.</span> <span id="s298">He said we should come to America.</span> <span id="s299">And my mother said, "Yes, but I have to wait first that my...uh...son comes back."</span> <span id="s300">And we went to Paris to the different organization...organization to find out if...if he was still alive and he was coming back, but we never...uh...we never got any news about him and we never knew except by...by these two witness who came back who told me that they...he was in Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he was alive til July 44.</span> <span id="s301">Then I have no...no other news and...uh...he never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: You said your husband was in high school with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: My husband.</span> <span id="s304">No.</span> <span id="s305">My husband came from Rumania.</span> <span id="s306">How could he come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: No.</span> <span id="s308">That's what I wondered.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s310">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s311">Uh...no no.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Do you want to know more about my life afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s315">Tell me about the...the early years after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: After the war I continued to go to high school.</span> <span id="s317">And...uh... my father was much younger than my mother.</span> <span id="s318">And he was a very religious Jew and...uh...because he lost his son he wanted to have another son.</span> <span id="s319">So it was very important for him so and because she couldn't bear any children, he divorced my mother and...uh...I remained...uh...in France and he remained in...in America.</span> <span id="s320">And it was a terrible shock to me.</span> <span id="s321">I went into a deep depression because of that and...uh...I couldn't study anymore.</span> <span id="s322">And...uh...I got married very early.</span> <span id="s323">In 19...in December 1948 and I had a daughter and in 51...uh...when my father died, I couldn't stand my husband anymore.</span> <span id="s324">And I divorced him.</span> <span id="s325">And in 56, I met my second husband who came from Israel and...uh...we moved to Paris and we start a new life.</span> <span id="s326">Unfortunately, in ...uh...June 18, 1959, a car struck my daughter and she died the same day.</span> <span id="s327">And life goes on.</span> <span id="s328">And...uh...my husband always dreamed of America.</span> <span id="s329">Uh...As soon as he became French in...uh...in 66, the first thing he did, he came to visit America.</span> <span id="s330">He had...he...he also was a third generation of America.</span> <span id="s331">His grandfather came here from Rumania to...to Israel where he wasn't successful and then he came to America and Canada because it was difficult at that time to come to America from Canada.</span> <span id="s332">They went to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s333">And...uh...he loved America too when he came to visit in 66.</span> <span id="s334">And...uh...in 69 we came.</span> <span id="s335">In June, as a matter of fact, the same day as my daughter died.</span> <span id="s336">June 18, 1969 we came to America, and we became American citizens.</span> <span id="s337">My husband died in...uh...May 29, 1980, and...uh...I remained alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Have you...uh...made contact with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: Oh sure.</span> <span id="s340">Oh sure.</span> <span id="s341">I was...uh...accept[ed] with open arms.</span> <span id="s342">I'm the...prodigal...prodigal child...uh...because...uh...coming back to the...they knew me as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Do you have family here?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Unfortunately, most of them died now and...uh...now I am alone...uh...and it's very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s346">Thank you.</span> <span id="s347">Was it so hard as you thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: When you start you...it goes, it flows.</span> <span id="s349">(laughter) It is...uh...something very funny that...uh...it's tragic comedy at the same time.</span> <span id="s350">Uh...the lady who accepted her... us to stay in her gardener's house was very nice to us and said goodbye to us when we moved away and we lived in another section of Lille.</span> <span id="s351">And...uh...over the years we lost contact with her.</span> <span id="s352">But when I got married, my mother got very ill, and she couldn't stay by herself and in Paris we lived in a very small apartment and we couldn't...uh...keep her with us.</span> <span id="s353">So she went to the Rothschild Institution and she was accepted there.</span> <span id="s354">There she met a gentleman that she liked very much because he was a German Jew and she spoke a perfect German, so she found her alter ego.</span> <span id="s355">And...uh...it was a little love affair.</span> <span id="s356">He was (laughter) already 84 and she was in her...in her early 60s, so she was a beauty for him.</span> <span id="s357">And...uh...it was by an irony...by a twist of fate, this gentleman was the uncle of the mother of my friend in school.</span> <span id="s358">So then I found out...uh...10 years later that the mother who received me in her house herself was a Jewish lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: And that was the first you knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: That's the first time I found out.</span> <span id="s361">They never told me.</span> <span id="s362">Montaigne was the name of her husband.</span> <span id="s363">I can't remember the name of the gentleman who was very good to my mother because...uh...she had Parkinson Disease.</span> <span id="s364">And...uh...she broke her ankle, and she was...uh...taken to the hospital and he sustained her very much.</span> <span id="s365">But the irony is that he was the uncle of the lady who saved her...us in her garden.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Do you have any other memories of the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Like what?</span> <span id="s368">What kind of memories?</span> <span id="s369">What we did through...during the war or...it was war time.</span> <span id="s370">Uh...but life goes on.</span> <span id="s371">Uh...I am a young...uh...girl...uh... I went to school.</span> <span id="s372">I..</span> <span id="s373">.</span> <span id="s374">uh...I..</span> <span id="s375">.</span> <span id="s376">I lived a normal life, but with false identification papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: What was...what were the nuns like in the convent?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Very nice.</span> <span id="s379">They...uh...they behaved with me...they knew who I was, but...uh...they behaved very nicely.</span> <span id="s380">They saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Were there a lot of Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s383">A lot.</span> <span id="s384">But...uh...there were so many different places...uh...but I suppose from...uh...most of the Jewish community was wiped out...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did...did you ever see the nuns again?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: After the war, I went to...to find them.</span> <span id="s387">Yes.</span> <span id="s388">I went to see all these people who thanked me naturally, but...uh... LIfe goes on...uh...and you are taken by many occupations and preoccupation and...uh...you forget and...uh...I thought that it was important to tell these things because many people say it never happened so before I die I want to bear witness to these things because I..</span> <span id="s389">.</span> <span id="s390">I suffered them and...uh...unfortunately I lost so many people because of it, and people say it never happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: And that's important for us.</span> <span id="s392">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">People from the French region of Auvergne USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0015 page \* arabic2 USHMM Archives RG-50.030*15 page \* arabic9</span></p> <p><span id="s395">page \* arabic9</span></p></body></html>
