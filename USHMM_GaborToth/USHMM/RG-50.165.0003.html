family was religious, but not hasidish religious…but he (my father) had a beard…</span></p> <p><span id="s23">WH: After the war, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">RB: We came home before the war ended…we were liberated not far from ?</span> <span id="s25">Warsaw?</span> <span id="s26">…</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WH: What year did you come to America?’</span></p> <p><span id="s28">RB: 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">WH: How did it happen that you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">RB: I’ll tell you, we wanted to go to Israel, we have family here, and family there, but our closest family was in Israel, an aunt that we loved very much…but we had family in New York, so uncles sent papers, and to Israel you couldn’t go because it wasn’t a state yet…and to go illegally, I didn’t want to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">RB: My brother went, he was on the Exodus with his wife…and my sister went…and my husband was in the American army…, I mean, we were third cousins, and I ask him if there was a way to come to America.</span> <span id="s33">So he send me papers as if his fiancée would come, and then we wanted to get married, if we liked one another, is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WH: You were single then?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">RB: I was single.</span> <span id="s36">And he was also single.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">WH: He was already in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">RB: He was in the American army…He left Europe long before the war…</span></p> <p><span id="s39">WH: Oh, so he wasn’t a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">RB: No…he lost his family.</span> <span id="s41">His parents and everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">WH: You said to me that he doesn’t like to talk about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">RB: No, because it hurts him very much.</span> <span id="s44">(inaudible)…he’s more sensitive about it than I am…(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s45">WH: What I’m curious about is that you said to me that you were more capable of surviving than the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">RB: I was stronger.</span> <span id="s47">Physically and emotionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: You were always like that, you would say, as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">RB: I don’t know as a child, but when I was 20 or so, I was the third in the family, and my sister had a baby, so you know, she was emotional about the baby, and so, I was always taking care of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">WH: How many brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">RB: Four boys and three girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">WH: How many made it through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">RB: Four of us.</span> <span id="s54">I have a sister and two brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: …two brothers are alive, one lives in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">RB: Yes…and the other one in California…</span></p> <p><span id="s57">WH: Did your brothers and sister all stay religious after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">RB: One brother has a religious wife…not as religious as we are…the one that’s here, in Israel, yah, like B’nei Akivah, like Mizrachi type religious…</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: You came to America…your brother and sister…left for Israel.</span> <span id="s60">Didn’t you feel like joining them?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">RB: See, the idea was, to leave Europe altogether, and then later you’ll think about getting together.</span> <span id="s62">You understand?</span> <span id="s63">Because that was getting Communist…I lived in Prague, wasn’t yet,…but you hear how they talked about Communism, that’s the only way to live, and you know, against Capitalism.</span> <span id="s64">A lot of people were trained in Moscow for that.</span> <span id="s65">So these (Russian) officers, we invited for Friday night dinner, and they, after dinner, when we said ‘goodbye,’ they said that in a short time we won’t be able to live like this.</span> <span id="s66">To be religious and everything.</span> <span id="s67">So they gave us a warning…this brother (who is now) in California was very sick.</span> <span id="s68">He had all kinds of things that he went through from the Army…so I had to be near him.</span> <span id="s69">(inaudible) from one sanitorium to another…so, I said, ‘how can we take him (to Israel he is so sick).’</span> <span id="s70">So, ‘first of all, we have to get out of here (Prague), and then we’ll think about getting together again.’</span> <span id="s71">…and as sick as he was, he wanted to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s72">(this brother who lived in California)…so I left Prague and he was suppose to follow me, because our uncles sent us papers.</span> <span id="s73">So he said, ‘He decided to go to Israel.’</span> <span id="s74">And I said, ‘(inaudible) they suffered so much, they don’t have have what to eat here.’</span> <span id="s75">because we kept on sending packages.</span> <span id="s76">They don’t have clothing, nothing, I said, ‘You’ll be just a burden on them.</span> <span id="s77">Why don’t you come here, and then later, we’ll all go there.’</span> <span id="s78">So he did me a favor, and he came there, and he went through operations, and all kinds of sicknesses, but he’s the type that he always pulls up.</span> <span id="s79">This is some will power…</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: Did you really think that when you left for America, was it in the back of your mind, did you think you were really going to Israel later?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">RB: I wouldn’t have wanted to be separated from the family.</span> <span id="s82">Because that was very important.</span> <span id="s83">But, it was no way to go, because they needed us, of course from there, you know, financial support.</span> <span id="s84">And packages, food and clothing, and everyting, so I thought, ‘Someday,’ we’ll come.</span> <span id="s85">It was always in the back of our minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: And they had already gone before you.</span> <span id="s87">How much later after they went to Israel, did you go to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">RB: The same year.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">WH: …where does your sister…and brother live?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">RB: In Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: …now, you had this affidavit, from your cousin, who later became your husband…when you left for America, you left from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">RB: I flew to Sweden…and I took (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s93">D…?</span> <span id="s94">and RB can’t remember exactly) a boat from Sweden to America…a regular commercial boat…I think my husband sent me the tickets…</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: …when the boat came into New York who greeted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">RB: My husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: Did he know you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">RB: Yes…but he didn’t know that we’ll get married.</span> <span id="s99">(He knew me) just as a cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: He lived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">RB: No, Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: So, he came from Cleveland to meet you.</span> <span id="s103">Then you went by train to Cleveland.</span> <span id="s104">What was it like when you came to Cleveland?</span> <span id="s105">What were the people like in Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">RB: They were nice.</span> <span id="s107">See, most of the people, who came right there, they were full of complaints about their relatives who didn’t make a big deal out of them.</span> <span id="s108">You know, they came from--they thought, they’ll be so happy with them, and they’ll give them everything, the rich Americans.</span> <span id="s109">I didn’t need that.</span> <span id="s110">Because I came, and we decided almost right away to get married.</span> <span id="s111">It was love at first sight, there, when he came to the boat, and the first thing, he was so pleasant, and so good-looking, and everything, and so, I wasn’t there like a ‘greener,’ what you call them.</span> <span id="s112">I spoke a little English…and I was dressed nicely, and so we decided to get married, so I was treated like a businessman’s wife.</span> <span id="s113">Not like the people who came, and they start a new life.</span> <span id="s114">(My cousin, my husband) already had a business.</span> <span id="s115">He had a restaurant at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">WH: Was he observant?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">RB: Not as much as now…(here in Israel) some Hasidim moved in, and I’ll tell you, sometimes you get—we got more than we bargained for.</span> <span id="s118">We wanted a religious community, but we didn’t-I wasn’t very happy that I have to-I cover my head when I go out… I don’t have to, but I don’t want my husband to be offended if I didn’t.</span> <span id="s119">He is very close with all the rabbonim here.</span> <span id="s120">And so, it wouldn’t be nice for him.</span> <span id="s121">And I have a son, who is also, he married a rabbi’s daughter here… the younger one---he wears a black hat, he wouldn’t go out without a suit jacket, so- …he has four children…he does a little writing, translating, for a yeshiva, but his main parnose comes from his wife.</span> <span id="s122">She is a music teacher.</span> <span id="s123">Organ and accordion.</span> <span id="s124">She’s Israeli.</span> <span id="s125">The rabbi’s daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">WH: …what kind of rabbi is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">RB: A rabbi of a small community…a small -(RB struggles to remember) I don’t know, my mind is kind of, doesn’t work so good.</span> <span id="s128">I have a little fever today.</span> <span id="s129">I don’t know, a little cold or something…</span></p> <p><span id="s130">EH: In America…did you feel that the American Jews that they were in anyway prejudice towards the people that came from Europe, who came from the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s131">That they looked down on them?</span> <span id="s132">That they thought that they were ‘greener?’</span></p> <p><span id="s133">RB: I never felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: Some of your friends-?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">RB: No, not my friends, but sometimes I overheard, we have some relatives who came after us, and they got together a lot of friends there, and each one was complaining about their uncle and aunt.</span> <span id="s136">You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WH: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">RB: So, and then I came in, and (inaudible) my husband’s nieces, they didn’t complain, they said, ‘Now I see why you don’t complain, because see, those are the ‘greener’.’</span> <span id="s139">Because he treated them like-but I don’t know, I didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s140">Depends.</span> <span id="s141">I don’t think you can be in general, you say that they were-.</span> <span id="s142">Some of them were nicer, they didn’t put their niece or nephew through college, like they did their own, and some of them expected it.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">WH: The nieces of your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">RB: Not our nieces, the friends who came to visit them, and they were talking about their American uncles and aunts, that they don’t-.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WH: That they don’t help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">But that doesn’t mean–maybe they expected too much…especially at that time, right after the war, it wasn’t such a-people weren’t as prosperous as they were 20 years later.</span> <span id="s148">They worked hard for their money.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">WH: In Cleveland, were most of your friends survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">RB: I had very few survivor.</span> <span id="s151">Most of them were Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">WH: When did you come here (to Israel)?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">RB: Fourteen years ago…we came in ’75 and he (my son) came in ’77.</span> <span id="s154">(my other son) is religious but he is not so-he walks around-no jacket, no hat or anything…</span></p> <p><span id="s155">WH: Did you feel anti-Semitism in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">RB: I personally didn’t feel it.</span> <span id="s157">I knew that there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">WH: Cleveland has a large Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">RB: I knew that there was anti-Semitism, but I didn’t feel it, I didn’t provoke it, and I didn’t look for differences.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">WH: And your children in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">RB: No…and they went to public school…I never saw, -if you looked for it, you find it.</span> <span id="s162">We didn’t look for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">WH: Did you think at any time of sending them to yeshiva high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">RB: No.</span> <span id="s165">I was glad with public school.</span> <span id="s166">I was happy with public school, they run very nice schools.</span> <span id="s167">My husband would have been happier with-(inaudible) but somehow it didn’t work out….</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: But you believe that there is a good deal of anti-Semitism in America.</span> <span id="s169">It didn’t happen to you, but you read about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">RB: Yes, but I don’t know, my husband never had it, we had customers, a lot of goyim.</span> <span id="s171">We’re in the wholesale egg business and cheese…the restaurant, he went out soon and then we were in the egg business, eggs, butter, cheese, and we had a lot of goishe customers and there were no problems.</span> <span id="s172">And goyim were working for us, and also Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">WH: You never had any problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">RB: We never did.</span> <span id="s175">But they said that there were, but we didn’t.</span> <span id="s176">We had some goishe neighbors and they were very friendly and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WH: What finally made you come to Israel in ’75?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">RB: First of all, we retired.</span> <span id="s179">My husband sold the business and there was no reason any more to be away from the family, and if there is a Jewish state, what our parents would never even dream about, I mean, dream yes, but they never thought that it would happen to them.</span> <span id="s180">So, why not live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: And you had a brother and sister there.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">RB: And every week a letter.</span> <span id="s183">And in fact, our children, maybe that’s why they felt so close with (inaudible) I read the letter at the table when we ate.</span> <span id="s184">I read the letters always about (inaudible) so they knew my heart, everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">WH: Had you visited Israel before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">RB: Yes, I came with the children…when they were little, in 1958 (without my husband) and then I came with my husband in ’70, and then once more…right after the Yom Kippur War…so we decided to get out of business, and we decided to look around to see where we want to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WH: Now, it’s changed a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s189">But there are a lot of nice people here.</span> <span id="s190">A lot of nice people.</span> <span id="s191">So we came, and we thought, ‘I don’t want to move again.</span> <span id="s192">I don’t want to go into an absorption center, or anywhere, I don’t want to move again.’</span> <span id="s193">That’s a very ugly business, to move’…so in ’75 we came and we moved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">WH: So, when you say that you got more than you bargained for, here-.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">RB: No, no!</span> <span id="s196">I don’t mean that in a positive way.</span> <span id="s197">I wanted to-like Young Israel type community.</span> <span id="s198">And it’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">WH: ‘ How does that present a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">RB: It doesn’t present a problem, because I found a lot of nice people among them, but, I would have felt much more comfortable-I have friends who are like me, and they live in other places, and they still live the same way as in Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">WH: You mean, like to go to a movie once in a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">RB: I could go to a movie if I wanted to…but I like it here, really, but it was an adjustment…and they treat me like one of them, and I made sheva bracha, sholom zuchort, or things like that, they all eat in our house, and that time I didn’t even cover my hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">WH: In other words, they respect you the way you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">But they knew I am frum, and especially my husband, he is one of the popular people here…(inaudible –Someone rings her doorbell during interview.</span> <span id="s206">She comes back and remarks on the caller.)</span> <span id="s207">Yesterday about twenty people came to the door.</span> <span id="s208">(inaudible-asking for charity).</span> <span id="s209">At least twenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">WH: You gave each of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">RB: We give half a shekel or a shekel.</span> <span id="s212">This time I give a shekel, a grown man came.</span> <span id="s213">(inaudible) Who knows what he is.</span> <span id="s214">But my husband says, (needs translation).</span> <span id="s215">You have to give them.</span> <span id="s216">It is written somewhere.</span> <span id="s217">(inaudible) It’s not a pleasant business.</span> <span id="s218">I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s219">Because, no matter, you have company, you are doing something important, they disturb you, but what can you do?</span> <span id="s220">You can’t say ‘no’ because you don’t know how badly it’s needed…(inaudible)…you can’t, no.</span> <span id="s221">If somebody comes, and I see he doesn’t look very-he looks like a liar or somebody, but I still give him, but I give him less.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">WH: Basically you came here to join your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">RB: My family, but you see…if I didn’t have anybody here, we most likely would have come anyway.</span> <span id="s224">Because if there is a Jewish state, why should we sit in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">WH: You didn’t come all those years before then.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">RB: We were in business, and what can we start here with something new?</span> <span id="s227">-and especially in business, if you had a trade that they needed here, you are a doctor and they need you, or you’re an engineer…but we had to raise the children, and we had a business.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">WH: Were you sorry that you didn’t raise your children in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">RB: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s230">I never thought of it…I wasn’t unhappy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s232">WH: …why is it that some people, who are survivors, decide to come to Israel, after living in America, and others decide not to?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">RB: It’s the nature of the person.</span> <span id="s234">I remember the first time we came here…we (inaudible)…didn’t have a telephone, about 6 months or so.</span> <span id="s235">.</span> <span id="s236">and that time it’s winter, and it’s raining, and I have to put on the boots, and go every night to call my sister, to Tel Aviv, or with my husband to go somewhere in the storms, and it wasn’t so smooth, there was no (inaudible-track?)</span> <span id="s237">here for quite a few years, and when we left, I said, ‘Can you picture this or this, that they want to go through that, to rough it up like that.’</span> <span id="s238">For us, it was,-okay.</span> <span id="s239">We didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s240">It was the privilege of living in Yerushalayim.</span> <span id="s241">And, so what…(one time) a woman (from America) she said, ‘After you read on the paper-‘ (inaudible)… somebody was killed or something…</span></p> <p><span id="s242">WH: You mean that someone from America said to you-.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">RB: ‘ Yes.</span> <span id="s244">‘After what happened in Israel, you still want to go?’</span> <span id="s245">Or somebody else said, ‘You want to give up all these things you have here, and go to Israel to live?’</span> <span id="s246">…I had a Cadillac…then my husband said that we don’t need a car in Yerushalayim.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">WH: How did you feel about giving up your house in Cleveland?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">RB: Oh, I was glad!</span> <span id="s249">Because I didn’t need…it’s not a headache, but it was more than I needed anymore.</span> <span id="s250">The boys were out, just the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">WH: Is the language a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">RB: I can get by…but for instance, the news I don’t understand…</span></p> <p><span id="s253">WH: Between the two of you, you felt more strongly about coming here?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">RB: I would say it’s even.</span> <span id="s255">And I would say that he has more feeling even than me.</span> <span id="s256">He’s so frum, and he’s so full of heart for everything here.</span> <span id="s257">He loves everything here.</span> <span id="s258">And he’s very tolerant.</span> <span id="s259">You know, you have to be tolerant to be able to live here.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">WH: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">RB: See, in America, the customers always right.</span> <span id="s262">Here, you can come in the store, ‘No-.’</span> <span id="s263">…You know, they (the store owners) didn’t come

id="s269">WH: Your children, they like the idea of moving to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">RB: In fact, my son was a few years in the States, because he went for some reason, and he insisted to come back.</span> <span id="s271">His wife would rather stay there, and he wanted to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">WH: Which son?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">RB: The older one.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">WH: So, you have two sons, both of which are Zionist?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s276">.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">WH: …did you

nice business.</span> <span id="s283">So to throw this away, and to come here and struggle, it was-we did much more for Israel than they needed, (inaudible) war or something, we went to the checkbook there, to the meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">WH: You always planned to come to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s286">There was no question about this…but I didn’t know when…(when we retired) to go to Florida, to Fort Lauderdale, it wouldn’t make much sense for people who feel like us…</span></p> <p><span id="s287">WH: …most American Jews don’t come here.</span> <span id="s288">Why?</span> <span id="s289">What’s the problem?</span> <span id="s290">Why can’t we get them to come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">RB: Because they want it easier.</span> <span id="s292">How about now the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">WH: They want-.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">RB: An easy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">WH: …and were

id="s298">RB: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s299">There was a time when I was growing up, that a lot of people belonged to B’nei Akivah.</span> <span id="s300">And one cousin came here…in the 30’s.</span> <span id="s301">And I had an older brother, and he didn’t survive, and he sometimes he was talking about someday we’ll be in Tel Aviv…(inaudible) we didn’t know that if it will come true or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">WH: What do you like most about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">RB: There are a lot of nice people, friendly people.</span> <span id="s304">Some of them are a little bit nosey, but most of the people I think, they are nice people.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t think everybody is nice anywhere.</span> <span id="s306">There’s a mixture everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">WH: So, what is it that you like about the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">RB: Well, most of them will say, ‘Nothing to like,’ because there are a lot of them that criticize the government, and-but, I really, just plain, I think it’s nicer here than other place, I mean, for a Jew.</span> <span id="s309">You can-there are all kinds of things to go, to cultural things, and there are shiurs everywhere, and we go to (?</span> <span id="s310">inaudible) Center there, you can find speakers there that I don’t think they would ever have speakers like that anywhere.</span> <span id="s311">And Rabbi Riskin.</span> <span id="s312">Or, Rabbi Wise.</span> <span id="s313">And there are others, too.</span> <span id="s314">And here, for instance, we had now on (inaudible and needs translation) speakers, in every neighborhood, they were talking against loshen h’ora.</span> <span id="s315">And they were such good speakers.</span> <span id="s316">(inaudible)…there’s a lot to offer here.</span> <span id="s317">And I would never have such friends like I have here.</span> <span id="s318">And, so friendly with so many rebbetzins here.</span> <span id="s319">They know that I’m like a b’nei akivah, but they are good friends.</span> <span id="s320">In Europe, and in America, when somebody, like for instance there were people who were a little more frum they were so snobbish.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">WH: They would look down on someone who wasn’t as religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">RB: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">WH: …and here you don’t find that to be the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">RB: I’m telling you, in the beginning, I didn’t even cover my head.</span> <span id="s325">If somebody comes here, I don’t cover it.</span> <span id="s326">But when I go out, I feel that it’s not such a big deal.</span> <span id="s327">I’ll put on a beret.</span> <span id="s328">And they all ate in my house.</span> <span id="s329">And that means a lit.</span> <span id="s330">It means that they are menshen.</span> <span id="s331">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">WH: Right.</span></p> <p><span

here?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">RB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">WH: No complaints.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">RB: Our younger son would never dream of going back</span></p> <p><span id="s339">WH: Do you think that another Holocaust would be possible in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">RB: No.</span> <span id="s341">I’m an optimist.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">WH: You certainly are.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">RB: There were certain times you know, a person feels low, but I hope not.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">WH: Then you don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">RB: See, there is a lot of bad in this-not only in the world, but (inaudible) even in people, good and bad, and I think that the good should win.</span> <span id="s346">But in America too, there are for instances, in the South, what’s going on with the Ku Klux Klan and all these-but I don’t think they have enough power.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">WH: …are there more survivors here that you know…?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">RB: …you see, I don’t look for somebody who is from here, or from there, or a survivor.</span> <span id="s349">I am communicating with people, I’m being friendly with people who I feel comfortable with.</span> <span id="s350">Who I like.</span> <span id="s351">It doesn’t matter if they are religious or non-religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">WH: In Cleveland the survivors had an organization of ‘New Americans’…</span></p> <p><span id="s353">RB: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s354">I remember at the beginning, there were meetings and I went sometimes to these, everybody paid a certain amount in, and I don’t know if this is the same group, to help people who are in need.</span> <span id="s355">And all these people, were survivors in the group.</span> <span id="s356">So I don’t know if this is what you are talking about.</span> <span id="s357">That’s a long time ago.</span> <span id="s358">It was 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s359">Or maybe longer,</span></p> <p><span id="s360">WH: What should we (Israel) do about the intifada&gt;</span></p> <p><span id="s361">RB: It’s very hard to say…send them back, away from here, there is enough land everywhere for them, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s362">It’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s363">That would be the best solution.</span> <span id="s364">But you can’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">WH: Which leader in Israel today do you think would do the best job?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">RB: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s367">Most of them I don’t care for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">WH: Do you vote here?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">RB: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">WH: Which party do you vote for?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">RB: I don’t remember…I think Likud.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">WH: You liked Begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">RB: (inaudible) it’s just a shame that the way he ended…(inaudible),</span></p> <p><span id="s374">WH: Do you think that we should give back the (inaudible -?</span> <span id="s375">Yehuda and Shalom Rah?)</span> <span id="s376">.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">RB: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s378">It would be terrible, it’s not only the land, but a lot of people, real, good people, then they had to protect the land, and they lived there, and they raising the children, if it would be like in (inaudible?</span> <span id="s379">Keyameet?)</span> <span id="s380">it would be horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">WH: You mean that if you had to pick up and leave like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">RB: Right…(inaudible-?</span> <span id="s383">Keyeameet?)</span> <span id="s384">was bad enough.</span> <span id="s385">But this would

your wife was, why it was that you felt so strongly that you made aliyah…in America, only 1% of all American Jews ever come to Eretz Yisrael, and half of them didn’t even stay.</span> <span id="s398">So I am always interested to know, what is the strength of commitment that a person has.</span> <span id="s399">Does it come from their parents?</span> <span id="s400">Does it come from what they learned in school?</span> <span id="s401">Where does it come from?</span> <span id="s402">Why are they different?</span> <span id="s403">Why are they the ones that come?’</span></p> <p><span id="s404">RB: In our families, we have cousins, like the cousins were raised…and most of our cousins never came even for a visit to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">WH: Why?</span> <span

children there and to come here?</span> <span id="s420">And then something else, he’s not well.</span> <span id="s421">And there, he gets better medical care.</span> <span id="s422">He couldn’t get that medical care here…he has two children there, and they wouldn’t come here.</span> <span id="s423">When you are raised in California, it is a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">WH:

id="s428">And she was-she (her sister) said, ‘You’re not going to leave me to (inaudible…)’ and there was no way of both of us-(Her voice raises as her husband reenters the room)…The one brother was

Yes, in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">WH: …Isn’t it true, that one advantage of you coming here in 1975, was that when you retired, you had your wholesale business, and everything, you have,
