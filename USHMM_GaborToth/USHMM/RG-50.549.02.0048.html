Okay, I’m interested in starting with you, this -- this date is a very significant date for you, can you tell me what this date is?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes, it is 57 years ago, when my parents and sister were murdered in the gas chamber of camp Sobibór.</span> <span id="s38">In the early -- In the early hours of the day, as I know, being there later, the whole procedure, how they -- how -- how it was handled.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Do you have a special way, every time that this day rolls around every year, of -- of recognizing that?</span> <span id="s40">Do you memorialize them in a particular way?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: No, not as -- not any specific way, although I -- I awake in the morning, on the 23rd, or rather on the 22nd, already, when I saw them the last time, and think of them.</span> <span id="s42">I know I think of them and of the events, daily, without wanting to even, it just come into my mind, and I am trying to analyze and study what actually happened, and why it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: You’re still trying to -- You’re still questioning on that level, is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: No, I don’t question any more, I think that I have my answers.</span> <span id="s45">I think I have my answers.</span> <span id="s46">I feel that the German nation was misled, and that there is not only -- there are two entities who are guilty of mass murder.</span> <span id="s47">We know of the executioners, it was Hitler’s political cronies, who went along with him, to eliminate the Jewish people wherever he could get them.</span> <span id="s48">But anti-Semitism was -- or racism, whatever you want to call it, goes back centuries, many centuries, and the original sin was committed by Christians, by the church, which actually propagated, I would say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by accusing the Jewish people of whatever was convenient for them.</span> <span id="s49">For instance, up to today, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, prevails within a large segment of people who do not know history.</span> <span id="s50">It is known, for instance, that the crucifixion was an act of erga -- Romans.</span> <span id="s51">It was their law by which they -- by which they sentenced people to death.</span> <span id="s52">The Jews stoned.</span> <span id="s53">And I want to tell you a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s54">I met, a year ago, a lady of the name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple books, I believe three books.</span> <span id="s55">She a foo -- survivor of Auschwitz, and after the war, because of her English lang -- English knowledge, she got a job in a little town someplace in Germany, to help displaced persons, from all over Europe, of different nationalities.</span> <span id="s56">And she became responsible for -- I believe, if I remember well, for 8,000 people, and got a very responsible, big job there.</span> <span id="s57">One day she got -- she was asked by a German doctor, whether she would come with him to inspect a ward of sick people in the hospital, which was also in that same s -- in that same area where she worked.</span> <span id="s58">And when they entered a ward, a woman attacked her verbally and physically in Polish, and told her, “You are Jewish, you should not be alive.</span> <span id="s59">You killed Christ.”</span> <span id="s60">With this one sentence, this Polish woman told the whole story.</span> <span id="s61">The curse on the Jewish people, which is a historical injustice, carrying on through centuries, which culminated this time in the Holocaust, but there were many events prior to that.</span> <span id="s62">You can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at individual abuses of führer, masters in Europe, in Russia, all over.</span> <span id="s63">Wherever Christianity was the main religion.</span> <span id="s64">And never was anything done on the side of the church, to dispel these wrong rumors, even up to today.</span> <span id="s65">Whatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough.</span> <span id="s66">I think the church owes us an apology.</span> <span id="s67">They should -- stop it, please -- they should admit, confess, and atone for what they have done.</span> <span id="s68">I think this is what they owe us, and it would also elevate the moral standing of the church, which up to today is only hiding and el -- and not coming out s -- directly of what happened.</span> <span id="s69">There’s another interesting thing which came into my mind.</span> <span id="s70">Protestantism was founded in Germany at least, by Martin Luther.</span> <span id="s71">Martin Luther originally protested against the abuses of the church, by being bought off for money, and ultimately was the founder of the Protestant movement in Germany.</span> <span id="s72">Although he was sensitive to what the abuses of the church, he took with him the anti-Semitism of the church, by putting his feces on the church, I believe, in Brittenburg, where he asked for the banishment of the Jews unless they became Christians, and of their -- of killing them, which is very interesting, and that only sh -- tells me how great and how deep the belief of the Jewish guilt was implanted in not only the population, but also among the intellectuals of the church itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s74">You’ve been living in a Christian country in the United States, for the last 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Do you feel that there’s a danger of something like what happened during World War Two, in Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: -- to the Jews again?</span> <span id="s79">Do you feel that anti-Semitism is --</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: I -- I do not believe that anything like that would be possible again, and I want to emphasize today, in my own mind, a tremendous change in government -- in government forming of -- of laws.</span> <span id="s81">Originally, if a government persecuted people, oppressed people, killed people, nobody interfered.</span> <span id="s82">At best -- There was an article in the paper, thanks to the courage of our President Clinton, and to NATO, that a change in this attitude finally came about, when we declared war on Milosevitch, who was oppressing his own people, and abusing the other minorities within Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s83">This is a historical event of tremendous impact for the future.</span> <span id="s84">And I think we should call this the Clinton Doctrine.</span> <span id="s85">I am -- I am highly impressed and very satisfied and happy that this happened, not because -- not because of myself, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: You think this is the -- the first time that something like this has happened on a governmental level?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: I don’t think, I know this is the first time, and never anything -- never anything like that happened.</span> <span id="s88">Even, you have a case here with Pinochet.</span> <span id="s89">There is still a dispute whether he is guilty or not guilty for killing people during the time when he was in power.</span> <span id="s90">Now they figured out that he is guilty now only from a certain date in England, when they reversed their thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Do you think that -- that Clinton’s and NATO’s actions in -- in Yugoslavia are -- do you think there’s a chance that they had anything to do with -- with Holocaust memory?</span> <span id="s92">Like if you’re thinking back on what happened during the Holocaust and what -- what America and the world did not do, there -- there -- perhaps there was pressure on the governments to actually take action now, in a way that they didn’t then.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen -- by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the Jewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines.</span> <span id="s94">But generally speaking, if -- if NATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn’t have done what they have done, the thing could have been again forgotten.</span> <span id="s95">As a matter of fact, from what I have been listening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever touched the church, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Talking about -- about faith, and -- and religion and -- and -- and the influence of religion on prejudice, can you -- can you tell me the role that that’s played in your life, and in -- in your own sense about --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that religions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population.</span> <span id="s98">Whatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and oppress others, this is a different story.</span> <span id="s99">Personally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish home, by birth, but we were not religious.</span> <span id="s100">We kept a kosher house, because of my father’s father, who was a widower.</span> <span id="s101">When he passed away, in his early 80’s, my sister and myself said, “Mom, let’s stop that kosher deal, we want to eat everything.”</span> <span id="s102">And that was the end of the kosher household.</span> <span id="s103">Personally, I believe that Moses himself was one of the greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving them to the people as a guide for morality, for life.</span> <span id="s104">And I also am convinced that Jesus, another Jew, was another very great man, great statesman, who spread the teachings of Judaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Judaism rather than sticking to the old ways of the Jewish religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: So do you see them more as politicians in a sense, than spiritual figures?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Oh, they were spiritual figures, but with a political result.</span> <span id="s107">And the spirituality is terrific, if you can believe in it, and important is that you should then do what they tell you to do, what they wrote down that God said, but not whatever pleases anybody to his own advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: You were just mentioning a moment ago, off tape, about yo-you -- before the war, as you said, you were an atheist.</span> <span id="s109">What did your experience in the camp, how did that influence your feelings about religion in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Ah the experience in camp only confirmed my conviction that there is no God, that it is people who make their life, for other people, either nice, or miserable.</span> <span id="s111">And anything else is just an individual need.</span> <span id="s112">Some people need to believe that they will go to heaven after they die.</span> <span id="s113">I believe that I will go -- after I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that will be the end of -- because I don’t believe in -- either in heaven, nor in a purgatory.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Let’s go back.</span> <span id="s115">I wanted to -- t-to bring us back to the beginning of your life.</span> <span id="s116">You -- You mentioned -- Why don’t you just tell me what your -- your name was at birth --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And tell me something about your original name.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: My original name was Ticho, T-i-c-h-o, which is an old family name, which goes back into the 13th century, in Boskovice.</span> <span id="s120">There were, according to the chronicle which I read, long before the war, but which I cannot locate now, and I tried to ask people to find it, there were originally, in 1492, that was the year when Columbus discovered America, three Jewish families living in Boskovice, under the castle.</span> <span id="s121">Their name was Horvald, Stefanski, and Ticho.</span> <span id="s122">The-There are very interesting things.</span> <span id="s123">One of the people who survived the war, was Mr. Ignatz Horvald, who was married to a Gentile woman, and he was, at that time, when the war broke out, he must have been in the late 60’s or early 70’s and somehow the Germans didn’t even intern him, at the end of the war, what they did to every other member of a mixed marriage.</span> <span id="s124">He survived, and he lived in the same section, which is mentioned in the chronic, under the castle.</span> <span id="s125">Now, at my time, there were my family Ticho, then there was a company of the name Brothers Ticho, which was owned by two brothers of a family of 13 children, two daughters and 11 sons.</span> <span id="s126">They were not related to us, we did not acknowledge any relationship between us.</span> <span id="s127">Then there was a third Ticho, Max Ticho senior.</span> <span id="s128">To distinguish it from my father, Max Ticho junior, who was the son of George Ticho, who also did not acknowledge any relationship to the other two Ticho families.</span> <span id="s129">During the occupation of Czechoslovakia, there came to Boskovice, another man of the name Ticho, a tailor who lived in Vienna, but originated in Boskovice, and then came to Boskovice, my father’s cousin, from a little town called Switofka, and these were all the Tichos, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s130">But I met in Vienna, another Ticho, his name was Franz Ticho, a tailor, who came f -- or his parents came from Marish-Ostra -- Morifska-Ostrava, to Vienna.</span> <span id="s131">That is all I can tell you about th-the Ticho roots in Boskovice.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Wa-Was your father born in Boskovice?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: My father was born in Boskovice, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Also, Joseph Ticho.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: So you -- you would be pretty certain then, that you are ru -- descended from the Tichos who were --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: I -- I am convinced of that, that my roots go back into that Ticho family, which was mentioned in that little chronic.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Have you been back to Boskovice?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Once, yes, after the Communists left -- were expelled f-from the government in Czechoslovakia, I went back.</span> <span id="s140">I was there.</span> <span id="s141">I went to the cemetery, I went to -- to see the city, I was with my high school chums, we had the dinner together -- rather, a lunch together.</span> <span id="s142">It was a nice meeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: High school chums meaning non-Jews, or -- or survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: They were non-Jews, yeah, there was -- there were no Jews left.</span> <span id="s145">As a matter of fact, some 443 people, if I am exactly to the -- to the exact number, were deported on March the 14th and 15th, 1942.</span> <span id="s146">Of those, seven came back alive.</span> <span id="s147">The Hanak family, with Mr. Horace Hanak, his wife Greta, and their daughter Vera, they survived in Theresienstadt, because he was maintaining the water works, or work -- or works -- worked on the maintenance of the waterworks in -- in Theresienstadt, and the Germans needed the water for themselves, is where three people.</span> <span id="s148">The fourth was a Mrs. Clara Stickelmacher, who had some kind of a job, and survived, was four.</span> <span id="s149">Eric Brill, who lived today in Frankfurt, who survived Dachau.</span> <span id="s150">Mitzi Brown, a sister of Mrs. Hanak, who survived Auschwitz and other camps.</span> <span id="s151">She is still alive in Bernau today in the capital of Moravia, and myself.</span> <span id="s152">And I would like to ask you to incorporate my original family name, so that it would be -- it would be part of my name, like Kurt Ticho Thomas.</span> <span id="s153">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: What was it like to -- we’re jumping around chronologically a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh, that’s alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: -- but we’ll go back and catch things, but while we’re on the subject, what was it like to return to Boskovice and meet all of these people who you had been friends with before the war, but who’d suf -- had not -- you know, you -- your pe -- your family had been wiped out, what di -- what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Well, to that point, I want to -- I want to bring out a very pleasant yet painful experience.</span> <span id="s158">I came to Boskovice with the -- with the Czech Legion, which I joined in Saragura, in Romania in 1944, in the fall of 1944, and I was home with my unit on May the 12th, 1945.</span> <span id="s159">The transport stopped on what they called the Walhoff hill, where the city started.</span> <span id="s160">And as we stopped with our trucks, I jumped off the truck, and out came from the first house, a woman.</span> <span id="s161">And she looked at me, and recognized me and said, “Where do you come from?”</span> <span id="s162">And I says, “I fell down from heaven.”</span> <span id="s163">And she crossed herselves and run back into the house.</span> <span id="s164">When we were f -- in Boskovice for a day or two, the commander of my unit, a Slovak mayor -- major -- major, not mayor, major, came to me and says, “Sargent Ticho, I know that this is your native town.</span> <span id="s165">If you want to stay here, you can be here as long as you want to, just join us, our point is Prague.”</span> <span id="s166">I says, “Mayor -- Major, I appreciate your offer, but I can’t stay here, because when I look around, in the windows where I knew all those people, they are gone.</span> <span id="s167">And I rather go with the unit to Prague.”</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: I think we need to back up.</span> <span id="s169">You -- Just to remind you of where the last interview ended, you had just talked about, in your video interview, after you had escaped from Sobibór, you found your way back to Piaski, you found your way back to the home of the farmer --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: -- who had been so kind to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: And they hid you again, and -- and you described that you were hiding in -- in a pigsty or a --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Yeah, I -- I was on the attic of a pigsty.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Tell me about that year, or however -- how many months was it that you spent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, I escaped from Sobibór on October the 14th, which was a Thursday, 1942.</span> <span id="s177">And I slept in the forest called Sobibór.</span> <span id="s178">Soba in Polish means an owl, and bor is a forest.</span> <span id="s179">Sobibór means actually the forest of the owls.</span> <span id="s180">I slept in the forest and the next morning -- no, the same evening yet, Chaim Engel approached me to go with them.</span> <span id="s181">When I say with them, with his girlfriend Selma, her name was Weinberg, from Holland.</span> <span id="s182">I figured where they are two, the third one with be superfluous, and I thanked them for the offer and I went my own way.</span> <span id="s183">W -- I -- I was sorry that my f -- girlfriend, also from -- from Holland, and it was Minnie Katz, did not come out, and I would like to tell you the story what happened before.</span> <span id="s184">A couple days before the uprising, I asked Minnie to get herself boots.</span> <span id="s185">And she says, “It’s still warm, what do I need boots for?”</span> <span id="s186">So I says, “It might get cold any time now, please get yourself boots.”</span> <span id="s187">And she went into the -- into the warehouse where the boots were located and got a pair of boots.</span> <span id="s188">I didn’t want to tell her about the uprising to upset her, because I figured, at the time, she will come back into camp one and we will get away together, but unfortunately she didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s189">So, that night --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Can I ask you a couple of questions about that before we go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: You -- You met -- Did you meet Minnie in camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: In camp, yes.</span> <span id="s194">Minnie came from Westerbork, from Holland, being discovered in hiding, and that’s how we met.</span> <span id="s195">She was a very well educated lady.</span> <span id="s196">She spoke Dutch, English, French and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And you were able to carry on a -- a courtship with her in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, after work, we had a f -- a couple hours, so we -- we -- we spent time together.</span> <span id="s199">But courtship, you cannot talk of any courtship, it was just th-the be-best we -- we -- we sat together, we talked to each other.</span> <span id="s200">When -- We rem-remembered things, and at one time, Minnie said to me, “Do you think that we will come alive out of here?”</span> <span id="s201">I says, “Minnie, my brain tells me no.</span> <span id="s202">My heart tells me yes.”</span> <span id="s203">She was of a very nice background.</span> <span id="s204">She told me that her parents sent their money from Holland to England, instead of going themselves.</span> <span id="s205">And I believe that none of their relatives survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: You lived in -- in camp one, in Sobibór, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Yeah, you see, the camp was divided into four parts.</span> <span id="s208">Originally three, later on four.</span> <span id="s209">Camp one was where the ramp was where the victims were brought in on -- by railroad or through the gate by truck or walking, whatever.</span> <span id="s210">And also, it was the living quarters of the Germans.</span> <span id="s211">Camp two was the sortier section, where you sorted clothing, and whatever.</span> <span id="s212">In camp one there were also all the trademens shops, like tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, goldsmith.</span> <span id="s213">People who worked on mechanical things, what-whatever.</span> <span id="s214">And in ca -- camp three, was actually the gas ca -- gas chamber and the cremation -- cremation, not chamber, i-it -- it was, as far as I na -- heard, done on roasts, on steel roast, where they burnt the people.</span> <span id="s215">And then later o -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: It was in 1943, probably in the early summer, when the Germans established another working s -- working spot, or whatever you want to call it, where mostly women were employed in cleaning ammunitions of the enemies -- of the, in our case, of the Russians.</span> <span id="s218">That was camp four.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s220">I want to ask you something about that, because you mentioned the -- the women cleaning ammunition --</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: -- in connection with the uprising --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: -- and -- and the plans for the uprising.</span> <span id="s225">And I’m interested in hearing more about how you knew about the plans for the uprising.</span> <span id="s226">Y-You --</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Well, one day, a fellow of the name Feldhandler, I forgot his first name now --</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Leon.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: -- came -- came to me -- do you -- what did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Leon.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Leon Feldhandler came to me and asked me whether I would be willing to cooperate in an uprising which is being organized.</span> <span id="s232">I says, “Leon, I am risking my life every day by cheating on the Germans in s -- in stealing medications and covering up for sick people.</span> <span id="s233">I will do anything what is necessary, but I would not like to go into any meetings.”</span> <span id="s234">Now, for the uprising, they also wanted the women to bring hand grenades, but they didn’t bring them the first day and they were afraid to bring them the second day, and so the definite date for the uprising was set for October the 14th, because a day or two later, Sharführer Wagner, the most brutal, and I would say the -- the -- the most intelligent one -- not by education, but by s -- by nature, by character, was coming back and we didn’t want him to be there.</span> <span id="s235">We wanted -- wan -- wim -- we wanted to do it before he came back.</span> <span id="s236">So that wa -- that was the day, Thursday, October the 14th, at four o’clock.</span> <span id="s237">It started before four o’clock already.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s239">I had been reading in -- in the book by Yithzak Arad, are you familiar with the -- the book on Sobibór --</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Belzec, Treblinka.</span> <span id="s242">Well, he mentions in this book that the -- that the uprising was postponed, that it was originally planned for October 13th, and it was postponed for the 14th.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: No, it -- it originally planned for the 12th.</span> <span id="s244">12th and 13th, and the 14th and we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: So I’m -- I’m interested in hearing more of the details of how -- how you knew what you knew.</span> <span id="s246">Did -- Did Feldhel-handler keep you abreast of what was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: -- even though you weren’t in the meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, I did not get any information from any more, but the news leaked through and I knew that we are preparing to get hold of the -- what they called wuffencummer, which is the chamber of weapons, which was a wooden building in -- in the what they called four lager, in the -- that part of part of camp number one, before you got into the -- that part where we slept and where the artisans had their shops.</span> <span id="s250">And once we get hold of the weapons, we will walk out like a armed unit, and that would have been the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: So it was your impression that the prisoners in general, knew about the uprising and that most people were aware of --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: I -- I would say that it leaked through.</span> <span id="s253">How many knew, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s254">For instance, Minnie Katz did not know, because otherwise she would have probably done something, and I didn’t tell her.</span> <span id="s255">I feel guilty about it, but I can’t change that any more.</span> <span id="s256">And there must have been -- there must have been some people of non-Polish, or non-Russian ethnicity, who probably did not know what was going on, because the -- the uprising was entirely in the hands of one Russian officer, and a group of Polish -- other Polish Jews, and they didn’t trust anybody else.</span> <span id="s257">They treated me as an exception.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Why do you think that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Because I proved through my behavior that I’m not a traitor, that I was helping anybody who needed help and I could do anything for him.</span> <span id="s260">By which I mean -- I believe it was in March -- end of March or beginning of April, 1942, when Dr. Subeese, Dr. Nink, and Dr. Breslev.</span> <span id="s261">Breslev was Polish, Nink and Subeese were Dutch physicians.</span> <span id="s262">Breslev was a specialist for dentistry, but he was still an MD.</span> <span id="s263">In Europe you had to become an MD and then specialize in dentistry.</span> <span id="s264">And th-these men came to me and told me they heard a rumor that the Germans will allow the Jews to be sick for three days.</span> <span id="s265">And they said, “Providing that would happen, we would like you to take on the job.”</span> <span id="s266">I says, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s267">It didn’t take long, and during the appelle, Chaffearal Fransel, I guess, who I testified in Hagen, two times and once in Frankfurt, I believe -- Frankfurt or col -- Cologne?</span> <span id="s268">I don’t know now, which one of the two cities -- told us that they are looking for somebody who will take care of the sick.</span> <span id="s269">And I raised my hand and he said, “What kind of a qualification do you have, or how -- how can you do that?”</span> <span id="s270">So I lied to him and I told him that I was a sanitary non-com officer, in the Czechoslovakian army, and I got the job.</span> <span id="s271">Now since I knew that Jewish people can be sick now for three days, as soon as somebody was not able to go to work -- prior to the point of course, if you couldn’t be able to -- if you were not able to go to work, they took you what they called in the -- into the Lazarette, and they shot you.</span> <span id="s272">Pardon me.</span> <span id="s273">So I wrote down, for instance, Arwin Donohue got sick on June the 22nd.</span> <span id="s274">So you -- w-we --were legally sick, allowed to be sick, 22 - 23 - 24.</span> <span id="s275">On the 25th and you still were sick, I threw that old card away and wrote a new one.</span> <span id="s276">And that’s h-how --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: How did you throw it away, did you have to burn it, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I didn’t -- That -- That was my own -- my own invention, my own set up, nobody told me.</span> <span id="s279">But it was good that I had it, because at each appelle, at noon time and in the evening, they counted us.</span> <span id="s280">And they knew, as an example, that they say are 480 inmates.</span> <span id="s281">Now, they counted and they’ve howd -- only 472.</span> <span id="s282">So the -- then they said, “Kurt, how many sick?”</span> <span id="s283">I said, “Eight.”</span> <span id="s284">In most cases, they accepted my number, but sometimes they went to the barracks and all the sick one had to come out, to double check, and that Fransel did it that way, and Wagner, he never let them come out, but I had to come with him to the door of the barracks and call the name, and the sick one had to answer, to make sure that there is no cheating.</span> <span id="s285">Now, through my function, actually, I’d had to save my life.</span> <span id="s286">There was a fellow of the name Leon Friedman, he cames from washa -- Warsaw.</span> <span id="s287">A ve-very nice young fellow, maybe 19 - 20 years old.</span> <span id="s288">He developed -- but I told you this story already.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Yeah, this is on the -- this is on the other tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: So why should -- why should I repeat it?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s292">I didn’t want to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s293">But, let me see.</span> <span id="s294">You did tell that story, you -- you, and we’re just kind of filling in on a few things that -- that I was interested in hearing more details about.</span> <span id="s295">And one was, so you -- you mentioned about the -- the women with --</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Who were supposed to be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: -- who were supposed to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Was that something that had just filtered out in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: I doubt it.</span> <span id="s301">That I doubt.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: How did you learn about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I found out about that when they postponed for the first time, the uprising -- the date of the uprising, why it was postponed.</span> <span id="s304">But I don’t remember who told me, that I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s306">I had read something -- the reason that I’m asking about that is I had read something that said that the date was postponed because there were a group -- an unexpected group of SS officers, from Osova, who came into the camp, and that was the reason why it was postponed.</span> <span id="s307">Do you think that could have anything to do with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: I ha -- I -- I remember something about that, but I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s309">I couldn’t give you any detail, I would only made up a s -- make up a story, I don’t want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: That’s fine, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s311">Okay, you talked about your escape.</span> <span id="s312">I had one more question about Minnie.</span> <span id="s313">How did the SS and the camp personnel respond to romances, relationships, inside the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: They were not, at the time -- First of all, it was not during working hours.</span> <span id="s315">After appelle, after we came back from work and we are counted once more.</span> <span id="s316">I don’t know whether we were counted after work, in the evening or not, I don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s317">But anyhow, we got our coffee, and 10 people got a loaf of bread and maybe some marmalade, whatever, out of beets.</span> <span id="s318">That was the end.</span> <span id="s319">There was no German with us any more, in -- on camp number one.</span> <span id="s320">And by nine o’clock we had to be in our barracks to go to sleep, and that -- that was the end.</span> <span id="s321">But say from seven til nine, although I was busy with working on people who had cuts, or bruises, whatever, you know, with bandages, and -- and so forth, dispensing aspirin, whatever.</span> <span id="s322">That was the time when we could associate among ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: So you -- you had a little bit of --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: A little bit of --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: -- freedom and leeway in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: -- yeah, yeah, in that.</span> <span id="s327">As a matter of fact, I would say today, in retrospect, that it was the German’s negligence that it -- that the u -- that the uprising happened at all.</span> <span id="s328">Th-They were so -- so content with that -- wi-with the run of the mill, that that was not -- not enough, I would say, diligence on their part, for which I am very happy, although they were still brutal in killing.</span> <span id="s329">But i-in other words, I would say they -- they missed something, th-they -- otherwise, it couldn’t have happened.</span> <span id="s330">I mean, it was very cleverly put together, how to -- how we got rid of the first of the -- all 11 of the SS men, you know.</span> <span id="s331">But somehow, there was something missing on the diligence, on the -- to find out what’s going on among the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Another question related to the uprising.</span> <span id="s333">You mentioned when Leon Feldhandler came to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: -- and asked you --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: -- if you would be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: And you said that you -- you were involved in being a medic and that that was enough of -- of a risk and you didn’t want to t-take that chance.</span> <span id="s340">How did he respond, did he accept that?</span> <span id="s341">Was he understanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: He accept it without any -- without any remark.</span> <span id="s343">When we -- we parted, we were ver -- on a very friendly basis, respecting each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s345">I had asked you early on -- you described in the first interview how -- how you escaped and how it happened that you and -- and Otto --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Came to return to -- to the farmer’s home.</span> <span id="s348">Can you tell me -- First of all, you mentioned that you and Otto parted ways.</span> <span id="s349">Did you -- Do you remember that moment of making the decision to -- to go on your own way, and f -- and to separate from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No, no, that is a misunderstanding.</span> <span id="s351">When we arrived, on Monday the 18th, on the -- on the outskirts of that little village, Selishkey, we set down in a ditch, because it was still daytime, and the -- the dusk was coming in.</span> <span id="s352">And I told him under the w -- on the way, under those -- during those four days, the whole set up with the farmer, his family life, and what I did there, and gave him a complete information.</span> <span id="s353">As a matter of fact, I gave him even some money on the way that if he would have chance to buy something, that he would have some money.</span> <span id="s354">I then, when it got dark, I simply decided, “You wait here, and I’m going to find Pocharlie’s house.”</span> <span id="s355">And as I walked maybe 20 - 30 steps, there is the barn of his estate.</span> <span id="s356">So I passed the barn, and there was the dog, Caesar on a chain, and he licked my hands when I came to him, he recognized me.</span> <span id="s357">And then I walked down to the house.</span> <span id="s358">Excuse me, I have to powder my nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: About --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Oh yeah, I stopped --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You mentioned you were -- you went and, Caesar, the dog [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes, I went into the yard, and opened the little gate of -- which was surrounding their thatched roof house, and looked into the kitchen through the kitchen door, where they were eating dinner, and on a -- with a petrol lamp.</span> <span id="s363">And a little while later -- it was pitch dark, it was a cloudy day -- cloudy -- cloudy night -- a little while later, the homeworker -- his name was Joseph, opened the door and went down the two or three steps to the gate and left, didn’t see me.</span> <span id="s364">And it dodn -- didn’t take long, and the farmer came out on the usual routine, to check the barn, whatever, and let the dog loose.</span> <span id="s365">And as soon as he opened the door, I whispered, “Koss padashu.”</span> <span id="s366">That means in Polish, farmer, but it’s -- it’s a title at the same time.</span> <span id="s367">And he recognized me immediately, and he says.</span> <span id="s368">“Where do you come from?”</span> <span id="s369">And I says, “I escaped from a camp and I came to save my life with you.”</span> <span id="s370">And he says, “Marno.”</span> <span id="s371">That means in vain.</span> <span id="s372">And then he says, “Come with me.”</span> <span id="s373">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: W-Why do you think he said that, in vain?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Because he probably wasn’t ready to -- to keep me.</span> <span id="s376">And then, as we walked toward the -- this stable, the horse stable and the cow stable, he said to me, “I owe you some money.”</span> <span id="s377">From that you can see what an honest person he was.</span> <span id="s378">I sold him a suit in which he took a picture with his wife.</span> <span id="s379">I have that pic -- I have that picture, and I says, “I don’t need any money, I have some money.”</span> <span id="s380">And then he says, “But allete samiastish.”</span> <span id="s381">That means, but you are alone, with an emphasis on the but.</span> <span id="s382">And I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s383">Because I figured out right away if I would have tell -- told him that we are two, that my chances would be even smaller.</span> <span id="s384">Today I know that I was thinking of Otto, but he was thinking of Emmie, my friend from Piaski, who once in awhile came out onto his farm in summer, and sunned herself on the lawn someplace, and then in the evening we went back together into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s385">And he wanted probably to know whether Emmie is with me.</span> <span id="s386">That -- That’s where the misunderstanding, and it came into my mind only much later.</span> <span id="s387">Anyhow, we came to that stable.</span> <span id="s388">He says to me, “You wait here,” and went out and locked it from the outside -- the door from the outside.</span> <span id="s389">I couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s390">After awhile he came back.</span> <span id="s391">Brought me a bottle of hot -- hot tea, or hot coffee, if you may -- want to call it coffee, it was chicory with milk.</span> <span id="s392">And the bread, which they baked every Monday, for the whole week, but they break fo -- they bake one loaf of sweet bread, and then I told you, I believe, in this story, too, which was a mixture of poppy seed and sugar beets and white mea -- white flour, while the rest of the bread was rye -- wy -- was rye bread, dark rye bread.</span> <span id="s393">So that he gave me, and he spread on the f -- on the floor, in the straw there, a little home-woven carpet and said, “I come to see you in the morning,” and locked the door from the outside, and that was it.</span> <span id="s394">I had no way to get back to Otto.</span> <span id="s395">Early in the morning, he took me -- he opened the door from the stable and took me across the ya -- across the yard in the barn and says, “Crawl up there someplace and hide.”</span> <span id="s396">Which I did.</span> <span id="s397">In the afternoon, when I was really rested, I came down, and later on, Mrs. Pocharlie came with another bottle of hot tea and two big slices of rye bread with lard.</span> <span id="s398">And that was the first food I had on that day.</span> <span id="s399">And she told me that at night, partisans came and wanted their bicycle.</span> <span id="s400">So I put one and one together and figured that I told Otto that Toidya, their daughter, Theodora, commutes on a bicycle from Selishky to Piaski, where he -- where she worked.</span> <span id="s401">And he must have been -- come into touch with them.</span> <span id="s402">That is my theory, but I believe it makes sense.</span> <span id="s403">When I came back after the war, I tried to find Otto, whether he came back into his native town of Chabeetch, in Moravia, but nobody knew of him, so he must have perished during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Do you think about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yeah, I think about him once in awhile, but I didn’t know him too much.</span> <span id="s406">He came into the camp, maybe only with the last transport from Bialystok, which must have been two or three weeks before the uprising.</span> <span id="s407">There came a few Czech people, he was one of them, a fellow of the name Shtasni was another one, and otherwise, I -- I don’t remember any more.</span> <span id="s408">But hi -- While he were -- While we were already in the forest, he just came to me, and he says, “I’ll go with you.”</span> <span id="s409">And that’s how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Tell me more about the time that you spent in hiding.</span> <span id="s411">How long were you in hiding in that pigsty?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: I was in hiding from Friday -- no, from Monday, October the 19th, until the very end of July.</span> <span id="s413">And I know it was the very end of July, because my late sister’s birthday was the 20 - 24th.</span> <span id="s414">I knew the date once in awhile, because my farmer threw up to me, a paper which he bought in Piaski, whenever he went to Piaski.</span> <span id="s415">And that gave me the date, and I knew when a Sunday was, because there was quiet on the -- on the yard.</span> <span id="s416">Th-The pe -- The f -- The farmers did not work on that day.</span> <span id="s417">So I knew on the 24th -- the 24th of July, I believe was a Saturday.</span> <span id="s418">I would like to check this out that I am right.</span> <span id="s419">And on that day, on that day, a tank went through the yard, which was the way into the fields, and also to the main road to Piaski.</span> <span id="s420">And I remember being in the straw there, I hear a noise coming closer and closer until everything was shaking.</span> <span id="s421">And I went through to the straw roof and looked through my little peephole, and there I saw a tank going through and leaving.</span> <span id="s422">That was the 24th of July, I believe, on m-my sister’s birthday.</span> <span id="s423">I would like to check whether it was really a Saturday.</span> <span id="s424">And then, a few days later -- then there was shooting, and whatever, which I dis -- already mentioned in my report originally -- in the interview.</span> <span id="s425">The --</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Actually, we don’t have anything in your interview on this -- on this time, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Yeah, you -- you [indecipherable] into details.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Then I will -- Then I will tell you what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: A few days before that tank already came, I could hear far away, artillery shooting, artillery cannon.</span> <span id="s432">Then later on, I could also hear machine guns.</span> <span id="s433">And then that -- one day that tank went through and a day later, I believe, I see a commotion in the yard from my vanta -- vantage point on the attic of the pig sty, from which I could see almost the whole length of the yard, not what was beyond me on the side where the barn was, where the barn started, but down there, yes.</span> <span id="s434">And there I see that my farmer, in a hurry, is putting the horses i-into the wagon and she was bringing out stuff of the ho -- from the house, to load it on the -- on the cart.</span> <span id="s435">And then suddenly I could hear bzzzz, like a whistle, and then an explosion, and that was a sharpnel.</span> <span id="s436">And the farmeress stood there with a mug in her hand, and when she heard that noise, she crossed herself and got really pale and was beside herself.</span> <span id="s437">And her husband -- and they were a nice couple, he came to her and he says, “Those,” -- I could hear it, “Those which you can hear, they are not dangerous.</span> <span id="s438">Those which you don’t hear, they can kill you.”</span> <span id="s439">By wi -- By which he mine -- m-meant that those which he hears, they are flying far away.</span> <span id="s440">And then they disappeared.</span> <span id="s441">Now, from Toidya I have later found out that they spent two days in the forest, hiding.</span> <span id="s442">And after they came back one morning, I can hear a noise, a commotion on the yard.</span> <span id="s443">No, before that, pardon me, I-I am -- I am going too far ahead.</span> <span id="s444">Then a group of Germans -- soldiers came into the yard and disappeared within three or four hours.</span> <span id="s445">As a matter of fact, there were U-Ukrainians among them, mostly Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s446">And one of them opened the door to the shack, from which you then could get up onto the roof of the -- of the pigsty, and was looking around there what’s going on, and I s -- I -- how do we say, crawled on my stomach to the edge.</span> <span id="s447">Luckily, he didn’t hear me, and when I saw him, it was a Ukrainian soldier, one of those who actually guarded us in the camp.</span> <span id="s448">I slowly, but without any -- causing any noise, retreated and -- back, so that he wouldn’t see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: You mean one of the actual s-soldiers?</span> <span id="s450">One of the same people?</span> <span id="s451">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: And I can tell you, I heard my -- my heart poin -- pounding in ma -- in my -- I remember that like today, that it was the lucky day, because that was the crucial time.</span> <span id="s454">Shortly after that, the Russians came.</span> <span id="s455">And he then left -- And then they left.</span> <span id="s456">Suddenly that -- the -- got a command and they left.</span> <span id="s457">They were retreating.</span> <span id="s458">Then one morning, I look out, and I can see a lot of commotion again in the yard, and there were carriages there, with one horse between two like wooden shafts, with little carts.</span> <span id="s459">And there were -- the soldiers were mostly women, big busted, short women.</span> <span id="s460">They were Russian women soldiers, who now were in the yard.</span> <span id="s461">And I think that they disappeared either the same day, or the next morning.</span> <span id="s462">And then my farmer came to me and says to me, “Don’t come down yet.</span> <span id="s463">Wa -- Let’s wait a couple days or so.”</span> <span id="s464">Which, I was a -- wh-which I agreed upon.</span> <span id="s465">And then when he told me, then I came down and left -- or when I -- when I came down, we star -- we stood at -- it was around noon time, we stood at the barn.</span> <span id="s466">And he says to me, “You know,” he knew that I wanted to fight the Germans, “there’s a Czech legion someplace.</span> <span id="s467">It is in pon -- Pordales Pordalsk.</span> <span id="s468">There you could join them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Stop here and flip the tape, change.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">End of Tape One Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Kurt Thomas.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Kurt Ticho Thomas.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Kurt Ticho Thomas.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: I’m trying to --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I think I stopped telling that I came down and we stood together at the barn.</span> <span id="s477">And Mr. Pocharlie told me that there is a Czech legion, with headquarters in Communist Poldalsk, which is, I think the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s478">And I thanked him for saving my life, and I was sorry that his wife wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s479">And I told him, “You raised yourself a son.”</span> <span id="s480">And I hugged him, and I left.</span> <span id="s481">He had -- Oh yeah, pardon me, he also told me, “Don’t go through the village,” which is characteristic of the situation as he knew it.</span> <span id="s482">And he said, “Because, if they would know that I saved a Jew, they would not -- they would now kill me.”</span> <span id="s483">And by that he meant his -- his villagers, which is another proof how deep the anti-Semitism was imbedded in the Polish population, generally.</span> <span id="s484">Although my -- my lifesaver was an exception.</span> <span id="s485">And I think these exceptions should be remembered someplace, so that the stigma of generalization would be punctured.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Was your lifesaver ever honored in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s488">Mr. and Mrs. Pocharlie were named as -- were -- were honored as Righteous Gentiles during a ceremony in -- I believe in Warsaw, on my -- on my re-request.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Are they i-in yadva -- by Yad Vashem?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: By Yad Vashem, yes, by Yad Vashem.</span> <span id="s491">As a matter of fact, I have seen the tree with their -- with -- with the little what is it, the little metal plate where their names are listed, and they are -- their name is also listed among the maybe 15 or 1800 Polish Righteous Gentiles who saved Jews.</span> <span id="s492">And by the way, I want to mention that there are more Jews saved by Poles than by any other nationality, at least in Yad Vashem, at the time I was there.</span> <span id="s493">There was not one, as far as I remember, mentioned from the Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s494">There might be some, but I haven’t seen them.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So do you think that it’s -- So often we’ll hear about the anti-Semitism of Polish people.</span> <span id="s496">You -- Do you think that that’s exaggerated?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: No, it is not exaggerated.</span> <span id="s498">It is actually and unfortunately a truth, a sad truth.</span> <span id="s499">But there were a few who were -- very few, who had character, who had compassion and courage.</span> <span id="s500">This is what ven -- was needed.</span> <span id="s501">You know, the Mrs. Pocharlie always addressed me Mister.</span> <span id="s502">These people treated me unbelievably respectfully.</span> <span id="s503">I did my best to work for them, but I think in that respect, they are an ec -- an exception to any other savior.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: How do you -- Di -- Have you tried to explain that to yourself?</span> <span id="s505">How it is that they came to be the way that they --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: They’re -- They’re -- They were just plain very, very nice [indecipherable] noble people.</span> <span id="s507">You know that he -- After I had to leave their farm because the Germans gave orders at the end of October, that no Jew can work out of the ghetto any more, and I -- when I came -- before I came back, she told me I should hide behind the farm, and when everything will quiet down, f -- I should b -- I come back out again and that we will kill a pig and eat pork and cabbage during the winter, then in spring the Mister will be able to work with us a-again.</span> <span id="s508">But, in spite of that, I went back to the ghetto, and while I was going back to the ghetto, there was a Polish peasant with a bicycle and he was intoxicated, he was drunk, and couldn’t use the bike, so he used it more as a support and he s -- yelled to me, he says, “Jakog dat yadesh,” Jewboy, where are you going?</span> <span id="s509">And I says, “I am going to the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s510">He says, “Don’t go into the ghetto, they’ll kill you.”</span> <span id="s511">That was his warning to me.</span> <span id="s512">While I was a few days in the ghetto, somebody told me that I should come to the fence, to the barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s513">And when I got there, I see my farmer with his horses alongside, and as ha -- as soon as he spotted me, he lifted a s -- burlap sack and threw it with a heave over the fence, and took his whip and he whipped the horses to get away.</span> <span id="s514">He gave me in that sack, I found a lard and potatoes.</span> <span id="s515">And if anybody would have seen him on the German side, I wouldn’t be here, and he wouldn’t -- and he wouldn’t have lived to the end of his days and died of a normal life.</span> <span id="s516">That’s how cor -- courageous and loyal he was to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Tell me about your contact with him after the war and -- and what became of -- of them, and of your contact with their daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: A-After the war, I didn’t have any contact at all.</span> <span id="s519">I left Czechoslovakia at the end of January of 1948, or -- or -- or middle of ’48, yeah, for England and sailed on the Queen Mary from Portsmouth, and arrived in the Uni-nited States on February the fourth, 1948.</span> <span id="s520">On the boat I wrote a card, or a letter, to the Pocharlies, and forgot all about it, until Toidya, with who I am still in touch, told me that she would like to find that piece of mail, but she never can find it.</span> <span id="s521">And then I started to correspond with -- with them in Polish and in Czech, and they answered in Polish and then later on, the Pocharlies gave up their farm and moved to Lublin to the daughter, and there they died.</span> <span id="s522">And then the son-in-law started to study English and from then on, we started to correspond in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Did the son-in-law study English so that he could communicate with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Was that his motivation?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: That’s what -- That’s what I understand that he did it, because of that.</span> <span id="s527">Maybe he had other -- Maybe he had other reasons, too, but to me he learned English, because he wanted to help his wife to stay in touch with me and make it easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: You mentioned that at first you were communic -- you were writing to them in Czech and they were writing to you in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: How did you communicate to each other verbally?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Polish, because I learned a little Polish while I was in Poland, and it’s a Slavic language, and I had a -- I think I have some talent for languages, so I caught on.</span> <span id="s532">As a matter of fact, while I worked on th -- first on the farm and then later on for him, at noon time, we took those things which we smuggled out of the ghetto of Piaski, to sell them in the village.</span> <span id="s533">So we went from house to house and we started to talk to the people and that’s how we learned a little more Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Going back to the issue of la -- or staying with the issue of language for a little while, you mentioned in your first interview that your -- your father was a German n -- speaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: And that you spoke -- you learned German in the home and you learned other languages as well, and it sounded as if Boskovice was -- had a lot of German speaking among the Jewish community there.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What -- Did you speak German in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yeah, we spa -- spoke German in the home and I will give you the historical reasons for this.</span> <span id="s540">Mora -- Czechoslovakia was originally part of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.</span> <span id="s541">And the Jewish people were very grateful to the -- to Franz Joseph, I believe, who came out in 1848, with some rights for the Jews.</span> <span id="s542">And one of the -- one of the strings attached were that the Jews have to go to Jewish school -- to German schools, to help Germanize the non-German speaking regions.</span> <span id="s543">Now, Boskovice was about 8,000 people, of which there were probably 350 - 400 Jews.</span> <span id="s544">There were more deported, because many came from other towns at the time of the deportation, to Boskovice.</span> <span id="s545">So we spoke at home -- my father had only Jewish -- German schooling.</span> <span id="s546">My mother had German and Hungarian schooling, because she came from Slovakia, which was under the jurisdiction of the Hungarians.</span> <span id="s547">And I considered myself a pure Czechoslovakian because my mother was Slovak and my father was Czech.</span> <span id="s548">I am the only Czechoslovakian who escaped and survived Sobibór.</span> <span id="s549">I don’t know how we came to this.</span> <span id="s550">Yeah, the -- the historical reason why we -- we spoke German, but in 1918, when Czechoslovakia was formed and I was four years old, there was still a German school.</span> <span id="s551">But in 1920, the German school was closed, and by the way, it was not attended only by Jewish children, z -- but also by some Gentile children, whose parents wanted them to learn German.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Did anyone in the Jewish -- Did you speak any Yiddish in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s554">We didn’t talk any Yiddish at all, we spoke only German, and I went to Czech schools and then later on, we spoke Czech at home.</span> <span id="s555">But originally, my mother language was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Was the Jewish community in Boskovice generally pretty assimilated?</span> <span id="s557">Did they not speak Yiddish or Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Nobody spoke Yiddish in the community, with the exception I know, that our cantor, Mr. Gross, he spoke with his wife, Yiddish.</span> <span id="s559">And I really don’t remember whether the rabbi spoke with his wife Hungarian.</span> <span id="s560">He came from Slovakia and he had Hungarian schooling.</span> <span id="s561">Or, whether he talked with her j -- Yiddish, I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s562">But the Boskovice Jewish population spoke only German, and had only German schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And did your father idealize Germany in any way, or was he germ -- did he -- you mentioned that he spoke German, did he also feel --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: He was politically an organized member of the Austrian German Social Democratic party.</span> <span id="s565">We had in our home, pictures of Victor Adler, who I think was the head of the Social Democratic party in -- in Vienna, and another one, Shoemayer was his name.</span> <span id="s566">I remember the names and these pictures were in our house and my father was a devoted German S-Social Democrat.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Was he very shocked by the developments in Germany after the rise of Nazism?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Well, he was not only shocked, disappointed and -- but what could he do, I mean, there were many more people who considered themselves Germans, or were in the sense of Hitler’s, real Germans, and still did not go along with national Socialism.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Did you -- Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: But they did not -- nobody ever thought that it will come to a organized extermination of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s571">Nobody ever thought of that.</span> <span id="s572">As even I, I found out only when I got to Sobibór, after a day or two, what’s happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: That must have been an incredible shock.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: It was, it was.</span> <span id="s575">As a matter of fact, for about two or three days, I didn’t want to talk German.</span> <span id="s576">And I don’t know -- I think I mentioned it in my a -- interview in Washington, D.C., after I was taken out from the ranks of those who arrived that day, around 3,000 we were, fr -- between the ghetto from Piaski and Izbitsa, they asked for textile experts and I raised my hand and I was taken out.</span> <span id="s577">And in the afternoon, I was already sorting the clothing of those who came with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Yeah, you did talk about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: But before I even start working, while we were getting soup, I see there a girl who was with my in Piaski and worked with me in Selishky, on that -- on the estate of that Polish nobleman who fled to England.</span> <span id="s580">His name was Bertha Collek.</span> <span id="s581">The same name as the long-standing -- long and well-known mayor of Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s582">That was Teddy Collek, and her name was Bertha Collek.</span> <span id="s583">And her father happened to be the mayor in a little village not far from Bernau, in Dumborshitz.</span> <span id="s584">And she came to me and I says, “Bertha, what’s going on here?”</span> <span id="s585">And she says, “Kurt, be happy that you are here.</span> <span id="s586">The other people will have it much worse than we here.”</span> <span id="s587">And with that she left with tears in her eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: How did you find -- I mean, realizing what was going on, that you were in a death camp and that -- that you were just being kept alive for economic reasons, how did you find the -- what gave you the will to -- to survive at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Well, you remember when, under Eisenhower’s government, when Kruschev was in Russia at that time, the political boss, we had a spy in the air in a -- in a drone plane like.</span> <span id="s590">I forgot his name now.</span> <span id="s591">That man was -- landed -- I think he was shot down and landed alive.</span> <span id="s592">He had with him cyanide pills, I believe, to finish his life, but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s593">And Kruschev at that -- that time said, “Shtoji ott, horchesi ott.”</span> <span id="s594">Whatever is alive, wants to be alive.</span> <span id="s595">And that was with me and with all those others in the camp, too.</span> <span id="s596">We hoped that it will not u -- be us.</span> <span id="s597">Gary Powers, I think was the name of that f -- of that pilot.</span> <span id="s598">You remember the -- the thing, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: No.</span> <span id="s600">Tell me about -- we were just talking about your father and your -- and his political orientation.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: And I -- I had -- it reminded me of a question that I had.</span> <span id="s603">You mentioned that at one point, he was arrested early on in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Oh yes, he was arrested and they wanted him to inform about the Gentile population.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Do you know what made them think that he knew anything about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Well, he had -- he was close with -- with a few Gentile people, and I believe that one of the Germans, local Germans, told the SS that my father might be the one who would be able to give them some information.</span> <span id="s607">The man I think who I have in mind was Estelberger.</span> <span id="s608">And that is a very, very characteristic story.</span> <span id="s609">Before 1918, there were actually two political entities in Boskovice.</span> <span id="s610">One was the Jewish community and the other one was the non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s611">We had our own mayor, and our own police department.</span> <span id="s612">And the policeman was this Mr. Estelberger, who was brought in from Austria to become the Jewish policeman in Boskovice.</span> <span id="s613">That guy became a good Nazi, and I believe that he gave the Gestapo the information about my father.</span> <span id="s614">He didn’t survive the war.</span> <span id="s615">I -- I think that he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s616">He had a daughter who had a son, his name was Alphonse Beçka, B-e-c-k-a, with a little hook on the c. Beçka means a barrel.</span> <span id="s617">Mr. Estelberger forced his daughter’s husband, his son-in-law, to become Germans, by which the grandson, Alphonse, became -- became liable to serve in the German army, and he lost his life, shortly after the war, in Russia.</span> <span id="s618">He paid for being a good German, Mr. -- Mr. Estelberger.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: So your father had a reputation for being very s --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: My father --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: -- socially integrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: -- We -- He had Ge-Gentile friends, customers.</span> <span id="s623">For instance, one o-o -- was the man who distributed cigarettes for the city and the vicinity and that does -- that was a position which you could get only when you were an invalid, a veteran after the first World War.</span> <span id="s624">And that was a Mr. Kosheneck.</span> <span id="s625">And -- And Julius Kosheneck had a reputation of being the most unfriendly person you can find, but he was very friendly with my dad.</span> <span id="s626">And o -- one day, I remember, during the war, he brought a piece of pork to my mother and ask her to prepare it for him with spices and pepper, you know.</span> <span id="s627">And he did it and he brought it back to him in his -- in his store, whatever.</span> <span id="s628">I didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s629">When I came back after the war, I went into this Mr. Kosheneck’s store.</span> <span id="s630">And I said hello and we talked a little bit.</span> <span id="s631">And then I says -- And then he offered me whether I would need leather for soles.</span> <span id="s632">I says, “Thanks, Mr. Kosheneck, I don’t need any.”</span> <span id="s633">And then he says, “I also could give you hen -- honey.”</span> <span id="s634">Because he was a beekeeper, that was his hobby.</span> <span id="s635">I says, “Thanks again,” and I want to say goodbye, he says, “Just a minute.”</span> <span id="s636">And he says, “Pull out the drawer from that desk.”</span> <span id="s637">I pulled out the drawer, there was nothing in it.</span> <span id="s638">He’s, “Now, put your hand into the opening, and to the left.”</span> <span id="s639">And there was another opening -- ano-nother drawer, another handle, I pull this out, and there were a few jewels which my father left with him.</span> <span id="s640">That’s how decent the man was.</span> <span id="s641">There were other people where I took stuff of ours, and either got back half, or nothing.</span> <span id="s642">But that was the unfriendly Mr. Kosheneck, you know?</span> <span id="s643">He had character and he was decent.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: I don’t think you actually mentioned in the first interview, what your father’s profession was.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: My father was an agent.</span> <span id="s646">He represented insurance companies.</span> <span id="s647">He also represented a s -- manufacturers who supplied -- who made linings for the local ready to wear industry, and buttons.</span> <span id="s648">That’s what he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: So you were following in his footsteps?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No, I was working with a friendly family, who manufactured clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Yeah, you did --</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: A fellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: -- you did talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: And I mentioned that when I saw the wedding picture and the picture of the three little girls, in Sobibór, I -- I’m sure I mentioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Now that I don’t think you mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: The wedding picture of -- of whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Of Ilsa Bruell, my boss’s daughter, oldest daughter and Ziegfried Lerfber, who he married during the war already.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s660">What was your boss’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Karl Bruell, B-r-u-e-l-l.</span> <span id="s662">If I didn’t mention this, then this is a big omission that is very interesting.</span> <span id="s663">One morning, when I went from camp one, into camp two, to pick up some drugs -- I was allowed to get cotton, iodine and salves.</span> <span id="s664">As I go -- walk through the lawn there, whatever tha -- it was, there I see a little pile of clothing.</span> <span id="s665">And as I got closer and to it, I see on top two pictures.</span> <span id="s666">One was the wedding picture of Ilsa Bruell and Ziegfried Lerfber, my friends.</span> <span id="s667">And the other picture was of Ilsa Bruell and her two younger sisters, Ruth and Lydia.</span> <span id="s668">And then there was that little -- pardon me -- that little pile of clothing.</span> <span id="s669">So I knew that they came at night, and they were shot right away, of course, and had to undress and they left it there.</span> <span id="s670">Now, when I came back to Boskovice, the father of the three girls, Karl Bruell, survived because his second marriage as to a Gentile woman.</span> <span id="s671">And I slept in his house and he asked me when he can expect his children.</span> <span id="s672">And I told him, “You have to be patient.”</span> <span id="s673">I couldn’t tell him what I know -- what I knew.</span> <span id="s674">He died in ’47, I think.</span> <span id="s675">Yeah, ’46 or ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Tell me more about th -- your parents.</span> <span id="s677">We -- We never got much of a sense of your relationship with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Oh [inaudible].</span> <span id="s679">Well, we had a very nice family life.</span> <span id="s680">My mother was the most loving mother I could imagine.</span> <span id="s681">They were tolerant people, liberal people, understanding people.</span> <span id="s682">I had a very nice relationship with my sister.</span> <span id="s683">It was a -- We were a very nice family.</span> <span id="s684">And we were five years apart.</span> <span id="s685">She was born 19 nine -- six years -- nine -- 1919, I was born 1914, five years apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: And her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Maryann.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: You -- There was something that -- that you had written in a letter to the Holocaust museum that you wanted to mention in your first interview, about your parents, and -- and one -- one story about your mother telling you something about crying, do you recall?</span> <span id="s689">She said -- I don’t want to -- I want to hear the story from you, but

thoughts.</span> <span id="s862">Did you -- Did you think of it after the war?</span> <span id="s863">Was it something that before the war you were thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Before the war I never thought this way.</span> <span id="s865">Bes -- Before the war I was liberal thinking, social thinking, [indecipherable] a person of social responsibilities.</span> <span id="s866">And I knew there was a friction between the Czech Catholic and the Czech Jew, historically, because we were talking German, and there was a certain -- a certain social envy also, because the Jewish people, in most instances, owned stores, or manufactured, and were more educated than the average non-Jew.</span> <span id="s867">An-And so I -- I could understand that, but I tried to overcome this also, by spoke -- speaking only Czech, of course.</span> <span id="s868">And Czech history was my history.</span> <span id="s869">I hated the Germans, because I was taught in school what they did

the war that made you --</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yeah, reading and hearing.</span> <span id="s873">For -- For instance, as of today, the Czech government didn’t return 90 percent of what was left after the Jews, only to those who either came back, or to their heirs.</span> <span id="s874">There are many, many properties, which nobody claims, because they were entirely wiped out.</span> <span id="s875">But they didn’t return anything.</span> <span id="s876">I have a friend here in town, whose father owned, with his three brothers, the largest ready-to-wear factory in Prostejov, he

people are more aware, more enlightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: The Czech people -- The Czech people should be led by the government, who would explain to them, “Listen, these were our people.</span> <span id="s900">Their properties were stole from them originally, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s901">Then they were nationalized or stolen by the Communists, and now we are free and we should have the decency to return it to those who are still alive, or to their heirs, as much as they are around.”</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Does your experience with Czech people, non-Jews, tell you that they are accepting of that and that their anti-Semitism is not such that they would not recognize their responsibility to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: No, I had no discussion with anybody.</span> <span id="s904">At the time when I was there, I didn’t have a discussion, because it was too early, the Communists just left, you know, and I hoped, in my naiveté that everything will be fine, but it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Well let’s go back to that time, immediately after the war when you’re -- you’re -- you joined the Czech legion --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: -- and you ended up in -- in Boskovice.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: And your goal -- Was your goal at the time, to fight the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Of -- No, that’s why I joined the army.</span> <span id="s911">Th-That was my goal, to -- to -- to -- to for -- fight Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Did you end up in combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: I was with a artillery unit, and they were never up front.</span> <span id="s914">Also, I didn’t feel -- I was -- I was sickly, actually.</span> <span id="s915">I -- I was -- from all those things which I had behind me, the camp and then the hiding, I was -- I was not myself.</span> <span id="s916">But luckily, I was with a unit which didn’t go into action, and not only that, at that time, the Russians did not use the Czech unit any more, because they wanted to come with some Czechs home, because there was another unit in England, and they didn’t want to come with a hundred people.</span> <span id="s917">And the English-Czech unit came back with a few thousand, you know.</span> <span id="s918">So th-that -- they -- they didn’t want to either.</span> <span id="s919">So, for that reason, we were somehow protected, toward the end of the ye -- of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: What was it like to see again, the townspeople who you had -- you know, you had been put into this ghetto and -- and herded off.</span> <span id="s921">Did -- Did anyone say -- Did anyone seem disappointed that you had survived?</span> <span id="s922">Was there that kind of experience, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I didn’t get your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: We were talking earlier about the anti-Semitism of the Poles --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: -- and how deep that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: When you returned to Czechoslovakia --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: -- did you find that these former neighbors, who you had been close with, were --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: In Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: In Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: I was disappointed, because there was one who was a very good Catholic, and he had all the silverware of my aunt, who perished in the camp.</span> <span id="s934">And she told me that he has it -- she has it with this fellow.</span> <span id="s935">I went to him -- Nowordny was his name, he said, “I didn’t even know your -- your aunt.”</span> <span id="s936">He denied everything.</span> <span id="s937">I mean, i-it was just -- it was a material greed.</span> <span id="s938">I didn’t get more than a half of my sister’s dowry back.</span> <span id="s939">Linens from a tailor, who also was a very well known Catholic.</span> <span id="s940">Kosheneck was also a Catholic.</span> <span id="s941">That was the guy who had the -- this -- diversion of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s942">He told me, and I didn’t even know -- pardon me -- that there was anything what my father left there, because he didn’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s943">So, I mean, there were two different types of people, that the great majority either didn’t care, or enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: But here we’re talking about a place where your family had been for centuries upon centuries --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: -- you have very deep roots there.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Did you feel like all of that was erased, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Not -- Not -- Not when I came back, but when -- while the Communists taking over.</span> <span id="s950">And then there was the process against the Jews, if you remember, they were sentenced to death, eight or 10 of them.</span> <span id="s951">Honorable Slansky, Rightsin, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s952">Then I lost entirely -- I lost entirely my -- my historical connection as a Czech, with the exception of the few people with who I am still in touch.</span> <span id="s953">But I disliked the -- the action, I -- I abhorred the action.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Do you still feel that that historical connection is gone?</span> <span id="s955">Is it gone forever?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: To a great extent, it is gone.</span> <span id="s957">To a great ec -- ec -- a-a-and I’m angry when I think of the people who can’t get anything back, who are there.</span> <span id="s958">I have a friend in California.</span> <span id="s959">She owned with her brother, a large apartment building in Bernau, in the capital of Czechoslovakia -- oh, Moravia.</span> <span id="s960">The brother unfortunately perished, she survived.</span> <span id="s961">And it’s her property today, because she inherited one half after her brother.</span> <span id="s962">She can’t even find a lawyer who would take over the case.</span> <span id="s963">Originally the lawyer told her that she has difficulties because she became an American citizen.</span> <span id="s964">Now, the -- later on, there was some reform in that respect.</span> <span id="s965">So she wrote to that lawyer, and she wouldn’t even talk on the case any more.</span> <span id="s966">It is really miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: How long did you stay in Boskovice with the Czech legion?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Two or three days, that’s all.</span> <span id="s969">And then I went to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: What did you do in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Well, then I was discharged, in fall I was discharged, and I went back to Boskovice, and stayed with this Hanark family, who came back.</span> <span id="s972">And then I got a job in what they called the Sudeten, where my father’s cousin represented a manufacturer, and this manufacturer happened to be married to a Jewish woman, and he was still in -- in Kernoff, and I went up there and got a job with them.</span> <span id="s973">And then they nominated me to become the trustee.</span> <span id="s974">And I resigned from the job after a short while, because I didn’t feel that it is right, that it should be th -- given to the man whose it was in the first place, and at the same time, there was some Jewish -- an-anti-Jewish grumblings, that the Jew became now the trustee.</span> <span id="s975">So I just quit.</span> <span id="s976">And then I -- I went to Prague, and from there I went to England and to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: So, originally, in -- in those -- that time immediately following the end of the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: -- did you have thoughts that you would stay in Czechoslovakia permanently?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: No.</span> <span id="s981">As soon as I got in touch with my relatives in America, my uncle and his sister, my aunt --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: I’m sorry, this picked up a --</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: Oh, that’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: -- noise.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s986">I -- When I got mail, they offered me an affidavit again, which we had already before the war, but the quota was exhausted, so I couldn’t -- you couldn’t use it.</span> <span id="s987">But then of course, I could feel that the Communists are taking over, which I hated.</span> <span id="s988">So I was eager to get out.</span> <span id="s989">I got out at the end of January to London, and arrived in the United States on February the fourth and within two or three weeks, there was the coup and the government -- the Communists took over the government in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: This is 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: No, this was -- yeah, 1948, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: And you went to England just en route to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: That -- It was no plans to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s997">Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: I stayed there with a man whose father and mother I met in Prague.</span> <span id="s999">They came originally from Lublin, Poland, where today Toidya lives.</span> <span id="s1000">And I stayed in his apartment in London, while he went home to sleep every night, to Blackpool.</span> <span id="s1001">He -- His family was in Blackpool, but he commuted.</span> <span id="s1002">But he had an office in London, and a room there where I slept for a few -- I would say a week in London, before I got to Portsmouth in -- on the Queen Mary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Let me ask you something about -- again about returning to Boskovice after the war.</span> <span id="s1004">Your -- You were -- You were the survivor of a very unusual experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: I mean, not only ha -- were you a survivor of a concentration camp, but you were a survivor of an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s1007">Did anyone ask you what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Oh yeah, yeah, people were listening and I had a need to talk.</span> <span id="s1009">I had a need to talk constantly.</span> <span id="s1010">But it was one ear in and the other ear out.</span> <span id="s1011">Didn’t make -- Didn’t make any -- any impression, any -- any lasting impression.</span> <span id="s1012">And today, I want to tell you honestly, so they do talk, what happened, and everybody comes to meetings, you know, but that’s all.</span> <span id="s1013">Nobody talks about the real reasons why it was possible to happen.</span> <span id="s1014">Go back into history.</span> <span id="s1015">And I intend to translate this, and then I will have an opportunity to talk about the camp and the life, I will bring this up, too.</span> <span id="s1016">Then, if you want to, I will send you a good translation of the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Okay, yeah.</span> <span id="s1018">I’m sure the archives would be interested.</span> <span id="s1019">Did you have the feeling that people believed you when you talked about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1021">They believed me, but they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1022">As a matter of -- I -- I have a very funny experience.</span> <span id="s1023">I was at one time in Naples, Florida, and there my wife’s two cousins were very friendly with some non-Jewish people, and we had a meeting, and he wanted me to tell them what I went through.</span> <span id="s1024">And next to us stood a group of Jewish women.</span> <span id="s1025">As soon as they heard my story, they left.</span> <span id="s1026">They didn’t want to hear it either.</span> <span id="s1027">That doesn’t mean that others would, but that group, they didn’t want to hear it, it was probably too emotional for them.</span> <span id="s1028">Please excuse me [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Okay, sure.</span> <span id="s1030">-- block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: When I left the farm, after hugging my -- my gospardash Pocharlie, I went past the barn and into the field, and there I was approached by a Russian soldier, with a automatic carbine and he asked me who I am and I tried to tell him in Czech and he finally let me go.</span> <span id="s1032">And I went through the fields in a big circle, and came to Piaski, where I have seen the city half destroyed.</span> <span id="s1033">Horses on the street blown up, dead of course.</span> <span id="s1034">And then I joined a huge crowd of people which were walking, and I walked with them, I don’t know where I went.</span> <span id="s1035">I know only that from the time I left Selishky, and arriving ultimately in Saragura in Romania, it took about six weeks.</span> <span id="s1036">When I first found Communist Poldalsk, in the Ukraine, and there the railroad station was destroyed, the city didn’t exist, actually, and somebody told me that -- I don’t know who, that they moved, the Czech unit moved to Saragura in Romania.</span> <span id="s1037">Now I had to go to Romania.</span> <span id="s1038">At one time I got caught by Russian -- by Russian soldiers and put together with German prisoners of war, into a train.</span> <span id="s1039">At another time they kept me with Germans prisoners of wars in a barn.</span> <span id="s1040">I remembered one night I slept in a little farm i-in -- in the stable with the cows.</span> <span id="s1041">But I cannot tell you how I got either to Communist Poldalsk, nor to Saragura.</span> <span id="s1042">As soon as I was in Saragura, I somehow changed my whole mentality.</span> <span id="s1043">I must have been absolutely depressed.</span> <span id="s1044">And when they took my clothing -- I had a pair of pants and boots -- shoes, and wouldn’t give it back to me, I started to raise hell, because they were ma-making money on the clothing.</span> <span id="s1045">And I forced them and I h -- I had a fight with them, and I -- the first day, I got it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: When you escaped from Sobibór, were you wearing a uniform of some sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, I had beautiful black boots.</span> <span id="s1048">You see, in the camp, you could have gotten any clothing you want to, the Germans didn’t care, because in the end they will get it anyways.</span> <span id="s1049">And there were warehouses, or sections in a warehouse, where there were boots for men and children’s shoes, and men’s pants and men’s coats, whatever.</span> <span id="s1050">And my new winter coat was in another building, where they -- where we -- the sorters, were f -- were instructed to deposit it there f-for their own benefit, because they then took it to Germany, so -- with so many other things.</span> <span id="s1051">So, I had a pair of britches, beautiful black boots, which the Russians took away from me and gave me another pair of bad boots.</span> <span id="s1052">And then they took those away from me, another Russian, and gave me regular shoes, with laces.</span> <span id="s1053">So I cut off the front and put the money which I had had, into the lining of the shoe, because I figured these shoes, nobody will take and I will keep the money.</span> <span id="s1054">But that’s what I wanted to tell you about the fact that I’d s -- could not recall my being lost for those -- about five, or s -- maybe six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: What changed once you got to Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: H-How did -- How did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Or -- Or -- Or Saragura --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Once I got to Saragura, I was again -- I wasn’t myself, but I could again think right, at least, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Why do you think that is, why the sudden change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: I -- I -- I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1063">That was a -- That was definitely -- There was definitely something what happened to my mind, because o-on the farm with Pocharlie, I had at least the haven there, a certain degree of security.</span> <span id="s1064">But here, I was under -- among strangers, I didn't know the language, nothing.</span> <span id="s1065">Yet, I made it.</span> <span id="s1066">And this is what I’m writing him, this Mr. Ribol, the director of the museum, because he wants to know all the details from my youth on, and what happened during the war and where I was and -- and I tell him that, it’s an absolute blank, I don’t know, couldn’t answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Is he going to use that information in the museum in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: I hope, I hope.</span> <span id="s1069">But I tell you what happened, why I say I hope.</span> <span id="s1070">A few years ago, I wrote an answer to a historical book written by a fellow of the name Professor Bronsky, about the Jews of Boskovice, and there were quite a few misstatements and anti-Semitic hints, and I wrote a letter, happened to be 14 pages again, and I succeeded through my Gentile friends in Boskovice -- the local paper wouldn’t print it, because I told them what I know about the Gentile people in Boskovice, how they behaved, almost like gen -- Germans.</span> <span id="s1071">A -- My professor of Latin’s son joined the German army, and then he got -- then he disappeared -- it was one of them, but I had quite a few cases, where I told him what he didn’t know, or what he didn’t want to publicize, and the paper wouldn’t publicize this.</span> <span id="s1072">So then my friends arranged for having it in the museum, to visitors of the museum, and I sent them one issue, covered in plastic.</span> <span id="s1073">Now, I found out later on again, through this Stanick, that the thing disappeared.</span> <span id="s1074">Allegedly for historical reasons, they are studying it.</span> <span id="s1075">And in the letter to Ribol, I’m writing now, also, “I hope that it came back, and tell me why they took it away in the first place.”</span> <span id="s1076">I never got an answer from him yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: I want to talk about your journey to the U.S., but actually first, I want to go back to one more thing that you mentioned --</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: -- off tape.</span> <span id="s1080">You didn’t mention -- there was something that you didn’t mention during the interview that you wrote in a letter afterwards, an-and I thought you might want to add it to this tape, and that’s -- it was a recollection of your father, from the time that you were, I believe, working on a farm and bringing home a lot of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: -- food in Piaski.</span> <span id="s1083">And he said something about how he would rather --</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Oh yeah, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1085">No, that was not in Piaski yet, it was in Boskovice.</span> <span id="s1086">When I had a job with this Mr. Stanick, the son, and that -- the father of Joseph Stanick, which you are mentioning in the letter there.</span> <span id="s1087">The tailors were home tailors, they took the stuff home to sew it and bring it back to us, and I got him merchandise, I got him business from Vienna, and from Stuttgart in Germany, because I knew perfect German, how to write and I wrote to the Chambers of Commerce, and these people didn’t have labor, but they had some materials, so we are fini -- we were finishing it for them, and the tailors from the little villages around, which did the work for us, they were very grateful to me, and were bringing me illegally food, like butter, eggs, chicken, whatever.</span> <span id="s1088">And I sent them to my mother, to the house directly, and she paid them for it, and then gave other people who needed it.</span> <span id="s1089">And my father at that time said that I would rather eat dry bread and drink plain water in freedom, than have plenty of here to eat.</span> <span id="s1090">That’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: And how did you respond to that at the time, what did that mean to you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Oh yeah, I think I mentioned that too.</span> <span id="s1093">It didn’t come into my mind the deep meaning of it, until I was in the concentration camp, or in Piaski, in the ghetto, you know, how much ahead he was of thinking, and how already thought that I know everything.</span> <span id="s1094">I was about 28 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s1095">Yeah, I remember that.</span> <span id="s1096">But I forgot all about it, you brought it back now into my mind.</span> <span id="s1097">And -- And that I did -- I said, I think I said it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: So you -- What did it -- Can you say more about what that meant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: What it meant to me, that freedom is priceless, period.</span> <span id="s1100">And for freedom you have to fight, and you have to be watchful it shouldn’t be taking away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: And this is why I love so much this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Tell me more about that.</span> <span id="s1104">Tell me more about arriving in this country, your expectations and -- and what’s it -- it’s meant to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: I -- When I arrived in New York, at the pier, my uncle was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1106">He was an employee of the Shanley Hotel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a very -- the finest hotel in town, he was a maître’d’.</span> <span id="s1107">And he came to New York to pick me up, but the crossing was 48 hours late, th-the first time ever for the Queen Mary, because of very bad weather.</span> <span id="s1108">And he couldn’t wait any longer, because the FBI took me to Ellis Island, because of that dumb doctor in Prague.</span> <span id="s1109">When he examined me before the government would give me a visa, they had to confe -- somebody had to confirm to them that I am well.</span> <span id="s1110">So he asked me, “Were you ever seriously sick?”</span> <span id="s1111">And I says, “Yes, at the age of 15, I had pleurisy,” with an [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1112">And he wrote -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Tape three, side B, of an interview with Kurt Ticho Thomas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: And he asked me then, after he examined me, whether one can hear anything by listening.</span> <span id="s1115">I says, “Doctor, you just took my x-rays and listened to me, you should know whether there’s anything or not.”</span> <span id="s1116">And he wrote a thing down that I had pleurisy at the age of 15, and when I arrived in the pier -- at the pier in New York, the FBI took three people from the boat -- four people.</span> <span id="s1117">Two, I believe, either Russians or Ukrainians, one woman who was Jewish, but allegedly was coming into the country on a proxy marriage, which something was not right, and I.</span> <span id="s1118">These three people went into the -- on Ellis Island, into the political section.</span> <span id="s1119">I went into the Merchant Marine section, for an additional examination.</span> <span id="s1120">And two days later, one man came to me, I was playing chess with a German sailor, and he told me that I can get dressed and get out, and the German sailor translated it to me in English.</span> <span id="s1121">And when I came then to the -- to the window, leaving Ellis Island, there was a fellow waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1122">His name was Kaufman from the -- from a Jewish organization, from the -- I forgot now the name, and he took me -- w-we went on the ferry from Ellis Island to long -- to -- to Manhattan.</span> <span id="s1123">And there we went to a restaurant and I had a sandwich with cheese and ham, and some milk.</span> <span id="s1124">And he ordered sandwich, and then I asked him how much I should tip, and how much I should tip in the check room, and all that.</span> <span id="s1125">And he brought me to the Pennsylvania gr-gr-grandel -- the Pennsylvania railroad station, the Grand Central Station.</span> <span id="s1126">And there I took a Pennsylvania train to Pittsburgh, where I arrived around one o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s1127">And in the meantime I called -- pardon me -- I called from Ellis Island yet, and he actually put the call through and I sat down and before I could sit down, it rang already.</span> <span id="s1128">I was amazed, because I got the call immediately.</span> <span id="s1129">In Czechoslovakia, when I was calling somebody 20 miles away, it took a half an hour before I could be connected.</span> <span id="s1130">So that was the first pleasant surprise, h-how communications work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Let’s back up a bit.</span> <span id="s1132">Can you remember where you are if I interrupt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1135">I wanted to ask you a little bit more about your trip.</span> <span id="s1136">How long did it take to get o -- to get across the ocean on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: The ocean?</span> <span id="s1138">Two ye -- Two days longer, 48 longer -- I believe five days, instead of three, or six instead of four.</span> <span id="s1139">I don’t -- that I don’t know any more.</span> <span id="s1140">That was the old Queen Mary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: Do you remember what your thoughts were on that trip, what your expectations were of this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: I was -- I was -- I was happy that I was -- that I was going to America.</span> <span id="s1143">I slept together with another fellow, down in the lowest quarters, on a berth above him.</span> <span id="s1144">And he was born in this country, but fortly before the war, his mother came back to Slovakia, his father was still here.</span> <span id="s1145">And then he came back again as an American citizen, but he didn’t speak a word English.</span> <span id="s1146">So I says, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s1147">He told me in Slovak, of course.</span> <span id="s1148">He says, “Connecticut,” and the city, he forgo -- I forgot now the city.</span> <span id="s1149">He pronounced it, the -- the -- the phonetic way, as it is written, you know, that was so funny, today.</span> <span id="s1150">At that time, I didn’t know better, either.</span> <span id="s1151">I forgot the name of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: What languages did you speak at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Czech and German, and a little Polish.</span> <span id="s1154">And a little -- I learned a little Jewish in the camp, too, from the Polish Jews, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: No English at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: No.</span> <span id="s1157">Oh, I -- very little, I mean, I tried to learn English, but this was all forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: But you were excited to be coming to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1160">So then, when I arrived, they were waiting for me, my aunt, my uncle and my cousin, they had the DeSoto car, and they took me home in the -- into their house, and it was a nice little house, in the campus of the Carnegie -- the Carnegie Technical Institute.</span> <span id="s1161">And I was going to med -- I was going to English elementary school with little kids, for about six or eight weeks.</span> <span id="s1162">And then I went to high school, Taylor Alderdise High School in Pittsburgh, and then during the summer, I took summer course, again in the al -- Taylor Alderdise High School, and because my uncle didn’t want me to go to work until I get a little bit settled, and he was so good to me, like a father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Leo Steiner.</span> <span id="s1165">That’s -- There’s his picture.</span> <span id="s1166">That’s the man.</span> <span id="s1167">And then he -- I got a job through my cousin’s wife’s father, who had a store with pants, and through the salesman of the company for who he was buying, I got the job as a cutter, in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1168">I had to get up at five in the morning, to be, by 6:30 or so, in the railroad station, Pennsylvania, Lake Erie railroad, to get to Beaver Falls before eight o’clock, to get into the plant.</span> <span id="s1169">And then, in the evening I rushed home, and twice a week I went to the University of Pittsburgh, to get English history and English.</span> <span id="s1170">And there were two veterans, GIs who copied my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: I’m not kidding you.</span> <span id="s1173">And when I came back home from school, I was so tired that I barely ate my dinner, and lied down, and the next morning, again to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1174">At the end of the year, before Christmas, they gave me a box of candy and told me I shouldn’t come any more, because they are closing up the plant, which I was so happy that I didn’t have to go back to that work any more.</span> <span id="s1175">Then I had other jobs, in a -- in a grocery store, in a umbrella shop and again in a pants factory.</span> <span id="s1176">I mean, that one I was packing rather than cutting.</span> <span id="s1177">No, I was working in the cutting room, too.</span> <span id="s1178">And also in -- in the -- in the room where we put orders together.</span> <span id="s1179">And from there I went on the road with ready to wear, through the help of a Miss Bertha Strouth -- Strouse was her name.</span> <span id="s1180">Sh -- H -- She was a buyer in a -- one of the department stores in Pittsburgh, and through friends who I made in Pittsburgh, their name was Albert and Laura Davis, they wanted to help me out of my menial jobs, and through them I got acquainted with her.</span> <span id="s1181">She acquainted me with a salesman who didn’t want to travel in Ohio.</span> <span id="s1182">He wanted to travel only in and around Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1183">So I took his line on, and that’s how I met my wife, because she owned with her brother a little ready to wear store, ladies ready to wear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Her name was Tina Zacks, Z-a-c-k-s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: And -- And when was this that you met her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: I met her in 1953.</span> <span id="s1188">In 1952 I started to travel, in 1953 I met her, in 1954 we got married and I moved to Columbus, and then my ankle -- uncle and my aunt moved also to Columbus.</span> <span id="s1189">That was his sister, they were brother and sister.</span> <span id="s1190">She was a widow, and he was a bachelor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: They must have -- So, did they come for -- because you were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1193">They came here because I was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Tell me more about your relationship with them in the early days.</span> <span id="s1195">Were they -- Did you talk to them about what your experiences had been during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Well, we were always a very closely knit family, my mother and her four siblings.</span> <span id="s1197">One brother came here already before the first World War, but I never saw him because he died before I arrived.</span> <span id="s1198">And then Uncle Leo, who took over.</span> <span id="s1199">His sister, with two children from Vienna, when Hitler came in there.</span> <span id="s1200">And -- And then I had the two cousins here, and another cousin who lived close to Pittsburgh, and they tried to make my life very nice.</span> <span id="s1201">I have a very nice relationship, they were very kind to me.</span> <span id="s1202">And I finally Americanized, you know, and became, I hope, a good citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Did you talk to them about what did happen to you during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1205">As a matter of fact, when I wrote my first letter to the United States, when the mails started to function in ’49 -- 1946, I wrote to Uncle Leo and Aunt Ilinor, my life in the camp, and he used this during one of the meetings of some organization in the Shandley Hotel at that time, I remember -- I was told later on, when I came here, of what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Did they encourage you to -- to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: I don’t think that they did have to, because I n -- I needed to.</span> <span id="s1208">Today I don’t.</span> <span id="s1209">Today I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: That’s interes -- Oh, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Today I am not hundred percent, but I would say maybe 90 percent of what I used to be, before all this happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: It’s interesting to hear you say that you had the need to talk immediately after, and not so much now, because I’ve heard other people say, “Back then I wasn’t ready to talk about it yet, and people didn’t want to listen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Oh some of them didn’t want to listen and some people told me I should already stop, you know.</span> <span id="s1214">They me -- They meant it well.</span> <span id="s1215">Th-That was my imbalance.</span> <span id="s1216">There was a mental imbalance, definitely.</span> <span id="s1217">I said yesterday, I -- accidentally, to my sister-in-law, the wife of my wife’s brother.</span> <span id="s1218">My wife’s brother was her husband, he passed away.</span> <span id="s1219">I says, “Florence, you know, when I got into your family, I wasn’t right.”</span> <span id="s1220">She says, “I know that, Kurt.</span> <span id="s1221">We know -- We knew that.”</span> <span id="s1222">But they -- they accepted me too, and treated me just like I would be theirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: In what way -- when you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: In any way.</span> <span id="s1225">Any way.</span> <span id="s1226">I had to -- the same right and the same obligations, like anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: But in what way, when you say I was not right, what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: I -- I was not my old Kurt.</span> <span id="s1229">I was very much influenced with my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: You were thinking a lot about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Not that I was thinking, but I ch -- i-i-it influenced my thinking.</span> <span id="s1232">I was -- As I told you before, when I finally hit the SS man in the jaw, after that point, even in my unconscience, I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Tell that story on tape, because I -- I think you didn’t tell that on tape, about your -- your dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: No, that was when -- in -- in this country already, I was dreaming -- I had a nightmare, always the same nightmare, that Sharführer Wagner is -- was chasing me, and I always escaped someplace in the straw.</span> <span id="s1235">Jumped someplace and lie in the straw, and he couldn’t find me any more.</span> <span id="s1236">Until one night, I’m dreaming again the same thing.</span> <span id="s1237">Suddenly I stopped running, and made a fist and hit him in his jaw.</span> <span id="s1238">And from then on, I never had the nightmare any more, and I improved definitely, in my mental attitude, toward the public -- toward the non-Jewish public, because at the time when I came, I suspected in the first place anybody again, who is non-Jewish, might be -- want to harm -- wanted to harm me, or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s1239">Thi-This is something, but it’s not easy to understand, and it is not easy for me to explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: How long did it take for you -- How long were you having those dreams before you turned around and socked him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: That I -- That I don’t remember, but it was quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1242">It could have been a couple of years, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1243">But I do not know, I really can’t -- this is just a guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: And then -- And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: As a -- As a matter of fact, I was so intimidated also, that I didn’t talk English in the public, when I was in a bus with somebody, I wouldn’t open my mouth.</span> <span id="s1246">It took me two years, before I started to talk English in a bus, or in a restaurant, you know?</span> <span id="s1247">I was -- Because I felt that I’m foreigner, I have an accent -- today it doesn’t bother me, I know I have an accent, but I don’t give a hoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: What language did you speak with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: We spoke English, only English.</span> <span id="s1250">When I arrived, and we got to bed at night, and the next morning, when I came into the kitchen, and my aunt was giving me breakfast and she started to talk to me German.</span> <span id="s1251">I said, “Auntie, please, don’t talk to me German, only English, whether I understand or not.</span> <span id="s1252">I don’t want to talk German, I want to learn English.”</span> <span id="s1253">And we never spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: That’s very impressive.</span> <span id="s1255">What were your -- What were your ideas and expectations about America?</span> <span id="s1256">What was your idea of what America was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: You know, the expectation of America were very much different what the reality was.</span> <span id="s1258">I thought that everybody is rich, and that nobody works.</span> <span id="s1259">And I found out that the majority of the people are not rich, the great majority, and even the rich one work.</span> <span id="s1260">I also thought -- I -- I -- I was not aware of the fact of the national coherence of ethnic groups.</span> <span id="s1261">I thought that they are separated, but as far as the nation concerns, America, if he’s Polish or Italian, you say something against the country, and I’m sure that they would -- they would not like it.</span> <span id="s1262">Th-That was another very pleasant experience for me.</span> <span id="s1263">And the equality, that everybody is protected by the law, and has the same obligation, like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1264">And the idea of a Lincoln, to build a nation by -- by mixing, by respect and cooperation and understanding for everybody, this all I didn’t -- I have no -- I had no idea who Lincoln was.</span> <span id="s1265">It was en -- It was entirely -- I was tra -- a transplanted tree, from one orchard, into another orchard, in another climate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: But then you started to study about American history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yeah, I was interested, I want -- wanted to know what was going on and what -- what’s going on now, and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: You mentioned that in -- in the early days you -- you felt suspicious, and -- and insecure about non-Jews, and not -- not sure whether you were safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: I didn’t know -- I didn’t know how to take it.</span> <span id="s1270">I didn’t know how to take it, because nobody made any remarks.</span> <span id="s1271">As a matter of fact, I got -- I arrived here in 1948.</span> <span id="s1272">When I got married in 1954, we took a honeymoon to Canada, and there, for the first time, I heard an anti-Jewish remark.</span> <span id="s1273">In Canada, not here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: What was the remark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: I don’t know any more what it was.</span> <span id="s1276">We were in a store and somebody made some nasty remark about Jews.</span> <span id="s1277">In Canada.</span> <span id="s1278">I don’t know any more which city it was, but I re -- that I remember dis-distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: And by then had your feelings changed, about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Oh yeah, no, I was -- I was already Americanized.</span> <span id="s1281">I was already a American citizen.</span> <span id="s1282">No, I was not citizen yet.</span> <span id="s1283">Yeah, I was citizen, yeah, because otherwise I couldn’t have gone to -- to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Tell me about becoming a citizen, when did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: That happened, I believe, in 1953.</span> <span id="s1286">The huge gathering by a judge, and a clerk of the court, in a big building in Pittsburgh, downtown.</span> <span id="s1287">I don’t know whether it was the courthouse, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1288">And there were for -- I was prepared, I was studying for it, and then they gave us a few questions, and if you answered, you became a citizen, and if you didn’t answer, you get a citizen too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Was it a very important occasion for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Definitely, but I want to tell you, once I got into this country, I got a little green card, for identification.</span> <span id="s1291">Not once, until I became a citizen, was anybody ever asking me about my identity.</span> <span id="s1292">No policemen, nobody.</span> <span id="s1293">It was just a entirely different life.</span> <span id="s1294">In my old country, if you went to visit somebody for more than 48 hours, you had to report it to the police.</span> <span id="s1295">That’s what they call a police state.</span> <span id="s1296">When my late grandmother came to visit with us, she had to go to the police and tell them, “I came from Warscarvas, I’ll be staying with my brother -- with my son-in-law and my daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Ticho,” such an address.</span> <span id="s1297">And the day before she was leaving, she had to tell him she is leaving, where she is going again.</span> <span id="s1298">And that was a democratic state at the time, already.</span> <span id="s1299">All Czechoslovakia was a democratic state.</span> <span id="s1300">The only one in central Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Did you have friends or acquaintances that you got to know who were non-Jewish at the time, or were you mainly moving in -- in the circle of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Where, here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: I did not have any non-Jewish acquaintances, with the exception that when I traveled, I had to, of course, approach any buyer, whether he was Chinese or Protestant, or Jewish, whatever.</span> <span id="s1305">But these were nice business friendships.</span> <span id="s1306">As a matter of fact, I am still in touch with the former buyer of the May Company, Betty Flaherty, and one happened to be a Jewish fellow, Buddy Fagersner, who was also in a Cleveland store.</span> <span id="s1307">But I was very friendly with -- with my buyers and they had great confidence in me.</span> <span id="s1308">And when my wife died, I remember one of the ladies made some preserve, then gave it to me, you know, I shouldn’t -- I should have some home cooking, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: How did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: I was selling these dresses, trying to sell the dresses, when I came into the store called Taft’s, in Columbus, Ohio.</span> <span id="s1311">And she wasn’t there at the time, her sister-in-law was there, and she asked me, “How does your wife like it when you are travel from col -- from Pittsburgh to Ohio, and you are at home only over a weekend?”</span> <span id="s1312">I says, “I’m single.”</span> <span id="s1313">So then they introduced me to the single girl in the family, and that’s how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Was that important to you, to -- to marry a Jewish woman?</span> <span id="s1317">Was your Jewish identity very important to you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Oh, i-i-it -- it was, yes.</span> <span id="s1319">It -- It -- It -- It was, although it didn’t matter to me whether she was ir-irrelig-religious, or religious, but somehow there was a cultural background, a cultural need.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: And you were living in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: I don -- I -- I didn’t know any Gentile women anyways.</span> <span id="s1322">So, I mean, I don’t know whether -- if I would have l -- fell in love with a Gentile woman, maybe I would marry her too, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Did you talk to your wife about what had -- what your experiences had been during the war, and what had become of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Oh yeah, yeah, the whole family wanted to know, they were very interested in what -- what’s going on, and they were very -- they are very active in Jewish causes, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Did you feel that they were capable of -- of really understanding what you had been through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Oh yes, oh definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s1327">For instance, my nephew -- my wife’s nephew -- former wife’s nephew, is today president of the Jewish congregation in Columbus.</span> <span id="s1328">He’s very active in Jewish activities, and also a very ardent Republican, who is very friendly with -- for instance, President Bush.</span> <span id="s1329">And his mother is a outstanding -- absolutely outstanding -- I would call her a genius.</span> <span id="s1330">Not only in Jewish causes, but sh-she’s an inventor, and she very g -- very generous, help people.</span> <span id="s1331">Not only Jews, non-Jews -- non-Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1332">I remember sh-she helped a woman to become an opera singer, for years supporting her, a non-Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1333">And when she was finally an opera singer and gave a performance in Cincinnati, we went down there to see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: I would have to ask Florence, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: You mentioned coming to the United States, and having some awareness of -- of some of the ideals of this country, and you came in the early 50’s.</span> <span id="s1337">It wasn’t long after that, that -- that there were a lot of civil rights issues going on.</span> <span id="s1338">Was that something you were particularly aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: I want to tell you, for instance, there was this Korean War.</span> <span id="s1340">I didn’t understand it too much.</span> <span id="s1341">I was a cutter and I was tired, and I read the paper, but I didn’t -- I was not in -- not into the global politics yet at all.</span> <span id="s1342">That came at -- That’s why I say, I changed.</span> <span id="s1343">I developed again into what I used to be.</span> <span id="s1344">It was a long process.</span> <span id="s1345">On -- Only it -- it -- and only it came along because of the environment in which I lived, and it was protect -- it was protective and understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Do you feel like you’re back to a hundred percent now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: No.</span> <span id="s1348">I would say it’s about maybe 90.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: You m -- also mentioned -- and this is something that I saw written down somewhere, but you didn’t tell the -- tell the story in your interview, something about your involvement with the trial of one of the SS members --</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: -- in Sobibór, Frenzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Can you tell me about your involvement in that trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: I tell you how it happened originally.</span> <span id="s1355">A fellow with who I worked in the camp, together in a little -- a little building, his name was Friedberg, Alfred Friedberg from Frankfurt, Germany.</span> <span id="s1356">He was a -- His hobby was painting.</span> <span id="s1357">And we worked together in this little place, on little items, sorting them out and deliver them to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1358">And I found [indecipherable] money.</span> <span id="s1359">And one day one of the Ukrainians, which have close by kept the horses, came into our place, and picked up a fountain pen and a pencil, whatever, and I had the money there prepared, and he picked up the money too, German marks.</span> <span id="s1360">And the next day he came and brought us a liter of vodka and a kilo of Polish kielbasa.</span> <span id="s1361">And that went on all the time I -- we worked in this -- in this little place.</span> <span id="s1362">Every second day we got a kilo and a liter.</span> <span id="s1363">The liter we gave away, we didn’t drank it.</span> <span id="s1364">Gave it to some other goy -- boys.</span> <span id="s1365">But the salami kept us alive, until that stopped, the job there stopped.</span> <span id="s1366">There was no-nothing met to sort, and I went back into the sorting department and then I became sick.</span> <span id="s1367">Got the flu or the typhoid fever, I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s1368">But that I mentioned in the -- in my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: -- memories there.</span> <span id="s1371">And then I became the sanitator, the man who was taking care of the sick people.</span> <span id="s1372">And what did you ask me originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: I was asking about your involvement with the trials, the post-war trials of Fre-Frenzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1375">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1376">This Friedberg got the job to make the labels for the SS when they were going back to Germany, the address labels on their lugga-luggage.</span> <span id="s1377">And he had any name but of the commander of the camp and of Sharführer fr -- Wagner.</span> <span id="s1378">Wagner was too shrewd to give it to anybody.</span> <span id="s1379">And at one time he told me, “You know, Frenzel lives in the -- close to Berlin, and he gave me the n -- city’s name, which contained the word lerver, lion in German, and I think berg or borg.</span> <span id="s1380">I don’t know how it happened, after the war I wrote a letter to some German office, mentioning that we had Sharführer Frenzel, who was very brutal, and he lived in this city, which has the word lerver and berg or borg.</span> <span id="s1381">And I didn’t pay any attention to the whole thing, I didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s1382">When I was in Frankfurt, I believe, at the trial, it was the last trial, there was a public persa -- persecutor, his name was Pfeiffer, very nice young man, and he called me aside and he says to me, “You know, because of your tip, we went to -- we went, looked at the map, found the town next to Berlin, found Mr. Frenzel working as a carpenter, which he was originally, on a stage in a theater.</span> <span id="s1383">And that’s how we got him.”</span> <span id="s1384">And then I testified against him, I was called as a witness.</span> <span id="s1385">The first time in 1966, and then later again, and then he was sentenced to life and then he got out on some kind of a legal point, I don’t know what, and I had to go to testify again, and then he got again arrested, and ended in jail.</span> <span id="s1386">He is not alive any more, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1387">He was a year or two older than I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Let’s pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: This is tape number four, side A, of an interview with Kurt Ticho Thomas.</span> <span id="s1391">We’re -- We’re resuming on the following day, it’s now June the 24th, 1999.</span> <span id="s1392">And so do you want to start by telling me -- you had a couple of things that you remembered, that you wanted to add.</span> <span id="s1393">I’ll hold --</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: The first thing what I want to mention is that when I was translating the letter to the director of the museum in Boskovice, that the word which I was missing, which actually is the deed, when the church was selling what it’s called indagencies, to those who sinned, and were buying off their -- their sinning.</span> <span id="s1395">That’s number one, number two, when I was translating that same letter, I omitted, I believe one sentence, which I definitely want to repeat, namely, when I say that Christianity is a noble religion, which will be here for eternity.</span> <span id="s1396">And now, if you allow me, I would like to start to read two letters from Theodora Toidya Cobaletska, that’s her -- that’s her married name, the daughter of the farmer, which she wrote me on my inquiries in the 90’s, what happened during my stay there, which I could not know, because I couldn’t get out, and after I left.</span> <span id="s1397">All right then.</span> <span id="s1398">Here is the first letter from Toidya, dating into September 19, 1993.</span> <span id="s1399">“Dear Kurt, in reference to your letters of March 15 and August third, 1993, I am conveying to you information regarding my parents and my family.</span> <span id="s1400">My mother Anna Pocharlie, nee Lipa, was born April 15, n -- 1890, in Wallagarja Nitzca, near Pableshk Piaski lubareska, while my father, Stanislav Pocharlie, son of Michael and Maryanna, was born on April 21st, n -- 1890, in Sialishky, near Piaski lubareska.</span> <span id="s1401">Together they will work as farmers on their farm in Sialishky.</span> <span id="s1402">Through their own daily work, they managed to acquire a larger farm, and until Hitler’s German invasion of Poland, in September 1900 and 39, they were leading farmers in the village.</span> <span id="s1403">After that, my father worked simultaneously in the Casa Shef-Shef-Shefsheek Savings Bank in Piaski.</span> <span id="s1404">The invaders ran a wasteful, exploi-exploitative regime and the for -- the for -- their forced deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside.</span> <span id="s1405">The invaders ran a wasteful and exploit-ploitative regime and the forced deli-deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside.</span> <span id="s1406">Not fulfilling the quotas was cruelly punished by the German administration, with arrests, and with sending people to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1407">The period of the German occupation was a brutal time, a time of violence and terror.</span> <span id="s1408">There was a lack of food, and the basic food articles were distributed by means of ration cards.</span> <span id="s1409">I remember that Mama used to prepare a syrup from sugar beets, and we sweetened our black coffee with it.</span> <span id="s1410">There were times when there wasn’t even flour for bread, which Mama baked herself.</span> <span id="s1411">Our basic diet was milk and potatoes.</span> <span id="s1412">Thanks to the resourcefulness of my father, there was never any real hunger.</span> <span id="s1413">I remember the day when you came to us at night.</span> <span id="s1414">My father warned Mother not to give you any food that was too fatty or excessively rich during the first few days of your stay with us.</span> <span id="s1415">After the camp food, it might have caused serious health consequences for your stomach and your whole digestive system.</span> <span id="s1416">At that time it was not easy to get medicines and curing you would have been made significantly more difficult under the conditions of your concealment.</span> <span id="s1417">I want to mention that my parents were afraid f -- of the neighbors, who were numerous around our farmyard.</span> <span id="s1418">A woman by the name of Fran-Franechka, who was very nosy, was specially dangerous.</span> <span id="s1419">She loved to look after -- around everywhere, in the outbuildings, and tell the whole village what was going on around there.</span> <span id="s1420">For that reason also, we had to maintain the greatest possible vigilance of all costs.</span> <span id="s1421">After that, there was a young girl in our house, by the make of Kriska, who was with us as a helper in the housekeeping.</span> <span id="s1422">Her mother asked my father whether she could work for him so that she could be registered in our community.</span> <span id="s1423">Wer -- This registration saved her from being carried off to forced labor with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1424">I remember also a conversation of my father with his brother, who likewise lived in Sialishky, who told father that a neighbor had told him that there was someone hiding in our outbuildings, because one night you could hear coughing.</span> <span id="s1425">This information from his brother made my father very uneasy and he told you about this occurrence, indicating that he would have to change your place of hiding.</span> <span id="s1426">Father,” -- pardon me, he didn’t tell me about that, but he said that I should not cough, but he didn’t tell me why.</span> <span id="s1427">I -- I had no -- I had no idea about the reason.</span> <span id="s1428">“Father and Mother were considering how to do this in order to create safe conditions for your further stay in hiding.</span> <span id="s1429">With that goal in mind, both of them went to Mama’s brother, who was living in the village of Wallagardianitska, about six kilometers from Sialishky, in order to discuss with him the matter of transporting you to that locality and of concealing you at his farm, but that event turned out differently.</span> <span id="s1430">It happened that my mother’s brother was being sought by the Germans and had to hide himself as well.</span> <span id="s1431">In that situation, Dad and Mama decided that you would remain further at the place in Sialishky, whatever the consequences.</span> <span id="s1432">In regard to Kriska, you -- who had seen you in the barn, Dad explained to her, if I remember correctly, that you were one of the partisans, who was hiding there.</span> <span id="s1433">It goes without saying that it was impossible to let her know who you were, and in the interest of the safety of all of us.</span> <span id="s1434">Apparently, she must have believed Dad’s explanation, because, as it turned out, the matter never came to public attention.</span> <span id="s1435">Further -- Fortunately, as you know, we endured those hard times and lived to see the liberation.</span> <span id="s1436">For us, the day of liberation, which came in our area in the second half of July, 1944,” -- it was rather at the very end of July -- “was a special day.</span> <span id="s1437">It was possible for you to leave your hiding place, and you were able to return to a normal life.</span> <span id="s1438">We were overcome with great joy.</span> <span id="s1439">That which had seemed an impossible thing, had become a reality.</span> <span id="s1440">Our faith and confidence, in the help of God, and also our prayers had been answered.</span> <span id="s1441">After your departure from Sialishky, at the end of July, 1944, we continued to be uneasy about whether you had made it in s -- in safe and sound to your home in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1442">Your letter, sent from the ship Queen Elizabeth,”-- but it should be Queen Mary -- “saying that you were alive and on your way to United States was an enormous comfort to us, and finally permitted our hearts to be at ease.</span> <span id="s1443">We were able to think about you -- your new life, with a feeling of relief, and to wish that it would be a happy one.</span> <span id="s1444">Our country was free from under Hitler’s occupation and we thought that the peaceful life would now en-ensue.</span> <span id="s1445">In the meantime, from the very beginning, there were starting to be arrests, death sentences and deportations to prison camps deep in the Soviet Union, from which many Poles never again returned to their country.</span> <span id="s1446">They a -- They arrested members of the National Army, and those who did not accept the new political order.</span> <span id="s1447">A difficult period for the Polish society had begun.</span> <span id="s1448">Many innocent people died during the consolidation of the people’s government.</span> <span id="s1449">The truth about these times of violence and repression has just recently begun to come to light, little by little.</span> <span id="s1450">In September ‘44, my father was arrested on the charge of possession of weapons and of concealing partisans.</span> <span id="s1451">In our home, a rigorous inspection was carried out by functionaries of the Bureau of Security.</span> <span id="s1452">Mama and I were terrified and beside ourselves at the thought of what would become to us in the future.</span> <span id="s1453">At a certain time, Mama and I left our home and possessions.</span> <span id="s1454">Our neighbors took care of the entire farm during our absence.</span> <span id="s1455">Such a situation could not continue, however, and our return to Sialishky was necessary, without regard to the consequences.</span> <span id="s1456">That was a very difficult time for us.</span> <span id="s1457">The Bureau of Security, after many interrogations, was not able to prove the charges they had brought against my father, that his possessions of arm, and concerning partisans.</span> <span id="s1458">Father did not return home until December fi -- ’44.</span> <span id="s1459">However, there was not any further peace.</span> <span id="s1460">Difficult times began to wealthy farmers, so-called kulaks, by the people’s government.</span> <span id="s1461">My father was likewise accounted as one of these kulaks.</span> <span id="s1462">Extremely high tax charges and mandatory deliveries of agricultural produ-produce, and livestock, were imposed by the office of the community, aimed at liquidating the so-called kulak farms.</span> <span id="s1463">If the farmers did not comply with the community prohibitions, they were e -- threatened with serious penal consequences.</span> <span id="s1464">With hard labor, my parents endured even this hostile rate of taxation, of the people’s government, or wealthy farmers.</span> <span id="s1465">They worked on their farm until advanced old age.</span> <span id="s1466">My parents did not want to leave Sialishky, here they had their family, neighbors, their home and their free life.</span> <span id="s1467">On the other hand, being with us in Lublin, they were condemned, as it were, to idleness, to a lack of -- to a lack of neighbors with whom they had lived together, or a -- great part of their lives, and to lack of all of that which surrounded them in the village.</span> <span id="s1468">Simply put, they never im-imagined a life in town for themselves, and I am not surprised, because the link with their environment, which accompanied them almost throughout their lives, was so strong that it could not be broken.</span> <span id="s1469">My father, right after Mom’s death, when we wanted to bring them to Lublin, put off his arrival for month, two months, and not until December, did he decide to come to our home in Lublin.</span> <span id="s1470">While he was with us, he was extremely homesick for Sialishky, and it might be that the homesickness and idleness hastened his death.</span> <span id="s1471">Mom died June 28th, ’71, in Sialishky, and Father on April 1972, in Lublin.</span> <span id="s1472">They are both buried in the cemetery in Piaski.</span> <span id="s1473">I want to mention that I have been married since December 31, 1945, and from the start, I lived in Piaski, and worked there initially, in the cooperative agricultural market, afterwards in the cooperative savings bank, and later, after bringing up the children, in the post office.</span> <span id="s1474">There was always frequent contact with my parents, especially during the times of intensified field labor.</span> <span id="s1475">All my family [indecipherable] these jobs.</span> <span id="s1476">Our children spent July and August vacations in Sialishky, and to the extent they could, helped their grandparents with the harvest.</span> <span id="s1477">Myself and my husband, who likewise are work in Piaski, took a leave of absence at the time, and spent it working on my parents farm.</span> <span id="s1478">In 1966, we obtained an apartment in Lublin, in Kalanovsheesna Street, and a new phase of our life began for us.</span> <span id="s1479">My son Andre finished at that time, the [indecipherable] technical school.</span> <span id="s1480">My daughter Alsberta finished liberal arts gymnas-gymnasium, college preparatory high school, and the younger daughter, Eva, went into the second class of basic school.</span> <span id="s1481">I, after coming to Lublin, have been working continuously at the post office in Piaski, which allowed me to be continuous -- in continuous contact with my parents, to whose house I used to ride after work on my bicycle, about three to six kilometers from Piaski to Sialishky.</span> <span id="s1482">At that time, my parents were already over 76 years old, and had less and less edj -- energy to work.</span> <span id="s1483">They sold part of their land because they were no longer in any condition to manage it, and earlier -- and -- and earlier, a part of the land had been sold to pay taxes imposed yearly by the people’s government of the community.</span> <span id="s1484">They were on what remained of their farm right up to Mom’s death.</span> <span id="s1485">My father, after the final liquidation on the farm, came to our house in Lublin in December ’71.</span> <span id="s1486">All my family hold them in fond memory.</span> <span id="s1487">They were people of high moral le-level, upon whom it was all -- always possible to depend.</span> <span id="s1488">Their most particular character trait was kindness and fondness for the family, and that was felt in every step in their contact with us.</span> <span id="s1489">For that reason also, our children were always very eager to be with them, and received each announcement of a trip to Sialishky with joy.</span> <span id="s1490">For us and our children, my parents home was always an oasis of peace and joy, where everyone always felt happy and secure.</span> <span id="s1491">That resulted in their positive influence on our hearts and minds, and arose from their deep faith in the values of the Christian teaching, on which they were followers.</span> <span id="s1492">Kindness, tolerance, and mutual respect.</span> <span id="s1493">My parents and all of us were eager to see you after years, once again in Sialishky, but that has turned out to be impossible.</span> <span id="s1494">I think that this will come true to a certain degree with your meeting with your son -- with our son Andre and his family al-although in America, where they have been living permanently since September 1988.</span> <span id="s1495">May he represent those who have already departed from this world, my dear parents and us all, living in this country.</span> <span id="s1496">We have the hope that this meeting will take place.</span> <span id="s1497">Lublin, December 19, 1993, Theadora Kobaleska.”</span> <span id="s1498">And now she’s got a beautiful letter --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Let’s pause for -- Let’s pause for a minute, don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: -- read those yet.</span> <span id="s1502">Let me ask you something about that.</span> <span id="s1503">Did you -- Did you -- Did you ever go back and visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: No, no, I never went back.</span> <span id="s1505">I was afraid of the Polish Communist government, I -- I never went back.</span> <span id="s1506">But we are continuously corresponding and I am helping them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Did you know Toidya while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Yes, I s-saw Toidya a few times.</span> <span id="s1509">She was a girl about 18 years old that time, and I don’t know whether I mentioned it in my story, at Easter, 1943, she came out of the house while I was watching the yard, with a little basket on her arm, and with her came a young man.</span> <span id="s1510">He stood in front of the house, on the side in front of the house and she went toward my hiding place.</span> <span id="s1511">And when she got in, she reached me the little basket.</span> <span id="s1512">And there were Easter cookies, and colored vodka to drink.</span> <span id="s1513">There -- There -- They regarded me as a member of their family.</span> <span id="s1514">It was really a beautiful relationship, and I told him he raised himself a son, and I am treating her like a sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: What -- How did you start to correspond with her?</span> <span id="s1516">Was that something that you had been doing over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Well, originally I wrote to her parents, but then when they passed away, and we continued some corresponding in Czech and Polish on either side, her husband Yanoush, started to study English, and from then on we started to correspond English on both ends, and you could have seen the improvement in his English as time went on.</span> <span id="s1518">It was really interesting.</span> <span id="s1519">And he’s a very find ma -- very fine man too.</span> <span id="s1520">By the way, their oldest son Andre came a f -- quite a few years ago with his wife and two daughters to the -- to the United States.</span> <span id="s1521">They’ve -- They left Poland.</span> <span id="s1522">And they live in San Diego, California.</span> <span id="s1523">And I tried to send them some money and the first time they finally took it.</span> <span id="s1524">And then he told me they don’t want any help, they want to do it on their own, and a very, very proud, fine, noble people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: This is the second letter that -- will you say something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: I am now continuing with the follow up letter after receiving the first one, I wrote her and this is the answer, dated Lublin, December the 17, 1993.</span> <span id="s1527">“Dear Kurt.</span> <span id="s1528">In reference to your letter of November seventh and to the information which I sent you in a letter on September 19, I would like to finish describing those events that I still remember from that letter.</span> <span id="s1529">I began working at S-Spudsyairna rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in September, ’41, and my work there prevented me from being taken to a forced labor camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s1530">In the fall, and especially during the winter, I frequently spent the nights in Piaski, and during the spring and summer, I often came home to -- by bike.</span> <span id="s1531">I was in Piaski the day you arrived at my parent’s home, on October 18, 1943.</span> <span id="s1532">The next day my mother came to me and told me about your arrival and that same day I came to Sialishky and we were tell -- talking.</span> <span id="s1533">I believe roo -- you remember that moment.”</span> <span id="s1534">I don’t remember that she was talking to me, that Toidya was ta-talking to me.</span> <span id="s1535">“I stopped working at the Sporgiana and came home to live with my parents with my father -- when my father took me from Piaski.</span> <span id="s1536">This happened when the Germans and Soviet armies were approaching our village.</span> <span id="s1537">During this time, attacks from wa-war planes, were intensifying, which were bombing German regiments and fleeing Germans and has set Piaski aflame.</span> <span id="s1538">At that time, retreating German er -- regiments and civilians, referred as to the Volksdeutsch, had penetrated into the village, took horses and anything else they could, and fled west.</span> <span id="s1539">I and several other people from the village, took our horses from the stables and we ran off in the meadows to prevent the Germans army from requisi -- requisitioning our horses.</span> <span id="s1540">We spent the night in the fields, in the bushes, where we safely waited until the morning.</span> <span id="s1541">The German army horse corp, and along with them civilians, arrived in our yard that same night.</span> <span id="s1542">Many farmers ran off into their meadows, whereas my parents and our neighbor, Adam Smoleara remained in the building.</span> <span id="s1543">In the morning my mother came and told us not to return home yet.</span> <span id="s1544">We returned to the village only in the afternoon, once the Germans left.</span> <span id="s1545">As we later discovered, rebels from the Polish underground army ambushed them outside of Piaski.</span> <span id="s1546">Most likely they were Germans and Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1547">A portion of them who survived, returned to Sialishky and ordered us to leave our buildings because the Soviet army was going to occupy them.</span> <span id="s1548">My parents quickly loaded the wagon with foods and clothes, and at that time, informed the military personnel that the messengers from the village went to the commander in Piaski to verify whether this order was reliable.</span> <span id="s1549">They were surprised by this information and shortly afterwards, left the village.</span> <span id="s1550">Our village is located between two main roads, which when leaving Piaski, one leads to Holm and the other one to Zamosc.</span> <span id="s1551">The Polish and Soviet armies were advancing on the road to Holm from Piaski, where the German’s army was retreating likewise it on the road from Piaski to Zamosc toward Lublin.</span> <span id="s1552">Both sides were exchanging machine gun fire from both Jal and the highest point -- from both Jal and the highest point in Sialishky.</span> <span id="s1553">The villages, Drizishky, Drazitchae, Jelltov and Piaski, and the surrounding area were aflame, but our village was preserved.</span> <span id="s1554">During this shoot out, we were sitting in a man -- manhole across from our residence, that was dug up by my father and our neighbor Alexander Pasternak.</span> <span id="s1555">In your hi -- In our hiding pl -- In your hiding place, there was another exit through the attic into Pasternak’s shed, that led to the meadow.</span> <span id="s1556">My father explained to me that in case of any danger, you could have run away by opening the door of -- to the unlocked shed.</span> <span id="s1557">After the German army retreated beyond Lublin, I decided to turn to work in Piaski.</span> <span id="s1558">That was at the end of July ’44.</span> <span id="s1559">The day you left our house, I was at work.</span> <span id="s1560">In my father’s opinion, the main roads [indecipherable] Piaski Lublin was the safest and directed toward the road, because that was where the Polish and Soviet regiments were located.</span> <span id="s1561">On the side road, Sialishky Pershki, there were many deserters dressed as civilians, of whom my father was suspicious, so he decided to lead you to the road beyond the yard, that led to the main road.”</span> <span id="s1562">That is not so in my memory, but it doesn’t really matter.</span> <span id="s1563">“You asked in your letter if anyone heard you coughing.</span> <span id="s1564">That was our neighbor, Adam Smalleara, who walked by your hiding place to his farm buildings every day.</span> <span id="s1565">He told his neighbor Constanti Pocharlie about the coughing in your -- in our buildings.</span> <span id="s1566">He was my father’s brother and frequently came to our home.</span> <span id="s1567">The next thing you asked is where my mother and I were when we left our home in Sialishky after my father was arrested, and who took care of our farm.</span> <span id="s1568">My father stayed with the si -- her sister, who lived in Volla Garjanitska village, and I stayed with my cousin in Lublin.</span> <span id="s1569">In our absence, my father’s brother, Constanti Pocharlie and his wife Elixa, who resided in Sialishky, and lived near us, took care of our farm.</span> <span id="s1570">They informed us through acquaintances that it was possible to return to Sialishky.</span> <span id="s1571">Was Kriska in Sialishky?</span> <span id="s1572">She did not live there.</span> <span id="s1573">She was from Walla Posi -- Biasetska village, a municipality of Piaski.</span> <span id="s1574">Some information about my family.</span> <span id="s1575">My husband Yanoush worked in Piaski, where [indecipherable] during the German occupation and several years after the liberation in -- until 1949, and subsequently in Lublin, December 31st, 1981.</span> <span id="s1576">From January first, ’82, after 40 years of working, the -- h-h-he retired.</span> <span id="s1577">Our son Andre was born January 10, ’47 in Piaski and graduated from a technical school in Lub-Lublin, and as you know, lives in the United States.</span> <span id="s1578">He has two daughters, Monica is 17 and Biara is 16.</span> <span id="s1579">Our daughter’s Edjberta, her married surname being Warchieska, was born January first, ’48, in Piaski and received a degree in Lublin, and subsequently in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1580">She was 21 all -- She has a 20 year old daughter, who il -- Ivana and lives in Warsha -- Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1581">Our daughter Eva have -- her married surname being Remish, was born December second, ’58, in Piaski, and received her degree in Lublin and has a 12 year old son, Pavel and lives in Lublin.</span> <span id="s1582">We move fi -- from Piaski to Lublin, with our entire family in ’66, where we are still living today.</span> <span id="s1583">If you would like any more information, please write, and I will gladly send it.”</span> <span id="s1584">That’s the end of the second letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: It must have been interesting to learn about what was going on from their perspective during that time that you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: I -- I remember when I got married, in ’54, I think not too long later, I got a request from them, the only time they asked for anything.</span> <span id="s1587">They told me that the oldest son, Andre, who now lives in San Diego and the second born daughter, will have Confirmations.</span> <span id="s1588">And they need for the girl, a little white dress.</span> <span id="s1589">So my wife Tina had made up a dress with the -- with the repair seamstress in the store, and we send it to them.</span> <span id="s1590">It had a stiff crinoline, and they thought that the crinoline is being worn outside instead of supporting the dress, and I got the picture, the confirmation picture with that crinoline on the outside.</span> <span id="s1591">I never told Toidya about this mistake, but it was really funny, and a beautiful picture.</span> <span id="s1592">I have the photograph someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: What --</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: I have also the photograph of Stanislav Pocharlie and his wife Anna, in the suit which I sold him, f -- and which he mentioned to me that I owe him -- that he owes me some money for it.</span> <span id="s1595">I have that picture, too, and the suit is as crinkled as it was when I s -- when I smuggled it out of the ghetto into the village to him.</span> <span id="s1596">But these were beautiful people, and they were so kind to each other.</span> <span id="s1597">A beautiful married life and a beautiful family life, the daughter, she was -- she was a queen, yet she was a wonderful daughter, you know, Toidya.</span> <span id="s1598">I have -- I have very warm memories, full of gratefulness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: What was it like for you to learn about some of the trials of the Poles in the area, and just to think of it from their perspective?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: That’s what I just wanted to let those know who will study the situation, that the Polish people, who were anti-Semitic, unfortunately, but that was again the fault of the church, later on suffered so much by their own Communist system, undeservedly.</span> <span id="s1601">In other words, they were always between two big millstones.</span> <span id="s1602">On the west was Germany, and on the east was Russia.</span> <span id="s1603">And Poland was actually divided, I believe three times during the history.</span> <span id="s1604">The last time it was unified in 1918, when the southern and -- and western part belonged to Austria-Hungary.</span> <span id="s1605">The northern part belonged to the Germans and the eastern part was Russian.</span> <span id="s1606">They -- They had very -- a li -- very few periods of their own nationhood, I think under the yagalons, which was a -- which was a -- they are kings, the yagalons, they were very, very well known, historically.</span> <span id="s1607">But the Polish nation as such, I -- I can see a very smart people, lacking some education and also infrastructure.</span> <span id="s1608">Communications, roads, electricity, that was missing.</span> <span id="s1609">But the people itself, are just as good as any of the civilized nations, or more civilized nations.</span> <span id="s1610">I w -- I wouldn’t -- I wouldn’t say that they are not civilized, but less me -- technically mes -- less developed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Do you want to say anything else about them before we move onto a different subject?</span> <span id="s1612">[indecipherable] question --</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: No, I really -- I -- I -- about the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: No, about -- about the -- your -- the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: About the -- no, no, I -- I -- I think I said everything I felt and feel about them, bef -- if I should remember later, I might be sorry, but right now I do not know what to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: When we stopped yesterday, we were talking about your experience with going to the post-war trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: And that you had testified a few times against Frenzel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: And you said something about how he had -- he had -- about what his sentence was.</span> <span id="s1621">I wanted to get more of a sense of your experience with going to those trials, and what did you testify, and meeting other people who had survived Sobibór while you were there, and wh -- and what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: The trial, generally speaking, were organized in such a way, that one witness per week.</span> <span id="s1623">I did not see a witness who was before me, or the one who came after me, because the court worked only on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I believe, and Thursday the -- the court wa -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: -- ee -- during the trial against the accused, Karl Auguste Frenzel Rosen, Undersharführer, or Sharführer of the SS.</span> <span id="s1625">First in Hagen, where I was two or three times, and then in another time, I was either in Frankfurt or in Kur-Kurnamrine -- no, I was in Frankfurt, Frankfurt mine.</span> <span id="s1626">Anyhow, at one time, he denied that I am the person who was in the camp, and the presiding judge, I believe his name was Schneider, stood up angrily and he says, “Mr. Thomas, how did they call you in camp?”</span> <span id="s1627">And I says, “Kurt.”</span> <span id="s1628">And then he said to Frenzel, “Now, don’t you remember a Kurt in the camp?”</span> <span id="s1629">He says, “Yes, I remember a Kurt, but this is not the Kurt which was there.”</span> <span id="s1630">He deny -- He was lying through as much as he could, but ultimately he was sentenced to life, because there was no death penalty in Germany, which he later on, for some legal reason, renewed the -- the trial, after being jailed for quite a few years, and the last trial confirmed again his guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: What -- What did you testify, and what was it like to te -- to be faced with this person and to testify against him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Well, I felt a certain satisfaction, that he could see that some of us survived and that he couldn’t get away with what he -- what he actually was doing.</span> <span id="s1633">He was really exploiting us very badly.</span> <span id="s1634">I am -- Otherwise, I -- I do not remember now anything during the trial, but I would say this, “There were actually three German families, which took care as much as they could om -- om -- of us witnesses.</span> <span id="s1635">One always was resting, while the other two were active, and in my case, it was another judge, who was very kind to me, with who I correspond once in awhile, and then there was the wife of the principal of a high school, their name was Wagner.</span> <span id="s1636">Very, very kind, nice people, who tried to make us feel a little bit at home while we -- while we during the trials in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: What year were those trials taking place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: The first one was in 1966, and then I couldn’t tell which following years when it was.</span> <span id="s1639">But the last one, I was a re -- I was real surprised, because it was quite a few years when they started a retrial, after he claimed that he was sentenced innocently.</span> <span id="s1640">And that was quite a few years later, it must have been in the 70’s, already.</span> <span id="s1641">And also Germany looked entirely different at that time, than during the first time of the trial.</span> <span id="s1642">Even the hotels were so much better, and -- and the food and the -- it was an -- it was already a Germany restored, almost completely, economically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: What was it like for you to be in Germany, and how did you find the Germans?</span> <span id="s1644">A: Those Germans which I encountered, were very, very nice, very kind, decent people.</span> <span id="s1645">And I believe that the German people are a -- are very -- very, ve-very good nation, like anybody else, but they were misled by a -- by a government, by getting promises, and also because they suffered of the -- of the defeat during the first World War, which was interpreted to them as a -- as a reason to avenge it.</span> <span id="s1646">But nobody wa -- was telling them that they actually started the war themselves, I mean it -- the war started in -- in -- after Ferdinand Testi was killed in -- in Bosnia by Gavria Princip, a Bosnian nationalist, who killed the successor to the throne of the Hapsburgs.</span> <span id="s1647">And they gave the Serbians an ultimatum which they couldn’t accept, and that’s why the -- how the war started.</span> <span id="s1648">And when Austria declared war on os -- on Serbia, the Russians declared war on Austria, and the French declared war on the Russians, and -- and Austria, and the English way north, and the first World War started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Did you feel any anger at all towards the Germans when you were ther -- there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: When I was in Germany?</span> <span id="s1651">No, not personal.</span> <span id="s1652">It was rather a historical feeling, but I had nothing against the German population any more.</span> <span id="s1653">They -- They were defeated, they changed their political system, and -- and they were admitting their guilt, and paid restitutions, so what else can you -- can you ask?</span> <span id="s1654">I think they were, in -- in the aftermath, they were the most decent ones of all -- of all the nations who were involved in the war and took advantage of the superiority of the German army, o-of the -- of the -- the German government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Did you ever feel angry at anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: No, I was -- certainly had no friendly feelings toward Frenzel.</span> <span id="s1657">As a matter of fact, I just remembered, I was waiting one morning on a stone bench in the courthouse.</span> <span id="s1658">I came earlier than necessary.</span> <span id="s1659">And next to me sat another German citizen, he was -- at that time, at least, I would say 20 years older than I. And I told him -- he asked me what I am doing there, and I told him that I am there, being summoned as a witness, and mentioned Frenzel, and then I mentioned another -- another SS man, whose name was Gomersky.</span> <span id="s1660">And he told me that he knew the Gomersky’s boys, pre-war, that they were very, very poor people, they had nothing, they didn’t have even a bicycle.</span> <span id="s1661">And when Hitler came into power, or rather, before he came into power, the n -- the National Socialist Party supported the family, for the promise that they will be voting National Socialist.</span> <span id="s1662">That’s what he told me.</span> <span id="s1663">And Gomersky, I have seen, he was already sentenced, I think.</span> <span id="s1664">He died in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: You mentioned earlier that right after the war, you’d sent some information to the West German government about Frenzel, and about his hometown, and where it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yeah, i-it wasn’t the government, it was some kind of a court.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: But it was a -- it was a government institution, but not directly the government, and I -- I mentioned that Frenzel came from a city, as I said this before, which consists of two nouns, lerver, lion, and borg or berg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned that and what I was wondering is whether -- did you feel -- did you trust the German government to actually persecute it’s criminals at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Well, I-I really -- I knew that the Germans are persecuting those Nazis.</span> <span id="s1671">It never came into my mind that they will not pick up the information which I gave them or -- or -- or simply pigeonhole it someplace.</span> <span id="s1672">But it never came into mind either, that they will take a map and find the city and -- and -- and find then Frenzel in this theater, working as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s1673">It was just a lucky coincidence that Friedma -- Friedland -- no, Friedberg, told me where he -- where his hometown was.</span> <span id="s1674">If I would have asked Friedberg at the time, “Give me all the names and addresses of all the people,” he would have given it to me, but who thought of that we will come out one day and be able to use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: I wanted to ask you about the -- So, during that time, you didn’t actually meet with any of the other Sobibór survivors?</span> <span id="s1676">The time that you were testifying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: No.</span> <span id="s1678">I didn’t see any of the survivors, although I think that at one time, I was going back to the United States with Samuel Lehrer and his wife, Gail.</span> <span id="s1679">No, no, no, they were still there, and they asked me because I will be home in [indecipherable] sooner than I, to call their children that they are alright.</span> <span id="s1680">I think we -- we -- we saw each other there for -- for a short while, in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Have you had any other kinds of -- of gatherings, of that -- that group, or any [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Yeah, we had some gatherings.</span> <span id="s1683">One time we were together in New York, when the movie about the uprising of Sobibór was premiered, and we, the survivors, saw it first.</span> <span id="s1684">At that time, the United States witnesses came to see the movie, and even one fellow who was in South America, Shlomish Misener, he -- he too came.</span> <span id="s1685">The movie was financed -- The making of the movie was financed by the Chrysler corporation, and it is often shown on PBS, the uprising in Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: That’s the one called, “Escape from Sobibór?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yeah, “Escape from Sobibór.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: At that time I had a dispute.</span> <span id="s1690">I, on one side, against all the other former internees, because I didn’t like what Hollywood made out of the story, by adding things which never happened, and not telling about those things which were just as important, and didn’t show them in the movie.</span> <span id="s1691">And they were angry with me that I was mentioning that.</span> <span id="s1692">And I said that history -- as these documents should be a historical document, should really tell the truth, and not be biased by some filmmaker, who made up a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Have you had a -- There’s been so much material on the Holocaust coming out ho -- in Hollywood and popular culture --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: -- lately.</span> <span id="s1696">Have you had a problem with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: Well, some of the literature, I will have to mention my former colleague Blatt.</span> <span id="s1698">He issued a little booklet, and it is in such a low standard, and so uninformative, actually, that it’s ridiculous that somebody even printed it.</span> <span id="s1699">There is another book which I read, by Jules Scurvis.</span> <span id="s1700">He’s a -- a Holland citizen, from -- from Holland.</span> <span id="s1701">And he spend one hour in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1702">When his transport arrived, they pulled out from the transport, 80 typographers, and he was one of them too, but he was not -- he was not taken.</span> <span id="s1703">So he asked an SS man whether he could join them, and the SS man kicked him in his butt into the group.</span> <span id="s1704">Now there were 81.</span> <span id="s1705">They were used during the war for typographical -- for -- what do you call it, when you print books?</span> <span id="s1706">Printing purposes, and also, I understand, for falsifying British currency, counterfeit.</span> <span id="s1707">It’s interesting that of the 81, he was only one who survived, and then wrote a book about Sobibór, and it was interesting.</span> <span id="s1708">He put into it -- I have it here, all the names of the some 34,000 Dutch people who came from Westerbork to Sobibór by transport, by date, and alphabetically.</span> <span id="s1709">And that book was reprinted many times, because people were interested, not only about knowing about Sobibór, but about those who perished there.</span> <span id="s1710">That book is there, I can see it from here.</span> <span id="s1711">It’s in -- It’s in -- in Dutch, in Hollandish, and I got later on a translation in German.</span> <span id="s1712">It was translated into German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Did you say something in your first interview that Jules Scurvis had told you something about the fate of your family, or am I misunderstanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: No, Jules Scurvis could not tell me, I told Scurvis about the fate of my family, and he put it in the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: There is also my -- a picture of mine in that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: What about other times that you’ve gotten together with survivors from Sobibór, has that happened?</span> <span id="s1718">Have you maintained contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yeah, it happened, because I used to go once in awhile when I was in New York, on business, I used to go to wine land, where quite a few of the former survivors of Sobibór were in the chicken business, and egg business, you know?</span> <span id="s1720">So I met with them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: It was a friendly get together, you know.</span> <span id="s1723">We -- We were happy that we are around and that we outsmarted the Germans.</span> <span id="s1724">I also forgot to say yesterday, after the war, when I came to the United States and I married my wife, I worked for awhile in their store.</span> <span id="s1725">Her brother and his wife were together with a partner in a business where they manufactured slippers.</span> <span id="s1726">Originally -- The original trade name was Angel Treads.</span> <span id="s1727">And then they came out with another line called Deerfoams.</span> <span id="s1728">And when the -- Prior to that yet, I was working in another branch of their business, called House of Foam, which was selling foam rubber.</span> <span id="s1729">We represented Firestone in Akron, and I was active there, traveling a little bit, and selling the stuff wherever I could.</span> <span id="s1730">And we made pillows.</span> <span id="s1731">And then when they came out with the line of Deerfoams, the company’s name is R.G. Barry Corporation, with headquarters here in Columbus.</span> <span id="s1732">I got a line of these Deerfoams and started to travel, to introduce that line of slippers, washable slippers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, I forgot now where else.</span> <span id="s1733">Min-Minnesota, and introduced these slippers and got them into big stores, and as the distribution rose, and I could not handle that many states any more, I was giving up territory, and ultimately, I landed with four or five cities in Ohio, like Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton, Youngstown.</span> <span id="s1734">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s1735">And then I retired in -- and that’s how I make an -- a living, and a nice living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">Q: Di -- Was your work an important part of your life, was it particularly --</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Well, I devoted all my energies to my work, and -- and to my wife.</span> <span id="s1738">These were the two main objectives, and I was successful building up this business, and the company was very nice to me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Did you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: No, I didn’t have any children from my -- with my first wife, neither -- nor no-none with my second wife, of course, we were too old already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: And you mentioned that your first wife passed away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: When was that and -- and how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: She had circulatory problems and later on also developed Alzheimer’s, and he passed -- she passed away in ’82.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: And -- And your -- you remarried when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: ’84.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: In ’84?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: In ’84, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Will you state your wife’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: Gloria, Gloria.</span> <span id="s1751">She’s American born also, just like my first wife was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: We pause for a second.</span> <span id="s1753">It’s -- Well, it’s interesting that you -- that you pulled out the -- the book that Thomas Blatt wrote --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: -- because I had a quote from the interview that we did with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And -- And I wondered what your response would be to this.</span> <span id="s1758">And he says, “The fact is that the survivors from the death camps act completely differently than survivors from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1759">Concentration camp survivors have societies -- have societies.</span> <span id="s1760">Mau-Mauthausen prisoners, Auschwitz organizations, and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1761">You never hear of S-Sobibór or Treblinka organizations, or Helmno.</span> <span id="s1762">First of all, that’s you on the left, but people ask me, do you get together?</span> <span id="s1763">No, we don’t get together, we don’t get together because our memories are too terrible, really, to talk about, so we don’t have contact with each other.”</span> <span id="s1764">It sounds like what you’re saying is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: It is not only different, this is -- he personally, had with him -- Shlomish Misener, staying for six weeks, when they were trying to put together a book.</span> <span id="s1766">So, th-that is already in contradiction that we ne -- didn’t get together, we did get together.</span> <span id="s1767">I was together this last winter with Esther Robb and her husband, which was not in the camp, and with Samuel Lehrer and his wife in Florida, and it was I who initiated that meeting.</span> <span id="s1768">And we already set for next year, that we will make it so that we could be longer together than a few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: And -- And he emphasized --</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: I went, for instance, to Chaim Engel’s son’s Bar Mitzvah in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1771">And I try to be in touch.</span> <span id="s1772">But then, when I had that controversy, that dispute about the movie, with which I cannot come out publicly, because I didn’t want to put wind into the sails of those who denied the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1773">I felt originally, and I -- now I -- it watered down, definitely, that me -- that feeling, that the only thing I have in common with them is, the physical living together in the camp, but that intellectually, we are far apart.</span> <span id="s1774">That was my feeling at the time, and I was very angry and frustrated, because they were at me like I would been a traitor, when I mentioned that the movie is not really a hundred percent correct.</span> <span id="s1775">In -- In the basis, it was correct that there was a camp and there was killing going on, murdering, and that we s -- that we had organized an uprising and some of us survived.</span> <span id="s1776">That is true, but certain details were not -- were not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Did they not agree with you that certain details --</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: That’s exactly, they disagreed with me, because he didn’t want -- they didn’t want me to even mention that there’s anything wrong, which shouldn’t have been there in the first place, and that they omitted other things which they should have put in.</span> <span id="s1779">And I think the -- the -- that -- that is my -- my -- that I put one and one together.</span> <span id="s1780">The main reason why this happened to us, Esther Robb went to Yugoslavia twice when the movie was made, as a consultant.</span> <span id="s1781">First she went as a -- as a volunteer, and then when they saw that she could give some information, they made her a consultant.</span> <span id="s1782">And she had in her power to do it right, because she has a good memory, she’s a smart girl.</span> <span id="s1783">And -- But she let them do whatever they wanted to do, and -- and on that she -- in that sense, she is guilty in my own mind.</span> <span id="s1784">But I forgave her already, because it doesn’t make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Okay, there was some -- something else -- on the -- the whole idea that survivors of extermination camps, as opposed to concentration camps, have a very different kind of experience, do you think there’s anything to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: I don’t believe that, what he said, because it was the trauma of the beatings, of the servitude which we have to manifest and -- and the horrible conditions, and to know that many people got killed.</span> <span id="s1787">What is the difference?</span> <span id="s1788">I -- I don’t -- I don’t believe that I suffered more than somebody who survived Mauthausen and Dachau.</span> <span id="s1789">I personally don’t agree with that, and I don’t know how he came to that conclusion, as if he would be a better, more elite caste of the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: You mentioned something yesterday about how, immediately following the war, you had more of a need to speak about it than you do now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s1792">I don’t have any need now at all.</span> <span id="s1793">But at that time, it -- I think that there was -- there was something mentally, because wherever I had an opportunity, I started to rattle down my experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Did you ever meet -- Did you ever do any public speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: No.</span> <span id="s1796">I had one little speech at the university here, and it was a fiasco, because first of all, there were only very few listeners.</span> <span id="s1797">More than half of the listeners were friends of mine, instead of students from the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Oh, maybe four or five years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: Hold on.</span> <span id="s1801">Did you say that you had gone to visit in -- in Boskovice, one time, after coming --</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Yeah, it was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: That was, I -- in the 90’s, in the early 90’s, after the Communist system s-stopped to exist.</span> <span id="s1805">Later, a year later, I think, I went to Czechoslovakia and was in bo -- was in Boskovice for about three days, but I stayed in the hotel in Bernau, and we commuted by taxi, because the -- the accommodations in Bernau were -- were easy and also I had friends in Bernau, survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Will you tell me something about that trip, and what it was like for you to visit again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Really, it was nothing dramatic.</span> <span id="s1808">The most dramatic thing was when I wanted to visit the graves of my late grandparents, my father’s mother and father, Josef and Rosaria Ticho.</span> <span id="s1809">They had two very nice tombstones, and before I went to America, I erected a plate -- a marble plate, which was affixed on the two tombstones, in which I remembered my parents and my sister, that they perished on June the 23rd, 1942, in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s1810">The stones were -- were -- f-f-fell down and -- no, at that time they were still there.</span> <span id="s1811">No, at that time they were already gone.</span> <span id="s1812">It was -- The stones were f -- laying flat on the ground and the tablet was torn off, and I could not -- I did not know that I need a key to get into the cemetery and I didn’t even know wh-who the key -- who the -- would have the key.</span> <span id="s1813">I crawled over the fence, into the cemetery, and that was the most dramatic thing on -- on the whole trip.</span> <span id="s1814">As a matter of fact, we went first to -- where did we go first?</span> <span id="s1815">First to Hungary, and stayed in Budapest, and my friend Rudolf Hurlinger, with his wife Inga, who live in California -- she unfortunately died a few months ago -- went on a trip with a group.</span> <span id="s1816">And as it happened, they also went to Hungary, to Budapest, and also to Vienna, and also to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1817">And we, my wife and myself, we were on our own.</span> <span id="s1818">So we happened to meet in Budapest, in the hotel, and when I was leaving with Gloria, the -- their room, I took the elevator, and in the elevator I see a man, and I look at him, and I says, “Sir, aren’t you a senator of the United States?”</span> <span id="s1819">And he shook my hand, and he says, “I am Sam Nunn, and this is my son.”</span> <span id="s1820">He introduced me in the elevator, and that was the day when Yeltsin stopped that tank in Moscow, during the revolution there.</span> <span id="s1821">And I says to him, “You know, Senator, we were lucky in -- in Russia.”</span> <span id="s1822">He says, “I just came from there, and we were really lucky.”</span> <span id="s1823">And in the meantime the elevator stopped on the first floor, and there were people waiting for him already, downstairs.</span> <span id="s1824">That was in Budapest, and then we met again in -- in Vienna, and then we met again in Bernau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: With Senator Nunn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: No, w-we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: -- my friend, Rudy and Inga.</span> <span id="s1829">And we wanted to go to -- to see the Spielberg, which is the same name as the producer of the movies, Spielberg, the same spelling, which was originally a torture camma built in the mid ages.</span> <span id="s1830">And they tortured their people for religious and political reasons, but it wasn’t accessible, so we decided instead, and took a cab and went to the Matzocra, which are limestone caverns, built by -- partly by the water seeping through from the outside, and there’s also a river on which you go on the little boat called Punqua, which was very interesting, that we spent together there with Rudy and Inga.</span> <span id="s1831">Where else did we -- Oh, yeah, then in Vienna, I knew my best friend’s brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: We s -- sorry, why don’t we switch the tape now, it’s about -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: -- which was a younger brother of my -- of his brother, who was a very close friend of mine, and we arranged a meeting and we met at the opera house.</span> <span id="s1834">Inga, Rudy, myself, Gloria and Emmanuel Ohare came too, and we had dinner together and -- and then we went to see the opera.</span> <span id="s1835">I forgot now what we saw.</span> <span id="s1836">And then in Prague, we met again with Rudy and Inga.</span> <span id="s1837">And we stayed downtown in a hotel, and they stayed on the outskirts in a hotel, with -- with was originally built during the Communist system for Communist’s functionaries only.</span> <span id="s1838">It was a luxurious place, I went there, with every amenity you can imagine, with terraces in front of the rooms.</span> <span id="s1839">And they stayed there for two or three nights and we stayed, as I said in the -- in downtown.</span> <span id="s1840">And there I met one of my school chums, from high school, Rudolf Bubla, who helped us in Prague.</span> <span id="s1841">He was a very nice fellow, who became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army, and then I found out later on, when I met him after the war, in Prague, how terrible all these officer were treated.</span> <span id="s1842">He worked in a coal mine for years, because he was a officer of the Czech army during the occupation of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: During the war, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: He was not Jewish [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: No, he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1847">Otherwise, he wouldn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: He wouldn’t [inaudible].</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Cramp -- Cramp in my foot.</span> <span id="s1850">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: What about return visits to Sobibór?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: I never made it, and maybe I should have gone, but what would I have seen there?</span> <span id="s1853">I have ha -- I have pictures.</span> <span id="s1854">There is nothing there but a elevated mass of -- of soil, and a monument in memory of those who got killed there.</span> <span id="s1855">And I c -- I couldn’t -- I couldn’t do anything for them anyways, so I -- no -- so I -- I never went.</span> <span id="s1856">There was a big -- There was a big gathering, and I think that Mr. Blatt was there, too.</span> <span id="s1857">I was the only one missing, at the 50th years anniversary of the uprising, I believe.</span> <span id="s1858">That would have been ’43 -- in ’93, there was.</span> <span id="s1859">And I have, someplace, even pictures.</span> <span id="s1860">You can remind Mr. Blatt that he was there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: One more question then.</span> <span id="s1862">Did you make a conscious decision not to have children?</span> <span id="s1863">Was that something that -- that meant anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: I tell you, we considered -- we were talking about adopting and I could not, at the time at least, accommodate my mind, that I could love a child which is not of my blood.</span> <span id="s1865">So we dropped the idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: Is there anything you want to add or say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: No, I want to thank you for being patient, and coming here, and I hope that we fulfilled our historical duty, to put on the tape, whatever I could remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Thank you very much, appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: Yes, it was a pleasure, you are very nice lady, and you are very good looking, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Oh, thank you.</span> <span id="s1871">We’ll have that on the record.</span> <span id="s1872">Okay, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Thomas Ticho -- with Kurt Ticho Thomas.</span> <span id="s1873">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">End of Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*00 PAGE 2 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 PAGE
