address.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">A: My name is Thomas Blatt, my Yiddish name is Toivy(ph).</span> <span id="s5">I live at 19427 Southeast 14th Street in ________________, Washington, 98029.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s7">So I wanted to start with where you ended your videotape interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I don't remember where I ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I probably ended, I have the tape here but I can't ________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Well you ended by talking about how you joined a, a partisan resistance group.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Probably I ended where I met the first Soviet soldier.</span> <span id="s13">Liberation, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Okay no, you hadn't gotten to that, but maybe we can, I wanted to ask a couple of questions about that group that you were in and what it meant to be part of the resistance group.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: So what group was it and how did you enter it?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: When I escaped from Sobibor, of course I was later hidden in a farmer's farm.</span> <span id="s18">He did try to kill me, I escaped and find myself in a village.</span> <span id="s19">In the beginning I was a cowhand, I helped with the cows because the farmer wouldn't keep me like this so I helped him out and once, a friend of my father, he was aware I'm Jewish, otherwise nobody did know I'm Jewish and he did want to help me.</span> <span id="s20">He called me and told me, "Tom, here's a piece of paper and an envelope, please deliver it to the next village, to that and that farmer."</span> <span id="s21">And I went over there.</span> <span id="s22">From that point, this farmer send me someplace else and finally I find myself not knowingly, working for the, in the underground.</span> <span id="s23">I didn't know what kind of underground, but I was delivering messages and I was with them in the forest and once in awhile we did go out to mine trains, is ______________, still not knowing what kind __________, but later I find out and that this is a organization, a peasant's organization called Battalione(ph) Hopska(ph), which in translation would meant, Peasant's Battalions.</span> <span id="s24">This was, on the political ground, it was in the middle, between the right and the left wingers.</span> <span id="s25">Later, after the Germans were chased out from Poland, some of them attached themselves to the Communist and some of them were the Nationalists, Akar(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: So how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was in that time 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: And you had seen a lot, you were not a child any more, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: No, I wasn't a child, I wasn't a child a long time before this, but of course the war speed up our development, mental development, special.</span> <span id="s30">So I do, I did see a lot.</span> <span id="s31">You see, some survivors were in the camps, concentration camps or they were as Christians on false papers.</span> <span id="s32">I did go all the phases through.</span> <span id="s33">I was in the ghetto, I was in jail, in camp.</span> <span id="s34">I later was in Christian papers and later was in the fighting organizations, so ________________ in all the aspects of the critical points of the hiding as a Jew.</span> <span id="s35">Not only in one place.</span> <span id="s36">So I know all the faces and all the difficult and different situations and I was of course liberated as a member of the organization, which later I was aware, the how, not by choice, but of course by accident.</span> <span id="s37">So many people by accident were in the Communist underground or the Nationalist underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So by accident.</span> <span id="s39">So that's what I wanted to ask about.</span> <span id="s40">You were 16 and this farmer asked you to start bringing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: To deliver a message.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And so at what point did you start to understand or think about or realize that you were part of this movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: The moment he send me, when I took the message to the next village, I already understood that this is something, it's a new phase in my hiding, I had to say.</span> <span id="s44">And when I delivered the message, in that time, you see, every day you survived.</span> <span id="s45">It's like I was, was like a bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s46">Every day you survived __________ a new sight ______________.</span> <span id="s47">So when I was on the farm, I thought oh, maybe I should sleep here, it'll be another safe day.</span> <span id="s48">So I went to the barn to sleep.</span> <span id="s49">I asked the farmer could I sleep.</span> <span id="s50">Oh, I don't want to go to make, back to my village, I am tired.</span> <span id="s51">He said of course you can sleep in the barn.</span> <span id="s52">And in the barn night time, some people started to arrive.</span> <span id="s53">About one o'clock, a group of about 25 people _______________.</span> <span id="s54">And I was ascared they will recognize me as a Jew so I digged in deeper in the straw.</span> <span id="s55">And they laid down, they relaxed.</span> <span id="s56">And about two hours later, everybody left and the way I find out, from their conversation was they're going on to mine the railroad tracks someplace, not far away.</span> <span id="s57">So I understood, that I'm in the midst of a organization, I still didn't know what kind, but later, as you see, _____________ special __________ once they did give me a horse and carriage, with a lot of leaflets from the Polish government in exile in London.</span> <span id="s58">And I supposed to deliver packages of the leaflets certain safe houses.</span> <span id="s59">So on that point I understood that they trust me already because I did know all the circuit we were delivering.</span> <span id="s60">And I understood for who I am working.</span> <span id="s61">Except that this Mr. Russelinski(ph) who was the head of the organization, who took me in to deliver the messages, he only was aware I'm Jewish, in the organization.</span> <span id="s62">Nobody else did know.</span> <span id="s63">As a matter of fact, the next day, when I was sleeping in this, in this village I mentioned before, it was Sunday the next day and the farmer said, Tom, they called me Tolek(ph) in that area, Tolek(ph) we are going to the church today and this farmer said, "Tolek, come to the church, we are going to the church.</span> <span id="s64">Tolek, come to the church."</span> <span id="s65">So I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s66">You see, I come, I don't come from an Orthodox family, but my old relatives were Orthodox and ___________ watched out for me I should learn the Torah and everything else.</span> <span id="s67">My parents really didn't care much.</span> <span id="s68">And I believed in God and to be a nice Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s69">You should never go without a cap, you know, if you take down the cap, you should have a yarmulke.</span> <span id="s70">And still, no matter what, after __________ after everything else, I still felt uneasy taking down the hat.</span> <span id="s71">Now they're going to church, I was aware I must take down the hat and what makes it worse, you're going to the church.</span> <span id="s72">We went over there and they are taking down the caps, the farmers and there's a big cross.</span> <span id="s73">And to take down in front of Jesus and the cross, I felt it's something terrible, I can't do.</span> <span id="s74">So I didn't touch my hat.</span> <span id="s75">But the farmer looks at me and said, "Och, like a Jew."</span> <span id="s76">And he, with his hand he __________ and threw out my cap.</span> <span id="s77">So I remember, but later when I was in the church, pretending I'm praying, we prayed of course in Polish and I prayed in Yiddish and asked for forgiveness that I am praying in a church.</span> <span id="s78">So now I don't mind, you know, it's different, but that time, my mind was set this way.</span> <span id="s79">So I feel to do some kind, how do you say it in English, blasphemy?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Blasphemy, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So all these people that you worked with, the resistance, did not know you were Jewish and it was important not to tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yeah, it was important not to tell them because the organization, we talk about a political organization, underground organization in Poland.</span> <span id="s84">One was called Akar(ph), AK and I know they killed the Jews.</span> <span id="s85">But on the other side, some Jews were members.</span> <span id="s86">Mostly doctors and so.</span> <span id="s87">So actually everything depends on the person, on the individual and if I was in this organization, maybe one wouldn't hurt me, but I bet there were some would hurt me badly would they find out I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s88">As a matter of fact my friend was hiding in the village.</span> <span id="s89">He attached himself to another organization, a leftist organization, where he should feel secure and he was killed by them.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Because he was Jewish, so they killed him.</span> <span id="s92">So it was dangerous to admit, so I, I looked like a little shygitz(ph), shygitz(ph) is in Yiddish, is a little Christian boy, barefoot and I was wearing, I remember, over, overhaul, you know and I didn't stood up as a Jew, my nose wasn't as big as is now.</span> <span id="s93">You know very younger, when you, when you, when you grow older the nose, first of all the nose is getting older too, longer.</span> <span id="s94">No, I was, I was pretty good.</span> <span id="s95">They didn't recognize me.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: And were there other Jewish young people or other Jewish people in the group?</span> <span id="s97">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: In the organization, no, no, not in this area.</span> <span id="s99">Oh no, no.</span> <span id="s100">There were living in this area, some Jews, there were two girls working at maids to Christians and there were one Jewish girl which married a Christian in another village and there was some Jews working as tailors, quietly, you know this was 1944, when the Germans actually didn't dare to come to villages like he used to come years before.</span> <span id="s101">When they did arrive in villages now, it's with big groups and very careful and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s102">So it wasn't so dangerous to take in a Jew for ___________, like it was, for example in 1942, '43.</span> <span id="s103">I talk about little villages far away where the partisans had the upper hand for the Germans.</span> <span id="s104">So some Jews were in the villages, living half hidden, half open.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: But you stayed private about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Yeah, yeah, in the partisans at least, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And so did they feed you, did they give you a place to stay, did they protect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: They didn't need to feed me or give me a place to stay, I mean in daytime mostly I was working with this farmer.</span> <span id="s109">But if there was, as it called, action, we did need to go someplace, they let me know, come here and there to assemble, to assemble part.</span> <span id="s110">We went out to a railroad track or we had some meetings and so on, so on and daytime, even back to work, no one did know that we are farmers, although in daytime I used to deliver leaflets, I mentioned.</span> <span id="s111">Or messages.</span> <span id="s112">But it wasn't a group, we was always in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: But there were some that were like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yeah, but ______________, they weren't always in the forest.</span> <span id="s115">And every group had people which in daytime, every partisan group, resistance, had people in daytime were normal people and in nighttime they went for some actions, they were called.</span> <span id="s116">And some were always in the forest.</span> <span id="s117">Actually the village was in the forest __________, it was in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And what was the name of the village?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Mchy.</span> <span id="s120">M-c-h-y.</span> <span id="s121">This is the Polish spelling.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s123">So a little while ago you said, then one day you met your first Russian soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No then one day.</span> <span id="s125">Finally.</span> <span id="s126">This was in July and a German soldier arrived in the village.</span> <span id="s127">And it was obvious that he, that he escaping and he told us that is an end to the war.</span> <span id="s128">It was already July 1944 and __________ us aware that the Germans are escaping, finally they arrived in our village.</span> <span id="s129">And we have seen it, the older farmers left the village and went uphill, for the prepared hiding places and dig outs and so on, ditches, you know.</span> <span id="s130">But, I was without in a hiding place and I didn't know what to do because they didn't let in strangers, the villagers.</span> <span id="s131">And the farmer where I working as a cowhand, he was aware I'm Jewish and he was afraid to let me in the last minute, you know, never know what could happen.</span> <span id="s132">So I went down to the village and mingled with the Germans, they were on every, on every farm.</span> <span id="s133">So anyway I went into a farm house, picked up a cow and took the cow back uphill.</span> <span id="s134">On the way, a German soldier passed me and he was washing himself with, he was shaving himself actually.</span> <span id="s135">And he offered me a cigarette, he talked with me a little bit and later I went down with the cow and to the field.</span> <span id="s136">And so if somebody stops me, of course I would say I take care of the cow, this is only, you know, belonging.</span> <span id="s137">So I felt a little bit safer, but later when the shooting is coming closer I was a little bit afraid and tried to get in, in a, you know, when they cut the corn, they but it in kind of a, I call it bundle and they put the bundles together so if forms like a, like a Indian shed, whatever would you call it?</span> <span id="s138">Anyway...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Teepee.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s141">I went to, so there was in the field a few of them standing and I was trying to hide in one and when I was trying to get in, I notice a person's over there.</span> <span id="s142">And the person was a Russian officer who escaped from, a few POW's were in this village with the Germans and he managed to escape, they were kept in a barn and he was hiding, so I noticed him and I was very happy because you have somebody to, of course it was dangerous, but the Germans were down in the village, I says, __________ uphill.</span> <span id="s143">I was happy to see him and we talked and explained that oh, they're machine guns, which meant Russians about 10 miles from here and later when we heard single shots, he explained, oh now they must be someplace in about a mile from here.</span> <span id="s144">And later was quiet and he said, "You know what, I think we are liberated, because the front probably passed the village on the eastern side."</span> <span id="s145">And I looked down to the village and of course there were no more Germans, but there weren't a lot of Germans, I mean.</span> <span id="s146">A few of them and they were mining tanks and they exploded the tanks, probably they didn't have fuel to drive them so they destroyed them before they left and later the, the Germans left and was completely quiet, like nothing.</span> <span id="s147">So I went down with this Russian to the village, looked around and later was walking on the road, not being completely sure that I survived, but I have the feeling, I think this is the moment.</span> <span id="s148">And finally from far away, I've seen a man on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s149">And I was wondering what is he doing with the bicycle and he was bicycling to the village.</span> <span id="s150">I'm waiting, waiting, when he comes closer, I recognize the Russian uniform, clean uniform.</span> <span id="s151">They're lighter than the Germans, than the German uniforms.</span> <span id="s152">He comes by, he drives closer, I recognize a Jewish, um a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s153">He finally stopped near me and he asked me, "Germans if nicht(ph)?"</span> <span id="s154">There are no Germans here?</span> <span id="s155">I said, "No, there are no Germans here, they left."</span> <span id="s156">So he turns around, went back.</span> <span id="s157">Few moments later, I seen on the edge of the forest about 200 yards away, somebody in a house and a black coat, overcoat, looking around for a few minutes, turning around and went back to the forest.</span> <span id="s158">And I realized that this is, I must be liberated and I was shocked, because I dreamed over the years about liberation, how the liberation would look like, how I will grab this liberator, I imagined it must be a soldier always, and kiss him and be happy and dance.</span> <span id="s159">And really be happy I survived and dance for joy or whatever people are doing when they are happy.</span> <span id="s160">And it wasn't so at all, I was really, when up to now, I was full of energy and I didn't think about anything else, just to survive.</span> <span id="s161">Now everything collapsed.</span> <span id="s162">I survived and it was, it was a terrible, pity should I say, I don't know.</span> <span id="s163">I felt terrible that my, my parents didn't survive, my brother, was only a year difference.</span> <span id="s164">So I felt the heaviness of the past tragedy that just fell on my shoulder and my soul and instead of be happy and joyful, I felt down and disappointed and it wasn't the way I meant, I thought it will be.</span> <span id="s165">And this was my liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: You felt that way at one moment or did that feeling of disappointment come later?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: The moment of liberation.</span> <span id="s168">Which could, as I, you say moment, it could be an hour, it could be, it could be a whole day I felt this way.</span> <span id="s169">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: And so thinking back on that now, is it still a disappointment?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: You see, when I was in Sobibor you know Sobibor wasn't a concentration camps, Sobi was a death camp.</span> <span id="s174">A lot of people don't know the difference.</span> <span id="s175">A death camp, you come in, you go to dead, with______________.</span> <span id="s176">And I never cried.</span> <span id="s177">I lost my parents in a matter of a few minutes and my brother, I never cried.</span> <span id="s178">When a day earlier, when they took us, before they took us to Sobibor, if one of my parents would die, let's say my mother, happened she died in the street, a truck run her, run her over, I would cry, I wouldn't imagine a life without her, it would be a terrible tragedy.</span> <span id="s179">Now, a day later, hours later, I lost my whole family and I didn't shed a tear.</span> <span id="s180">And I asked my friends, I thought maybe something wrong with me.</span> <span id="s181">Nobody cried in Sobibor.</span> <span id="s182">Why?</span> <span id="s183">Because a mechanism, another way of thinking took us over.</span> <span id="s184">The nature helped us to survive by blocking out the past and the same thing was before.</span> <span id="s185">When I was liberated, my feelings, the normality of the person, of human feelings especially, was no restrictions, this is the reason I felt the true feelings which were earlier suppressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: That's a lot of feeling for one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s188">And later, about a year later, I had another, I would call it, back down, not back down, another, when I did open completely because no matter what, I still, it still didn't reach me, the past deed, but in 1945 I was in a city called Gliveesa(ph), with a friend and I did drink a little bit vodka and I remember suddenly I started to cry and cried for a whole afternoon, maybe four hours.</span> <span id="s189">After that point, after I stopped crying, I felt really a different person.</span> <span id="s190">And from that point on, I, I think I started to live a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: That was how much later though, a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: A year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: A whole year.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: So in that first day though, did you cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: No, still not cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: You just felt the...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I very seldom cry, from that point.</span> <span id="s201">When I, when I did cry, I see a movie, from the wartime.</span> <span id="s202">I would, I would put in a few tears and that's all, when I see what's pictures from the past.</span> <span id="s203">That was the first time I cried really, besides this I mentioned this Gliveesa(ph) was a Polish movie I have seen called Channel, about Jews escaping through the tunnels and the shoes and so and so on and that time I cried.</span> <span id="s204">And other, now, here, there, I see a Jewish movie from the past, a little bit, you know, uneasy.</span> <span id="s205">But otherwise I think I'm very hardened, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Hardened, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Hardened, you see, I mean, I was a very sensitive boy as a kid.</span> <span id="s208">_______________________ and fighting and, but, what the Germans have done is not only killing people, the ones which did survive, the, the, the feelings was deformed.</span> <span id="s209">And I think the, the, the deformity for the rest of my life.</span> <span id="s210">I'm not as sensitive.</span> <span id="s211">I could look now to, to cripples or whatever, a divorce scenario and it wouldn't bother me really much.</span> <span id="s212">So, they changed my personality and...</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Okay, let's go, I want to go back, let's come back and talk about this.</span> <span id="s214">So the day of liberation, you had imagined it and it was a little emotionally different?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Why emotionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: At that point.</span> <span id="s218">Later I was more disappointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So what happened you know, the next day, the next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: So I'm free.</span> <span id="s221">Where should I go?</span> <span id="s222">I'm going back to my town, Itsbeetsa(ph) because it's only three kilometers.</span> <span id="s223">On the way I notice a group of Jews, _____________ and there was about five people of them, from Itsbeetsa(ph), I recognized them, start to talk what to do.</span> <span id="s224">And later they go to the marketplace.</span> <span id="s225">And there I realized again, that's another world, because this town, Itsbeetsa(ph) had come to be in 1917, in the 17th century, established by King Auguste(ph), only Jews lived there, 99 percent.</span> <span id="s226">The Christian was the mayor the city, commandant of the police, the rest only Jews.</span> <span id="s227">And I did know every place and every home where I would step in in Itsbeetsa(ph), they would take me in like the best guest and now we are standing in the middle of the marketplace, strangers now __________, hostile all around, I felt the hostility.</span> <span id="s228">And I remember not far, next to the stores, was a man, in a uniform, in an officer uniform.</span> <span id="s229">He was standing with a woman, we were watching him and he was watching us and finally he did come to us and he told us that he is an officer, _______________ in the Polish Akar(ph), in the Polish underground and he, he, he's, he's Jewish, he said and he, we're the first Jews surviving in hiding the way he has seen.</span> <span id="s230">And he talked with us and he left.</span> <span id="s231">Later we find out that he was killed.</span> <span id="s232">Because he was, in the Polish Akar(ph), the Polish underground as a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s233">And while talking with us, he betrayed himself as a Jew and he was later killed.</span> <span id="s234">And this told us his wife, much later was in Lublin and she survived ______________ wasn't Jewish, but she told the story in Lublin later.</span> <span id="s235">The city I left later.</span> <span id="s236">Most of the Jews left for Lublin, from the little towns in Poland, being afraid.</span> <span id="s237">Now, so we standing, finally one said, "I'm going to Lublin."</span> <span id="s238">Then another one went to a friend in the town.</span> <span id="s239">And I went to people I was friendly with, our neighbors and there was a bakery, Kulikoffska(ph) bakery.</span> <span id="s240">I went to her, a short lady, probably in her 60's.</span> <span id="s241">She helped my before.</span> <span id="s242">And she said, "Toivy, you know what?</span> <span id="s243">Where will you go, where will you run?</span> <span id="s244">Don't go the Jewish ways, business, handle.</span> <span id="s245">You see what's happened?</span> <span id="s246">Start to work like all the honest peoples are working, I will teach you to be a baker."</span> <span id="s247">So I thought, let's see what happened.</span> <span id="s248">I was sleeping a whole day, I started to work about two o'clock in the morning, producing bagels.</span> <span id="s249">And we worked til about eight and the bagels were ______________ ready by eight for the _______________ and eight o'clock I went back to sleep in the attic.</span> <span id="s250">And the oven actually was found there.</span> <span id="s251">One day, well night, somebody's knocking on the door.</span> <span id="s252">She runs, she was living in the first floor, she comes down, Kulikoffska(ph)...[End of side 1 of tape 1]...so, and she said, “Run to the attic and hide."</span> <span id="s253">So I hid in the attic and I was thinking, the war is over, I'm liberated, what is it?</span> <span id="s254">But after awhile she comes back.</span> <span id="s255">I heard some talking downstairs and I ___________________ the door locked and she comes, calls me down, "Come down and go back to work."</span> <span id="s256">Whatever else, I know the ______________ a short fellow, forgot his name, he was a drunkard, but a good person, he said, "Toivy, don't stay here, run while it's not too late."</span> <span id="s257">They were looking for you.</span> <span id="s258">He said, "Run."</span> <span id="s259">So I understood that there's still people after Jews.</span> <span id="s260">Same day, the day started, after I finished the bagels, I go out to go to Lublin.</span> <span id="s261">I didn't realize there's no regular communication.</span> <span id="s262">So I start to walk on the streets, people recognized me, because up til now I wasn't a baker practically.</span> <span id="s263">And I find out, as I said, there's no communication, just I must find a occasional horse and carriage or truck or whatever.</span> <span id="s264">There were some carriages leaving the direction of Lublin ________________, but I was afraid to go over there, one by one with a farmer, who knows, I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s265">So I was waiting for a truck.</span> <span id="s266">I tried to stop one truck, another one, ______________ military Russian trucks passing by from Lublin to Zamush(ph).</span> <span id="s267">But they didn't stop me beside, they didn't stop in any small places, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s268">In that time was still a turmoil, you know.</span> <span id="s269">At the point, after about three or four hours, wandering on the street of Itsbeetsa(ph), the main street, I notice that about three or four people are watching my ______________, where, where you going?</span> <span id="s270">They going after me.</span> <span id="s271">At that point I recognized one, who shot at me, trying to kill me, who did kill my friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Shot at you or shouted?</span> <span id="s273">Shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: So I realized, and shocked me, I realized the people I was trying to hide for so long, they shouldn't find me, that I myself practically ______________ in, in their hands.</span> <span id="s277">Because the realized, they were looking for me, they realized if I survive, they will be punished.</span> <span id="s278">And so was there life or my life.</span> <span id="s279">And now, and they didn't even, they weren't in a hurry to kill me.</span> <span id="s280">They didn't want to do it probably in daytime, he was waiting til it be dark and it was without question they would shot at me.</span> <span id="s281">__________ where could I go, no truck stopped.</span> <span id="s282">Finally I've seen that it started another hour, so it'll be dark and that time I'll be really in trouble because even the trucks would not, the drivers will not drive at night time.</span> <span id="s283">So I thought, I will wait.</span> <span id="s284">And the next truck I will see, the next military truck I will simply jump in the middle and he could run me over and this is it.</span> <span id="s285">And so it's happened.</span> <span id="s286">When I've seen the truck, I jumped on the road and tried to stop him.</span> <span id="s287">He didn't want to, but finally he stopped practically inches from me and the officer, the Russian officer opened the door, jumped out, start to yell.</span> <span id="s288">Said to him, "Listen, ________________, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s289">You could run me over, but I don't move on that place, because here are my killers.</span> <span id="s290">If you wouldn't kill me, they will kill me.</span> <span id="s291">I prefer you should run me over than they must kill me.</span> <span id="s292">Please take me."</span> <span id="s293">"I can't, because we have three people in the, in the compartment."</span> <span id="s294">So I said, "I don't care, I will drive on the back, I will ride in the back."</span> <span id="s295">And he had seen that he can't do anything with me, he said, "No, jump" So I jumped to the, on the truck and there was, I remember an anti-aircraft gun with a big seat and some, maybe six barrels.</span> <span id="s296">So I sat on the seat and hold on the handles from the, to hold on, not to shake in this truck.</span> <span id="s297">It was handling like an anti-aircraft gunner, you know.</span> <span id="s298">And the truck moved and I looked down and I've seen the four persons disappointed and the truck moved on and the people become smaller and smaller and smaller and finally I realized again, I made it.</span> <span id="s299">And this way I was taken to Lublin.</span> <span id="s300">And Lublin in that time, Lublin was the center of the surviving Jews from the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s301">Before the war, Lublin in this area, had most of the Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s302">So whoever survived, went to Lublin.</span> <span id="s303">So Lublin I find a lot of my friends.</span> <span id="s304">And in that time was organization called I think, Umara(ph).</span> <span id="s305">United, I don't know, it was American organization which helped refugees and so on.</span> <span id="s306">And probably the joint too.</span> <span id="s307">And he had some houses where survivors like me did get a bed, a blanket, had a place to live.</span> <span id="s308">So I start to be over there.</span> <span id="s309">I start to, took a, a such a room with a few, another Sobibor survivors like Edda Lishtman(ph), her husband Ithsak(ph) Lishtman(ph), can't remember more.</span> <span id="s310">And __________ start to work in Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So when you said you saw your friends, what was it like when you came upon someone again, and to see, to know that they had survived also.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Each new face which I've seen as a survivor and a familiar face, from my town or from Sobibor, you know, it, it, it was a, I felt happy, I felt, we felt close to each other.</span> <span id="s313">We're, we're wild too.</span> <span id="s314">We didn't know what, we didn't have, talk about kids my age, you know, when the war started I was 12 years old, I didn't learn a trade or anything else, my way of thinking was completely distorted.</span> <span id="s315">I remember wandering Lublin and I've seen policemen, two policemen that escort a man to the courthouse and I ask my friend, "What's happened with this guy?"</span> <span id="s316">"Oh he did steal a chicken and he was arrested."</span> <span id="s317">So I said, "He stole a chicken?</span> <span id="s318">Let me see what they will do with him."</span> <span id="s319">So we went to the court and he did explain the court, that, that or that and, and I wasn't able to understand it.</span> <span id="s320">It was to me, like unreal.</span> <span id="s321">I mean he stole a chicken, he said he stole, take him behind the wall and shot at and kill him.</span> <span id="s322">I have seen people killed for less than stealing a chicken.</span> <span id="s323">Why you wasting time?</span> <span id="s324">Two policemen, the judge and the procedure and time.</span> <span id="s325">I, I, I wasn't able to grasp it.</span> <span id="s326">Another time, I was like a newborn in the world.</span> <span id="s327">Another time, I went, I was hungry many times and somebody told me that the Catholic monastery, nuns, the nuns, they have a kitchen, a sort of kitchen, go over there and you could eat soup once a day.</span> <span id="s328">So I went over there.</span> <span id="s329">I felt uneasy being in a Catholic institution but I was hungry and I went in, in Lublin.</span> <span id="s330">And there were big tables and people sitting and the nun with the white cap comes and she brings me a dish, soup and I eat it.</span> <span id="s331">And she comes, she asks me, "Would you like more?"</span> <span id="s332">And she takes this, how you call it, this spoon, a big, big spoon and gives me more soup.</span> <span id="s333">And I felt that I am doing something wrong.</span> <span id="s334">I felt that I should tell her I am Jewish, she's too good to me.</span> <span id="s335">I mean, I'm cheating her, I felt.</span> <span id="s336">So this is the way, many, many things like that, which I did need to learn from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: So is it a, it sounds confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s339">Somebody called me sir.</span> <span id="s340">________________.</span> <span id="s341">First time I still remember was in the train, called me sir.</span> <span id="s342">It was sounding, affirming that I'm a person and this took time.</span> <span id="s343">So I was in Lublin and I was ever so very shy, but over shy and instead to go to my father's friend, like another people done, a few my age who survived and he took care of them.</span> <span id="s344">I waited my father's friend should tell me come.</span> <span id="s345">Well, where are you, what are you doing, be with me.</span> <span id="s346">He didn't tell me and I didn't ask him, so I suffered.</span> <span id="s347">Years ago, when I met him in America, because later he emigrated, and this was in 1960, I asked him, I said, "Moshe," his name was Moshe Blank(ph).</span> <span id="s348">I said, "Moshe."</span> <span id="s349">I, he was my father's best friend and, "you've seen me, a lost fellow and why didn't tell, you had so many young men around you."</span> <span id="s350">Because he had a tannery, you know, he was very rich and I said, "You had so many young people, helping them, living in your house, why didn't you ever tell me, Toivy, you need some help, come be with me."</span> <span id="s351">So he said, "I didn't know.</span> <span id="s352">I mean, you should tell me.</span> <span id="s353">I be glad.</span> <span id="s354">I thought that you want to be independent."</span> <span id="s355">In a way it's true, I always liked to be independent, but also I did, I felt bad, I did want to be with somebody who, who will substitute my father, a family at least.</span> <span id="s356">So I was wandering and finally I have seen a shop, a bicycle repair shop and I asked them if they need help.</span> <span id="s357">In the wartime I worked in a bicycle shop.</span> <span id="s358">He said yes and I started to work.</span> <span id="s359">At a point I asked him, "Listen I will work for you, but you must pay me every day."</span> <span id="s360">And I remember ________________ because I had to have money.</span> <span id="s361">So he paid me every day.</span> <span id="s362">And the day did look like that in the morning, I was in this house, from the joint committee.</span> <span id="s363">Went down to the marketplace and there were farmers, mostly their wives, actually, with milks, was exchange, with milk, sour milk and this.</span> <span id="s364">So I bought two glasses of milk.</span> <span id="s365">Not sour cream, the sweet milk, sweet cream, two glasses and two rolls and when I drink this, right on the spot, this cream and the rolls and after that, I went to work and worked.</span> <span id="s366">We had lunch, I wasn't, I didn't go, I didn't take out lunch, I liked mine job.</span> <span id="s367">And once, I remember there, my boss said, "It's already five o'clock and we are closing, but Tolek(ph), if you would like, there's a man here has problems with a bike, you don't need to, but if you would like to, fix it."</span> <span id="s368">And I said, "Of course I will stay."</span> <span id="s369">And this happened a few times and finally the boss told me "Tom, I don't understand you.</span> <span id="s370">I have more people working for me and they're just waiting for the five o'clock to go home and you seem to be happy to work and always agree to work overtime.</span> <span id="s371">I like you.</span> <span id="s372">From now on you eat with me together."</span> <span id="s373">And from that time on, lunchtime he took me to his house as a member of the, I eat like a member of the family.</span> <span id="s374">But he didn't understand, this farmer, is this, that for the first time in my life, I worked, nobody beat me.</span> <span id="s375">I get paid.</span> <span id="s376">I mean, I didn't realized that it could be so, I was for five years indoctrinated in a different way.</span> <span id="s377">So I loved my job and I always was mechanical, handy and I liked it, really.</span> <span id="s378">So this was the reason I worked so nice and hard, the day did come...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: And the other people weren't like that __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No.</span> <span id="s381">______________, they didn't care.</span> <span id="s382">Went through a bottle of vodka later from, with the money.</span> <span id="s383">I did like __________, I did like and it give me a pleasure.</span> <span id="s384">From the past, they beat me and I was always in the threat of death and knowing that I will die and here I work and is a different world, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: But I guess my question was the other people you worked with had come from a different, they had not been through the same thing you had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: They were Christian Poles, they were not Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Had a different life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Even though this was, you were, you said it was a town of mostly Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: No, not mostly.</span> <span id="s391">Most of the survivors from this area, congregated in Lublin, but most of the Jews too, did go go in, in the business by themself.</span> <span id="s392">I mean, handle, trade and so on.</span> <span id="s393">Very few, maybe I was even actual the only one who did go to work in a bicycle repair shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: And how old were you by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Still 16?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yeah, I know, '44, yeah, yeah, 16,17, 16, end til 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Couple questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s401">When you said you were in this house with the other people from the joint committee, did they feed you?</span> <span id="s402">You said you were hungry some days and that's why you went to that church.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: They didn't feel me, they give me a place to stay.</span> <span id="s404">But I think they had some kind of kitchen, I didn't know, I did never got to this place.</span> <span id="s405">I think they had in another street, called Shwartic(ph) Street, there another house, big house for refugees and I think, it's a possibility they had a kitchen over there, but I imagine, I didn't hear about this and I didn't go, but now from the perspective of time of the time passed, I think there probably there was some kind of kitchen, I didn't know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: And so you lived with other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Slept?</span> <span id="s409">Cause everyone came back to the same house?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: At nighttime we did come back to the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: And did people talk about their, each, everyone talk about their experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s413">We come home tired and what's happened is there's this, we didn't, I had a problem, only which I was very ashame of and I didn't know how to correct it, I urinated nighttime and in every, I did get up, I was in a puddle of this and I felt bad and I understood this problem ________________ and very unsettled and this was the reason for.</span> <span id="s414">No, we didn't discuss, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: But probably other people had other problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Everybody had problems.</span> <span id="s417">I didn't know how, I know a few of us in this house, he doesn't live any more, he's he did became to be a multi-millionaire.</span> <span id="s418">He had gas stations in Israel, __________ and Canada.</span> <span id="s419">His name was, I can't remember.</span> <span id="s420">Anyway, he used to go out and other people and buy from the Russian soldiers, part of the uniform and later sell it in the market, you know.</span> <span id="s421">And the Russian soldiers, especially in the hospitals, used to sell shirts and soap and this and they did conduct some trade, which I didn't do, I didn't like it and I didn't feel talented in bargaining and trading, so I didn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: And so you said people went to the market to trade, how did, you got a job, how did people get money, how did they start changing from having to survive every day to having some money and a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I will give you example.</span> <span id="s424">I do go work in the bicycle place.</span> <span id="s425">So I had the money because every day he paid me 17 dollars.</span> <span id="s426">The another one, the guy who did, which I mentioned, I forgot his name, unfortunately, but is a typical tradesman, he did get up in the morning, went to the hospital to work in the hospital.</span> <span id="s427">If you work in the hospital they give you food to eat, you know.</span> <span id="s428">While working, he had a package of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s429">So he trade the package of cigarettes with the Russian soldier which was wounded and he was in the bed and he sold his shirt.</span> <span id="s430">Later he took the shirt to the marketplace, was a spot, a marketplace in Lublin, where somebody bought a shirt.</span> <span id="s431">Later he bought 10 package of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s432">And later he did, when he went outside, I remember a year later I met him in Germany, in Frankfort.</span> <span id="s433">He was with a very rich man, this particular man, was very talented, very, he helped me a lot too.</span> <span id="s434">So and a lot of people started this way their fortune, their fortune, fortune, fortune.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So how long did you work in that shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: I work in the shop for awhile and _________________ but my future.</span> <span id="s437">And I told him, "Mr. So and so, I'm leaving you."</span> <span id="s438">"Don't leave.</span> <span id="s439">Work for me, don't do like all them other Jews, just be the same," _________________ Kulikoffska(ph) used to say, "Work for me and later I will give you a paper, you will have the, the, you finish the exams and you will be, you will have a trade" and so on and so on, "like me."</span> <span id="s440">And have a little garage which was maybe four feet by four, four yards by four yards, a small, anyway.</span> <span id="s441">I thought, I don't like a life like this and told him now I'm leaving.</span> <span id="s442">"Oh, Tom, I must tell you, I never had such a worker like you."</span> <span id="s443">And so on, "You mustn't be Jewish probably, " he said.</span> <span id="s444">"Yes, I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s445">So, did you have many Jewish workers?"</span> <span id="s446">He said, "No," "So how do, how could you compare that I'm not like another Jews?"</span> <span id="s447">Good, said good bye and left.</span> <span id="s448">What did I do later?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Oh, my question was, did people still, was there still people who hated Jews in the village, in the town __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Did they still?</span> <span id="s451">In my Itsbeetsa(ph)?</span> <span id="s452">Why did I escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And then in the next town?</span> <span id="s454">__________ you could be...</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I was with ________________ Jews and we had power, I mean, but they hated, a lot of them, it's a Catholic country.</span> <span id="s456">Jews, the Jews are Christ killers.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: So even though it was free...</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: How could they not hate Jews when they go to the church Sunday and there's a mass and they're, and they're, mass and the priest is telling him the story about Jesus going to the ten stations and how the Jews they cheat him and so on and come out on the church, not be anti-Semites?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So it was still hard?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: So then you decided to leave this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No, I was __________ but, for awhile, looking what should do and later I remember the moment Warsaw was liberated, I went to Warsaw, ruins.</span> <span id="s463">I remember from that time, that I, I grasped the freedom, the way I could, just to convince myself I am free.</span> <span id="s464">I remember I had a habit and we were joking with my fellow survivors always, even a few years ago he was here from Brazil, Shlumer(ph) Schmizner(ph), survivor of Sobibor and he was joking, "Tom, " he said, "I used to ride with, work with you in the street of Lublin and there's a truck stopping, a military truck, and you see a military, a truck, you was, you went crazy, you just went straight to the driver asking, where are you going?</span> <span id="s465">To Posenun(ph).</span> <span id="s466">Will you take me?</span> <span id="s467">And you used to leave me in the street," he said, "jump on the truck and go."</span> <span id="s468">And I remember it was.</span> <span id="s469">I used to travel.</span> <span id="s470">I didn't care where and for what.</span> <span id="s471">Train, no space in the train, I traveled on top of the, of the roof, of the wagons holding on to the edges.</span> <span id="s472">And come to a city of, another city, I was wandering around and later I took a train or bus back.</span> <span id="s473">It was some, it was crazy, if I look now from the distance of the years, it was not normal, always traveling.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Why, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: I think confirmation of freedom, I could move.</span> <span id="s476">I remember the, the months in Sobibor, on this half a, quarter square mile is all, being like in a cage, had some effect and now I could move.</span> <span id="s477">And really we'd have __________ sometime will study the tape, maybe he will come up with something.</span> <span id="s478">__________, with that money.</span> <span id="s479">What should we do?</span> <span id="s480">I met, __________ and other survivors and one of them was ________________ Schmizner(ph), later another one, Silva(ph) was his name and later another one, his name was Felleck(ph), forgot his true name.</span> <span id="s481">And we talked to each other and I told to Schmizner(ph), Shloma(ph), who escaped with me from Sobibor, I tell him Shloma(ph) listen, tell them the story, I was sitting with another two boys from Sobibor in a farmer's place, the other two are not alive, I escape with a bullet, he has all our money, you must arrest him, you must get him too, because of killing.</span> <span id="s482">It was very dangerous to go there.</span> <span id="s483">I was aware that a farmer is in the village still.</span> <span id="s484">Why have I got to tell you this?</span> <span id="s485">Once I did go to, of course I didn't have shoes.</span> <span id="s486">The farmer once took our shoes away when we were in the hiding, the farmer who used to hide us, Bullyafski(ph) is his name, in the village.</span> <span id="s487">So I remember that he has our shoes, so I went to Itsbeetsa(ph) back from Lublin, find a little boy, I was afraid to go to the village of ________________, so I find a little boy, give him a few zlotas(ph), Polish money, with a note to go to Bullyafski(ph) and tell him he should bring me shoes, boots, to the forest and I will be waiting here and here and here and here.</span> <span id="s488">And he left and after about an hour the farmer arrived, in the forest, near a special called Malinia's(ph) building.</span> <span id="s489">He did bring me the boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: The same farmer?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s492">I took the boots.</span> <span id="s493">He left his way, I left my way.</span> <span id="s494">Now when I think about this, I can't believe it, that I was so stupid.</span> <span id="s495">Hey, he could kill me and the boys who used to wander after me when I escaped to Lublin, he could call them and he could kill me, what did I do?</span> <span id="s496">But now when I'm thinking about this, I realize probably he didn't think I'm so stupid the time, coming alone.</span> <span id="s497">He thought maybe I told the police that I'm going and if I don't come back it's his fault.</span> <span id="s498">Maybe I have some friends nearby watching me.</span> <span id="s499">I was alone, if he would kill me, nobody would know, I tell you.</span> <span id="s500">I still can't forgive myself how stupid I was, but it's the way it was.</span> <span id="s501">So I was aware that the farmer did not escape, he's in the village.</span> <span id="s502">So now in Lublin I told them, "Listen, he's over there, he's not punished, what could we do about this?"</span> <span id="s503">So, Felleck(ph) had connections to the Russian soldiers, officers.</span> <span id="s504">He told the Russian captain the story and one day we took a truck with soldiers and went to arrest this farmer.</span> <span id="s505">We arrived early in the morning in Itsbeetsa(ph), drived up to the village.</span> <span id="s506">The dogs start to bark, we come to this village, to this, to this farm and there his wife is, his daughter and we ask, "Where's the farmer?</span> <span id="s507">Where's Mr. Bullyafski(ph)?"</span> <span id="s508">"Oh, he left for Zamush."</span> <span id="s509">I really don't believe he left, he was hiding someplace, we did search ________________ to find him.</span> <span id="s510">And we would find him, we wouldn't take him to court, we would have shot him right on the spot.</span> <span id="s511">But, you see, with Bullyafski(ph) it was like that with all the farms, they had good dogs.</span> <span id="s512">And when we were walking to him, the dogs already barked and he had time to escape to the field on another side and nobody would find him.</span> <span id="s513">We're over there, Stanislaf(ph) said, "Okay, if he is not here, we kill your daughter."</span> <span id="s514">And he took this girl behind the barn with the rifle.</span> <span id="s515">As a matter of fact you could read this in this book, Escape from Sobibor, Rachel, did you read this book?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Rachel ________________ described this.</span> <span id="s518">So I was standing with him and told him, "Shloma, don't kill this girl, she is innocent."</span> <span id="s519">She was my age.</span> <span id="s520">"No, they killed those who were innocent, too."</span> <span id="s521">And while he was pointing, I heard the, the rifle and he missed her, he didn't, I didn't let him shot any more.</span> <span id="s522">We going back and wait for the farmer.</span> <span id="s523">She said, "He is in Zamush(ph), we are waiting, he will come back."</span> <span id="s524">But in that time was still, even we had soldiers, it was still dangerous to be in the little villages too long.</span> <span id="s525">"So, where do you have the money?"</span> <span id="s526">"Oh, we don't have any money." "</span> <span id="s527">_______________ the money?"</span> <span id="s528">And finally, probably she was, I don't know, afraid that we will wait maybe longer, "I don't know," she did come, she did go to a, we did go to a, she took us to the yard and there was a bunch of stones, a heap of stones laying.</span> <span id="s529">She moved away the stones, picked up a big pot with gold, with __________, with watches and diamonds.</span> <span id="s530">And he said, "Okay, this is it" and he took it.</span> <span id="s531">And the Russians took it...</span></p> <p><span id="s532">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: And so we were talking about when you went back to the farmer's house and you had the Russian soldiers with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Is that, yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s538">So we take the money, we divide it, we left for Lublin.</span> <span id="s539">At that point, I had some money and, but it disappeared very fast.</span> <span id="s540">I don't know, __________ other people do some business and this and I remember that, had another complex, from Sobibor left, that money doesn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s541">Because I've seen people in Sobibor come in with a lot of money, gold, diamonds and they went to their deaths.</span> <span id="s542">So I thought money, what is money?</span> <span id="s543">Now I think a little bit different, but this was my philosophy and I spend it and was again very shortly without a penny.</span> <span id="s544">So what did I do, really, what did I do?</span> <span id="s545">So when the Russians advanced to Warsaw, Posenun(ph), Shilezia(ph), went into Germany, I did, I traveled to Shilezia(ph) and there are a lot of stores, which were completely open right after the __________ went in and I've seen a bicycle shop, so I went in and they called them, the people like me in that time, was a special name, Shabrovnik(ph) they called them.</span> <span id="s546">People who went to, to the west and picked up stuff like that, whatever they could and bring back to central Poland and sold.</span> <span id="s547">I was on big scale, here, Stanislaf(ph), he was bigger scale, he did pick up pianos, high quality pianos and took him to central Poland.</span> <span id="s548">I went to, I've seen a bicycle shop, it was open, I went in and took some little parts, brought them back to central Poland, make a few pennies, less pennies, really.</span> <span id="s549">But one of my trips to Shilezia(ph), I met a group of people, Polish people.</span> <span id="s550">So, well maybe ______________________ was the first Poles, you know, over there in the city, so we kept together.</span> <span id="s551">They didn't know who I am, I know who they are, but they had weapons.</span> <span id="s552">Oh, to make a long story short, I find out it is a special group going after the, after some territory that's liberated, to look for Nazis for criminals.</span> <span id="s553">So I attached myself and pretty soon I was official member of the group and I worked with them until the end of '45.</span> <span id="s554">The end of '45, I went and had a conflict with a member of this group and I left them.</span> <span id="s555">Went to the city of Strachin(ph), I had a Polish officer uniform, but over this I had a civilian coat, went to Strachin(ph), trying to escape to east, to Germany.</span> <span id="s556">In that time was no east or west, was Germany divided in three, in three zones, I think it was, called Threezonia(ph).</span> <span id="s557">And finally, I don't want, I could say the details, but this would take too long, I find my way to Berlin.</span> <span id="s558">So, as a certain, beginning of December, I was forced to leave this group, deserted them, with the intention to escape to west Germany, right in the city of Strachin(ph) over there, I met a Polish soldier, who was arranging the transportation of, the illegal transportation of people to Germany, to the west.</span> <span id="s559">Was the Jewish sergeant, cost about 2,000 __________ zlotas(ph), I contacted him.</span> <span id="s560">I asked Jewish people how could they go __________ and they told me, here on this corner, it'll be the sergeant, you see and talk to him.</span> <span id="s561">I didn't have the money to pay for the trip.</span> <span id="s562">He said, "It will cost about 2,500 zlotas(ph).</span> <span id="s563">So he said, "You know what, you don't have the money, go and look for me for people.</span> <span id="s564">Cost 2,500 zlotas(ph), you find five, you go free."</span> <span id="s565">So I find him 10 and charge more than 2,500 but the extras I took.</span> <span id="s566">So I had someone already, and he said, "Okay, in that case, maybe you would like to work with me."</span> <span id="s567">So I said, "We will see."</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: But you were still a very young man then?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: But beginning to learn business?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: No, I didn't care about business at this point, I think had to run away and I never intended to work with him.</span> <span id="s572">But cause I was in danger, if he would caught me escaping from such a military outfit, because it was a secret outfit, very exclusive, of the Polish army, interrogating, looking for the Nazis, I would go into the firing squad in that time, the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s573">Now?</span> <span id="s574">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: This was after?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: May, yeah, this was after, was after __________.</span> <span id="s577">But you know, after the war was still, it wasn't clear, it was still early, the war finished May and it was __________________, it was after the war but still it was, like _________________ I'm setting.</span> <span id="s578">There were no codes of law, later when it settled, but so I was in danger, I never intended to go back, but he thought that because I was so good I will come back and do _______________ with him together.</span> <span id="s579">It wasn't difficult because you meet, he was in the area where people congregated which want to go to, go to the west and but certain areas of people like that were waiting, you ask and listen, would you to the, would you like, you like to go to the west?</span> <span id="s580">Yeah.</span> <span id="s581">Cost you $3000 zlotas(ph).</span> <span id="s582">And if he said okay, so I told him, "You go to the Hotel Griff(ph)," this hotel is still over there in Strachin(ph).</span> <span id="s583">"Go to the Hotel Griff(ph) and go to the manager and tell him that you want to travel to Posenun(ph) and he will give you a place to stay until the group will be assembled and we will go to Germany."</span> <span id="s584">And so it was with me.</span> <span id="s585">And finally the sergeant told me, "Tom, this night __________ tug will arrive, and prepare the group."</span> <span id="s586">I was in this hotel, two o'clock a truck arrived, we all went out, went to the truck and didn't take long.</span> <span id="s587">_______________ from Strachin(ph) to Berlin, a couple hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: So people, a lot of people would say, why go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Why?</span> <span id="s590">Mostly Jewish people.</span> <span id="s591">First of all I didn't want to go to Israel, we want to escape the Communists, that's all.</span> <span id="s592">Most of the Jewish people didn't want to be in Poland, was a lot of hate and so this way they crossed.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And so what was, what was there that was ________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: No, when I arrived in Berlin, I've done a mistake, when I was, when I arrived in Berlin, was there a little place called Bernau(ph), suburb of Berlin, _______________ and I made a mistake, instead to go with the whole group, we would go, we went to a under organization, a refugee organization and they take care of them, food and everything else, I went by myself.</span> <span id="s595">I always, I actual, up til now, I hate to go in organized groups, always, I'm individualistic.</span> <span id="s596">I went by myself, not realizing that in that time in Berlin, there are no restaurants, everything is by food stamps and so on, so on.</span> <span id="s597">So I was walking around, hungry, without a place to stay, look __________ into a restaurant and I've seen two Russian soldiers and, and two German girls.</span> <span id="s598">And soldiers ________________ only one seat left __________, I sit over there.</span> <span id="s599">One thing you could order without money was beer, so I ordered beer and later we talk with the Russians and I told the blonde girl that maybe she know where I could, a place to stay.</span> <span id="s600">She said yes she knows, a friend of hers.</span> <span id="s601">So when they left, she took me, she knocked on the door, on the window, to her friends house and she said, "Here's a gentleman that maybe you could keep him overnight."</span> <span id="s602">And they let me in, I slept.</span> <span id="s603">The next day, unexpectedly the same girl did come back and ask me if I slept good and something and she did help me with food.</span> <span id="s604">She was aware of some restaurants where you could eat without food, only soup.</span> <span id="s605">So anyway, to make a long story short, I was with her for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s606">But later, a jealous, her boyfriend, the Russian officer arrested me, put me in jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: For what?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Just like that.</span> <span id="s609">Because, put me in jail.</span> <span id="s610">I don't go any in details the way I went, he put me in jail.</span> <span id="s611">He was a higher officer, I missed a lot because the telling the tales will take ages.</span> <span id="s612">But anyway he put me in jail and finally while in jail, I've seen I could be over there months, because I wasn't registered, they just threw me in the cell.</span> <span id="s613">So once when we did walk, once a day we did walk, I've seen a Russian officer and I recognize, say he must be Jewish and I stepped out from the walking pattern and told him, "Listen I'm sitting here so long and I'm Jewish and I know it."</span> <span id="s614">So finally I was taken to the interrogation and they let me out immediately.</span> <span id="s615">So and I thought I should better leave Berlin.</span> <span id="s616">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Now, but there were many other Jews in Berlin then?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah, yeah, but I was working alone, I didn't, I was in the organized camps and so I didn't like it, it remind me too much of a concentration camps, living together, ______________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And you didn't know other people, have friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: No, but I met another German, another German, who was smuggling people from east Germany, from the Russian sector, to the west Germany.</span> <span id="s621">Because in that time was, Germany was divided to the Russian sector and the rest was called Threezonia(ph), three zones.</span> <span id="s622">The Russian zone, I'm sorry, the French zone, English and American zone.</span> <span id="s623">So __________ he was a smuggler who smuggled people from the Russian zone to Threezonia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay, so we just finished about you talking about you met someone who would take you to Threezonia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s626">So this person agreed to take me, but again I didn't have money.</span> <span id="s627">I always operated on a very low level of currency.</span> <span id="s628">And so I find some, another few people who want to go with me, the same thing, I repeated the whole, the story as before.</span> <span id="s629">But this time we took a train to the border, to a border village, which he did know and we single, but we're waiting until the, the, the border guard will go for lunch.</span> <span id="s630">It wasn't for some reason, they didn't change.</span> <span id="s631">One guard arrived, another one left.</span> <span id="s632">It was, looks to me, one set of soldiers and they took off at a certain hour for lunch and nobody was guarding the border.</span> <span id="s633">He was aware of it and he told me that this is, this is this way in this particular point.</span> <span id="s634">I don't know, maybe the way I paid some money, when we arrived on the border, there was a fence, we simply pulled up the barbed wires and we slid underneath and we were on another side.</span> <span id="s635">When we're on another side, was about seven people and you stopped American soldier and he took us to a special camp.</span> <span id="s636">To my surprise, it was a camp of former Anised(ph) members from Poland.</span> <span id="s637">Anised(ph) was a very, very right wing group of underground partisans in Poland in time of the war.</span> <span id="s638">Killed Jews on the spot, very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s639">The worst guy you could meet, a Jew could meet.</span> <span id="s640">And of course when the Russians liberated the Polish towns, they escaped to the west.</span> <span id="s641">And this was their _______________, people which, as I said, killed Jews in the hundreds, thousands.</span> <span id="s642">But it was the only camp where we could stay for awhile so they put us over there and I've seen the people and they were aware that we are Jews and I could see they hate, but we were standing over there for a couple days.</span> <span id="s643">They called us names.</span> <span id="s644">And later, they let us go, the Americans and I went to, where did I go.</span> <span id="s645">Ah, I had a name of a friend, Travinski(ph), he was, his story, he was Jewish, he was in his 50's.</span> <span id="s646">In the time of the war, he was a head, a leader of a partisan unit, Akar(ph), which I mentioned before, AK.</span> <span id="s647">A nationalistic unit, nobody'd know he's Jewish.</span> <span id="s648">The Communists arrested the leading figures of the Akar(ph), they arrested him too.</span> <span id="s649">He could go out from this prison if he would only say he's Jewish but he didn't want to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s652">So he was in prison and I find out about this when I was working in this special unit and I arranged his freedom and they let him go.</span> <span id="s653">Later I, how does, __________, I don't know, how come he was in Germany, in a village called Urgelsbak(ph).</span> <span id="s654">So I thought, I helped him then, maybe he will help me now.</span> <span id="s655">And of course I went to this village and he was a very rich fellow at that time and he built over there a old factory and a bus line to Munich.</span> <span id="s656">So he was very active and I was with him for awhile.</span> <span id="s657">Later I left for ________________ near Ginsburg(ph), near Stuttgart(ph), ________________ and I was in the ________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: So when you said you went to this man and you said you were with him, before you said you were too shy to ask another man to take care of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yeah, yeah, but this, I didn't ask him to take care of me.</span> <span id="s660">He owed me a favor and I had come and this was already later a little bit, I did grow a little bit.</span> <span id="s661">And a simple, I didn't even and I didn't ask him, I just did come and say, "Hello, how are you?"</span> <span id="s662">And he, __________ did live in a villa, he offered me immediately.</span> <span id="s663">Maybe if he wouldn't offered me I would go farther.</span> <span id="s664">But he offered ________________.</span> <span id="s665">Later we did went in that conflict and I was forced to leave him because he wasn't too faithful and I did know all his escapades and his wife was nudging me, "Where did he go, what did he do?"</span> <span id="s666">And I was forced to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: You didn't want to get involved in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I told his family he was hungry anyway, I left and I went to the ________________ camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: How did, did you want to go there or that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No, again, I didn't have money, I was hungry and over there a bed was waiting for me, a room, food, exactly in time, ________________ good food, candies and even cigarettes.</span> <span id="s671">So I went over there.</span> <span id="s672">I still didn't live there, I, the first weeks, yeah, but later I took my cigarette rations and I went into a city called Ragensburg(ph) and cigarettes were very sparsely so for a package of cigarettes, another way to say, I rent a room in a German's place and pay them with cigarettes.</span> <span id="s673">So I was independent, in a way.</span> <span id="s674">And only every week or so I did, go back to this, the __________ camp to collect my food and cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: And why did they give you food and cigarettes if you weren't staying there?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: They didn't know I'm not staying there.</span> <span id="s677">Only while ______________________ a refugee, which I was a refugee, but you see, I didn't want to live with a group of people, I want to live with myself, that's all, ________________.</span> <span id="s678">So, but I was a refugee, was entitled to it.</span> <span id="s679">Now we come to a second period.</span> <span id="s680">When I left Poland, I was in love with a Polish girl and I left unexpectedly, she finded out where I am in Germany and she did come to Germany, she had my address in this private house and we did get together and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s681">Had a cousin in New York who arranged papers for me, but now she is and she did get pregnant and she didn't get the papers.</span> <span id="s682">So for me was either leave her and go to America or stay with her.</span> <span id="s683">And she want to go back to Poland, she's pregnant, she want to go back to her mother, she can't go to America, so I don't know what to do and finally decide to go back with her, which was very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Where in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Opolly(ph), city of Opolly(ph).</span> <span id="s686">Changed my name, told the police that I lost my papers and they give me new papers on a different name.</span> <span id="s687">Under this name, Polish name, under this name I registered with the Polish repatriation mission, was a special mission.</span> <span id="s688">And soon, in '47, we left for Poland.</span> <span id="s689">In Poland we married, she had a baby, which lives now in Poland with my two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s690">And but I was discovered, by accident.</span> <span id="s691">A guy who did know me, who vowed earlier to get, he discovered me, but luckily he allowed himself to be bribed and I did bribe him with some stuff, I had a little store in that time and nylons were in prize and I had the nylons.</span> <span id="s692">He did come in once in awhile to the store, Tom I need for my wife, this or that.</span> <span id="s693">So he let himself be bribed.</span> <span id="s694">But in 1947, July 22nd, a big Polish holiday, the Polish government announced amnesty for all the criminals, political or whatever, so I heard about this, took off, took a train, went to the city, where I committed this terrible crime, escaping, deserting.</span> <span id="s695">And I said, "Here I am."</span> <span id="s696">All I remember was standing in the line with partisans, Anised partisans, we did come out from the forest.</span> <span id="s697">Up til now they fought.</span> <span id="s698">From the forest they come as ______________, now they did, was amnesty, could go out from the forest, give your weapons and you're free men.</span> <span id="s699">Or whoever is in, has some problems with the law.</span> <span id="s700">And finally mine turn did come, I signed papers, did get a nice package of food for __________ and I was no more afraid.</span> <span id="s701">And this Pole, for some reason didn't know of and the next time did come, ask for some stuff for his wife, I told him, I don't have it.</span> <span id="s702">"What?</span> <span id="s703">You know what this means?"</span> <span id="s704">"It doesn't mean any more for me, it means now for you, because I could put you now in jail, you know."</span> <span id="s705">So he keeped quiet and everything was okay.</span> <span id="s706">Later we divorced and I went to study in Strachin(ph), I went to study medicine, I went to the preparation school for medicine.</span> <span id="s707">Over there I went in some trouble and I quit the school and went to work in a resort place.</span> <span id="s708">Here in America would call it social director.</span> <span id="s709">Mine job was to take people to different historical places, castles.</span> <span id="s710">In wintertime teach them skiing in the mountains near the Czechoslovakian border.</span> <span id="s711">And I worked over there until 1957 when I, __________ did come to power in Poland.</span> <span id="s712">This was a person who was very anti-Semitic, but he did allow the Jews to emigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s713">And I took my chance and left for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: So before we get too far, let's go back.</span> <span id="s715">The girl that you fell in love with in Poland, Jewish, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Was that a big deal for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I didn't want Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s721">There's another complex I had.</span> <span id="s722">A Jew girl, a Jewish girl was for me something holy, you don't touch her.</span> <span id="s723">I mean was something which, was my mother.</span> <span id="s724">So I had a complex.</span> <span id="s725">I want a blonde Polish girl, Christian girl, I don't care.</span> <span id="s726">Blonde, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s727">It was, it wasn't normal, I wasn't normal, it was a complex which had grown me.</span> <span id="s728">This exactly what the Germans said is their, is their example of a perfect human, I wanted.</span> <span id="s729">So it's a good case, as I said, for a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s730">So I had exactly a Polish girl, blue eyes, blonde and so on, so on, so on, so on, short nose, upside down.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Because some people want, wanted, especially after the war, only to be, only with Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: A Jewish girl was, I felt for her so much respect and something, I ________________, it wasn't so with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: And what about her family, did her family know you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s735">She has a brother and her mother.</span> <span id="s736">Actually they liked me, her mother you know, liked me very much and she was 18, her mother was I think 35, something, 35.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: At that point I was 18 I think, 18 yeah, or 19, I can't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So that was a big decision, to not go and to go back with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yeah, I loved her, it was true love.</span> <span id="s741">But later we divorced.</span> <span id="s742">And as you said, I left for Israel.</span> <span id="s743">In Israel I met American tourist, we married and she brought me here, to America.</span> <span id="s744">In 1960, I was in America, my son was born.</span> <span id="s745">I worked as a janitor in a hospital, my wife worked as a laboratory technician, I worked as a janitor.</span> <span id="s746">Learned the language, started to work in a factory as a punch press operator.</span> <span id="s747">Later I worked in a factory producing car stereos in Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s748">And later I went in to my own business, opened a store, electronics store, car stereo store in California, first in Oxnard, six months later in Ventura, six months later Santa Barbara and all were very successful and my intention was to go til the end, to San Francisco, on the coast and open stores in every little, small town in the coastline, but when I come to Santa Barbara I realized that I need to have more money to have the control of all the stores, so I stopped with the three stores and later, it was always in my mind to finish my books, my story, to make a documentary, to do a few things about Sobibor.</span> <span id="s749">So I sold one story, later another one.</span> <span id="s750">And 10 years ago I sold a third one, __________.</span> <span id="s751">At that point I said, "Now I have time to do whatever I want to do."</span> <span id="s752">And what did I do?</span> <span id="s753">I set out to prove to people in America, __________ people, what's happened in Sobibor, that a place, which was, which has taken place, the only successful revolt of any camp under Nazi domination, nobody knows about Sobibor, is over grown and the history of Sobibor's changed.</span> <span id="s754">There's a big sign that here were killed 250,000 Russians, Poles, Jews, which is not true at all.</span> <span id="s755">And I set out at the time I must change it.</span> <span id="s756">And for close to 40 years I worked, it was very hard to change.</span> <span id="s757">I went even so far, I went to the Pope and not only this, they build a church over there in Sobibor, with a big carving, lifesize carving of a priest being behind the barbed wires of Sobibor, and what kind priest?</span> <span id="s758">Kolber(ph), very well known anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s759">Anyway, so, and I find out that in the sermons, which they hold in the church, they talk about the victims, the Christian victims of Sobibor and collect money.</span> <span id="s760">And this really, to say it bluntly, pissed me off, you could have it recorded this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: But you're going too fast for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: So this... [End of Side 1, Tape 2] So you had talked before about, when we first started about how you were very, you got very hardened and a lot of people would see that as not being able to open up, but yet you told me a story about deciding to go back to Poland because you loved this woman so much.</span> <span id="s764">Now a lot of people would not, who had lost their whole family, would be afraid to love that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: I don't agree, because it's not up to you, you can't calculate you love, nor you can love because this or that, it varies from the individual.</span> <span id="s766">If you love really, you don't calculate, it's happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: So you recognized that you had emotions?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: It was natural, of course I had emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Now when you then got married and started your family, did all this time, did you think about your family that you had lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: You didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: You couldn't?</span> <span id="s774">Some people wouldn't be able to think or you did in part, intentionally didn't think about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: It's lost, what could you think about, is tell me?</span> <span id="s776">Over and over, is lost and lost and lost, lost, you go kill yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: So you knew to move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Yeah, of course, yeah.</span> <span id="s779">I think now more than I used to think then.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: You're older, you have your own family and kids and you think sometimes what did your mother feel when they took the kids away.</span> <span id="s782">What, how did she feel when your kid went to the gas chamber?</span> <span id="s783">You could understand more your parents than used to be.</span> <span id="s784">You're in their situation and you have time to reflect and you get older, you do reflect.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: So when you had your first child there, did you and my parents always told me we name the first child after a family member, did you do that, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yeah, after my father, but I didn't let them circumcise.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Why?</span> <span id="s791">Because when I, the first time, in 1940, to the end, did try to escape from the ghetto, save myself with Polish papers, the problem _________________ was circumcision and I remember my mother saying, why do we need this, how many Jews would be saved if not this?</span> <span id="s792">And I described this in my book, in my testimony from before and I promised myself, even that time, when I survive and have a boy, I will not circumcise and although all my family, from my wife's side, of course, insisted, I said, no.</span> <span id="s793">I'll leave it the way I want to.</span> <span id="s794">He wasn't circumcised.</span> <span id="s795">Well what's happened, after seven years, when he did try to go to the school, when he went to the school, he said, "Daddy, I'm different, I don't want to, kid's laugh at me, Dad, Dad."</span> <span id="s796">So he asked me to be circumcised and when finally I did give in, because he asked me, he was so happy, he did go to Methodist hospital like the sanitarium, so now he's circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So were, I imagine you were afraid that that would be a way to identify?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Yeah, why do people need to be marked, for some religious reason?</span> <span id="s799">Somebody, ________________ set up a precedence?</span> <span id="s800">Nature builds this way and this way is probably the best way.</span> <span id="s801">Nature's know best.</span> <span id="s802">Mother Nature know best.</span> <span id="s803">Anyway, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: So that was a mark that Jews could be?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Identify, yes.</span> <span id="s806">Not, you see, not in America.</span> <span id="s807">America is too many circumcised, but in a country like Poland or you know, in Eastern Europe, is the only identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Were there other things like that that you felt very strongly about?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: No.</span> <span id="s810">I felt that I can be religious, very much so.</span> <span id="s811">I was a boy, when I was a kid, when I dropped a book, ______________, Jews picked it up and kissed it, they were, a custom is you drop a book, you pick it up and kiss it.</span> <span id="s812">I never was able to say a vote against religion or against God.</span> <span id="s813">I did become completely different.</span> <span id="s814">It was a problem to be a believer or not.</span> <span id="s815">You can't just take something from one side.</span> <span id="s816">This was, few days ago was a, a plane dropped __________ fell apart, people killed 200, with one lady I heard on television said, "Oh, thank God that I intended to go with this plane, but I changed my mind.</span> <span id="s817">God say thank, God helped me."</span> <span id="s818">Very nice, what about the 200 people He, God didn't help?</span> <span id="s819">Same thing what was then.</span> <span id="s820">If I would believe in God, would still be a believer, I must also believe in the same God who witnesses killing of little children.</span> <span id="s821">Couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s822">Couldn't look on the one side, was the same God.</span> <span id="s823">So I must believe in a really terrible God and so I choiced to be an unbeliever.</span> <span id="s824">I like the tradition.</span> <span id="s825">I maybe a stronger Jew than many Orthodox Jews are, although I don't follow the ritual, but I know I am Jewish and, and always be.</span> <span id="s826">As a matter of fact when I married this Polish Christian girl, she wanted to convert and I was thinking about this and I was thinking, I'm a non-believer anyway, if it makes somebody happy, why not?</span> <span id="s827">For me would be like changing my shirt.</span> <span id="s828">Make happy.</span> <span id="s829">But on the other hand I thought no, I survived.</span> <span id="s830">But if I would go now away from Judaism, I would be, Hitler would have another victim, would be a spiritual victim.</span> <span id="s831">And now I'm Jewish and my children are brought up, maybe not I mean Orthodox or whatever, but strongly Jewish.</span> <span id="s832">So, that what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: So, did you, were you 13 already when the war started __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: 12.</span> <span id="s836">So, I remember in your interview you talked about, was it your aunt saying when you would be Bar Mitzvahed at 13, God would forgive you for eating pork?</span> <span id="s837">So by the time the war was over, had you decided it was a, God was a terrible God?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: God is a terrible God, I mean, I, you know.</span> <span id="s839">You can't live in a twilight.</span> <span id="s840">The signs and everything is contradictory to the dogma of the religion.</span> <span id="s841">I mean, ________________ revolution and in other aspects of our, of the world and you realize that, Bible, everything else, is simply a story.</span> <span id="s842">Stories people keep up because of the parents and grandparents and the tradition they did grow.</span> <span id="s843">And ________________ Jewish tradition as I remember, is very spiritual, spiritual and very nice.</span> <span id="s844">I know, I did live as a Jew and I'd live as a Christian and the Christian society have, the Sunday go to church, otherwise you live your own day, but the Jews have Friday, every Saturday was spiritual and a feeling, completely different feeling.</span> <span id="s845">And so, people likes it, like this and it keeps up the tradition, but otherwise I, I'm not a follower of Judaism.</span> <span id="s846">I come to America and I hear the Reform Temples and Conservative.</span> <span id="s847">If I ever need to choose between them, I would go to the Orthodox.</span> <span id="s848">This is, beside I remember this from our home, this is another one I consider clubs, like a city, this is some kind, trying to hold back the Jewish people which otherwise would maybe drifted to another side.</span> <span id="s849">So it's a midway, but it's the true Jews I think __________ and the Orthodox are keeping up the Jewish continuity, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: So, if we look back we would say you were brought up with what we would call now, the Orthodox Jewish culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: But yet, by the time the war was over and you met this, you married this Polish woman, you were not, did you not consider yourself Jewish or you did by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Oh, I consider myself always Jewish.</span> <span id="s854">I'll go from the 1947 until '57, nobody in Poland was aware I'm Jewish except my wife.</span> <span id="s855">I was under a different name and very seldom, if I had told them, if I told them I'm Jewish they were aware, otherwise they weren't.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: So the period that you were in Poland and had this family and were living a different life...</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: A lot of Jewish people were going from the camps and were going to the United States and to other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: Did you ever think you wanted to be part of that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: No, I did try until I met this woman and this changed my mind, I went to Poland and later I did want to go from Poland, but it was impossible already.</span> <span id="s862">Until the first chance I had in 1957, which I took and left.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: And that's when you went, so let's go back to that, you went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: Israel.</span> <span id="s866">To be a Jewish person in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: As a Jew, I went to Israel.</span> <span id="s868">And over there I went to a friend of mine in a moushaff(ph).</span> <span id="s869">In the beginning he arranged for me a job, I was driving a Caterpillar on the fields, turn over the soil.</span> <span id="s870">And later I met this American girl.</span> <span id="s871">American, she took me to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: So when you went to Israel you were already divorced?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Your son, did you have just that one son?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: I didn't have, I had only a girl with this Polish, with my Polish wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Oh, so, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: And then my first son was born in America in 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s879">So even in 1960, no circumcision, you didn't like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Okay, so you were already divorced, you went to Israel and did your feelings for being part of the Jewish culture and the Jewish religion become stronger then?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: I felt __________ like in home, a completely different feeling to being in Poland.</span> <span id="s883">It was overwhelmed, it was some kind of inner freedom, immediately, on the spot.</span> <span id="s884">And I felt good except the heat.</span> <span id="s885">I, people they ask me many times, why did you leave Israel and I hesitate to tell the true, because true is because was hot.</span> <span id="s886">Because they, they, they would think that is, oh a nice excuse, but the truth is, I can't stand the heat.</span> <span id="s887">If I would live in Israel, I would die a long time ago.</span> <span id="s888">I, even now I'm perspiring and it's not hot at all here, we have air conditioning.</span> <span id="s889">It's physical, I have something which is, can't stomach.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Now did you go to Israel because you felt that desire to be in the Jewish homeland?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: First of all, it was the only way to go out.</span> <span id="s892">This probably was the main reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: So if you could have gone...</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: If it be a nice climate in Israel, it wouldn't be hot, I would stay there, definitely.</span> <span id="s895">All my friends were there and, but I always thought to get out from over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: You said the only way to get out of Poland, the only way out was to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Israel, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Where else, if you had been able to go someplace else?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I don't know what I would do, I don't know.</span> <span id="s900">I don't know, I heard so much about America, maybe I would go to America.</span> <span id="s901">But I always thought about Israel, I remember actually in the ghetto, I was arguing with a friend of mine about Jews living in Europe, in strange countries and I said, "Strulek(ph), if we will survive, if Jews will survive, __________________ you should go to Palestine, that time was Palestine and build a country because you will always be guests any place else."</span> <span id="s902">On top of it, I remember the _________________ like a childish comparison, but nevertheless I will tell you this, I tell them, "Take a look.</span> <span id="s903">If you, if a friend of you, of you, would take into your home, give you a little room and you're smarter than him and after awhile you buy his table and you buy his dishes and finally he feels that you have it better than him.</span> <span id="s904">He would be angry and he wouldn't like you, the same thing is with Jews in Poland," I told him.</span> <span id="s905">We're able, willing, talented and we live better than most of the Poles.</span> <span id="s906">Not all of them, there were a lot in little towns, very poor Jews, but it'd look like the Jews are for some way living better than the peasant in the villages.</span> <span id="s907">So there's a lot of jealousy and there always will be trouble.</span> <span id="s908">There will be too many of us, will be trouble in any country.</span> <span id="s909">Anyway, so and finally he wind out, who was against it, wind out in Israel and I wind out in America.</span> <span id="s910">Now he lives there.</span> <span id="s911">Anyway, so after the war I went to him in Israel and he did give me the shop and to make it short, I met my wife, we married in Israel and left for America.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: And you went to America because she had a life here?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yeah, she had a job here, she ________________ a vacation from this job.</span> <span id="s914">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: And that was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yeah, in that time was okay, you know, you, you, you, you're not, you're, you're, you don't stay in one place.</span> <span id="s919">You move on, you change your opinions.</span> <span id="s920">__________, you could be a Communist and later you see there's something, you could be a, a Nationalist.</span> <span id="s921">People, I think people which change their religion, I'm sorry, their opinion are people which think.</span> <span id="s922">They find out this is wrong.</span> <span id="s923">They grow, people grow and when they grow, they understand more.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: So you recognize growth and change in yourself a lot over these years.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Oh yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Now some people, I'm sure you've talked with a lot of other Holocaust survivors, a lot of them have not changed, cannot grow, cannot move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: You see, when I opened my first store in Santa Barbara, in Ventura, I liked, I liked very much Jewish music.</span> <span id="s928">And always I had a Jewish tape with Jewish songs.</span> <span id="s929">Later I sold the store, I sold the store to another Jewish survivor.</span> <span id="s930">When he did come to visit my store, always had Jewish music and I didn't care who was over there, I had Jewish music.</span> <span id="s931">When I had come to his store and put in a Jewish tape, "Oh listen David, listen to this tape," he did look ascared, he looked around, I said, "David, it's over.</span> <span id="s932">If I must hide here again, why did I come to America?"</span> <span id="s933">He still has the complex.</span> <span id="s934">I rather did try to demonstrate, that time, Jew and so on and so on, so on, so on and...</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: So in the, I don't think it was the transcript but in one of the articles they sent me they talked about how you went, did you go back to the trials at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: All the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: And when was that, was that after you came back to this country or in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: _________________ they used to call me when there were the trials for the Germans, the Nazis, they used to call me as witness.</span> <span id="s939">From America they used to call me, dozen of times to Germany as a witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And what was that experience like?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: When I first seen the murders in Sobibor and the bench in court, my knees, I was very nervous that I survived to that moment when they are behind bars and so on.</span> <span id="s942">But the next occasions it didn't bother me, if I would try to describe all the feelings each time I did come, against each of the Nazis, cause there are many courts against the Nazis, court sessions against the Nazis from Sobibor, against the Nazis from Itsbeetsa(ph), you would need to sit here for a whole week.</span> <span id="s943">But generally only the first time was a little bit strange and later it didn't bother me.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Did you think about not doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: No.</span> <span id="s946">You see some survivors, they drift away from the past, they don't want to think about this and it's okay.</span> <span id="s947">They have families, children, grandchildren, they proved that they survived, this is their way of saying here I am.</span> <span id="s948">And some survivors they can't attach themselves from the past and they don't want to.</span> <span id="s949">Feel of guilt, I don't know, they want to do something.</span> <span id="s950">I'm the one who want to do something to, for the history, should be documented.</span> <span id="s951">Anyway, I'm very much involved with the past and cannot go away from it.</span> <span id="s952">And this is the reason that I was involved lately with Sobibor and I'm happy I did do something worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So at what point did you start writing down things and thinking the names, the dates, various specifics?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: The first time I start to write down, I was in, before the war, I was in the public school.</span> <span id="s955">I wrote down with my ______________ something I didn't want, somebody should __________, they had some special marks and, and although I was very bad in mathematics, I was always good in writing, in Polish and it was my passion to write, in the wartime I wrote.</span> <span id="s956">Lost many times the notes.</span> <span id="s957">Some I did leave to Poles for safekeeping, some I took with me to Sobibor and a Nazi, __________ threw me in a well and everything went wet and ruined my whole, whatever written down.</span> <span id="s958">Next time, start to write again, I wrote all the time, in the forest, in piece of paper and give it to farmers and after the war I collected about 40 percent.</span> <span id="s959">In 19, in 1953, I put everything from the little notes in the notebook and in 1957, when I arrived in Israel, in 19, yeah in 1957, '58, I borrowed a typewriter, put everything in a manuscript form and later, and this was my whole story, that evolved at Sobibor.</span> <span id="s960">Later I thought, let me have the opinion about this book, if it's interesting.</span> <span id="s961">And I thought, who could give me the best opinion?</span> <span id="s962">Somebody who was in the camp.</span> <span id="s963">So I went straight, I forgot his name, he was the secretary of the Auschwitz organization in Israel.</span> <span id="s964">In Haifa he used to live.</span> <span id="s965">Said, "Mr. So and so, take this, read it and tell me, evaluate my manuscript."</span> <span id="s966">Three weeks later I go to him, he looked at me.</span> <span id="s967">"Oh, Toivy, you have an imagination.</span> <span id="s968">Never heard of Sobibor, never heard about the revolt."</span> <span id="s969">And I thought, I was in shock, you know, I was many times hit by the Germans in Sobibor, it didn't hurt me as much as his words.</span> <span id="s970">He, five years in Auschwitz, he doesn't believe my story?</span> <span id="s971">Who will believe it?</span> <span id="s972">So I put it away.</span> <span id="s973">For about 40 years, didn't touch it.</span> <span id="s974">Forty, I don't know, I started again about, this was in 1958, about 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: You put it away?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Put it away, because if he doesn't believe me, I was thinking about it many times and I find out, but I had come at a conclusion, that he wasn't really a good person to evaluate.</span> <span id="s977">He was closed up in this Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s978">He didn't know the complexity of the Holocaust tragedy.</span> <span id="s979">And in a way, despite what you, many people think, it was much worse outside the camps, in many cases, than in the camp.</span> <span id="s980">In the camp you was, you had a good job over there, you was secured in a way, you didn't know, you could vision another day and so on, so on, so on.</span> <span id="s981">If you were strong, you was able to... And on the other side, hiding as a Pole in the forest, you wasn't sure every second of your life.</span> <span id="s982">So he didn't know this aspect of course.</span> <span id="s983">He didn't hear about Sobibor.</span> <span id="s984">Cause he went straight to Israel and so he was hidden.</span> <span id="s985">They tried to erase the memory of Sobibor.</span> <span id="s986">Poland didn't care.</span> <span id="s987">Why should they expose, even now they didn't take, they don't take people, why should they expose a place where the Jews fought back the Germans?</span> <span id="s988">They despised Jews, the cowards.</span> <span id="s989">When there were so many Poles in camps and they didn't fight back.</span> <span id="s990">So Sobibor was pushed away and I actually put it back in the view.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: So one man said that you and you, did you think maybe I did imagine or maybe it wasn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: No, I know I didn't imagine.</span> <span id="s993">As a matter of fact in my book which I wrote now, which will be published by Northwestern University in the spring next year, I eliminate many things from the manuscript to make it more believable.</span> <span id="s994">Because it took miracles to survive the Nazis, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: So the time that you put your manuscript away, did you think about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: No.</span> <span id="s997">Put it away.</span> <span id="s998">Actually it was always in my, in my subconscious.</span> <span id="s999">It started again when the film did come out in America, The Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1000">When did come to interview me and I think this film was a breakthrough in America.</span> <span id="s1001">From that time on they start to talk about this.</span> <span id="s1002">And I did go back to my manuscript.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: So it was a breakthrough for you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: It was, no, from this time on, if you will look the chronology of the history, I mean, the chronology, chronology, what's happened, films, books.</span> <span id="s1005">From that point on, people started to publish memory, memories, books, films and so on.</span> <span id="s1006">Was a, the Holocaust was a breakthrough from the taboo about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: And did you feel, that's the first time we've used that word taboo, did you feel that there was a taboo, that there were people ______________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yeah, yeah, they didn't talk about this, they didn't, who would believe them?</span> <span id="s1009">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Even though you knew other people who had had somewhat of the same experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1012">You know, there's a lot of them because now they have, they, another thing, while it was the, it wasn't so public knowledge like now, because most of the survivors, some made it, made very fast a fortune and were busy still doing it.</span> <span id="s1013">Some worked to make a living.</span> <span id="s1014">Now most of them, the last 10, 20 years retired.</span> <span id="s1015">They have time and they go back to it and they start to write.</span> <span id="s1016">Before they were trying just to make a living.</span> <span id="s1017">So this also a reason why now we have more, we talk more about this than before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: I __________ about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Okay, let's relax.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: So all the things that we've talked about today and the interview that you did originally, did you talk about all these experiences with your family, with your wife and with your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Yeah, not with the children, oh, the children know about this, but I talk with my wife, she helped me, book because see, see, my English was bad, it's still bad and she helped me with editing.</span> <span id="s1025">We talk about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: But now would you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: As a matter of fact she went with me once to Germany and when I met this officer from Sobibor and I interviewed him, she was with me, helped me a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: You talked about in terms of writing the book, but do you talk about it in terms of the experiences itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yeah, of course, we talked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Now you say of course, but some people...</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No, she was very much in it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: But why not talk about it with your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Well, they know the story.</span> <span id="s1034">And because when I, I made a lot of slides and I talked people, I told people the story ______________ many times and they would, were sitting, listening.</span> <span id="s1035">I didn't hide from them.</span> <span id="s1036">Some them want to know stories when grown up children know anything about their parents and we don't tell them, they know from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: So were there things you wanted to protect your children from?</span> <span id="s1038">Hide?</span> <span id="s1039">That they shouldn't know about you from that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: I didn't want to protect.</span> <span id="s1041">I told them, it's not, you see I don't believe to do something, to protect, not to tell, not to do this because if you do this it'll be __________ or better.</span> <span id="s1042">I believe, I'm not a Federalist, but I will believe, I believe what must be, will be and you could do your best trying to do it, to do something and could turn around, upside down.</span> <span id="s1043">You really can do much to influence your future.</span> <span id="s1044">Of course, you could do it, you could go to school, learn a trade, but a lot of things which you could, but another way, really, not talking about the past, __________ because the kids wouldn't have a complex.</span> <span id="s1045">Talk, all because they should know the true.</span> <span id="s1046">Depends on the child's character, about intelligence and willingness and upbringing.</span> <span id="s1047">I told them, in any case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I have in Poland my daughter from the Polish marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Whose and adult now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1052">And I have here a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s1053">The boy is about 36 and the girl is about 32.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: So do they ask you questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: They don't need to ask me, they know everything.</span> <span id="s1058">And my daughter called me up just yesterday.</span> <span id="s1059">"Daddy, I'm so proud of you."</span> <span id="s1060">"What are you proud?"</span> <span id="s1061">I've seen in the window in a library or whatever, I can't remember, the film, Escape from Sobibor and Schindler's List has recommended as a stand out literature for the schools and I've seen your name there.</span> <span id="s1062">So they are involved in it and that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: So, we were talking before about how some people didn't want to talk about the experiences, what do you think, why do you think it's important for you to have spent all that time writing and to have spent all the time making sure the story that you wrote comes out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: I survived.</span> <span id="s1065">And I felt always, there's a price to pay back in surviving, that's all.</span> <span id="s1066">You have something inside which you must release it for the, for the future.</span> <span id="s1067">And I said before, and it hurt me when I come to Sobibor and I see a sign that here were killed 250,000 Russians.</span> <span id="s1068">And was there a church next where they killed people, actually on the same spot they murdered people.</span> <span id="s1069">So it did hurt me when I have seen this.</span> <span id="s1070">When they build a church, I was in Sobibor, but I was misled, because of seeing an ad in the paper that a group of priests want to build a mausoleum for the memory of the Jewish victims of Sobibor.</span> <span id="s1071">So when they were building I talk with them and I ask them if there will be some kind Star of David, so the priest told me, "Oh no, we can't do that."</span> <span id="s1072">I said, "Why not?</span> <span id="s1073">Only Jews were killed."</span> <span id="s1074">So he said to himself, so he said, "No there wouldn't be, there will be, it will be a monument this church for the victims of Sobibor, but are they Muslim men or Christians or Jews?</span> <span id="s1075">No, it wouldn't say so."</span> <span id="s1076">So I said, "Why?</span> <span id="s1077">Only Jews were killed here."</span> <span id="s1078">So he said, "Yes, I know that only Jews.</span> <span id="s1079">And people living here around, which still remember the times, they say that only Jews, but the sign doesn't say so."</span> <span id="s1080">So I told him the sign is lying.</span> <span id="s1081">So finally, anyway it was next year and there's a church, no mausoleum but a church built there.</span> <span id="s1082">So is, I was mad.</span> <span id="s1083">And start to work with double energy, went to the commission for investigating, investigating the Nazi crimes and talk with them.</span> <span id="s1084">Talk with the Minister of Justice, with the Minister of Monuments and inch by inch, I was a pest.</span> <span id="s1085">To have more authority, I produce a film, a documentary called Past and Present.</span> <span id="s1086">Did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: To show what's going on.</span> <span id="s1089">And with this help, I organized in Los Angeles, with the help, with the second generation of the Holocaust survivors, I establish organization, Holocaust Site Preservation Committee.</span> <span id="s1090">Had some senators as figureheads and Asner and Fonda and ________________, very good names.</span> <span id="s1091">So I had a, the organization was called Holocaust Site Preservation Committee and was official non-profit organization and I had a letterhead and some support, but still was working alone.</span> <span id="s1092">And so I, but now when I had appointment with a ______________________ official, I send him this letterhead with impressive names.</span> <span id="s1093">And I did gain some appointments.</span> <span id="s1094">And finally a writer, she wrote a book, it's a English writer, English-German writer, maybe you did read this book, Into the Darkness, Gitta(ph) Serran(ph) is her name and of course that is the best book about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1095">She told me, "Tom," I told her the problem, she told me, "Tom, go to the Pope, talk with the Pope."</span> <span id="s1096">So I said, "With the Pope?</span> <span id="s1097">I need _______________."</span> <span id="s1098">She said, "It's not so difficult at all.</span> <span id="s1099">If you want I should, I will help you."</span> <span id="s1100">And she had a friend, a very famous Polish aristocrat, she's not Polish but she had this, I forgot his name, he had, he was a, very close to the Pope, anyway to say it shortly, I did get out, did see the Pope.</span> <span id="s1101">Talked with him 12 minutes, told about the church, about the lies, about what I would like from him is help.</span> <span id="s1102">And soon after that when I was in Poland, I talk with the ________________, I could go in details but it will take ages, so I would just tell you that, that we set out, when I had already set, the first version which they allowed me to change on the sign, only we pay money, we do it, the Polish did not want to put a penny, the cost was and I had about 25,000 dollars to my disposition from the collection American.</span> <span id="s1103">The first version was to change that, in this place were killed 250,000 Jews and Poles and I thought this is the best of it and I accepted it.</span> <span id="s1104">But later it did bother me.</span> <span id="s1105">I said, "No, Jews and Poles, it's not so.</span> <span id="s1106">There weren't Poles there."</span> <span id="s1107">The argument from the Minister of Justice was that there were for sure converted Jews.</span> <span id="s1108">As converted Jews, they were Christians.</span> <span id="s1109">So I told him in this case __________ converted Germans, maybe he should put the Germans too were killed and so on, so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1110">Anyway, they didn't want to __________.</span> <span id="s1111">So I said, "In that case, I back out."</span> <span id="s1112">"Mr., but you signed it already."</span> <span id="s1113">"Yes, it's true, but I cannot follow it."</span> <span id="s1114">And it come out another version, that in this place were killed 250,000 Jews and about 1000 Poles.</span> <span id="s1115">To support my version, I played for him the tape, which I made with my interview with Frentzel(ph), the Nazi officer from Sobibor.</span> <span id="s1116">I had with him my interview in Germany.</span> <span id="s1117">And, and it was difficult with this too.</span> <span id="s1118">I had already, they accept it and I said, "It's okay.</span> <span id="s1119">1000 Poles will show, 250,000 Jews, that will show that the tragedy really more graphic."</span> <span id="s1120">And maybe because Sobibor's on the side, far away from the main centers, we will, hooligans will maybe have a little bit respect and they'll not destroy this place.</span> <span id="s1121">So I agreed.</span> <span id="s1122">But still, hard to go about this?</span> <span id="s1123">I have already the text, but I didn't have _______________ permit to take out the old sign.</span> <span id="s1124">Now I did work with the district, you would call him here, governor.</span> <span id="s1125">Over there they called him ________________.</span> <span id="s1126">Went to him and talked and established some kind of friendships and I remember the day I invited them, not only him, him and his co-workers for a big dinner in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1127">In that time a dollar we changed for Polish zlotas(ph), you could do a lot.</span> <span id="s1128">So I made a big dinner, with vodka and when were we were practically drunk, I said to the __________, "Oh, Mr. Leshick(ph)," first name, "so what, will we finally change the plates?"</span> <span id="s1129">And he said, "You have new one, do you have with you arranged everything?"</span> <span id="s1130">I said, "Yes, is no problem.</span> <span id="s1131">We must take down the old one, that's all."</span> <span id="s1132">I thought the moment we will take down the old plate, we will leave a empty spot, we will have no way, we will need to fill it in because tourists our coming.</span> <span id="s1133">So mine objective was to take it down as fast as possible.</span> <span id="s1134">So I said to Mr. Leshick(ph), "We must take down the sign, the old one, because I want to put in a new one."</span> <span id="s1135">And he asked me, "When do you want to have it done?"</span> <span id="s1136">So I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s1137">And I just, as a matter of fact, I didn't believe, I said, "Maybe after dinner."</span> <span id="s1138">He said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s1139">I didn't believe him, I look.</span> <span id="s1140">He said after, I said, "Okay?"</span> <span id="s1141">I wasn't, I was impatient to finish this dinner, we took a car to Vuldava(ph), the next city and he took, as a mayor, as a governor, he took some people from the city hall, workers, city workers, to come with shovels and they, it didn't take them long, took down the sign, I loaded my car.</span> <span id="s1142">I still have it hidden in Poland, my daughter's place, in the garage.</span> <span id="s1143">And now it's a empty spot, need to fill it in, so I said, I thought, _______________.</span> <span id="s1144">So I ordered the new signs, five of them they made, put them on and organized a big 50, 50th anniversary of the revolt, when the signs were unveiled and now at least the truth over there.</span> <span id="s1145">This accomplish I think I've done a little thing.</span> <span id="s1146">Now, published this book about Sobibor, another book and could relax.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Now you said that was giving back something.</span> <span id="s1148">That's not a little thing, that's a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: See.</span> <span id="s1150">A _______________ from the present Polish president, a letter, _______________.</span> <span id="s1151">Here, firing squad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: So this was important, not only to you, but to other people.</span> <span id="s1153">All these letters that are...</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: _______________.</span> <span id="s1155">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1156">______________ is this.</span> <span id="s1157">That most difficult I heard from Jewish people and I don't know why, because the Jewish people Israel, should bring up, take care of Sobibor.</span> <span id="s1158">Because this was really the biggest revolt, if not the only successful revolt.</span> <span id="s1159">Not talking about ______________ ghetto, talk about camps.</span> <span id="s1160">And I had difficult time to organize somebody from Israel.</span> <span id="s1161">I went to the Israel ambassador, tell them, listen, I know the Prime Minister will come from Poland.</span> <span id="s1162">__________ she's __________ Polish, I would like you should be there.</span> <span id="s1163">I didn't, they didn't even let me talk to ambassador.</span> <span id="s1164">They'd give me some kind political secretary there, a woman called Gordon.</span> <span id="s1165">She didn't care, she just didn't want to go for the commemoration.</span> <span id="s1166">So I said, listen if you don't go, I promise you, I myself am talking on the radio, on television.</span> <span id="s1167">I will say that I tried to get somebody from the Israel ambassador and they didn't give a damn, didn't even know what Sobibor is and what Sobibor was, so educated __________.</span> <span id="s1168">Anyway, so she was ascared and she did come.</span> <span id="s1169">Otherwise nobody would be.</span> <span id="s1170">But I arranged it very nice, if you want to see it in the tape, it's 15 minutes, I could show it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: I have some more questions though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: In terms of, in this course of this interview you've said how it's important to go on, to live, to survive, but yet you spent a lot of time on this.</span> <span id="s1174">Why was it so important?</span> <span id="s1175">Because they ___________ or why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: It was important, I said in the beginning, you can't disappear from this world when you feel you have something, something unspeakable, something you must leave for the future.</span> <span id="s1177">And now, I'm close to 70 years old, another half a year, I'll be 70 years old.</span> <span id="s1178">I'm really satisfied that I left something for the posterity, for history.</span> <span id="s1179">What do you think?</span> <span id="s1180">People say, oh we should kill them all, okay, of course, ______________ forward to kill the Nazis, but I think this is not, this shouldn't be the purpose, we should keep the emotions down.</span> <span id="s1181">We should sue him, have court proceedings.</span> <span id="s1182">Because I don't give a damn if he's killed or not, because takes a minute and he hangs and there's, this belongs to them.</span> <span id="s1183">But most important is his testimony because this will last forever, if he had to document what's happened.</span> <span id="s1184">So, what I have done is in a way, a document and now I'm really satisfied because that's all I could do.</span> <span id="s1185">It was very difficult as I said, with help and look ___________ at this letter, the organization, the Holocaust ______________ committee, the head, the head __________ did represent me as a figure at least, in the Polish and _________________ for the Polish official, as a figure to _________________ as an official from America and the true, was a little like I am, a little simple person, trying to do the best and I used it and I was received with respect by the Polish dignitaries, as a matter of fact, I grabbed one of us in a meeting, some kind of meeting in Washington and there were some diplomats and I grabbed the Polish Minister of Justice, Yushkevich(ph), had the collar ______________________ called it __________ and didn't let him go until he promised me 10,000 __________, he didn't keep his promise.</span> <span id="s1186">For this money, I forgot to tell you, in Sobibor, besides the church and besides the sign, they establish a kindergarten, with swings and everything and I managed to throw them out and I establish a museum, now there's a museum there.</span> <span id="s1187">So in my small capacity as small man, I think I accomplished something which let me, let me live a little bit in peace now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So in doing all that work...</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: ...it also seems like you had to relive some of the pain, over and over and over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Okay, I didn't have to relive the pain, because after awhile, it neutralize you.</span> <span id="s1194">You become a person, you're not so personal involved, your emotions is moving aside by the, by the action.</span> <span id="s1195">You doing it and I used to come to Sobibor and I used to shake in the beginning, not now.</span> <span id="s1196">The only one moment may be when I'm, I sometime not able to control, I'm going to tell the story of Sobibor and the lectures here, whatever, when I talk about my parting with my mother.</span> <span id="s1197">Otherwise, I'm in full control of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: These are?</span> <span id="s1199">Just a couple of other questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: So do you talk to other Holocaust survivors and encourage them to speak out or do something that's meaning, something that's meaningful to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: No, the fact is, that the survivors from the death camps, act completely different than survivors from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1203">Concentration camp survivors have society's mauthausen(ph), prisoner's, Auschwitz organization and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1204">You never hear of Sobibor or Treblinka organization.</span> <span id="s1205">Or Helnot(ph).</span> <span id="s1206">First of all, that's you on the left, but people ask me, do you get together, no we don't get together.</span> <span id="s1207">We don't get together because our memories are too terrible really, to talk about.</span> <span id="s1208">So and we don't have contact with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: When you meet people either from the same types of experiences, or people who have had other types of experiences, but can't talk about it, who might have nightmares or a hard time having family relationships, what do you tell them?</span> <span id="s1210">What can you tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Repeat it please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: I'm wondering, you're someone who has, who doesn't seem to find it hard to talk about your experiences, who has been able to go on and have a family and a career and business and __________, but yet there are some people who haven't, who can't.</span> <span id="s1213">And I'm wondering what you tell those people, what can you, what advice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I didn't met, in my way a person who is complaining.</span> <span id="s1215">Although yes, I, I actually hear, well this was the wife of a survivor.</span> <span id="s1216">She doesn't want to talk about this, she doesn't, she doesn't want to hear about this.</span> <span id="s1217">So we didn't talk about this.</span> <span id="s1218">And but otherwise to engage myself in some kind help, in some kind advice, I had never a chance to do it, really, although I know that some people ______________________ want to talk about this and I respect it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: You understand it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yeah, want to go away, they can, there's a lady in Santa Barbara, she shaking when we talk __________ about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1221">Maybe she has some terrible memories and she doesn't want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Do you think you'll remember everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: You know, I could forget what we talked yesterday about, a date or whatever, but I will never forget what's happened 50 years ago or 55 years ago.</span> <span id="s1224">Every single thing, I'll never.</span> <span id="s1225">Little things I find out, I can't exactly, but basically everything, yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Do you ever wish you couldn't remember some of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1228">______________ poetically, wish not to remember, but maybe ______________.</span> <span id="s1229">You survive, you remember, and terrible things happened, it just makes you think about people, how they act.</span> <span id="s1230">People sometimes ask me, "So what did you learn from the Holocaust, what could you say?"</span> <span id="s1231">And they expect I will say something poetical, something you know, high, some extra thoughts and what I did learn is this, it is not a direction what to do or what, a simple thing, I learned that nobody knows himself, nobody.</span> <span id="s1232">I look at people, men __________ catch myself wondering, especially if people are nice to me, in Poland or in Germany, I wonder, how would he act in that, in that situation?</span> <span id="s1233">And that, what I know, nobody knows himself, how he could change, what he could be.</span> <span id="s1234">Because I've seen it, you take now, five or ten mothers and ask them, if you have a choice, you should be killed or the child, would you give up your child and I'm sure all ten would say no, I would rather die and they think so.</span> <span id="s1235">They don't say a lie, but I am not so sure if it would be like that if this would be the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s1236">I think what I have seen, more than half would give up the child.</span> <span id="s1237">Anyway, I have little observations, I wouldn't call it lessons about the human nature, I've seen a lot.</span> <span id="s1238">And if I were to be an educated psychologist, psychiatrist, I could __________ on it and write very nice, scientific work about the human behavior, because I've seen it first hand.</span> <span id="s1239">I'm not, I think I've done, well I was very busy usual always, writing this book, and another book now, I've finished it so I have more time and maybe I will write short stories, but this, would rather be, I think in a fiction form, based on true stories.</span> <span id="s1240">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: So before, I'm sitting in front of this big Menorah, Menorah, yes and we talked about how, at some point in your life, the Jewish religion or practices wasn't all that important.</span> <span id="s1242">Has it come back into your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: It didn't come back, maybe if I would __________ a religious person, the tradition would come back.</span> <span id="s1244">But in America again, in the beginning, we did need to work Saturday or not Saturday and we would never keep it up __________ Jewish spirit, the way I remember in Poland before the war, so the conditions changed, or the behavior changed.</span> <span id="s1245">But I have very good memories from the past, from the tradition and, which I never keeped up now, for years.</span> <span id="s1246">Saturday especially, when I was living in Poland, I didn't know what is a Saturday, is not a Saturday, Yom Kippur, not Yom Kippur, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: But your, the children that were born here, did you bring them up Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: They know they are Jewish and I didn't care what either way they will go, whether they feel Jewish, whether not so.</span> <span id="s1249">Not religious, they didn't go to religious schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Bar Mitzvahed, Bat Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: None of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1254">I don't care about this, it's a big show of __________ so many people I've seen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: And what about God now?</span> <span id="s1256">You talked about there, God being a terrible God at some point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: How does, how's God now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: I am at odds with God.</span> <span id="s1260">So much I don't want to talk about Him, that's God.</span> <span id="s1261">There is some, obviously, I lean, I lean rather to Spinosa(ph), __________.</span> <span id="s1262">You know who Spinosa(ph) was?</span> <span id="s1263">Jewish philosopher.</span> <span id="s1264">He was thrown out in Jew's society, you know.</span> <span id="s1265">There is some, you could say I'm agnostic, not atheist.</span> <span id="s1266">There is some power which is ruling the world and of course obvious, the balance between water and the air _______________ and whatever their ending is, you know, proclamation, generations after the generations.</span> <span id="s1267">There is some logical balance and everything is in logic and but I believe there's some power which we don't understand.</span> <span id="s1268">It's either religion __________ logical explanation of things, come to a stop and people can't live in the emptiness, so they did think about different stories and one of them is religion, an explanation, people don't need to, to, to search for others, for an explanation, __________.</span> <span id="s1269">So God, in the religious way...[End of Side 1, Tape 3]...Another way to say I don't believe in a theological God, I believe there's a power.</span> <span id="s1270">And we don't know what __________, maybe someday we will come to the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: But it's that power that you're at odds with, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: No, but I'm not, this is, I'm a little dust in the whole machinery.</span> <span id="s1273">I am against the imaginable God, which did come from different religions.</span> <span id="s1274">But again, how could you be at odds, if you don't believe in Him.</span> <span id="s1275">So, put it this way, I'm a non-believer, but a Jew.</span> <span id="s1276">Some say you can't be a Jew if you don't believe in Judaism, in religion, in the past.</span> <span id="s1277">But why not?</span> <span id="s1278">You could be a Jew, you don't need to be a religious Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: I know a lot of people who are Jewish but don't practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: But culturally they feel those roots very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: I feel the roots strongly, yeah.</span> <span id="s1283">It is something, you know, in the human life, in every life, irrational.</span> <span id="s1284">If you didn't believe in that, why do you believe in that?</span> <span id="s1285">This is one of them.</span> <span id="s1286">I'm not religious, I'm a Jew.</span> <span id="s1287">And I would like, I like the tradition and maybe I would be happy if I would have a partner who's traditional and so on, so on, but not everything is up to us.</span> <span id="s1288">My life in this direction, this is it, nobody could actually set up his life.</span> <span id="s1289">People get married, beautiful wife, live forever after, after awhile, start to fight, get a divorce, so on, so on.</span> <span id="s1290">So everything is, you never could set something in one set and will run like that.</span> <span id="s1291">Some experience in my life, which what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Well, the important parts, the interview that we want to do is to find out what your life has been like, how the experience of the Holocaust has determined your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Well the experience of the Holocaust first of all make me a agnostic.</span> <span id="s1294">The experience of the Holocaust, not so, the history of the human beings, which I studied very carefully, history of Jews, history of the world and so on, make me wonder if it could happen again.</span> <span id="s1295">And I think it could very easy happen again.</span> <span id="s1296">First of all, if you learn from history, it's a very well, a very well known saying, history repeat himself.</span> <span id="s1297">Why should it stop here?</span> <span id="s1298">And it's proven, that the __________, our culture, didn't put a stop to it.</span> <span id="s1299">As a matter of fact, the technology made it worse.</span> <span id="s1300">Next time something will, something happened, there'll be computers.</span> <span id="s1301">You wouldn't be able to say I'm not that or that.</span> <span id="s1302">You push the button, they have your whole story.</span> <span id="s1303">So it could happen.</span> <span id="s1304">You could see the feeling against Jews is not, you scratch it in some societies and comes up, without scratching it comes up.</span> <span id="s1305">People will always hate the smarter, the very well off and people will always look for excuse why they are miserable.</span> <span id="s1306">So if like Jews, a nation didn't have anybody to protect them in that time, you could fell easy prey to hate.</span> <span id="s1307">Now we have Israel, which in a way could protect, but from my experience, I don't talk, I don't look the positive way on the future.</span> <span id="s1308">I think it could happen.</span> <span id="s1309">It doesn't take much, it should change.</span> <span id="s1310">I sometime go over on a bus in Los Angeles, I went to Nazi meetings, I get Nazi magazines, I subscribe.</span> <span id="s1311">Not for support, I'm not a supporter, but I want to know why they think.</span> <span id="s1312">And you go to such a meeting, you really see it how it is, it's not so simple.</span> <span id="s1313">The __________ America think we are fairly secure __________.</span> <span id="s1314">To summarize it, I don't want to turn my head away, it could happen again.</span></p> <p><span
