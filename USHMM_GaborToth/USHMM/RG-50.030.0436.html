me your name, your date of birth and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Answer: My name is Gertrude Flor.</span> <span id="s13">My maiden name, Gertrude DeGranierer(ph).</span> <span id="s14">I was born in Saraguda(ph) Romania in 1921, September 28th.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My mother came from Prague, Czechoslovakia and her parents lived in Prague.</span> <span id="s17">My father came from Czernowitz, which was about 10 miles from where we lived and his parents lived there.</span> <span id="s18">I went very frequently with my mother to visit my mother's parents and we spent every summer in one of the nice spas in Czechoslovakia, like Francensbat(ph), Cardelsbat(ph), Marinebat(ph).</span> <span id="s19">And so I was very close to my mother's...</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: What do you remember about your childhood, what distinct memories do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My most distinct memories are that I was much closer to my father than to my mother.</span> <span id="s22">He was a very well-educated man who was very interested in education and since I was an only child, he gave me a lot of attention in this area.</span> <span id="s23">He had returned from the first World War with a shrapnel in his hip which was not properly removed, so he was not well, he didn't walk easily and was very sedentary and his greatest joy was to teach me.</span> <span id="s24">Geography, history, languages.</span> <span id="s25">This is how he instilled in me a great love for education.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did you come from a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: No.</span> <span id="s28">I have no recollection, others that, maybe once a year, it's a high holy days, my parents went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s29">But other than that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Did you identify as a Jewish person or Jewish girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s32">It was, I don't know how to explain it, but it was just not very important.</span> <span id="s33">Although I do remember that my parents contributed to, to Zionism.</span> <span id="s34">We had in our house a certain, I don't know how you call it, piggy bank, where we always put money in and this was with, in the shape of, I don't know if it was apart, but it was white and blue.</span> <span id="s35">And we always put money in there and I have no idea where that money went but it was explained to me as a child that this is for, for Jewish people who needed it.</span> <span id="s36">That's all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: I guess I assume that your friendships were very mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Very mixed, our neighbors left and right were not Jews, but there were also quite a few Jews among them.</span> <span id="s39">It was, until 1937, I was not at all aware.</span> <span id="s40">I shouldn't say that because I do remember now that on Memorial Day, which is a holiday for everywhere in the world and schoolchildren went to the cemetery but the Jewish schoolchildren were separated from the others and went to the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s41">That is when I became aware that, that there was a difference between the other children and me.</span> <span id="s42">That's all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: But nothing that made you feel terribly different?</span> <span id="s44">Were you, were you ever aware of anti-Semitism, early in...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, yes, at that time I became aware of anti-Semitism and particularly in 1937, there were times where in our town, soldiers, Romanian soldiers and particularly Romanian officers, who probably often got drunk, were roaming the streets with guns, with the revolvers in their hands and yelling loud words against Jews.</span> <span id="s46">Yes, I was, that was when I began to be very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did, did that attitude affect the, your Christian friends?</span> <span id="s48">I mean, did they pick up the spirit of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: No, not particularly, as a matter of fact, I remember one incident where this one Romanian officer was running through the streets and yelling, "I'm going to kill all the Jews."</span> <span id="s50">A couple of friends of my father's, my stepfather, this was in 1937,'38, a couple of friends who were not Jews, tried to approach this officer and to talk reason to him and they were, I had completely the feeling that they were on our side, that they were not against us and they were two of the leading people in town.</span> <span id="s51">So I didn't have a complete feeling of being betrayed by every Christian, you know.</span> <span id="s52">But, I can't describe it too well, this is how it began.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And then at what point did it get worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Well we heard then the speeches that Hitler gave on the radio and we kept thinking, well it's not going to last too long, because sane people would not accept this and all, and anyway it's not here, it's somewhere in Germany and then it was in Austria and then it was in Czechoslovakia, but and then it was in Poland, and Poland was pretty close to where we lived, but we still couldn't believe it, we still didn't think that it would find us.</span> <span id="s55">I can't, when I think of this now, I just can't understand how my parents did not accept my uncle's offer to leave.</span> <span id="s56">They, they simply didn't think that anything could happen to them.</span> <span id="s57">And we saw a number of Jews from Poland coming to our town and we made room where we lived for them to sleep and we saw how it happened, but we still didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s58">And then in 1940, when Hitler and Stalin made this pact, we had not very much of a choice.</span> <span id="s59">We thought, since we knew what happened under Hitler to people, that we would in fact be better off to stay where we are and very many people were glad that the Soviets came.</span> <span id="s60">Of course, we didn't know what would happen.</span> <span id="s61">It was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about life under the Soviets?</span> <span id="s63">I know that you've told me before that your home was taken away from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: The interesting part was that their propaganda was so efficient, they, there were concerts, the people danced in the streets.</span> <span id="s67">There were speeches that there is no better quality of life than in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s68">The children got their education for free.</span> <span id="s69">The older people got their medical help for free.</span> <span id="s70">People were taken care of from their birth to their day they died.</span> <span id="s71">They never had to worry.</span> <span id="s72">And all of this wonderful thing happened because the Communist government knew how to take care of it's people.</span> <span id="s73">And in the meantime, during the night, people disappeared.</span> <span id="s74">And this, this was very, very difficult, because it hit us almost immediately and then one of the Soviets, who moved into our house, told me, first of all he said to me, "You know that there is no God."</span> <span id="s75">And you know this, for me, even though I was not brought up in a strict religious sense, it was awful thing for me to hear.</span> <span id="s76">And then when my father was taken away, this man, whose name I do not know, I don't think I even knew it then, this man said to me, "Look, you are a young person, you have the best chance for a wonderful life in our country, but you have to put an ad in the paper that you want to have nothing to do with your father, who is an enemy of the people."</span> <span id="s77">And of course I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s78">This is how life was under the Soviets.</span> <span id="s79">We saw a big poster, said, was seen in many places.</span> <span id="s80">Stalin was holding on his lap a child and giving the child a wristwatch, because that child had informed the teacher that the parents at home had spoken against the government.</span> <span id="s81">And what the parents had said was, "No eggs today for breakfast."</span> <span id="s82">And the father had said, "Again no eggs?"</span> <span id="s83">And this was regarded as counter-revolutionary talk.</span> <span id="s84">The parents were arrested and the child got a watch.</span> <span id="s85">The parents disappeared.</span> <span id="s86">That was how life was.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did, were Jewish businesses taken away, were people allowed to go to school, did sort of every day life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: People went to school and Jewish businesses were taken away, all businesses were taken away but the difference was that the Christians who had businesses could, under the pack that Hitler and Stalin had, could say that they are false Germans, which means that their ancestors were of German background and therefore they were not arrested.</span> <span id="s89">They had the right to be resettled into Germany and while the Soviets took away their houses in Sattagura(ph) or in one of those towns, when they were resettled, they got an, an equivalent house or apartment in Germany.</span> <span id="s90">And I even know about one man who was taken the same night as my father, who was a Christian and who was a merchant, a businessman.</span> <span id="s91">He, he dealt with, he sold ham and, and kielbasa and had pigs and made them, made, made these foods at home and then sold them.</span> <span id="s92">Well he was regarded a Capitalist.</span> <span id="s93">He was taken the same night, but he said that he was a false Deutschner(ph), he was not, he was actually a half Polish, half-Ukrainian Christian.</span> <span id="s94">Well he was taken out of the prison and sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s95">And he escaped, my father didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Just for the clarification here, we're talking about your stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Was there fear on the streets, was it better or worse than the Romanians who were hunting down people?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes and no.</span> <span id="s100">A very difficult thing to answer.</span> <span id="s101">The people who were not arrested and who were friendly towards the Soviet Union, didn't feel that they had anything to fear.</span> <span id="s102">They thought that it would be just the very rich people who, who should be treated that way, because they, they really shouldn't be so rich.</span> <span id="s103">But very slowly, it became clear to everybody that you couldn't talk.</span> <span id="s104">Even though they said you had freedom to say anything, you knew that you couldn't, you couldn't even think against them.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Now you were about 19 years old, what were you doing at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: I had just finished the conservatory.</span> <span id="s107">It was, I believe it was June 12, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: The conservatory where?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: In Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s110">Which was the larger town.</span> <span id="s111">It's some 10 or 15 miles away.</span> <span id="s112">And two weeks later, June 28, is when the Soviets occupied our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: And you were back home in Sattagura(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Tell me just a little bit about Czernowitz because it seems like you spent quite a bit of time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Czernowitz was a wonderful town.</span> <span id="s117">It was, I believe there were about 100,000 people and a great majority of them were Jews.</span> <span id="s118">Very well educated, very motivated towards education and very proud to, to read a great deal and to be considered intellectuals.</span> <span id="s119">Czernowitz was considered the little Vienna, whereas Bucharest, as the capital of Romania, was considered little Paris.</span> <span id="s120">In Bucharest, the second language was French, first was Romanian.</span> <span id="s121">In Czernowitz, the first language was German, because it had belonged to Austria, to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, where most educated people spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: It was a good life there, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes, I think it was.</span> <span id="s124">The parents and grandparents kept talking about the good old time of Kaiser Francioseph(ph).</span> <span id="s125">They loved that Kaiser.</span> <span id="s126">And they were very assimilated.</span> <span id="s127">They, in fact, didn't believe that anything could happen to them because they, in the first World War they served as Austrians, they got medals and awards and they were proud of that, they, they just couldn't believe that this could happen.</span> <span id="s128">They also couldn't believe that a civilized nation like Germany could do any harm to people.</span> <span id="s129">It was strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Do you remember the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: This happened one year after the Soviets had occupied us.</span> <span id="s132">The Soviets had done a very thorough job to deport a great many people, particularly thinking people, particularly.</span> <span id="s133">The deportation took place on June 12, 13 and 14 I believe, 1941.</span> <span id="s134">This...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: This was an involuntary deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s137">And it's interesting that we had, when we came to the United States many, many years later, somewhere, we had found in a, an old issue of the New York Times, that a very small article that said that people of the Buchavina(ph) had asked Comrade Stalin, had requested to be resettled into the interior of Soviet Russia, for fear of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s138">And that Comrade Stalin had agreed to it.</span> <span id="s139">And this was the deportations that happened in the middle of the night against, nobody was asked, nobody asked to be resettled.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: So when the Germans came in, what was happening?</span> <span id="s141">Were you, you were in Sattagura(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No.</span> <span id="s143">When the Germans came in I was already married to Sam and I was in his apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Okay then let's, let me backtrack a bit here.</span> <span id="s145">You have explained as well as Sam has explained how you got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Didn't really know each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: You knew of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did he know you?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I don't think so, but I don't know, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Because you had studied at the conservatory?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: It's, do you have any remembrance of what was going through your mind?</span> <span id="s156">You went there to find work, you went to the conservatory to find work and you immediately got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s158">Yes, I do have memory of that.</span> <span id="s159">My, first of all, I was terribly afraid because I had left my home, my mother had said run.</span> <span id="s160">And she had given me a brown bag with some black bread and I believe it was lard.</span> <span id="s161">And also she had told me to put on two dresses, one on top of the other because I could not carry anything.</span> <span id="s162">I have to run and nobody should know that I'm running.</span> <span id="s163">So I put on a summer dress and over it a winter dress and made my way to Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Why were you running there?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Because the, this was the Soviets.</span> <span id="s166">Because the, a neighbor had said, who was friendly with a Soviet soldier, that he had told her that this night they are going to come for the whole family, after they had taken my father away.</span> <span id="s167">And so my mother had said, run and go to Czernowitz and stay with this family, trying to remember their name, Isinger(ph), Isinger(ph).</span> <span id="s168">Well, it wasn't easy.</span> <span id="s169">First of all the fear.</span> <span id="s170">When you are under curfew, there were everywhere soldiers and when they saw somebody moving they stopped him and wanted to know where are you going.</span> <span id="s171">Well, I knew the area very well, I managed somehow to make it to the next town.</span> <span id="s172">All night it took me.</span> <span id="s173">And when I came there, the Isingers(ph) told me they could not put me up because there was a raid in this apartment house and a number of people, whole families, were taken away.</span> <span id="s174">At that time they didn't know where to.</span> <span id="s175">We know now it was to Siberia.</span> <span id="s176">And so I had nowhere to go but to the Philharmonic, which also housed the Conservatory of Music, which also housed a movie theater, which was called Keynote Central.</span> <span id="s177">When I came there, I was dead tired, because I'd walked all night and I knew the building very well.</span> <span id="s178">I went up into this projection room, from the movie, knowing that nobody would be there at that time and I feel asleep o the floor.</span> <span id="s179">And I thought when I wake up in the morning, the only thing I could do, was to try to see if I could find a job in the conservatory, because I had just graduated, you know.</span> <span id="s180">So when I woke up it was not morning, it was closer to 12 noon.</span> <span id="s181">I had slept several hours and when I came to the office of the conservatory, this man was just closing the office.</span> <span id="s182">It was 12 and in Europe between 12 and one is lunch hour and I said, "Could I come in for a moment, I'm looking for a job."</span> <span id="s183">And he looked at me and he said, "A job?</span> <span id="s184">At 12 o'clock noon?</span> <span id="s185">This is time for lunch, not for a job."</span> <span id="s186">You know, he was very flip and I was not in the mood for, for this type of conversation, so I said, "No, no, I want a job."</span> <span id="s187">He said, "What, what job?"</span> <span id="s188">I said, "Well, I've, here's my paper, I have graduated from the conservatory and I am a pianist."</span> <span id="s189">He said, "Well, now look, how much money do you have?"</span> <span id="s190">And I said, "Three rubles," something like 75 cents.</span> <span id="s191">And he said, "That's enough."</span> <span id="s192">And I said, "What?"</span> <span id="s193">I thought for lunch.</span> <span id="s194">"No," he said, "It's enough to get married."</span> <span id="s195">And I said, "No, no, please don't joke with me, my mind is not on that."</span> <span id="s196">He said, "Well I am not going to open this office door until I come back at one, but if you want to, you can come with me."</span> <span id="s197">And I trailed after him and I thought we were going to eat something and we went into some building.</span> <span id="s198">See, in the, at that time, every building was different from what we were used to.</span> <span id="s199">So we went up one or two flights of stairs.</span> <span id="s200">[End of Side 1 of Tape 1].</span> <span id="s201">So we went up there and a young woman, around 17, asked, sitting behind a desk, asked, "Do you want to get married?"</span> <span id="s202">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s203">And she asked him, "Do you live with this woman?"</span> <span id="s204">He said, "No."</span> <span id="s205">"Do you live with another woman?"</span> <span id="s206">"No."</span> <span id="s207">"Do you have children?"</span> <span id="s208">"No."</span> <span id="s209">"You have children with this woman?"</span> <span id="s210">"No."</span> <span id="s211">"Do you have children with another woman?"</span> <span id="s212">"No."</span> <span id="s213">Then she asked me the same questions and to me all of this was an insult, because I never even had a date.</span> <span id="s214">And when this procedure was finished, she called over a man who was sweeping the floor, whose name I don't know to this day and he was the witness who signed and we got a piece of paper and we went downstairs and as we went downstairs, naturally we spoke German.</span> <span id="s215">He asked me, in the very formal German, ______ "By the way, what is your name?"</span> <span id="s216">And this after we got married.</span> <span id="s217">And so we went back to the conservatory, he enrolled me as a pianist accompanist and gave me right away work to do in a certain room with a choir, and told me at five o'clock we meet in front of the building and we go home.</span> <span id="s218">And no more running around.</span> <span id="s219">He never asked about my background, he never asked me what happened and he told me he had a mother and a sister at home, which I didn't believe, but I had no choice, I had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s220">And at five o'clock I went with him and when we came home to his apartment, there was a mother and there was a sister.</span> <span id="s221">And now it was up to, it was their turn to be shocked because here was their famous son and brother, who had left in the morning a bachelor and had come back and told them, they asked, "Who is this?"</span> <span id="s222">And he answered, "This is another Flor in the family."</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Didn't this seem mildly crazy to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes, but I, I was very, very frightened.</span> <span id="s225">I had, it felt as though I had lost my equilibrium completely.</span> <span id="s226">You know, it was unbelievable how that had worked on me, the fact that they took my stepfather away and my mother went every day with food to a certain place where many women stood in line, their husbands had been taken the same way.</span> <span id="s227">Or maybe their sons, or brothers.</span> <span id="s228">And I think there were mostly men that they had taken at that time.</span> <span id="s229">And then one day, my mother came, maybe she had already been six weeks, every day and one day there was another guard and he said, "He's not here, he never was here."</span> <span id="s230">You know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s232">Let me ask you something, this is just sort of an interesting point, I mean if the men were taken away first, this, didn't this put the women of these towns in a completely different role and situation now?</span> <span id="s233">I mean in terms of their responsibility and...</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Sure, sure, cause they had to do everything, they had to fend for themselves.</span> <span id="s235">But that didn't make them more assertive, they were very courageous, but women were not very assertive to begin with.</span> <span id="s236">So it was just a matter of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Did you see a change in your mother after your father was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s239">And, and even when my mother survived 17 years of Siberia and even after I found her again and she came to us here in the United States, when I tried to discuss with her what happened there, she never wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s240">And she said to me, whenever I asked to tell me about it, she said, "No.</span> <span id="s241">No, no."</span> <span id="s242">And then I said, but, one day I got very angry and I said, "They took your husband away and they killed him and you don't even know where he's buried and you don't want to talk about it?"</span> <span id="s243">And she answered very quietly, "He was an enemy of the people."</span> <span id="s244">And this was the man she loved and believed in.</span> <span id="s245">So they had done a very good job on her.</span> <span id="s246">I finally got her to tell me that she would, she had promised that main chief there never to talk about this event.</span> <span id="s247">He had said to her, "If you ever want to see your children again, you will forget all that you lived here, all that you saw here."</span> <span id="s248">And she never wanted to talk about and to this day I do not know.</span> <span id="s249">Except here and there a little bit.</span> <span id="s250">She told me about this guard who had a child.</span> <span id="s251">I think it was probably only one child, one little boy and when he knew that she knew languages, particularly French, he wanted her to speak French to him and he gave her a glass of milk a day.</span> <span id="s252">And she, her living quarters were slightly improved, she shared a room with a lady from Czernowitz whose husband was also taken away, but he was taken because he was a leading Zionist and his name was Weiselberger(ph), very well known.</span> <span id="s253">I think he was a lawyer, I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s254">So with this Mrs. Weiselberger(ph) she shared a room in Siberia and then when Kruschev came to power and somehow permitted people over 65, if they had relatives in Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You actually told me this.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes, to, to come out, so Mrs. Weiselberger(ph) came out and brought along a letter from my mother to her brother in South America.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: And you were able to?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yes, that's how we...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Some of these areas that we've recorded, I'm going to skip over because in the interest of time and your energy.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: So, you were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did that, I realize many, many years later that it was a good marriage, but in the beginning was that terribly awkward for you or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: I can't say how it was, I was completely dead inside.</span> <span id="s265">You know, it was often an irony to me, that when the Germans took us into the concentration camp a year later, the Soviets had done such a job on me that I was not able to be more shocked, more afraid.</span> <span id="s266">They had already killed me, inside.</span> <span id="s267">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s268">To me, you know, the word Siberia, as you may know in all of Soviet or Russian literature, usually meant that people never returned from there.</span> <span id="s269">So, I don't know what else to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: When you say that the Soviets had already destroyed you, you're talking about by taking away your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Not any personal brutality?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s274">Just by, and you know, it was so strange to think, why do they have to resort to such terror?</span> <span id="s275">If life is so complete that each person is taken care of from the day of their birth to the day of their death, why do they have to, to terrorize people by taking them away?</span> <span id="s276">If they want to take away a house, why must they send this person to Siberia?</span> <span id="s277">If they want to take away somebody's flour mill or somebody's business, why must this person be destroyed?</span> <span id="s278">You know, almost all these people would have been perfectly satisfied to become employees of the, of the government in their former own place of work.</span> <span id="s279">But, as I think back, I know that the reason must be that they had to destroy the middle class and that's what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: What happened when the Germans came in?</span> <span id="s281">You were in Czernowitz at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s283">When the Germans came in, it happened very fast, so fast that the Soviets could barely run as fast as the Germans followed them.</span> <span id="s284">Our town was by that time already, they had undergone the, the Soviet terror of a large group of them being deported and nobody knew where to.</span> <span id="s285">Only now do we know where to.</span> <span id="s286">And, of course the coming of the Germans meant that they will first of all go after the Jew that were still there and so most of the Jews tried desperately to run with the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You and Sam, what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: We were, we, we knew that if we stayed, the Germans will kill us, but we also knew that there was no way of running with the Soviets.</span> <span id="s289">And, but still, we went down to the bridge and there were guards, but you couldn't get through the bridge to go east, because these guards were there to make sure that first of all, all the Soviet Russians should get over the bridge.</span> <span id="s290">So they didn't let us through and we, and we went home and we said if we have to die, we'll die in our own bed.</span> <span id="s291">A friend of ours, who is a, an opera singer, his name is Paul Marco(ph), he had come from Bucharest to Czernowitz when the Soviets came in, because in Bucharest, under the Romanians who were allied with the Nazis, he had no future at all.</span> <span id="s292">Well, he was able to get over the bridge, together with a group of Russian singers.</span> <span id="s293">And his story is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s294">He knew, the more he got into the Soviet Union, the more he wanted to get out of there and couldn't, couldn't.</span> <span id="s295">Anyway, we went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Were there bombings?</span> <span id="s297">How did the Germans come in ?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: We heard bombings, we heard the noises of war, but we stayed in our apartment and one or two days later, I think was that they came in and took all the men out, I think Sam may have told you about this and took them to what the Soviets call the _____, the Palace of Culture and there, I believe that, I was sure that I'll never see Sam again, but he has told you that, that he managed to get away from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Well, you've told me as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s301">See I don't think... They used Sam to dig graves for, I don't know how they did it, to count one, two, three and every third person, I don't remember exactly, but somehow he found his way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: So at what point did you have to leave your house, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: You know, I don't know, I don't exactly know when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Well wait, let me, do we have a sense of whether it was a few weeks later, a couple months later, a few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: It was, I think a few weeks or months later, not immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: What happened in these few weeks or these few months, were, would you go about your business, could you go out on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No.</span> <span id="s308">We were permitted one hour a day to go out and to get some water from a well, which was about a half a block away from where we lived and we went only women, never a man.</span> <span id="s309">We were sort of in hiding, but we really didn't have where to hide, we were in our apartment.</span> <span id="s310">I think this was a few weeks or months and then came the...</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: So the men didn't go out on the street at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So basically life stopped and you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s315">And then we had to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s316">We...</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: One day, there was, there were signs all over, posters, that said all the Jews must go, find a place to live in the ghettos, it's the ghetto was really the collection point for the future deportations to Transnistria(ph).</span> <span id="s318">We had a friend who lived in one of those streets, in that ghetto and we went there and stayed in her apartment.</span> <span id="s319">This friend is now also here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: How long did you live in the ghetto, approximately?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: That's very difficult.</span> <span id="s322">Not long.</span> <span id="s323">Not, not very long.</span> <span id="s324">There was a, trying to remember, there was a mayor of Czernowitz, who was a very decent guy.</span> <span id="s325">His name was Tryon(ph) Popovitch(ph).</span> <span id="s326">I think he did all he could to help the Jews.</span> <span id="s327">I think if he were alive, he would be called a righteous gentile.</span> <span id="s328">He did help a, a number of Jews.</span> <span id="s329">He had the right of requesting, for, for work, a certain, a few thousand such papers, you know, to, to say this Jew is absolutely necessary for our work and in this way he saved about, I'd say, 20,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s330">Only temporarily.</span> <span id="s331">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: I'm curious what your daily life was like in this ghetto, could you go in and out?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Was there food, was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: You know, I do not recall anything about this.</span> <span id="s336">I, I recall less about this even than during, than later on in the camp.</span> <span id="s337">We, I have no idea how we were, I know we, we didn't go out.</span> <span id="s338">I know we were absolutely paralyzed with fear, because we didn't know from moment to moment what was going to happen to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s341">As I say, we were in this apartment that belonged to my friend.</span> <span id="s342">I imagine that there may have been some food because that was a different proposition than later on in the camp, but I can't explain how we did it and what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Were, were German guards present, were Romanian guards present?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: Romanian, Romanian guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So they were actually doing the work for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: And what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: We were afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Because they were the authority and we were afraid of any kind of authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Did they abuse people, were they nasty?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I don't have a recollection of that.</span> <span id="s353">I do know that, that Romanians, I don't know, it, it, see, I don't want to say something that I'm not sure about.</span> <span id="s354">The Romanians were often helpful when you could bribe them.</span> <span id="s355">They were not as vicious perhaps as, let's say, the, the Lithuanians for instance, or the Ukrainians, they were terrible sometimes.</span> <span id="s356">The Romanians you could, once in awhile they could help you.</span> <span id="s357">It's very difficult to recall all of this after you've tried so hard to forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Now did you know anything at this point about camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: In Poland or anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s362">We knew nothing and we knew that one day, some day, we would be deported, but we thought that it would simply be a work camp, where people have to work.</span> <span id="s363">After all, there was a war going on, so if everybody had to give their share, probably we had to work, we didn't think of anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Need some water?</span> <span id="s365">Now you were probably in the ghetto for about six months or so, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: And did you have any, did you know anything about deportations, did you think you would have to leave at some point and go somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s369">We had heard that there were people in Morgalev(ph), this here and that probably when our turn comes, we will go in the same route, you know.</span> <span id="s370">And then one day, they came for us and, and we went.</span> <span id="s371">And we were put into cattle cars and I do not recall how long the trip was, several days, several nights and finally we came to this place which was called Carrera(ph) di Piatra(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Do you, did they take the whole ghetto population or did they take certain kinds of people at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: That I don't know, I don't think they could have taken the whole population at once.</span> <span id="s374">I imagine they took parts of...</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Do you know how they prioritized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I've no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Who were the, who were the people you went with?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I know only that I went with Sam and his mother and his sister and other than that I didn't know, for instance this girlfriend of mine, in whose apartment we lived, I don't recall that she went with us, at that time.</span> <span id="s379">I know she did go, but not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So maybe they came for you...</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: ...first because you were the intellectuals, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Yes, probably, probably that's what it was.</span> <span id="s384">Because our entire group that was deposited on the stone quarry were the intellectuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Do you remember the mood or how you felt on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Terrible.</span> <span id="s387">Unbelievable, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s388">First of all there was so many people that you could not move and of course we didn't know where we were going, we didn't know what expected us, we didn't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s389">And of course the people who had to relieve themselves couldn't do it and had to do it and then after several hours when the train stopped and then opened the doors and they permitted and, people to get out and relieve themselves, they all relieved themselves right there, in front of each other.</span> <span id="s390">It became suddenly just so humiliating, so terrible, our life was worth nothing.</span> <span id="s391">(pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: All right, so continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Well, you were just talking about the experience of being transported to Carrera(ph) di Piatra(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Were people hysterical?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s398">Some were hysterical, some were very quiet and depressed and on the Carrera(ph) we saw naked people lying, some were dead, some were not dead, emaciated and the insane people hunching over them and eating them alive.</span> <span id="s399">And on the Carrera(ph) there were a few buildings that had no windows, the war had gone, had happened there before this happened and in these few buildings, we were, I would say, 20 or 30 people in a small room, so that, and we slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s400">It was so tight that when one person wanted to turn at night, everybody else had to turn.</span> <span id="s401">No trees.</span> <span id="s402">There were, it was a stone quarry.</span> <span id="s403">Some grass grew between the stones.</span> <span id="s404">That's what we used to just try to have something in our mouths and we still had some, a few things that we brought from home, like a, a piece of salami or something and people were very, very frightened and once a day, certain people were permitted to go with a pail of water downstairs, this was, the stone quarry was like a mountain, you know and you, or a hill, you went down and down on the bottom was a stream and on that stream...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">End of Tape 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: So you were at this Carrera(ph) di Piatra(ph)...</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: ...for a short time?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s411">I would say maybe one, two or three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And they, you didn't work, you really didn't do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: How did you get out of there, did you have any thoughts on what would happen next?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: No, we had no thoughts, but one day they came and made the roll call and at that roll call they set aside a man who was a glazier, a man who was a carpenter, a man who was a, I don't know, builder, a doctor who was a surgeon and they called Professor Samuel Flor and he didn't move, because they separated the people that, these few people, the builders and that were in one corner and all the others were put on this side and we knew this side meant across the book and Sam didn't want to budge and the man said, "Are you Samuel Flor?"</span> <span id="s416">And he said, "Yes, but I'm not a professor, I am a dentist."</span> <span id="s417">So he put him, he told you this story, he put him in the corner together with the surgeon and with the few people who were supposed to fix up the hospital, ___ was in the vicinity, we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s418">And then Sam said, "I do need a person who, who can help as an assistant."</span> <span id="s419">And this uniformed man said, "Do you have one?"</span> <span id="s420">And he said, "Yes, I know one girl who is a good assistant."</span> <span id="s421">And he took me.</span> <span id="s422">They didn't know that we were married and this is how we began to walk.</span> <span id="s423">We walked from Carrera(ph) di Piatra(ph) probably two or three days until we came to a point, which was LaDijing(ph) and then we walked a little further and we came to Toolchin(ph) and that is where they had to fix up the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Who went to this hospital, who was the hospital for?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: The hospital was, I imagine for Romanian soldiers and maybe occasionally for a native who lived there, you know.</span> <span id="s426">We were put into a ghetto in Toolchin(ph) and in this ghetto we had to stay and every morning we were taken out to the hospital and in the evening we were brought back by guard.</span> <span id="s427">And in the hospital we, we worked to clean it up and to, to make a hospital out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Did you have any sense of freedom at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s430">Because even if we were in the hospital, we were not allowed to leave.</span> <span id="s431">We were brought there and we were brought back.</span> <span id="s432">No, we never had a sense of freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Were you afraid or did you feel somewhat safe there in Toolchin(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: We were always expecting the worst.</span> <span id="s435">We never felt this is good, or this is, nothing can happen to us, no, this, this was impossible, to think that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Was, was this a large ghetto or organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s438">It was, I think it took place in Toolchin(ph) in a couple of streets where Jews lived before, the Soviet Jews, because they, they, some of them remained there, not all of them ran with the Soviets, some of them were older people, couldn't run.</span> <span id="s439">So this was, I would say, as large as, maybe three or four blocks.</span> <span id="s440">One street.</span> <span id="s441">And houses were demolished from the war.</span> <span id="s442">Most of the houses didn't have windows, I mean they had windows, but no glass.</span> <span id="s443">And when we came there, we lived a sometimes four, sometimes six to a room.</span> <span id="s444">When we were settled, we were, let's see, Sam's mother and sister lived in one room and we found a possibility to move into another room, Sam and I. And for a short while we lived alone and then they brought a man very sick with Typhus and nobody wanted to let, to have him, cause it was very contagious.</span> <span id="s445">And we were very young, we didn't care, we didn't have, we were not thinking that something could happen to us in that way, so they put him into our room and he shared the, this was not a bed, it was made of a piece of wood, you know, but it was not directly on the floor, it was a little higher, so we shared this with him, what do you call this?</span> <span id="s446">Not a bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Platform?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Yeah, something like that.</span> <span id="s449">Well, the man died after a few days.</span> <span id="s450">Sam had a wonderful conversation with him.</span> <span id="s451">He, he said to Sam, "Someday when you survive, I want you to play the violin on Yom Kippur for me and to play ______."</span> <span id="s452">And you know, Sam did it, last year.</span> <span id="s453">He went over here to a synagogue, to a Rabbi Holien(ph), told him the story and the rabbi said okay and he played it and it was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: I want to do something, just a minute.</span> <span id="s455">How organized was this ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes, it was organized.</span> <span id="s457">It was organized.</span> <span id="s458">But I don't know very much about it.</span> <span id="s459">I know that there was, there were a couple or three more prominent men who ran it, so to speak, Jewish.</span> <span id="s460">But I have no idea what their function was.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Who guarded the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Well, I think it was Romanians and Germans, because, more Romanians I think, the Romanians had more of an authority there.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Were there Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I don't recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Was there a system for you to get food or get medical help or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I think there was some sort of a system that the Jews among themselves made, to have a soup kitchen, I think there was that.</span> <span id="s467">But I do not recall whether there was medical help.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Were there any activities in the ghetto, did people at least privately, worship or sing or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yeah, maybe there was.</span> <span id="s470">I don't recall exactly what it was, but I do recall that there was one very talented poet who sort of made little ditties pertaining to the ghetto and put them to music and sang it for us and making fun of our lives, yes there was some.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Not all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: But so there was some, some humor and some way to compensate for...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Yes, yes, yes, that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: Do you remember anything about conversations or whether people had any thoughts about what was happening, whether or not they'd be, get through this or how to get through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Nobody.</span> <span id="s477">I don't recall that anybody talked about this.</span> <span id="s478">I know that when I discovered the hole underneath our floor and I knew that the time would come when we have to run because we already could hear the, the shooting, the cannons and you could hear that they're coming closer and these things don't happen overnight, not in one day.</span> <span id="s479">And we knew that the Ukrainians, who lived outside the ghetto would not hide any of us.</span> <span id="s480">They would simply, even if they wanted to, they would be afraid to do it because they would know that they couldn't get away with it and we also knew that you couldn't even hide in a tree because they, it was winter, there were no leaves, you couldn't hide.</span> <span id="s481">So, so the only way that I had the idea was that we should cut open this floor and hide underneath, which everybody thought was insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Did you have contact with the local Ukrainian population?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yes, a little bit, very little.</span> <span id="s484">There was one dentist, a Ukrainian who came to the hospital and when Sam needed, for instance to make a crown for somebody, he had to give it to this man, to this dentist, who was a technician, who made it and brought it back to him.</span> <span id="s485">This, he seemed like a very decent guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Do you think he shared information with Sam?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Never, never.</span> <span id="s488">He never spoke about anything but the dentistry.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: It's, in a way it seems a little far fetched that Sam, all of a sudden one day became a dentist.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: How did you pull that off?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: It was unbelievable, but you, but it was a matter of life and death.</span> <span id="s493">If, if he didn't say he was a dentist, he would have been killed.</span> <span id="s494">He would have been sent across the ____.</span> <span id="s495">And the, he didn't, he wasn't so frightened because he had next to him this good friend the doctor, Dr. Rard(ph), who was a very prominent surgeon and he was sure that Dr. Rard(ph) would pull all the teeth for him.</span> <span id="s496">And you know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s497">Dr. Rard(ph) had to operate on a German captain who was brought in from the front and he died on the operating table and Dr. Rard(ph) was taken out and was shot.</span> <span id="s498">And suddenly Sam was without his friend and the only thing we could find was an old book in the Russian, which we had to study, a dentistry book.</span> <span id="s499">We found it in the hospital and I read it to Sam and translated it for him.</span> <span id="s500">That's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: So every day you'd study a little dentistry and he figured it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s503">He was brilliant as a dentist.</span> <span id="s504">He pulled two of my teeth, I don't know if I told you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: _____ you all decided not to stick with the profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: He didn't want to, but they offered him at the University of Minnesota, a scholarship or fellowship, they were so impressed.</span> <span id="s507">He gave them a speech about his experiences and they wanted him to study, he didn't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: I'm going to wait for this airplane to pass over.</span> <span id="s509">Your sister and mother-in-law at this point were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Sam's sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Right, your sister-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: So they were able to come to Toolchin(ph) as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: I'm going to jump ahead...</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: To the Czech army experiences.</span> <span id="s518">After liberation you joined the Czech army?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: By the way, the liberation was awful.</span> <span id="s520">When, when we finally didn't hear any more shooting and we were downstairs, some 78 people, I don't recall exactly how many, we expected 18 people to be downstairs because those 18 people knew about what we were doing, you know, they were in the same area.</span> <span id="s521">But when the Germans really had to retreat, they began to shoot people and so all of a sudden they came in, came in, came in and we were 78 and you know, we were, right above us was our room and we, on the floors there was just straw, you know and then suddenly, we, we heard heavy boots like German boots, you know, you can't mistake that, above us and we were as quiet as possible and we heard them speak German.</span> <span id="s522">We knew at that moment that they must have found us, but it wasn't.</span> <span id="s523">They happened to have entered this room and they put a cannon in front of this room and they used that room to sleep over and we were underneath.</span> <span id="s524">At first we were quite sure that they knew we are downstairs and they are going to just kill us all.</span> <span id="s525">But then, the next morning and you, we were so quiet, you could just not imagine how quiet you have to be and the next morning they left.</span> <span id="s526">And after they left we were still there, quiet and then we decided we couldn't stand it any more, we could begin to feel smoke coming through and we decided we couldn't do anything but at that time they had left.</span> <span id="s527">And when we came out we were just pale and green and, and there were a few Russian partisans, maybe boys of age 13 or 14 who came and they looked at us and they said, in Russian, _____, "And who are you?"</span> <span id="s528">They didn't know who we were.</span> <span id="s529">And we asked them, "And who are you?"</span> <span id="s530">And they said, "Me Russki(ph) partisani(ph)."</span> <span id="s531">Then all we could think of was to get home.</span> <span id="s532">But that, that was impossible.</span> <span id="s533">That was not possible, we had no way how to get home.</span> <span id="s534">Then, one or one trucker came by and had heard that there are some Jews who, maybe Jews have something to give to them, maybe they'll give them a ride.</span> <span id="s535">And he said, "If you give me some vodka, I take you to _____."</span> <span id="s536">So we, so a group of us got together and whatever we still had, a top or a blouse, or something, we exchanged with some peasants for vodka and we gave it to them and they took us.</span> <span id="s537">And they took us maybe two or three kilometers in a forest and dumped us in there and said, "The Germans didn't do a very good job with you, they should have killed you all."</span> <span id="s538">And then we had to start walking, that was our liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Did you believe you were really liberated, I mean did...</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No, we couldn't believe it, because first of all the war went back and forth, it was not just in one direction all the time.</span> <span id="s541">The, the Germans had left, the Soviets came back and you could think, okay, that's it.</span> <span id="s542">No, then the Germans were lucky or there were not enough Soviet soldiers in that one spot, they came and took back part of that area again.</span> <span id="s543">It was awful.</span> <span id="s544">We were, we were absolutely torn back and forth, we didn't know from moment to moment when the Germans are going to be back.</span> <span id="s545">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: At what point did you join the Czech army?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: When we came back to Czernowitz, in the hope of getting back to our apartment, Sam's apartment.</span> <span id="s548">I never tried to go home to Sattagura(ph) and at Sam's apartment were some people who said, "You better get away from here before we call the police, because if we call," these were again the Soviets, "if we call them, you're going to land in Siberia."</span> <span id="s549">And we had heard from other people that this is, in fact has happened.</span> <span id="s550">People who had survived concentration camp and who could think of nothing but to return to their home, returned to their home where some people lived, who maybe paid nothing for that apartment of for that house, but considered it their own and had a powerful weapon, that all they had to do is to say, "These people are no good, they are enemy of the state."</span> <span id="s551">And that's all.</span> <span id="s552">So we quickly disappeared from the, from this apartment, didn't pressure them or anything and it so happened that the Czech army passed by Czernowitz at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Want to ask you a question, before you continue.</span> <span id="s554">Did you think that maybe you'd be, your mother would return at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I didn't even know whether my mother was alive.</span> <span id="s556">I didn't know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: But had you thought of going back to your hometown in case she was alive and coming home?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Never.</span> <span id="s559">I never thought of going back to the hometown.</span> <span id="s560">I couldn't even think of going back to this small town.</span> <span id="s561">In that small town, we had heard, this long back that the Jews that had not gone away with the Russians were killed in the one night before the Germans came to occupy the town, by the native people.</span> <span id="s562">They were all herded together on one hill and they were all killed, I don't know how, I don't know whether they were shot or with knives or what, but they were all killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: So you just had no thought of going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: When, at this point did you have more information about the other camps and the killing centers, did you learn anything more at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: We knew that there were, there were camps, we knew about Mogilev, you know Mogilev and some other places in the vicinity, Bareshot(ph), I don't know if these, this means anything.</span> <span id="s567">But we didn't, there was no time to dwell upon what happened in those other camps because you were constantly busy trying to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: What does it mean?</span> <span id="s570">I don't know what it means because really you...</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Busy trying to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: You were not involved with what went on somewhere else, you also didn't know it, there were no newspapers.</span> <span id="s573">You depended maybe on the rumors and in fact, you didn't want to know too much, all you wanted to, was from day to day to see whether you could make it.</span> <span id="s574">I don't know how else to explain this.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: You've told me a little bit about the Czech army before.</span> <span id="s576">I'm, I'd love to hear a little bit about some of the places that you liberated with the Czech army.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: What kind of experience that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s580">We were, in the Czech army, I have to say, it was a moment of a wonderful feeling, to not be less than a louse, as we were in the concentration camp where they had power over us and we had nothing.</span> <span id="s581">In the Czech army we were constantly facing the enemy, maybe one or two miles away, no more.</span> <span id="s582">The Germans were in front of us, the Soviets were behind us or next to us.</span> <span id="s583">We were allied soldiers of the Soviets.</span> <span id="s584">But, the sense of camaraderie between the people in the Czech army was absolutely magnificent, these were Jews, but not all of them were Jews, there were quite a few non-Jews.</span> <span id="s585">These were people who had run away from Hitler into Poland, when Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s586">In Poland, they didn't know that the Soviets would occupy that part of Poland and when the Soviets came, the Soviets regarded these people as unreliables and put them into Siberia.</span> <span id="s587">Cause they said they weren't sure who they are.</span> <span id="s588">And in Siberia, at a certain moment in time, there was, everyone who was Czech was asked to join the Czech army.</span> <span id="s589">The Czech army consisted of all kinds of people, Jews and non-Jews, but mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s590">Women, children, old people, sick people, anybody who could walk, joined the army.</span> <span id="s591">It began in Boosoulouk(ph), in the, in the very interior of Soviet Russia, where, where the majority were concentrated and there were about 5,000 people who made up this army.</span> <span id="s592">These people were so magnificent, most of them very, very well...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">[End of Side 1 of Tape 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Okay, you were talking about the Czech army?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yeah and this man, who had run away from Prague, his name was Ed Haas, H-a-a-s.</span> <span id="s596">When he came, when the Soviets got hold of him and he said he was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia and they found him in Poland.</span> <span id="s597">He said, they asked him, like they ask everybody, what is your father's name, because you know in the Soviets, the father's name is always part of your name and he said, "My father's name is Adolph(ph)."</span> <span id="s598">"Adolph(ph), three years."</span> <span id="s599">Simply because this was the name of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: But tell me a little bit about, for example, you liberated Prague, what was that like, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: It was very, very wonderful.</span> <span id="s602">First of all, we lost many of our soldiers before that.</span> <span id="s603">We started out in the Ukraine and went by way of Ducla(ph), which is a pass in the Carpathian, in the Tatra(ph).</span> <span id="s604">And the Ducla(ph) pass, we were held up endlessly long, it was difficult to get through and it was held by very few Germans but they were on the top and they saw us and we were on, in the valley.</span> <span id="s605">And anyway, many, many weeks it took before we could take the Ducla(ph) pass and then, then we were, we ended the war, the war was at an end when we liberated Prague.</span> <span id="s606">What was it like?</span> <span id="s607">It was for us very wonderful and for the people of Prague I don't know.</span> <span id="s608">They must have had mixed feelings because they also didn't know what is in store for them.</span> <span id="s609">One thing that I remember that turned me off and made me want to leave Europe for good was when we, we had survived concentration camp and was now in the Czech uniform and when we came to the first city in Slovakia, Koshitza(ph), we got orders to arrest anybody in the street who speaks German.</span> <span id="s610">And I said, "Sam, this is not for me.</span> <span id="s611">We were in a situation where we were persecuted for no reason at all, I do not want to be part of a group of people who persecute somebody for speaking any language.</span> <span id="s612">I don't want to live there."</span> <span id="s613">And that is when I decided, no more Europe.</span> <span id="s614">That was the time.</span> <span id="s615">And by the way, when President Benish(ph), who was the President of Czechoslovakia, returned for the very first time from London to Koshitza(ph), to the first town in Czechoslovakia, it was Sam who conducted the orchestra for his welcome and he still has the program to show.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: But when you went into these towns, I mean you weren't a soldier before, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: I was a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Then.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I learned very fast to be a soldier, but what did I do mostly?</span> <span id="s620">I used my languages very much, I translated from all kinds of Slavic languages to German or vice versa and they needed people who did that because when they, when they took, they were the Czech army and when they were in need of to talk to someone who spoke German, that's what we did.</span> <span id="s621">We also used our musical gifts whenever we could.</span> <span id="s622">Sam conducted an orchestra, but not all day, only in the evening and I collected folk songs in Czech, in Slovak, in Russian and sang them for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s623">And I knew, when I was sent out with this, I would be singing a concert for about several hundred or thousand soldiers and the next day I would be sent to a hospital and find, this was a small army, I knew many of these soldiers personally.</span> <span id="s624">Found them without arms, without legs, that was kind of tough because you see the terrain that we got to work on was, the Russians gave us that terrain which was very difficult and it was very much mined.</span> <span id="s625">There were lots of mines there.</span> <span id="s626">Many of our friends lost their eyes and some got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: So you were really in battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: All the time, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And you had a gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Did you use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: I didn't use it, but I learned how to use it.</span> <span id="s633">I was lucky, I never was in a situation to just face, because I have a feeling they would have killed me first.</span> <span id="s634">I don't know, I don't think I could kill a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: But you came in contact with, did you come in contact with an opposing army?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: We were, we were, one night, I'll tell you this, one night we were in a peasant's hut, sleeping and it was summer, windows were open and I woke up, I've a very light sleep and I saw a, a German helmet sneak by the window and I pushed Sam and I said, "The Germans are here."</span> <span id="s637">And he was very tired, he said, "Let me sleep."</span> <span id="s638">And I didn't say anything, they didn't come in.</span> <span id="s639">You know what we found?</span> <span id="s640">That some chickens, that the previous day we had organized, they had come by and they had stolen those chickens.</span> <span id="s641">And that was, that was a moment where, had he been awake, maybe I wouldn't be here to tell it to you.</span> <span id="s642">Yes, that's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Were there a lot of close calls?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yes, yes, there were a lot of close calls.</span> <span id="s645">Once Sam and I, because we speak German, were sent to across German lines to let a group of generals who were on a meeting and were encircled by the Germans, to let them know that help is on the way.</span> <span id="s646">And we had to, to, to, to go on a highway that was completely patrolled by Germans.</span> <span id="s647">That was very close.</span> <span id="s648">We were just lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: You were in a truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No, in a, what do you call this?</span> <span id="s651">You know, the, a little, no come on, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s652">A, a, a, can't think of the word.</span> <span id="s653">Not a truck, the smallest vehicle.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: A motorcycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: A motorcycle with a sidecar.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Well you said that when you entered Prague, it was exciting for you, but you don't know how the people felt...</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Is that the general reaction when you went into...</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: ...Levov(ph) and you went into all of these place?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s662">We liberated Levov(ph), we liberated ______ Krakau.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: And no reaction from the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yes, yes, there is always a reaction from the people, there are always a group of people who come out singing and then there is always another group of people who sit at home and don't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s665">That's how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Were any of these cities that you went in destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Most of them were destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Prague was not?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: What was it like going into cities that had been devastated?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I, I can't say that we were shocked because we had already gone through so much and the people who lived there had gone through so much.</span> <span id="s672">What was it like?</span> <span id="s673">I think that we did not spend very much time to think what was, what is it like because we went through this and continued going, we didn't stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: So the act of liberation was basically being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Because the, you were, the Germans were already ahead of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: And you didn't stay long enough to get any direction of the people or?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: No.</span> <span id="s680">Or if, when it may have been another company, you know, that gave direction.</span> <span id="s681">All I know, we were always the first, you know, to come in and then as we came in, we continued.</span> <span id="s682">I have a cramp in my leg, oops.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: When you left Europe, your intent was to go to South America because you had an uncle there?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s685">We waited in Paris for six months and when that first boat left, we were on it, that was the _____.</span> <span id="s686">The boat came to New York, we never dreamed about going to New York, but we had no choice and in New York I asked Sam, "Do you know anybody in New York or in America?"</span> <span id="s687">And he said, "Yeah, I think a sister of my mother went from, many years ago, to New York and married a man by the name of Sitomer(ph) and I think she lived in the Bronx."</span> <span id="s688">So when we came to New York and were in the hotel, I looked into the phone book, not knowing that New York has many phone books and I saw only one, that was the Manhattan phone book, cause we were on 96th and Westend(ph) and I looked for Sitomer(ph) and there were five of them, so I called the first one and it happened to be the aunt and when we told her who we, who we were, she had seen Sam when he was five years old.</span> <span id="s689">And she said, "Where are you?"</span> <span id="s690">And I said, "96th and, and Westend(ph)."</span> <span id="s691">And she says, "Don't move, I will be right there."</span> <span id="s692">Turned out she was on 85th and Broadway and she was there in five minutes and when she came she went to the phone and she called somebody in Philadelphia and said, "Harry, you wouldn't believe it, my sister's son Sam is here."</span> <span id="s693">And two hours later, Harry Good(ph) was with us.</span> <span id="s694">He put us in the car and brought us to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s695">And these are the two people I showed you and they were so wonderful, we spent a wonderful day or two with them and then they brought us back to New York and then we were on the way to South America and all I could think of was I want to live in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: What were your first impressions of New York, other than you were fortunate to find people and...</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: What were your impressions of New York or America?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Fantastic, I kept thinking, how is it possible that in, on one and the same planet, there is one place which is hell, Europe and then we come here and this is paradise.</span> <span id="s700">People were so friendly.</span> <span id="s701">You know people, everybody said, "How are you?"</span> <span id="s702">And everybody answered, "Just fine."</span> <span id="s703">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s704">Everybody was just fine.</span> <span id="s705">I hadn't heard things like that in years.</span> <span id="s706">It was an unbelievable atmosphere.</span> <span id="s707">I loved it, I fell in love with this country and it's lasted to this day.</span> <span id="s708">I have a tremendous feeling for this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Were you surprised by the abundance of everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s711">But it was less the abundance, although it, I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s712">It was a great deal of feeling, that people could be so nice.</span> <span id="s713">You know, when you are under great stress the way we were and under great disappointment from many people, it is hard to, to, to believe again.</span> <span id="s714">And these people here in the United States, made us believe again.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: That quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No, not that quickly, not that quickly, but it was gradually.</span> <span id="s717">But one thing I knew, I said to myself, if I can I want to come back to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: So your visa was to go to South America?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And so you could not stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: You would have if you could have?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: No, I don't know that because our, our destination was the uncle.</span> <span id="s724">And I didn't know ahead of time, how it is there.</span> <span id="s725">But I found out very quickly that I never wanted to live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Okay, so you went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: We, we were, we had a visa for two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Two?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Two weeks and from here we went to, to Miami beach and in Miami beach we were another few days, we took a hotel which was next door to the place where we could go and ask when does our flight go to, to Barankia(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Columbia?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s732">And probably two or three days later we went, we flew to Barankia(ph) Columbia and we came to my uncle, who was not there, who was on his finka(ph), which is a, a plantation, a coffee plantation in the Sierra Nevada.</span> <span id="s733">And he had left word with someone there to bring us to him.</span> <span id="s734">And so we went, this was a, quite a trip, for the first time in my life, on a very small airplane, like a double decker, I don't know.</span> <span id="s735">And this plane wouldn't take off, it couldn't take off and every time it took off we stopped again and then waited a few hours until they repaired it and then the same thing, Well anyway, we came to a small village, an hour later and in this small village we, there was a man who was a friend of my uncles, who, who brought us to a place where there were several natives with horses and they put us on horses and I had never been on a horse before and we went for about six hours through the jungle and they went ahead of us and cut, cut open the jungle to make room and you could see behind you how it closed again and you know, I saw my first snake there.</span> <span id="s736">I have a snake here.</span> <span id="s737">You don't want to see it, no?</span> <span id="s738">And, not live.</span> <span id="s739">And we came to the uncle's finka(ph) and that was our first time here in South America.</span> <span id="s740">We stayed there for six months.</span> <span id="s741">Couldn't stand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: There's a different way of life.</span> <span id="s744">My uncle did not want me to have anything to do with music.</span> <span id="s745">He was a businessman, very highly respected in the community, he was a very rich man and he also didn't want them to know that Sam was a musician and it was all so very unpleasant because of the way they looked at things, the attitude.</span> <span id="s746">And one day my uncle said, "Somebody told me that they saw you in the street somewhere with a violin case."</span> <span id="s747">And he said, "Yeah we went to this family ____, who has a piano and were going to try to see how much we still remember."</span> <span id="s748">And my uncle said, "No, I don't want to hear that any more.</span> <span id="s749">If you need a piano, I'll buy a piano and it'll be in the house.</span> <span id="s750">I don't want you to go to other people to play."</span> <span id="s751">And each day I liked that place less and less and then I found out that I was pregnant and I decided I don't to have a child born there.</span> <span id="s752">But I did know that I wanted to have a child born in the United States.</span> <span id="s753">And so I went every day to the consul until one day he told me, "Yes, now you are ready to go."</span> <span id="s754">So we came here and our Gloria was born here.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: I'm a little bit curious when you, when you, well I guess both when you first arrived to New York, but more when you got to Columbia.</span> <span id="s756">Did you talk about your experiences at all, did your uncle want to know what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: I came to, I didn't, I don't know if I ever told you this, when we were in New York, my uncle had sent $200, so that we should have some money if we need it and this was December 22, 1945.</span> <span id="s758">It was a blizzard and we were without, we were in uniform and without a coat, Czech uniform, we didn't have anything else and Sam and I went out, to one block away, to Broadway and we saw this drugstore with a display of soap in the window and we hadn't seen soap for three years and I said to Sam, "They are also swindlers, they put, they put something into the window to pretend it's soap, but I'm sure it's not soap."</span> <span id="s759">And I could speak English, he couldn't.</span> <span id="s760">So I went inside and I wanted to see what the man will say to me if I wanted to buy a piece of soap and I came in, nobody was in except the man and I and I say, "I want to buy a piece of Sweetheart soap," cause that was what was in the window.</span> <span id="s761">He said, "One piece, wouldn't you want to have two for 29?"</span> <span id="s762">And I thought to myself he's stalling, he's stalling.</span> <span id="s763">What is he going to say?</span> <span id="s764">I said, "Yes, I could have two."</span> <span id="s765">So he disappears behind the counter and wraps something up and says, "29 cents plus tax."</span> <span id="s766">I don't know what, 32 cents and he gives me a package and I pay and I come out and I didn't believe that he really gave me something so right out in this blizzard I open it and I smell it and I nearly fainted, it was soap.</span> <span id="s767">And I said, "Sam, you know, he didn't see you, he doesn't know that you belong to me.</span> <span id="s768">You could go in and just say soap and you can say two soap and we could have four pieces of soap."</span> <span id="s769">He went in, he comes out with two pieces of soap.</span> <span id="s770">Now we have four pieces of soap and we walk a short block and there is another drugstore.</span> <span id="s771">And now I said, "You know, they don't know here that we bought it there."</span> <span id="s772">So I go in and I buy again two pieces of soap and then he goes in.</span> <span id="s773">To make a long story short, we spent all that money on soap and we came to my uncle in South America with a, we had to buy a suitcase to put in the soap and we brought this soap to my uncle in South America.</span> <span id="s774">And he, who thought it was wonderful that we came, and we told him nobody should know, look what we have and he looked at that and he knew that we were nuts.</span> <span id="s775">He knew that something was very wrong with us.</span> <span id="s776">He told this to me many months later.</span> <span id="s777">So, this was the impression my uncle had of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: But he was nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Oh, he was wonderful, he was very wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: You didn't even have soap when you were in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Not in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Because the people had to have coupons and we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Was, did you talk at all about what had happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: I couldn't.</span> <span id="s786">Sam did.</span> <span id="s787">I don't know how much Sam did, I couldn't stand even being in the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did your uncle want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Not really, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: Did your relatives in the States want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Not really, they said they wanted to know but, you know, when he started telling them, you could see their eyes were glazing over and they, when is this going to finish?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: They believed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s794">They believed it when it had to do with the Nazis, they did not believe it when it had to do with the Soviets.</span> <span id="s795">We had a lot of hard, a difficult time with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So they didn't, he didn't want you to play music?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yeah, he didn't want me to teach, he didn't want me to play.</span> <span id="s798">Women in Columbia play Canasta all day long and men, who work during the day, I mean work, this was, my uncle was a very rich business man.</span> <span id="s799">The evenings they spent playing poker and drinking whiskey.</span> <span id="s800">And I couldn't stand this life, I just, I said to Sam, "I don't want to live here."</span> <span id="s801">And my uncle was flabbergasted when we said we are leaving.</span> <span id="s802">"What?</span> <span id="s803">You are leaving for the United States, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s804">They have musicians there to feed the pigs."</span> <span id="s805">And I said, "If there are enough pigs, that's okay."</span> <span id="s806">And then, "What will you be in the United States, nothing but a number.</span> <span id="s807">Here you are a, a señora.</span> <span id="s808">I said, "I want to be a number among numbers, instead of a señora among slaves.</span> <span id="s809">Can't stand this life."</span> <span id="s810">And then I said, "We've lost already too many years.</span> <span id="s811">I don't want to lose any more.</span> <span id="s812">We've had to be in the ghetto, we've had to be in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s813">We have had to do things that we didn't want to do because others wanted us to do them.</span> <span id="s814">I would like, before it's too late, to leave so that I should live the way I want."</span> <span id="s815">And so he didn't say anything and we left.</span> <span id="s816">And that's how we are here.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Was, was that lifestyle, do you think, especially difficult or offensive to you because it seemed frivolous?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s819">And I couldn't understand how those people can live like this.</span> <span id="s820">And it seemed so frivolous because of what we went through that even when we came here, I had serious doubts that I will ever return to playing piano.</span> <span id="s821">I thought to myself, "Piano playing is very frivolous.</span> <span id="s822">It is."</span> <span id="s823">But somehow my love for music got the better of me and I am glad.</span> <span id="s824">But it is very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: When we stopped you said that when you first emigrated to the United States you thought you'd probably never play music again because it seemed frivolous in comparison to the life you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: ...gone through.</span> <span id="s830">What made you pick it up again?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: It seems that the love of, for music somehow returned and began to give me comfort.</span> <span id="s832">And it was a great deal of, a very important part of my life before and somehow I felt that I needed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did you play the same music that you had once known?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Some of it, but, but I, it took, it took quite awhile before I could really want to play.</span> <span id="s835">I really felt too much that it was frivolous.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Did it evoke memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s838">Yes it did, but in the end, it restored me.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Did it make you feel kind of a closeness to what you had lost?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Maybe.</span> <span id="s841">I never thought about it.</span> <span id="s842">But I think yes, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Now that sounds like that would have been saddening?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: I can't say for sure, I think somewhere I had decided that we had to pick up the pieces and go on.</span> <span id="s845">And with that decision I think I didn't want too much to look back and maybe it was good that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Do you know how long it took you to come to this decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Very long.</span> <span id="s848">10 years at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: So how did you, how did you live and what did you think about within those 10 years before you had made that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s851">I don't know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s852">I lived.</span> <span id="s853">I continued to live in great fear, I had nightmares, I was afraid that one day they will kidnap me.</span> <span id="s854">I was no longer afraid of the Nazis, but I continued to be afraid of the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Even in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Even in this country.</span> <span id="s857">And it was very difficult, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: What, what do you think helped get you through all of these very, very bad years?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: I think two things.</span> <span id="s860">Being young and in good health and my education.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Education was usually a drawback.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: I didn't see it that way.</span> <span id="s863">And I don't understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Well, I mean normally, when Nazis went into towns, they got rid of the educated people right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Oh yeah, in that respect.</span> <span id="s866">And so did the Soviets, they did not like thinking people.</span> <span id="s867">But it was, somehow I can only think of it that way.</span> <span id="s868">Maybe I didn't appear so educated as they left me alone.</span> <span id="s869">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Well you've described how your language skills...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: ...helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Very much, very much.</span> <span id="s874">I translated books, which, which I did much more at that, when we first came to this country because this, this was for me a wonderful exercise in, in coming back to all these languages.</span> <span id="s875">Some of them are published and I enjoyed doing that.</span> <span id="s876">Just like I enjoy music.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: When you were in Europe, did you think about music, did you sing to yourself, did you hear music?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: You mean in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: In the camp, in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Not often, not often.</span> <span id="s881">You know, it's too, the situation was much too depressing.</span> <span id="s882">Usually when you think of music, you, you have to be a little lighthearted.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: So music you put on hold?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: In all of this, did you think at all about religion, did you resent it, the fact that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Yeah, there were times when I thought to myself, what did I do, why am I punished?</span> <span id="s887">I didn't do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s888">And yes, it was difficult to accept the fact that by doing nothing, you are being punished.</span> <span id="s889">And I didn't have, perhaps the support that people get when they are, from early childhood, educated in the religion.</span> <span id="s890">On top of which, the Soviets did their share of indoctrinating us that religion is the opium of the people, if you have heard this expression.</span> <span id="s891">And the Soviets have replaced it with their own kind of religion, their ideology.</span> <span id="s892">Yes, I went through all of these difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Did you, do you have a sense of religion or, today?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: I can't say.</span> <span id="s895">I have a very strange and interesting sense of humanity in me.</span> <span id="s896">I don't have a sense of, I think when I hear of organized religion, which, which produces hate, like the Ayatollah Khomeini, that is, I think the most awful thing that you can imagine.</span> <span id="s897">It seems to me that a, a sense of humanity and ethics is what I would consider my religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: So you never returned to Judaism in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I do not know really what I am, but I do know that I have the highest feelings for Israel, for the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s900">And the greatest pride that there is such a state.</span> <span id="s901">If you can understand how this works, I don't know.</span> <span id="s902">But I could, I've been trying to think about it and it is difficult to understand, you know, when I was a child, there was this teacher, Hebrew teacher, who was trying to teach us to read Hebrew, but he neither explained each word by itself, nor did I know what he was saying.</span> <span id="s903">And he never bothered, or maybe he, maybe that was the way it was taught, but I, it remained out of my ____, where in my mind I was always curious about languages and I would have liked to know more about this language, this man was not forthcoming to give it to me, so I gave it up.</span> <span id="s904">And that is all I know about Hebrew.</span> <span id="s905">I didn't want to learn to read Hebrew when I don't know what I'm reading.</span> <span id="s906">Because it did not coincide with all the other languages, 10 of them, when I read them, I know what I read, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Was it difficult to begin anew here?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: It was not difficult, it was magnificent.</span> <span id="s909">It was, we were so full of hope that we are in, in a new country, not just country so, the whole way of life is so different.</span> <span id="s910">We went about it, we were very excited.</span> <span id="s911">And we had a baby and the baby was born here in Philadelphia and Sam, who couldn't speak English, found a job to play the violin and everything was wonderful.</span> <span id="s912">No, it was not difficult.</span> <span id="s913">And we never felt that we had to ask somebody for help.</span> <span id="s914">We were so proud.</span> <span id="s915">You know, it took years and years before I ever heard that there was such a thing like a, a family service, who helps people, so we never did.</span> <span id="s916">We were really very strong, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Wasn't it hard to get over what you had experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Yes, there were those nightmares.</span> <span id="s919">I couldn't talk about it and when Sam talked about it, I couldn't stay in the room.</span> <span id="s920">But these were, as time went by, less and less.</span> <span id="s921">But it took about 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: What were your biggest challenges?</span> <span id="s923">You must have had some, I mean you were starting a new life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: I can't, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: It couldn't have been that easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: I don't know, we had a wonderful attitude, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Were there certain kinds of activities that helped you connect with the life here?</span> <span id="s928">Certain things you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: We didn't have money.</span> <span id="s930">We lived in a very poor neighborhood, in a one room, not apartment, one room in a house of a man who wanted me to write receipts, he was a landlord, write receipts when the people brought the money.</span> <span id="s931">And for this he gave us a room, where the one window went directly to another wall.</span> <span id="s932">So we lived very primitively and we were as happy as can be because it was still so much better than what we had before.</span> <span id="s933">You know, everything is just relative.</span> <span id="s934">And I taught Sam English, I read to him books, endlessly.</span> <span id="s935">And our, our best way to entertain us was to go to the library.</span> <span id="s936">It didn't cost anything and we kept on reading.</span> <span id="s937">That was our beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: And he was playing music _____ music?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And he became a very well acclaimed...</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes, yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: ...musician.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Was it easy to make new friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s946">Yes and no.</span> <span id="s947">I don't, I don't think that we have ever, we've been the two of us, rather self-sustaining because of the circumstances and after that, also because of circumstances, maybe it's a baby and then his mother came and was very ill.</span> <span id="s948">She had cancer of the stomach and died in our house and at that time, she was ill about eight months, the doctor gave her six, and we had no insurance, it was tough.</span> <span id="s949">But somehow, the fact that we had survived the Holocaust and that we could be here in this country, we just thought nothing can hurt us any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Was there any sense of, I don't know, isolation or being different because of your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: At least in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yes, it still is, even to this day.</span> <span id="s956">We have a few friends, but we are very much aware, they didn't go through what we did and it's different, it's different.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Did you, you said you couldn't talk about it much, but did you talk with Sam about how you felt and what...</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: No.</span> <span id="s959">No, because he was not receptive to talk about it, I would have liked to talk, more recently, but he just, is not, I don't know how, how to put it, he's not interested to talk about things that you can't change.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Now this is probably an unusual question but, I'm curious, there have been, now that you've been in this country for 50 years...</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Were there certain historical events that you think you experienced differently or were very significant to you because of your background?</span> <span id="s963">You know, when you think about, you know, what went on, the, you know, the Cold War and, and, and the Soviet Union, McCarthyism, Civil Rights, the Eichmann(ph) trial, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s965">Well, one of the most wonderful feelings I have to this day is President Truman, because he happened to be President when we came and the first time we, we met some people and they said, "Truman stinks," I was so frightened that I said, "Sam, we didn't say it, but we heard it."</span> <span id="s966">And we immediately left their home.</span> <span id="s967">We could, I didn't want to stay in their house.</span> <span id="s968">And I took it very seriously and today I know that they keep on saying the same thing about every president.</span> <span id="s969">It's sort of a way that Americans like to talk.</span> <span id="s970">They, they don't take it as seriously as I heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Well you thought you would be found out as an enemy of the state or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Do you remember when Israel became a state?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: How you felt about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Very excited.</span> <span id="s977">Very excited.</span> <span id="s978">I thought it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s979">And we know some people here who befriended us, who are Jewish, who think Israel should not be a state.</span> <span id="s980">And you can't imagine what a shock this was to me, why?</span> <span id="s981">And they said, "Because it's not necessary."</span> <span id="s982">And I will never understand that and I had to accept the fact that if I wanted to continue being friends with them or at least seeing them, I must stay away from this discussion because it just bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Did you feel that by Israel becoming a state that there was some refuge, some safe place for Jews finally?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: And you still feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Do you remember the Eichmann(ph) trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: I mean, I guess what I'm asking here is, were these events a little bit different for you than they might have been for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: I don't know about the Eichmann(ph) trial.</span> <span id="s991">It's too difficult to know what went on, you know.</span> <span id="s992">You know, it's very strange, this whole thing with Eichmann(ph).</span> <span id="s993">We had maybe different Eichmann's(ph), you know, not that particular one.</span> <span id="s994">And his trial was very far away from us.</span> <span id="s995">I have no idea how that affected me.</span> <span id="s996">I can't say one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Well, let's talk about something recent.</span> <span id="s998">The situation with the Palestinians.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Do you have any feelings about that, the way that they have been thought of or treated or anything _____ ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: I, I have some feelings, I don't believe that by giving away land you will have peace.</span> <span id="s1002">I can't believe it.</span> <span id="s1003">This is a very small country, Israel and I don't think that the Palestinians or any one of, of these people who wish Israel ill are going to change their colors, their attitudes.</span> <span id="s1004">I simply can't believe it.</span> <span id="s1005">It's hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: On the other hand, Palestinians are living in pretty rough circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Do you have any sympathy for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: This is hard for me to explain because I know very little about it and I've not spent much time thinking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: What about, do you remember the period of McCarthyism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1012">By that time, we were very new here and I did not understand it very well, because in some ways I thought there were a few Communists here.</span> <span id="s1013">So I don't know, I, whether I thought I, I didn't like the man and the way he went about it and I didn't quite understand what he was after, but I, but I thought that the Americans were very naive about their, about what goes on in Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s1014">I still think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: But I think, you know, when you talk about how he was going about it and what he was after...</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: ...it's really the concept of the witch hunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1019">Guilt by association and I, it's, it's, it's bad, you know.</span> <span id="s1020">And particularly in a country like this one, where freedom of speech is so important or freedom of thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Any thoughts about the civil rights movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No.</span> <span id="s1023">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Okay, okay, I won't pursue this ____, but you know, it's just, it's just interesting because these were all very significant events in American history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: Sure, sure, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: I just didn't know if they impacted you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: ...differently.</span> <span id="s1029">What sort of, well you went on and you went back to music and you taught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Here in Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: I taught here in Philadelphia, I taught at Temple University and at Settlement School.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: You taught piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: At Settlement School I've taught piano, at Temple I taught diction in foreign languages for voice majors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: What's, you've mentioned a few things, what sort of long term impact did these early experiences have on you, in terms of maybe how you raised your daughter, your values, the way you, your sense of trust or security?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1037">I think that I continue very much to have the attitude that I had when I grew up.</span> <span id="s1038">I am hopelessly old fashioned.</span> <span id="s1039">I am not in favor of living together without being married.</span> <span id="s1040">What else should I tell you, you would be shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: No, tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: No.</span> <span id="s1043">I really think that these values that I've had and that I've never rammed down my daughter's throat, but somehow she had witnessed in her life near us, what is important to us.</span> <span id="s1044">And it feels to me that they, that these values have given me a strong sense of being steady.</span> <span id="s1045">Sometimes I had a feeling that I was on an ocean tossed back and forth and, and if I didn't have the strength, I couldn't survive it.</span> <span id="s1046">And I had the strength and I think that's why I survived.</span> <span id="s1047">And I continue to think that way, old fashioned.</span> <span id="s1048">That's how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Basic values?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Basic values, terribly important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Do you think that you raised your daughter differently because of your Holocaust experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: That I don't know.</span> <span id="s1053">I suppose because of these experiences I have often found myself a little bit impatient.</span> <span id="s1054">Impatient with stupidity.</span> <span id="s1055">I can't stand it when, when I detect a little less than common sense.</span> <span id="s1056">All I'm asking is common sense.</span> <span id="s1057">I don't know if that makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Well, I'm trying to understand how that relates to your experiences or where that came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I don't know if it comes from that or if it doesn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Do you think that you might, you might have been more and maybe you weren't this way, protective or fearful or any of that sort of thing, because of what you had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: It could be, I don't know, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1062">But I do know that I am, for a long time I have been very much aware that I have to be one step ahead of danger.</span> <span id="s1063">I used to walk in the street in New York and I used to have a feeling, if I heard the same step behind me for a couple of steps, that this is surely somebody who is after me.</span> <span id="s1064">I had this for a long time, couldn't get rid of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: So that even here, you didn't feel entirely safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Absolutely, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Are there certain sounds or smells that bring back memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Not now, not any more.</span> <span id="s1069">Used to be when a, when an airplane was, was coming by real low, that I would shrink, but not now any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Are there certain images that haunt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: No, but I cannot watch on television anything that has to do with killing, can't stand it.</span> <span id="s1072">I don't even want to hear a story about it, I don't want, not only not see it, I can't, I don't like it on the radio, I don't like to read it in the newspaper and I find it absolutely unbelievable that in this country, where it's possible to live like human beings, that there's so much crime.</span> <span id="s1073">And I don't have in my house any guns and I wouldn't have one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Do you think that, having these experiences influenced the way you decided to live your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: I don't know that.</span> <span id="s1076">Because when it happened, when it began to happen to me, let's call it since 1937 it began, because the anti-Semitism in Romania was already rampant at that time, this was the ______ time.</span> <span id="s1077">And I was 16.</span> <span id="s1078">That's when, that's when it began.</span> <span id="s1079">To be, it, when it became conscious.</span> <span id="s1080">It happened at the time when, I don't how I would have turned out had this not happened, I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Did you and Sam ever think about hiding and pretending you weren't Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: We were offered a hiding place by a Catholic priest and we were hiding one night in the organ in the church and the next morn...</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">[End of Side 1 of Tape 3]</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: You were hiding in the organ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: A priest, a Jesuit priest in Czernowitz, offered us hiding.</span> <span id="s1088">His name was Father Komorovitch(ph) and at first we thought this could be our salvation and we said okay and we went and we were one night.</span> <span id="s1089">The next morning we couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s1090">The thought that Sam's mother and sister were in, at home in the apartment and that they would be taken, I couldn't stand it and so we said goodbye to the priest and we went directly home and maybe an hour later they came for us and took us into the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: If you had to, the word survivor probably means a lot of different things for different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: That if you had to summarize a commonality that survivors share, is there something?</span> <span id="s1094">Either in terms of experience or in terms of, how it, how that life changed people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1096">This to me is so incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s1097">I wish I knew.</span> <span id="s1098">I have no idea what makes a person a survivor and another one not.</span> <span id="s1099">Of course, you have to have health.</span> <span id="s1100">If you don't have that, we have seen too many people perish, just simply falling by the wayside.</span> <span id="s1101">You have to have that.</span> <span id="s1102">Everything else, I think you have to remain with a cool head and I always thought that when you are in such danger, you have to have an even cooler head and see if you can be one step ahead of them.</span> <span id="s1103">But I have no idea how that works.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: What about, when I use the term survivor in the sense of having gone through these experiences, was there a commonality to the experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: I suppose so.</span> <span id="s1106">I suppose that when you find, in the experience of the concentration camp, people who befriend you.</span> <span id="s1107">They, they'll be most wonderful and do everything and you will do everything.</span> <span id="s1108">And then you will find others who take everything away from you.</span> <span id="s1109">So it is, I think it is the same, like in the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: Was there something in the process of dehumanizing you, of having, somebody having this control over your lives and abusing that control, that you think is common to the experience perhaps?</span> <span id="s1111">I'm not trying to put words in your mouth...</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Yeah, yeah, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: ...I'm just trying to understand, your experience is different than many other people I've talked to and yet you've all had your lives torn apart, disrupted, lost family...</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah, yes, exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s1115">I think a personal experience of someone controlling my life like that, I, I can't think.</span> <span id="s1116">But I also thought that, because of Sam, who protected me, I think that I was only too willing to be protected and too grateful and to this day I'm grateful to him.</span> <span id="s1117">But I have no idea, I think I, I think that in some ways we were also fortunate with the way things came, were.</span> <span id="s1118">But, whether we were fortunate or smart, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: You know, it's interesting to me that you refer, you've referred several times to the concentration camp and how awful it was and yet as I understand it, you really were only there a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1120">And this seems to be such a..</span> <span id="s1121">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: You are, you are talking of Carrera(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: But the ghetto in Toolchin(ph) was also a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Ah, okay.</span> <span id="s1126">Because I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1128">We didn't call it a concentration camp, but it was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1129">Only the fact that Sam was used in a certain profession and I was used as his assistant and that we were taken every morning and brought back every evening, maybe it made it a little easier, you know, but it also made it a little more dangerous, because every time Sam would have made a mistake on one of the soldiers or officers, that would have been the end of him.</span> <span id="s1130">So, so he was in very big danger and I call that a concentration camp, even though it was called a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: That's, I guess that was maybe what was confusing me.</span> <span id="s1132">I want to ask you to talk about one other thing which I know is not easy, but it's very, very telling.</span> <span id="s1133">And that is, you know, we talked earlier about how as people get older, a lot of these memories flood back and I know your husband hasn't been well lately.</span> <span id="s1134">Can you talk about that a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Yeah, ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Now your husband Sam has, he's had a stroke, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: A couple of mini strokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: And so his mind is not always clear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: But can you describe how when his mind is not clearly grounded in the present, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: He talks about, as though he were back in the concentration camp and he gets, he could be in, among 20 people, like in that senior care center and he'll take off his shirt and start scratching and the doctor asked him, "Sam don't do it."</span> <span id="s1142">And he'll say, "I have to do it, I have all these lice."</span> <span id="s1143">And the doctor said, "You don't' have any lice."</span> <span id="s1144">And he says, "Yes I do, yes I do and we always have them in the camp."</span> <span id="s1145">So I know that he's there and this doctor tells me that there's no use that I should try to convince him that he's not there because he believes so in it.</span> <span id="s1146">And this has happened a number of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: This happens at home as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1149">At home and with people and here at the table, with guests.</span> <span id="s1150">And he'll say, "When are we going to leave this place and go home."</span> <span id="s1151">And I'll say, "But this is our home."</span> <span id="s1152">And he say, "No, don't tell me this is our home, this is not."</span> <span id="s1153">And then he'll say, "We are going, we have to go back to this camp."</span> <span id="s1154">And I'll say, "No Sam, we are not."</span> <span id="s1155">You know.</span> <span id="s1156">I can't convince him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: So after all of these years, 50, 55 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: What he's left with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1161">And that for me is the saddest part of his illness.</span> <span id="s1162">You know, anything is easier to deal with than this.</span> <span id="s1163">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1164">There is such a sadness in him.</span> <span id="s1165">I wish I, this is, this is the one thing I wish I could help him with and I can't.</span> <span id="s1166">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Sam is how old now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: 88.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Is there anything else that you want to add or you can tell me, that we haven't talked about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: I think I told, I think I've told you everything.</span> <span id="s1171">I can't think of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: All right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Conclusion of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0436 PAGE 46</span></p></body></html>
