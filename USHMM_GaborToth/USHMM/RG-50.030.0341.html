id="s12">Q: Would you start by telling me your name, date of birth, where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: That's important.</span> <span id="s14">I'm Henry Bermanis.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Ventspils, Latvia on January 5, 1925.</span> <span id="s16">I'm 70 and half years old at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: My father was born in 1889.</span> <span id="s19">He was drafted into the old Czarist Russian army in World War I.</span> <span id="s20">He was wounded at the battle of Tannenberg, the only battle the Russians really fought in World War I and was a prisoner of war in Austria-Hungary for four years.</span> <span id="s21">It runs in the family.</span> <span id="s22">He came back in 1919, married his childhood sweetheart.</span> <span id="s23">They had very promptly two children, a girl and a boy.</span> <span id="s24">They lived in Liepaja.</span> <span id="s25">Then they moved to Ventspils and now they had in this musical home a future pianist and a future violinist so I had to come along and play the cello.</span> <span id="s26">We were at the cross-culture in that western part of Latvia, which was heavily influenced by the Germans.</span> <span id="s27">We spoke German at home, and Russian, and Latvian and when they wanted to speak so that we wouldn't understand it, they also spoke English.</span> <span id="s28">Like I say, it was a very musical home, and then everything -- well, he had some standing timber and a sawmill, and a dock for exporting lumber, and he bought all of that on credit after World War I and lost the whole kit and caboodle in the depression.</span> <span id="s29">So, then he sold everything except our house and furniture and then we moved to Riga during the depression where he sold insurance door to door.</span> <span id="s30">My mother went to work as a bookkeeper and we three kids took care of each other.</span> <span id="s31">I was five years old at the time.</span> <span id="s32">My sister was five years older, and a brother in between.</span> <span id="s33">So, we went to school.</span> <span id="s34">I did my first two years in a German language school because our last governess was German and we spoke predominantly German.</span> <span id="s35">Before that it was Russian, so I was raised in the classics of both languages.</span> <span id="s36">Latvia didn't have classics yet.</span> <span id="s37">So, I wore all the hand-me-downs from my sister and brother.</span> <span id="s38">It was a fairly routine life.</span> <span id="s39">That was 1930 from there until 1934 Latvia went through a benign revolution, so- called, and a fellow by the name of Karlis Ulmanis took over as President.</span> <span id="s40">He had his own secret police, which was heavily oriented to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s41">There were no anti-Jewish campaigns and I lived there in that fashion until it came time to graduate from high school.</span> <span id="s42">My sister was a secretary to earn some money but she also was predominantly a ballet dancer and did that from age six until the end.</span> <span id="s43">She died at 20.</span> <span id="s44">My brother was totally geared to music and finally under the Soviets enrolled in the university and studied economics, which is quite alien to his nature.</span> <span id="s45">That was a rather peaceful co existence until 1940, 1941.</span> <span id="s46">1940 the Soviets came and converted Latvia into a Soviet republic.</span> <span id="s47">In 1941 the war broke out for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">05:06:38</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Before you go any further, now these German language schools you went to I assume they were public high schools and they were mixed with Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Any incidents or was that pretty comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: No, before 1938 it was pretty comfortable.</span> <span id="s53">After '38 or just before '38 Hitler called all the ethnic Germans back to Germany, the so called Volksdeutsche, people whose families had lived there for centuries suddenly discovered that they were German instead of Latvian.</span> <span id="s54">Some kids in school started to wear the Hitler Youth uniforms.</span> <span id="s55">So, there were frequent fist fights after school.</span> <span id="s56">Never in school, it wasn't done.</span> <span id="s57">The pasttime was "Well, let's go out after school and beat the Germans," and they had similar past times.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: So you were involved in all of this as a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes, but not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: It didn't make you concerned, or it did?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: There was no prediction of the future, no.</span> <span id="s62">On the contrary because we were raised in the German classics, and people who could produce Beethoven's 9th with Schiller's words couldn't possibly do what was being done.</span> <span id="s63">And really until the Kristallnacht of '38 there was no such official program.</span> <span id="s64">So, no there was no premonition.</span> <span id="s65">There was some premonition when in 1940 a business friend of my father's, a German from East Prussia, came to visit us and said, "You must get out of here."</span> <span id="s66">We had, at the end of the Polish war, we had a joint parade with the Soviets, and we marched in formation and you know with the goose-step and all that, to impress the Russians.</span> <span id="s67">Then there was nothing for a while, and then we heard this distant thunder.</span> <span id="s68">Then there was this incredible cavalcade of T-34 tanks and it scared us.</span> <span id="s69">You must get out of here.</span> <span id="s70">There will be a war.</span> <span id="s71">Well, we didn't believe that.</span> <span id="s72">So, no there was not really a premonition.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">05:09:25</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Did you come from a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My mother came from a religious home.</span> <span id="s76">My father was a self- professed atheist who thought that his children should attend religious institutions, churches, synagogues.</span> <span id="s77">Pick one that is comfortable and stick with it.</span> <span id="s78">I'm still looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: How was life under the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: For us it was an improvement because my father didn't have to -- he wasn't on his own anymore.</span> <span id="s81">He became a bookkeeper for two nationalized industries as a full time job.</span> <span id="s82">He was on salary, and our financial situation improved.</span> <span id="s83">My mother didn't have to work anymore.</span> <span id="s84">My brother's college was paid for, so in that respect at that time, life improved.</span> <span id="s85">It didn't stay that way, but it improved.</span> <span id="s86">It changed just before the outbreak of hostilities between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.</span> <span id="s87">The Soviets were very confused apparently.</span> <span id="s88">Stalin did not believe that there was going to be a war, that his friend Adolf was going to attack him, and apparently made no preparations for such a war.</span> <span id="s89">There was on the other hand there was a movement in the Soviet Union to move unreliable elements out of the areas where there might be a conflict.</span> <span id="s90">That included certainly Latvia.</span> <span id="s91">So, on the night of June 13, 1941, the word got out that they are rounding up people, and it was a memorable night.</span> <span id="s92">It was my mother's 50th birthday.</span> <span id="s93">They simply had a list prepared by the NKVD, by the secret police, and the army trucks came around and knocked on the door and you went with your little satchel via truck to a train station and from there to the Gulags.</span> <span id="s94">We anticipated being taken because we were classified as former bourgoise, therefore untrustworthy.</span> <span id="s95">They didn't come.</span> <span id="s96">And it was few weeks later on I met a young man in the NKVD who told me that he had taken our paper and put it to the bottom of the pile because he was a college friend of my brother's.</span> <span id="s97">So, that was his favor to us.</span> <span id="s98">About that time, my brother was drafted into the Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s99">He was a musician.</span> <span id="s100">He didn't know which end of a gun the bullet came from.</span> <span id="s101">Youngsters were shipped off to defend Leningrad in the coming battles, but since they didn't trust the non-Soviet peoples, the Latvians, with a weapon, he wasn't given a weapon.</span> <span id="s102">So, when the Germans did come, they weren't even able to shoot back.</span> <span id="s103">So, my brother was killed near Leningrad.</span> <span id="s104">The exact date and place are unknown.</span> <span id="s105">That was the beginning -- that was just before the war for us.</span> <span id="s106">I'll spend a little bit of time on life before Barbarossa, before that war, to set the stage, if you will.</span> <span id="s107">What did we do, how did we live?</span> <span id="s108">We had a very nice apartment with four bedrooms, five bedrooms.</span> <span id="s109">We had managed to retain from Ventspils a concert grand, a Steinway.</span> <span id="s110">My mother used to play in a rather unique orchestra.</span> <span id="s111">Eight pianos played four handed so there was a full sound utilizing what Liszt had done to arrange all the Beethoven's symphonies, for example, for that kind of orchestra.</span> <span id="s112">One of her distant relatives, Maria Solmonovich, was a concert pianist since age 6 and a student of Glazunov, who did her pre-concert exercises, if you will, on our piano because it was larger than hers.</span> <span id="s113">We would sit in the other room, quiet as church mice listening to that.</span> <span id="s114">It was uninterrupted pleasure really, except for the concert she gave with Professor Metz, the head of the violin section of the conservatory, and a young cellist named Aronson.</span> <span id="s115">They played the Tchaikovsky trio which was dedicated to the death of a dear friend.</span> <span id="s116">Maria died in Soviet Gulag, Professor Metz in a concentration camp, and Lev Aronson I found quite by accident in Dallas where he was the principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony and a teacher at the Southwestern University.</span> <span id="s117">This musical tendency just permeated a lot of our life.</span> <span id="s118">Like I said, my sister was a ballet dancer and she with four other girls toured the provinces giving ballet performances.</span> <span id="s119">So the language was culture.</span> <span id="s120">The interruption of that culture became doubly painful.</span> <span id="s121">That was the background.</span> <span id="s122">My personal tendency, I played the cello.</span> <span id="s123">My personal tendency was towards engineering and I became the outstanding physics student in my high school and that love for physics stayed with me afterwards.</span> <span id="s124">My best friend was Alexander Bergmans.</span> <span id="s125">Sasha, as he was called.</span> <span id="s126">Sasha and I used to hang out together every evening when I wasn't busy with my girlfriend Helga, who was totally adorable, and whom I was going to marry.</span> <span id="s127">It was generally assumed in the whole school at some later time.</span> <span id="s128">That kind of existence, rather almost pastoral until things collapsed.</span> <span id="s129">Our first indication of things to come was when my father didn't come home from work one day.</span> <span id="s130">We found out that by bribing people that he had been arrested by the Latvian secret police and was held in one of their jails.</span> <span id="s131">On the denunciation by the Gestapo in Germany that he was a British spy.</span> <span id="s132">This was very interesting later on.</span> <span id="s133">It came about because he had a former business competitor in Germany who wanted to get rid of him.</span> <span id="s134">In German the in between man between the seller and the buyer is an agent, ein Agent.</span> <span id="s135">That has a double meaning, and he was quick to utilize it.</span> <span id="s136">So, we got him out.</span> <span id="s137">We bribed the police.</span> <span id="s138">We got him out, but that stayed in our memory.</span> <span id="s139">So, we had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s140">We had to check on each other.</span> <span id="s141">Except for that one incident, things were "normal."</span> <span id="s142">Then came the war.</span> <span id="s143">There was very little buildup for Barbarossa, for the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s144">At least not noticeable.</span> <span id="s145">There were signs that the governments involved just ignored.</span> <span id="s146">The German attack started on June 21, 1941.</span> <span id="s147">Within days the German army had slashed through the rather meager Soviet defenses, and kept going.</span> <span id="s148">On the way they went through Riga, and with them came the first anti-Jewish regulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">05:20:20</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: Now, where were you at this time, what was happening?</span> <span id="s151">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Well, I was in Riga.</span> <span id="s153">It was exciting to witness what was going on, just as it was exciting before to listen to radio Warsaw during the German attack when they played over and over again a piece by Chopin: the same piece, until suddenly they went off the air.</span> <span id="s154">Then we knew that Warsaw was no more.</span> <span id="s155">It was a strange excitement certainly, witnessing history.</span> <span id="s156">We had, ourselves, no premonition of what was to come afterwards.</span> <span id="s157">I was in the street witnessing it, watching the German army come in.</span> <span id="s158">Latvia had a very strong pro-Nazi underground, or movement if you will called Perkonkrusts.</span> <span id="s159">These people were out in force, of course, waving the swastika and greeting their brothers in blood.</span> <span id="s160">It was a chilling experience but interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Frightening?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Not frightening, but scary, a slight difference.</span> <span id="s163">But again, had we known what was going to happen, we would have been doing other things.</span> <span id="s164">Under the Soviets we had to declare a spare bedroom and we received somebody that the Soviet government decided should stay in our apartment.</span> <span id="s165">He was the director of the Latvian bank, from Moscow.</span> <span id="s166">When his family arrived, he brought two Russian girls from Moscow, the head bookkeeper and the head cashier.</span> <span id="s167">They were adorable youngsters, 20, 21 years old.</span> <span id="s168">When things fell apart, when the war began, they urged us to come with them, that they would make room for us in their trucks.</span> <span id="s169">And we said, no, it's going to pass.</span> <span id="s170">So, we didn't go.</span> <span id="s171">Again, in retrospect, it was very foolish, but it was not a normal situation.</span> <span id="s172">So when the Wehrmacht--the German army--came into Riga, they were promptly followed by civilian administrators from the party and they instituted anti-Jewish regulations.</span> <span id="s173">You had to wear a star that identified you.</span> <span id="s174">Your passport was stamped.</span> <span id="s175">You couldn't get ration cards, so you had to finagle your food using up all resources.</span> <span id="s176">You couldn't walk on the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s177">You had to walk on the street, like the horses.</span> <span id="s178">They were basically things designed to set you off from the rest of the population and to reduce your self image, and I think that everything the Nazis ever planned to do was centered on reducing your physical resistance and imposing regulations that would detract from you as a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">05:24:20</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Was it effective?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, I think so.</span> <span id="s182">I think so.</span> <span id="s183">I developed a stutter which I ascribed to that, and it took me quite a while to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s184">Yes, I think it was effective, at least it was in me.</span> <span id="s185">Not enough to remove me from society.</span> <span id="s186">A German officer of the German Marine Corps was then billeted in our apartment building, and we quickly became acquainted.</span> <span id="s187">He had an orderly who was a cute youngster who had been working on ocean liners all his life, and we became close friends.</span> <span id="s188">That gentleman wanted our piano.</span> <span id="s189">He got our piano and he got a signed receipt that it was given to him.</span> <span id="s190">I don't know how grateful he was, but he did suggest that my father and I both go to work in his organization in the harbor.</span> <span id="s191">He was in charge of a German Marine Corps food supply warehouse.</span> <span id="s192">A big nine story affair with chilled cooling rooms and stuff.</span> <span id="s193">So, we became longshoremen.</span> <span id="s194">My dad and I would walk off to the harbor every day and work until they closed up and then walk home again.</span> <span id="s195">It was hard work.</span> <span id="s196">They quickly liked my father because of course we spoke fluent German and he was so darn intelligent that he could guess what they needed and tell them what they needed.</span> <span id="s197">I was the guy who dragged the heavy boxes and bags.</span> <span id="s198">I had two teachers, professional longshoremen who said they were going to make a laborer out of me or kill me in the process, and they did a very good job.</span> <span id="s199">I developed physically very well.</span> <span id="s200">I ate like a horse.</span> <span id="s201">My breakfast in that place was nine eggs, raw, with a half of cup of sugar and a cup of rum.</span> <span id="s202">That was my breakfast.</span> <span id="s203">It went down hill from there.</span> <span id="s204">Low cholesterol.</span> <span id="s205">It was an existence, abnormal as it was.</span> <span id="s206">Then came an order that all Jews had to move, leave their belongings and leave their apartments and houses and move to this one part of Riga, the Moscow suburb.</span> <span id="s207">That was in September.</span> <span id="s208">Once we were all there, they put a barbed wire fence around it and then guards, and it now became a Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">05:27:50</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Let me just interrupt you a moment before we get to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s211">In this period after the Germans had entered in June and until Ghetto you were still out in the world a bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Your school had stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: What about the people that you knew from before the war.</span> <span id="s216">What was the local reaction to what was going on?</span> <span id="s217">Were Jews safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Relatively speaking, yes.</span> <span id="s219">There were incidents early on.</span> <span id="s220">There was the famous Gogol Street synagogue incident where Jews were rounded up on the streets of Riga and locked up in the synagogue and then put to fire.</span> <span id="s221">They all died.</span> <span id="s222">The ruins of that synagogue are preserved as a monument to the occasion, but another synagogue in Riga was recently, in June of 1995, was bombed so that the anti-semitic tendencies of the Latvian population are still fairly strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: How did you avoid all of this?</span> <span id="s224">Were there regular roundups.</span> <span id="s225">Regular violence directed against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: It was not a "Monday at nine o'clock" kind of thing.</span> <span id="s227">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s228">And maybe it wasn't the incidents didn't have such a high profile.</span> <span id="s229">They weren't repeated so often.</span> <span id="s230">There was time in between.</span> <span id="s231">Somehow I didn't get it.</span> <span id="s232">On the streets I had a non-Jewish appearance and I when I took the star off I was like everybody else which I did on occasion to go out and buy food and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s233">But no, it was an almost-normal existance except the fact that you weren't totally free.</span> <span id="s234">And the self image of wearing that yellow star.</span> <span id="s235">All that changed with the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s236">It was -- I think that the Nazis used a very clever graduated program as if it had been orchestrated.</span> <span id="s237">I rather suspect it was happenstance.</span> <span id="s238">They really weren't that clever, but it evolved with time, and especially after the 1942 Wannsee Conference.</span> <span id="s239">It took on a totally different measure.</span> <span id="s240">Until then it was not the program to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s241">That came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So you were required to go into this Ghetto.</span> <span id="s243">Did you take all your belongings with you.</span> <span id="s244">How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: We walked with a little suitcase and went there.</span> <span id="s246">We moved into a preexisting quarter so there was some pots and pans and things like that.</span> <span id="s247">It was not a desolate desert.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">05:31:30</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Did somebody organize your housing or you just went into an empty house?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: We went into an empty house, an empty room if you will.</span> <span id="s251">There were several families in one apartment, and no we didn't have sheets.</span> <span id="s252">It wasn't all the amenties of home, and it wasn't home, and yes, now it began to be scary.</span> <span id="s253">When the barbed wire went up it became really scary.</span> <span id="s254">When the men who had a job outside came home from the job assignment one day, they couldn't rejoin their families.</span> <span id="s255">They had to go into a different part of the Ghetto which is blocked off by barbed wire.</span> <span id="s256">That became scarier.</span> <span id="s257">But that was still an everyday life, if you will, until the end of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Were you still working with your father as a longshoreman?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: So you went out of the Ghetto every day to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Right.</span> <span id="s262">There were a number of Jews who worked there at this point and we had a column of workers who marched off to the harbor and came back in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Being that were outside of the Ghetto, were there advantages?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Oh, one advantage, yes.</span> <span id="s265">One was that you were not that vulnerable.</span> <span id="s266">In the Nazi hierachy you occupied a useful function.</span> <span id="s267">That was meager life insurance but it was there.</span> <span id="s268">We didn't know yet that it was a life insurance.</span> <span id="s269">We didn't know what was coming next.</span> <span id="s270">And since we got fed every day, that was an advantage, and I became as strong as a bull with that labor exercise and the supporting food.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">05:33:40</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Did you get information about what was going on since you weren't as isolated as people in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s274">Yes.</span> <span id="s275">We knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s276">We knew.</span> <span id="s277">We pilfered the German newspapers.</span> <span id="s278">We weren't supposed to know what was going on, but you did and discussions with the Germans and the Latvians surely kept us abreast.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Were you aware of Einsatzgruppen activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s281">That came later.</span> <span id="s282">The real killing didn't start in Riga until the end of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: The Ghetto itself, you described that there were two parts of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Right.</span> <span id="s285">The so called small Ghetto which is where the people came back to after working all day, and then the larger one where everybody else was.</span> <span id="s286">I was in the smaller one.</span> <span id="s287">We had -- we were told to move in there.</span> <span id="s288">Well, our accomodations were not palatial.</span> <span id="s289">We found a shack with two rooms and a place for cooking.</span> <span id="s290">It was after all the poorer section of town, so it was not terribly nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: This is your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No, this is just my father and I, plus eight other fellows, men.</span> <span id="s293">We all moved together into this shack.</span> <span id="s294">That's all that the shack could hold.</span> <span id="s295">My mother and sister moved into a room and were joined by a young lady, Shasti, who was in my high school class, but they didn't live there very long.</span> <span id="s296">They didn't live very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Did the two parts of the Ghetto have contact with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: They were not meant to have contact.</span> <span id="s299">It had a double barbed wire fence and I did sneak through it once, in the first few days of July of '41.</span> <span id="s300">But the first Aktion--the first mass killings-- took place on the 30th of November 1941 in Riga.</span> <span id="s301">As we lined up to go to work that morning, we were faced on the other side of the street by 110 special Latvian police and we stood there eyeing each other and one of the cops came over and poked his rifle in my stomach and said, "Look at the sun, tomorrow you won't see it again."</span> <span id="s302">I didn't know what he had in mind, but that group came into the Ghetto under SS supervision and under supervision of a man named Cukurs, a Latvian war flying ace.</span> <span id="s303">They took half of the Ghetto population by street blocks and forced them out of their homes to line up in the street in columns of four or five.</span> <span id="s304">And they were marched off to Rumbula, a suburb of Riga slightly further east and south of the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s305">During that day and that night, they were shot.</span> <span id="s306">There were about close to 15,000 people, so there was alot of shooting going on, and I don't believe anybody who lived in Riga didn't know what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">05:38:08</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Could you hear it?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Oh, yes, inevitibly.</span> <span id="s310">Then during the days following that, I managed to sneak through the barbed wire one night, and I saw my mother and sister and the girl.</span> <span id="s311">Then everybody knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s312">My girlfriend was shot and 15,000 other people.</span> <span id="s313">There was still about that many remaining and the Aktion was repeated the following weekend, and the rest were shot.</span> <span id="s314">That took care of the large Ghetto, and it left about 2500 men and two women.</span> <span id="s315">It was a very thorough expedition.</span> <span id="s316">There were two ladies in the Zentralka prison.</span> <span id="s317">They did not get killed.</span> <span id="s318">And there was a young woman by the name of Frieda Michelson who crawled out of there, out of the graves and lived.</span> <span id="s319">About a month later, on January 3, as we were lining up to go to work, a group of Gestapo agents came over in their black coats and took my father out of line.</span> <span id="s320">As I found out later, it was a Gestapo arrest, still going back to the old agent of the British business, that former competitor of his didn't let go.</span> <span id="s321">They took him to Zentralka prison and he was killed there, or he was tortured to death.</span> <span id="s322">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s323">I don't know the exact date.</span> <span id="s324">That was on January 3, 1941.</span> <span id="s325">Now they're all gone.</span> <span id="s326">Nothing.</span> <span id="s327">Life continues.</span> <span id="s328">I continued as a longshoreman and in due course I felt that I had to do something.</span> <span id="s329">I was angry.</span> <span id="s330">I went to work.</span> <span id="s331">I got myself assigned from the longshoreman work, to a well first as an electrician for Siemens.</span> <span id="s332">Siemens was one of the German companies, still alive, that was making money out of this free labor for which they paid the SS.</span> <span id="s333">I worked as an installer of electric circuits in private homes under the supervison of a Latvian fellow who was as inexperienced as I was and just an absolute sweetheart, Janis.</span> <span id="s334">Janis came to pick me up one day at the Ghetto and marched me to the next apartment.</span> <span id="s335">He had obviously been crying.</span> <span id="s336">He had been drafted into the SS.</span> <span id="s337">So, we did our work and then we went to his apartment, me on the street and he on the sidewalk as my guard, much to the shock and dismay of his mother.</span> <span id="s338">We sat down in the kitchen and we consumed at least one bottle of vodka.</span> <span id="s339">Then when it became to get back to the Ghetto, he marched me back the same way.</span> <span id="s340">We're both staggering and singing at the top of our voices.</span> <span id="s341">With him gone, I got myself reassigned again.</span> <span id="s342">This time to the Powder Tower--the Pulverturm--in the remaining standing part of the fortification of the old city of Riga.</span> <span id="s343">In the meantime I had also joined the underground in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s344">We had a triple cell structure where three fellows would belong to this thing and only one would report to the next one higher to make it basically betrayal-proof.</span> <span id="s345">It wasn't.</span> <span id="s346">We smuggled weapons into the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s347">I had some weapons training there, and at the Powder Tower I had further training.</span> <span id="s348">I became an ordnance expert.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">05:43:40</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: How did you get the weapons that you smuggled?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: These were weapons that the Germans had collected in the battlefields that the Russian army had left behind in retreat.</span> <span id="s352">They brought these things together in the Powder Tower and tried to reconstruct them into useful weapons.</span> <span id="s353">There were also some Russian PWs, worked in that Powder Tower.</span> <span id="s354">That brings me to the Russian escapade.</span> <span id="s355">One of the Russians from Georgia took me aside one day and said that one of their members was a high ranking officer and there were several others like that and I should get in touch with the underground and get them out of there before the Germans found out who they were.</span> <span id="s356">So, I got through the underground.</span> <span id="s357">We organized this.</span> <span id="s358">Somebody stole a German army truck and uniforms and we became Feldpolizei--military police-- and then just before the action was to take place, one of the ten people in our little group, nine now, took me aside for a walk one day, and said, "You aren't going tomorrow."</span> <span id="s359">When I asked how he knew about it, he said that he was one of the Committee of Ten who governed the underground.</span> <span id="s360">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s361">Jerry Bahn, so he said you have to stay behind and organize the next one.</span> <span id="s362">Well there was no next one.</span> <span id="s363">This one was betrayed, and they all got killed.</span> <span id="s364">In any case, that thing became a little bit hot for me, and I got myself reassigned out of there.</span> <span id="s365">But we had a good organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: How large of an organization do you think it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: I haven't the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s368">I can tell you how many people I knew.</span> <span id="s369">That was three.</span> <span id="s370">Unbeknownst to me, there was another underground going on, and that one included all the Ghetto police in the Latvian sector.</span> <span id="s371">These were select fellows, about 50 of them, and I had never looked at them as my buddies because we could not disclose to them our underground or they would have had to stop it because it would have threatened other people.</span> <span id="s372">That was the trouble with forming resistance in the Ghetto or a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s373">It was not in isolation.</span> <span id="s374">The retributions, like the town of Lidice in Czechoslovakia, was total.</span> <span id="s375">So we had to be very cautious about who knew about it.</span> <span id="s376">And it affected my social conduct totally because I didn't trust anybody, and I didn't want to expose anybody to knowing me.</span> <span id="s377">Well, the Latvian police was betrayed and they were killed by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s378">For some reason, the sense of humor of the gods, I was not picked out and I started to do very innocuous work, which was probably a life saver, because some of the work at the Powder Tower was fairly risky.</span> <span id="s379">We did bomb disposal, for example.</span> <span id="s380">I remember one time in northern Lithuania there was an encampment of Soviet 105 artilliery that they had left behind and this stuff was damaged and they were scared that people would bump into it and blow themselves up.</span> <span id="s381">So, they told us to bring those things out.</span> <span id="s382">Well, some of them could be brought out.</span> <span id="s383">You could unscrew the fuse and have an innoucuous metal object.</span> <span id="s384">Some of the fuses were obviously damaged and should not be monkeyed with and some were plain too dangerous to move.</span> <span id="s385">So, what we did, was to unscrew the good ones and put them in crates and load them in the truck.</span> <span id="s386">The others we placed in a circle, 16 rounds of 105 plus two pounds of TNT in the middle.</span> <span id="s387">Then we threw a percussion handgrenades into the woods to scare away the locals.</span> <span id="s388">The Lithuanian police kept them away from us.</span> <span id="s389">Then we had 15 minutes to trade, to get some food.</span> <span id="s390">My speciality was raw eggs, and then we'd get the dickens out of there after lighting a short fuse.</span> <span id="s391">The explosion was impressive.</span> <span id="s392">And then I would sit on the tailgate of this truck full of questionable artillery rounds and carefully balancing a bag of raw eggs, worried about the raw eggs.</span> <span id="s393">The German police at the Ghetto never bothered us when our truck came back.</span> <span id="s394">They stayed away from us and that was one way to bring weapons into the Ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">05:50:00</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: What about the internal police?</span> <span id="s397">Were there Jewish police within?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Well, for obvious reasons we couldn't trust them.</span> <span id="s399">For the protection of the rest of the Ghetto population they couldn't tolerate what we were doing.</span> <span id="s400">So, yes, they were the enemy as well.</span> <span id="s401">On one of my electrical engineering assignments I worked in a textile factory installing cable and on the way to and from work in the truck, I met a young Jewish girl from Czechoslovakia who had just recently been brought to Riga and there was a very strong attraction.</span> <span id="s402">You might call it puppy love, I don't know, but we decided we were going to get married after the war.</span> <span id="s403">That sort of continued until 1943 when the Ghetto was eliminated.</span> <span id="s404">The people in Ghetto were either assigned to work camps--Arbeitslager--which were subservient to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s405">Kaiserwald was established and I was shipped out to Kaiserwald one fine day.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: I want to ask you a few more questions about the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s407">Now, what I've heard is that only the small Ghetto remained.</span> <span id="s408">Did they ever fill up the larger Ghetto again?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">05:51:55</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I'm sorry, I left that out.</span> <span id="s411">Within a week of the second action, they brought in Jews form Europe, from Czechoslovakia, from Germany mostly and assigned them to take over the homes.</span> <span id="s412">One lady told me that it was a horror because the food in some cases was still warm on the table.</span> <span id="s413">They couldn't understand what happened here.</span> <span id="s414">How come these people so suddenly left.</span> <span id="s415">They didn't believe the obvious.</span> <span id="s416">After all they were told by the Nazis that they were going to be working in the east.</span> <span id="s417">They believed it.</span> <span id="s418">They wanted to believe it I guess, just like we wanted to believe all the other lies.</span> <span id="s419">So, there was a new population into this larger Ghetto.</span> <span id="s420">Some of these folks came straight from their homes in Germany.</span> <span id="s421">Some of them were really Jewish Germans instead of German Jews; there was one gentleman with the Iron Cross from World War I, proudly displayed, which was torn off.</span> <span id="s422">Any sign of self awareness had to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s423">Yes, it was a new population.</span> <span id="s424">I did not mix with them.</span> <span id="s425">This charming lady, Nelli Stahler, was on the same truck.</span> <span id="s426">I did not have to pick her out.</span> <span id="s427">I was not good company.</span> <span id="s428">I was not safe company, so I didn't make myself available as safe company.</span> <span id="s429">I don't know if there was any other mixing.</span> <span id="s430">I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">05:54:08</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: What about the daily life the basics in the Ghetto, the part that you were in.</span> <span id="s433">Was there any life, was there enough food?</span> <span id="s434">What was going on there other than working?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Depends on your definition of life.</span> <span id="s436">You call that living?</span> <span id="s437">Yes, there was life.</span> <span id="s438">It was a community.</span> <span id="s439">People went out to work.</span> <span id="s440">Some people did not, some people did.</span> <span id="s441">There was medical care.</span> <span id="s442">Some people got together in the evening for a musical soirèe.</span> <span id="s443">I was not in that.</span> <span id="s444">I cannot talk about it.</span> <span id="s445">To me, it was a totally abnormal society in every respect.</span> <span id="s446">I'm not aware of any children being born or conceived for that matter.</span> <span id="s447">I just don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Your part was mostly men?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: It was all men, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Were there any activities, anything other than work, come home, make food?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Now, both of these Ghettos were under some sort of administration?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Who were these people who ran the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: There was a Nazi administrator, an SS officer who had a lousy reputation; well earned, I might say.</span> <span id="s456">He ran it with an iron fist.</span> <span id="s457">Whether he could do otherwise, I don't know.</span> <span id="s458">It didn't take very much to keep this kind of society alive.</span> <span id="s459">It also didn't take very much to destroy it.</span> <span id="s460">It was not that cohesive.</span> <span id="s461">There were people from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s462">Germany itself didn't have a strong national entity.</span> <span id="s463">After all it was only Bismarck who unified the German principalities.</span> <span id="s464">So, the united Germany was a myth and the love between the Bavaraians and the Prussians for example, was not there.</span> <span id="s465">I was escorted one time through Riga by a Bavarian officer, and when somebody blew up an ammunition train in Riga not far from us, he jumped from one foot to the other shouting, "Serves the damn Prussians right."</span> <span id="s466">There was that kind of local chauvinism in Germany.</span> <span id="s467">It was repeated in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s468">I have seen it repeated in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s469">I don't know how prevalent it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s471">06:01:05</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: I had as little to do with the administration as I possibly could.</span> <span id="s473">I didn't go on sick call because it wasn't healthy.</span> <span id="s474">We did have a small hospital.</span> <span id="s475">It wasn't very healthy either.</span> <span id="s476">Whatever supplies I had to have I had with me.</span> <span id="s477">We did, in our little group of nine, in our shack, we had two people who stole food and brought it in.</span> <span id="s478">I was one of them so when I quit the harbor I had to rely on others.</span> <span id="s479">But it was not a problem.</span> <span id="s480">At that point, food was not a problem.</span> <span id="s481">That became a problem later.</span> <span id="s482">So, the administration mostly was German Jews.</span> <span id="s483">Not Latvian Jews especially after the killing of the police, and I just kept my distance from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: This one administration ran both Ghettos?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Yes, so we had a sub-administration if you will but yes it was one group that ran the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Now because this is interesting, dynamic, because they were German Jews in Latvia did that cause any tension, or did everybody get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I am told that it did cause tension.</span> <span id="s488">I never experienced it, maybe because of the German orientation in my home, but some of the German Jews told me since then that they felt severe antagonism on the part of people who said "They killed my family so you could move in here."</span> <span id="s489">Like I said, I did not experience it but I'm told it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: Was it your sense that the Jewish administration and the Jewish police tried to help and support the community or were they corrupt in basically saving their own hides?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I don't think they were corrupt, but their view point was different than mine.</span> <span id="s492">They wanted to do nothing to antagonize the German administration.</span> <span id="s493">The less antagonism, the quieter the better they were off.</span> <span id="s494">People like myself who challenged that obviously were outvoted.</span> <span id="s495">All we could do is cause trouble à la Lidice.</span> <span id="s496">So, it was their job to make sure that we didn't exist, that we didn't do these things and it was my job I felt to do precisely that and to be in a position of taking some of them with me when the time came.</span> <span id="s497">I wasn't very nice.</span> <span id="s498">I didn't feel any reason to be.</span> <span id="s499">But that's Ghettoesque society.</span> <span id="s500">What an awful term.</span> <span id="s501">That Ghettoesque society existed reasonably successfully until Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s502">Until the Nazis decided to eliminate the Ghettos as one step in the control of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">06:04:50</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: After the actions in the beginning or in the early months, was it fairly quiet then until the liquidation or were there other roundups and actions?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No, it was fairly quiet.</span> <span id="s506">I'm not an eyewitness to what happened in Salaspils, but I'm told that Salaspils, which was a small concentration camp outside of Riga, that there were medical experiments going on and things of that nature.</span> <span id="s507">I have no direct knowledge.</span> <span id="s508">The liquidations were performed by Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s509">In the Nazi hierarchy, the SS was in charge of that particular activity and they relied heavily on local talent to do some of the dirty work for them.</span> <span id="s510">They found that the German troops were not suitable.</span> <span id="s511">Their mentality was not suitable for this kind of a mass murder of men, women and children.</span> <span id="s512">I read some place that some of them approached Himmler and complained about needing a break for his troops.</span> <span id="s513">That they couldn't take that kind of work any longer.</span> <span id="s514">One reason it is speculated why Riga became an important killing ground was because the Latvian population was anticipated to support the liquidation of the Jews.</span> <span id="s515">So, that probably will be strongly opposed by some Latvians, but two years ago when the Gogol Street synagogue monument was dedicated, the president or prime minister of the country in his statement said that the Jews only have themselves to blame, because after all, they were working for the Germans.</span> <span id="s516">And that kind of insensitivity to what really happened, in a high government official, does not speak well.</span> <span id="s517">In any case, in the Nazi approach to the Final Solution it couldn't be done with an undisciplined mob within the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s518">The movie Schindler's List was, I thought, an excellent depiction of an Aktion in action.</span> <span id="s519">People fell through the cracks.</span> <span id="s520">The kids were hiding in the latrines and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s521">It was not a well-organized activity with precision, and that was what was needed.</span> <span id="s522">The task of killing that many people successfully is formidable.</span> <span id="s523">The eventual disposition of the bodies also was.</span> <span id="s524">So the Einsatzgruppen became specialists supported by local talent and that's what happened in Riga.</span> <span id="s525">I cannot speak for all the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">06:08:20</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: One other question about Ghetto, and you got involved in an underground organization, how did that come about?</span> <span id="s528">How did you get involved?</span> <span id="s529">How did you know who to trust?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, we didn't trust anybody, that's why we had these groups of three so that any betrayal would have limited consequences.</span> <span id="s531">Subsequently they discovered -- and I don't know who discovered it and betrayed it, but they discovered one of our training rooms, which was rather nicely hidden underneath a movable kitchen.</span> <span id="s532">Underneath there was a cavern, and it was very well done.</span> <span id="s533">We did learn how to use weapons.</span> <span id="s534">We didn't fire them there, but we learned how to use them.</span> <span id="s535">By my activities in the Powder Tower I did know how to use a weapon and learned even better.</span> <span id="s536">No, you couldn't trust anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: You were just talking to some of your colleagues and said "Let's fight back"?</span> <span id="s538">I mean, how does this get started?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Well, I let it be known that that was my mind set and eventually I was contacted.</span> <span id="s540">Interestingly there were two undergrounds in Latvia.</span> <span id="s541">One was the Nationalistic one, the one that wanted a free Latvia but had no arms in to succeed in it, so all they could do is pray that someday the Swedish navy would liberate them, which they didn't.</span> <span id="s542">Another one was the one that was pro-Soviet and worked very closely through the communist party in town, in Riga with the Soviet partisans who were mostly the ones near Tukums and Daugavpils, two cities in Latvia.</span> <span id="s543">They were very effective.</span> <span id="s544">The civilian Latvian police, if there is such a thing, left those people alone because if they went into the woods with their arms in their hands they got shot at.</span> <span id="s545">If they had them on a sling on their shoulder, they were left alone.</span> <span id="s546">So, it was sort of a mutual admiration society.</span> <span id="s547">My subsequent contacts with the underground were with an agent who worked with the Soviet radio station, clandestine radio station near Tukums.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Was there an overriding ideology or did you have goals?</span> <span id="s549">I know you were trying to bring in weapons, but what were you going to do next?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Kill Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">06:11:25</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Well, clearly we were all motivated to exact revenge.</span> <span id="s554">We had all lost our families, every one of us.</span> <span id="s555">So, our mind set was to avenge something.</span> <span id="s556">The professional undergrounder, the Soviet organizers, they couldn't stand that because that took control away from them and they didn't want any of that.</span> <span id="s557">So they were at cross purposes.</span> <span id="s558">There were different motivations.</span> <span id="s559">Mine was to damage the German war machine, to damage the German effort.</span> <span id="s560">To do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Was there a where and when, do you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No, it wasn't that well organized and the elimination of the Ghetto and the move to Kaiserwald brought a halt all of that for a while.</span> <span id="s563">The underground in the city continued lively.</span> <span id="s564">When I got to Kaiserwald in the early summer of 1943, I was again in very strange surroundings.</span> <span id="s565">Do recall, if you will, the life in the Ghetto, no matter how crazy, it was still a civilian existence.</span> <span id="s566">When you moved to the concentration camp, you became a number.</span> <span id="s567">You lost your identity as a human being, and so that changed your perception of yourself.</span> <span id="s568">It changed the Nazi perception of us.</span> <span id="s569">We were so many pieces.</span> <span id="s570">I didn't stay long in Kaiserwald, just long enough to get my nose busted, but that was an even more abnormal society.</span> <span id="s571">The importation of the German Kapos, the German professional criminals who became the ears and eyes and hands of the Nazi administration, they did the dirty work.</span> <span id="s572">They were not Jews, and whatever feelings they had about Jews was not pertinent.</span> <span id="s573">I didn't stay in Kaiserwald more than a few weeks.</span> <span id="s574">It was enough not to like the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">06:14:10</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Because you ceased to be a human being and because it was dehumanizing.</span> <span id="s578">For example, one of the betrayers in the camp was found drowned in the latrine upside-down.</span> <span id="s579">That is not the normal proceeding.</span> <span id="s580">We had one gentleman by the name of Einstein who was a head Kapo in a smaller camp somewhere in Latvia; when they destroyed that camp he was brought to Kaiserwald and we knew that he had actively collaborated with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s581">So we held kangaroo court in the barracks at night and persuaded him to hang himself.</span> <span id="s582">Well, we tried to persuade him, he wouldn't.</span> <span id="s583">He was -- why would he kill himself, but after two weeks he snapped and he went after the fence with a set of manicure scissors and he got shot by the guards.</span> <span id="s584">It was that kind of abnormal society.</span> <span id="s585">There was some other work going on and we were fed reasonably well, comparatively well, comparison with later food.</span> <span id="s586">But it wasn't that bad.</span> <span id="s587">It was a --in all respects a totally abnormal society.</span> <span id="s588">At this point, I was about 18 and, heck, I resented it.</span> <span id="s589">I resented everything that had gone before that and that was still going on.</span> <span id="s590">I was very soon assigned to a branch camp at the cement factory.</span> <span id="s591">As a matter of fact Riga had a large and reasonably modern cement factory.</span> <span id="s592">They were short of people, so they got the SS to give them some Jews, and I became a maintenance electrician in that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Do you remember the name of the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">06:16:35</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Zement Fabrik.</span> <span id="s596">Cement factory.</span> <span id="s597">It was on the left bank of the Daugava River that goes through the country.</span> <span id="s598">It was hard work, but it was not without some humor.</span> <span id="s599">It was not without some human contacts.</span> <span id="s600">I met two people there who were important to me.</span> <span id="s601">One was a fellow prisoner, also an electrician, who just had a couple teeth left.</span> <span id="s602">He had come from the Zentralka prison.</span> <span id="s603">When I asked him of my father he knew him.</span> <span id="s604">The other one was a young man by the name of Dute.</span> <span id="s605">Arvids was about my age, came from a farm near Tukums.</span> <span id="s606">He was a totally dedicated communist.</span> <span id="s607">Had gotten his whole family to jail because of it and he was still pursuing it.</span> <span id="s608">He had a furnished room near the cement factory and he gave me some food.</span> <span id="s609">He was a delightful man, a truly delightful dedicated fighter whether you share his philosophy or not, his politics.</span> <span id="s610">That assignment lasted for about -- by the way that other prisoner confirmed that my father had been tortured to death but he couldn't tell me when or how.</span> <span id="s611">When that assignment closed, they closed that little branch camp, at the factory, I was assigned together with the others to Spilwe.</span> <span id="s612">Spilwe used to be the airport for Riga.</span> <span id="s613">The Germans modernized it, enlarged it, and it became the main tactical Luftwaffe--German air force-- support field for the northeastern operations.</span> <span id="s614">So, as long as they could fly, they flew out of Spilwe.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Was Spilwe part of Kaiserwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: It was administered by Kaiserwald, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Did you live at Spilwe or did you live at Kaiserwald, in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Call that living.</span> <span id="s619">In Spilwe the living quarters, sleeping quarters, were in an abandoned old brewery.</span> <span id="s620">It was not designed for the purpose so some of the rooms and facilities were not very suitable but they had a fence around it and it was administered by somebody we called the "Eiserne Gustav"--the "Iron Gustav"--a perverted gentleman in the SS.</span> <span id="s621">No pretty girl who was safe for the man.</span> <span id="s622">Or boy.</span> <span id="s623">But it worked.</span> <span id="s624">I was an electrician again, on the airfield.</span> <span id="s625">They clearly didn't have enough guards for all of us so they had guards around the field.</span> <span id="s626">It was a leaky fence.</span> <span id="s627">And there were times when I had a civilian suit from Arvids in one of the substations that nobody would go in because of high voltage.</span> <span id="s628">I would put that on and go an look up my friend Arvids during the day.</span> <span id="s629">I gave him information about the Luftwaffe--the German air force--the disposition of planes and so on.</span> <span id="s630">And he instructed me how to sabotage the planes.</span> <span id="s631">So, I was able to get into a hanger and unsecured the oil drain plug cotterpin and then watch to see if that plane would make it back or not.</span> <span id="s632">Sometimes it didn't so I shot down a German plane.</span> <span id="s633">We also handled bombs and we found out that there was a way to secure the bombs so they wouldn't go off.</span> <span id="s634">So we all did that.</span> <span id="s635">But my main function was as an electrician and that was pretty good.</span> <span id="s636">I was also able to steal some personnel documents, ration cards, and passports and so on and I.D. cards and get them via Arvids to the paratroopers in the woods.</span> <span id="s637">All in all I felt very successful and so did the underground.</span> <span id="s638">So, in 1944 with the return westward of the Soviet Army there came a point when they said you've got to get out of there.</span> <span id="s639">We have to save you.</span> <span id="s640">It was around May or June of 1944 I had a friend in Spilwe and I told him -- I told the underground first that I couldn't leave without him because obviously he would become a hostage under the Nazi system.</span> <span id="s641">The nearest relative or the nearest friend becomes a hostage and, within three days, if he doesn't come back, he's dead.</span> <span id="s642">So, I explained to him that he had to come and be prepared the next day not to come back.</span> <span id="s643">So, that night he went over the fence and left me.</span> <span id="s644">So, I became the hostage.</span> <span id="s645">Boris Monastirsky, a fairly unforgettable name.</span> <span id="s646">He survived.</span> <span id="s647">I was designated as the hostage and within three days I was assigned to Stützpunkt.</span> <span id="s648">Stützpunkt was the work assignment where you went and naturalized, denatured the mass graves.</span> <span id="s649">You had to open them up, destroy them with lime, and then close them up again to eliminate them.</span> <span id="s650">And of course, since you were a witness you had to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s651">It was an assignment of no return.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">06:23:25</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: You just covered them or you had to cremate them?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Well, you had to open them up, chemically destroy them with lime, and then cover it up again.</span> <span id="s655">The decomposition gasses were unavoidable and they raised the earth, they raised the soil.</span> <span id="s656">So, to stop that, you had to either remove the bodies which by then were not easily handled--that is a euphemism, too--and so destroying them chemically in place was the way to do it.</span> <span id="s657">So, I was assigned by the Eiserne Gustav to that detail, and the truck broke down.</span> <span id="s658">The Germans used at that point trucks that were lacking gasoline and they used stoves that partially decomposed wood and the resulting gasses were combustible.</span> <span id="s659">So, that was in lieu of gas and it raised Cain with the engines so they frequently broke down.</span> <span id="s660">This one wouldn't even start.</span> <span id="s661">So, I was permitted to stay in the camp, but not go out to work.</span> <span id="s662">So, I became the delouser.</span> <span id="s663">I would take mattresses and clothing that were full of lice and fleas and stuff like that and bedbugs and put them in a chamber and use a bowl of sulfur powder with sawdust and set it on fire and then seal the thing up.</span> <span id="s664">The next day I would open it up and take the stuff out, shake out the dead beasties and do the next one.</span> <span id="s665">This wasn't very healthy.</span> <span id="s666">You did a lot of inhaling and finally I went to the Eiserne Gustav and said I was on strike and I wasn't doing that any more.</span> <span id="s667">And he was so impressed with this audacity that he said if you find a guard who will give you his gas mask, you may don it.</span> <span id="s668">There was such a guard.</span> <span id="s669">So, that helped.</span> <span id="s670">The guard in question was half-Polish, half-Scottish, in the German SS.</span> <span id="s671">He gave me his gas mask.</span> <span id="s672">He also did the incredible act of sitting in the guard shack and listening to Radio London and Radio Moscow and then come out and tell me what's going on.</span> <span id="s673">Because the front by then was very dynamic.</span> <span id="s674">He also did an even less credible.</span> <span id="s675">He and a German lieutenant marched the perimeter of the fence of the camp and then the two of them took me around and showed me where there was a weak spot where I could go over the side.</span> <span id="s676">Totally unheard of that two of those people in uniform would trust each other as much.</span> <span id="s677">But in any case, one day I was allowed to go out to work under a one-on-one guard to dig an air raid trench, and I discovered where I was digging was obviously a field cemetery from the Swedish-Polish war of 200 years ago.</span> <span id="s678">And I found a lot of wonderful skeletons well persevered in this sandy dry soil and I put "Charlie" together, a full skeleton leaning against the tree.</span> <span id="s679">There was a loud laughter after that.</span> <span id="s680">The captain of the German meteorological station which was there, dismissed the guard and he and I ended up using the captain's Luger to plunk at tin cans on "Charlie's" head.</span> <span id="s681">It didn't last long, but it was fun.</span> <span id="s682">He also showed me the German tactical map and how sparsely they had occupied the countryside between Riga and Leningrad.</span> <span id="s683">So, the time had come pretty close to do something.</span> <span id="s684">Well, the Nazis did it.</span> <span id="s685">They liquidated Spilwe as part of Kaiserwald, marched us to the harbor and we were loaded on this one incredible ship and taken on the Baltic to Gdansk and to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: When you say you marched to the harbor, were you close to the harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">06:28:20</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s689">Riga is a harbor city.</span> <span id="s690">The Daugava river bifurcates Riga just like Covington bifurcates Ohio at Cincinnati, so, yes, it was a port city.</span> <span id="s691">Stutthof was, as Bella said, was a horror.</span> <span id="s692">It was our first aquaintance with an extermination camp as opposed to the labor camps or concentration camps before in Latvia and, thank goodness, I was there for only a few weeks before being shipped off to a branch camp of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s693">Listen to the semantics of that: "Thank goodness I was shipped to Buchenwald"!</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: What was so horrible of Stutthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Stutthof was an extermination camp, not a labor camp.</span> <span id="s696">It was a place to kill a lot of people, starve them into being vulnerable to diseases so that they would die.</span> <span id="s697">It was not designed as a mass killing installation, but it was designed as a mass death installation.</span> <span id="s698">So, the conditions, if you will forgive the expression, the living conditions, were submarginal.</span> <span id="s699">The food was submarginal.</span> <span id="s700">And it was not designed to be survived.</span> <span id="s701">That was very unique in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Did people work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">06:30:15</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, there was no work.</span> <span id="s705">There was just dying.</span> <span id="s706">Everything else was just immaterial.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So, how did you spend your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Partly doing calthestenics.</span> <span id="s709">That sounds ridiculous, but it was a way to burn off our energy, what was left.</span> <span id="s710">We had to do push ups and knee bends and so on.</span> <span id="s711">Try doing a knee bend to the count of eight and then stop at three and stay that way for a while.</span> <span id="s712">That takes energy away from you.</span> <span id="s713">Anything to destroy you.</span> <span id="s714">There was one young Russian PW in Stutthof who broke down and took a hammer and smashed his German guard over the head with it.</span> <span id="s715">He killed him.</span> <span id="s716">He was executed that night and we had to stand at Appell and watch him hang.</span> <span id="s717">It was not a nice place.</span> <span id="s718">The exception perhaps was a group of Norwegien PWs who were fed by the International Red Cross.</span> <span id="s719">They got food packages every week and they sat there along the fence and taunted the SS guards by biting into a large salami and then throwing the rest into the dirt.</span> <span id="s720">The Germans didn't have much to eat at that point.</span> <span id="s721">So, the atmosphere was rather deadly.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Was there any commraderie among the inmates like yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: No.</span> <span id="s724">Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s725">There was no what they call bonding.</span> <span id="s726">Not in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s727">It was awaiting death.</span> <span id="s728">And, if you will, at that time we were badly weakened.</span> <span id="s729">We had not been properly fed for a long time and worked.</span> <span id="s730">The transport from Riga to Stutthof was not pleasant.</span> <span id="s731">There was a lot of sea sickness.</span> <span id="s732">There was very little food, almost no food, and no water.</span> <span id="s733">We were badly emaciated by the time we got to Stutthof and that environment just did the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Do you remember what you were thinking at the time in terms of chances for survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I remember the tactical overlay that I saw that this captain showed me.</span> <span id="s736">I knew that the Nazi system was coming to an end and I resented the fact that I wasn't going to be there to see it.</span> <span id="s737">I badly wanted to see that, but your thoughts are heavily preoccupied with food and your discussions are about juicy steaks that did not exist.</span> <span id="s738">It's like "fatah morgana" in a desert where you visualize a bucket of water or a lake.</span> <span id="s739">We were not normal, I think, at that point, and our thoughts were not what a normal person would conjecture to be.</span> <span id="s740">This is not uniformly so.</span> <span id="s741">My friend the cellist ended up in Stutthof and so did his sister.</span> <span id="s742">His sister died there.</span> <span id="s743">But in his words, he had to unload a truck with several others at one point, and he was told that if it takes longer than 30 minutes you'll be shot.</span> <span id="s744">Well, we didn't have watches, but being a concert cellist he played in his mind the Saint-Sans Cello Concerto, which he knew takes 23 minutes.</span> <span id="s745">So, they unloaded the truck in time.</span> <span id="s746">There were these moments, but in retrospect 50 years later to tell you about my thinking process I can't.</span> <span id="s747">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">06:35:05</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Mostly you talked about food?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: It was a dominant subject.</span> <span id="s751">And safeguarding what little food you had.</span> <span id="s752">I mean you got a small food ration every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Is there any way to get extra food there?</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: How long were you in Stutthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Oh, about four or five weeks I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Then the order came out that they were looking for professionals, and I was an electrician of course.</span> <span id="s759">I could prove it so I volunteered.</span> <span id="s760">Anything was better than Stutthof and I was put on the transport to Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s761">There were others, my friend Bella and her husband and several others so it was not as if it were among strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: You and Bella went together on this transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s764">That was the positive aspect.</span> <span id="s765">The fact that we were eagerly volunteering for Buchenwald didn't come through.</span> <span id="s766">It was the sign of times.</span> <span id="s767">By comparison to Stutthof, Buchenwald was okay.</span> <span id="s768">Magdeburg was a branch camp, a labor camp, Außenlager 101 of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s769">And I again became an electrician.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Is Magdeburg a large place?</span> <span id="s771">How many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Oh I'm guessing, I'd say about a half a million.</span> <span id="s773">It was a fair-sized city.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: How about the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Oh, the camp was small.</span> <span id="s776">Only a few hundred people in it.</span> <span id="s777">It was set up to support the Polte factory; they made ammunition.</span> <span id="s778">Yes, we supported the German war effort, for the love of Pete, reluctantly and only for a while.</span> <span id="s779">Two things interfered.</span> <span id="s780">As an electrician I had maintenance access to that part of the plant.</span> <span id="s781">The stampings, the manufacturing process, consisted of large stamps that rammed a disk into an elongated shape, further elongated at other stamps and then it was taken to the machine floor in the mezzanine for final drilling and lathing, turning.</span> <span id="s782">That elevator therefore became a key in the transport and I was able to destroy it.</span> <span id="s783">It had two wheels which were driven by a large motor and I overrode the security system and drove it beyond its limits and broke the two rails that handled the elevator.</span> <span id="s784">The chief engineer of Polte formed a committee to find out why it had happened.</span> <span id="s785">They decided it was sabotage.</span> <span id="s786">That evening in the camp I told our head Kapo, Dave Kagan, what had happened, and he gave me a new number.</span> <span id="s787">The chief engineer, you know, You see one prisoner, you've seen them all, and he went by the number and I had a new number and he couldn't find me.</span> <span id="s788">So, my Kapo saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Now, why was this Kapo so benevolent?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: He was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s791">He did his work, partly to make sure that the Nazis did not administer us directly because they could beat us more than he could.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">06:39:10</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Was he German?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: He was a Jew from Latvia.</span> <span id="s795">I don't know what part of Latvia.</span> <span id="s796">He eventually came to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: So some of the Kapos were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s799">I have no statistics.</span> <span id="s800">But in any case, that slowed down the transportation from one floor to the other.</span> <span id="s801">The other thing is that the allies conducted air raids of Berlin every night at ten minutes till nine the armada flew over Magdeburg, and then we stood there and waved goodbye.</span> <span id="s802">Then one night they stopped and, on the third of January 1945, they blitzed the city.</span> <span id="s803">They destroyed a good part of it and moved on.</span> <span id="s804">That pretty well wiped out the productivity of Polte.</span> <span id="s805">After that they did one more massive bombing raid and that totally wiped it out and after that we just cleaned up debris in the city.</span> <span id="s806">There was no sense working in the plant.</span> <span id="s807">Also, somebody had very good intelligence on the ground because when the utilities to the plant were brought back to life, the compressed air station, the water works or the transformer, one plane would peel off that night from the armada and wipe out that facility and move on.</span> <span id="s808">There was very good intelligence apparently, by somebody.</span> <span id="s809">It was delightful to watch, but that was the end of productivity.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">06:41:06</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Now when you were in the city cleaning up debris, did you come in contact with the local population?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No.</span> <span id="s813">I had no contact.</span> <span id="s814">They pretty well stayed away from us and vice-versa and there were guards.</span> <span id="s815">The German administrators had a difficult time with some of the cleaning up because there were bodies around.</span> <span id="s816">There was one bomb hit right in front of the door of an air raid shelter housing a large number of Hitler Youth kids, and the air shock dismembered everybody in there.</span> <span id="s817">So, we had to go in and pick pieces of bodies and try to match them up by shoe size or things like that.</span> <span id="s818">People didn't like to be with us.</span> <span id="s819">It was pretty gory.</span> <span id="s820">And you really couldn't jump for joy.</span> <span id="s821">These were kids, no matter what uniform they wore.</span> <span id="s822">That was in March.</span> <span id="s823">April 11th came around and Patton's Third Army people came around and approached Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s824">On Eisenhower's instructions they did not go into the city.</span> <span id="s825">They didn't want to meet up with the Soviets before they were ready to do that.</span> <span id="s826">They didn't want to end up shooting at each other so there was a hiatus.</span> <span id="s827">The Americans approached and then held back.</span> <span id="s828">The German SS disappeared, reappeared.</span> <span id="s829">I hid among some old discarded clothing in the basement of one of the barracks.</span> <span id="s830">They came through with dogs to find me.</span> <span id="s831">I don't blame the dog for staying away from me.</span> <span id="s832">I had a terrible nervous digestion at that point, and even the police dog could not stand it.</span> <span id="s833">They caught me twice.</span> <span id="s834">Once I crawled underneath some bunks in the barracks.</span> <span id="s835">They found me there; and then I escaped to the plant itself.</span> <span id="s836">As an electrician I knew where everything was, so I was able to hide out successfully.</span> <span id="s837">And I stayed there until the American army was firmly in Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s838">So from up there, near the top of the plant, I saw the white flags of surrender and the American tanks coming in.</span> <span id="s839">I went shooting down the fire escape.</span> <span id="s840">This poor G.I. I'll never forget his face.</span> <span id="s841">I was an unpleasant apparition.</span> <span id="s842">But life came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">06:44:20</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: What happened to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: They surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: They just surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Were there any attempts that you noticed to retaliate against them by prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: There was only one case where an SS man, now in civilian clothing, who had originally been in Poland and had a little Polish flag in his lapel.</span> <span id="s850">He was recognized and the prisoners beat the devil out of him, and there was a Jeep with an American war correspondent.</span> <span id="s851">He said wait a moment, wait a moment.</span> <span id="s852">Do that again.</span> <span id="s853">I haven't got it on film.</span> <span id="s854">So the poor guy got beat twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: I'm sure you weren't weeping for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: No.</span> <span id="s857">His name was Shuller.</span> <span id="s858">He wasn't very nice.</span> <span id="s859">I was at that point emaciated.</span> <span id="s860">I weighed about 80 pounds and I had to put some weight on.</span> <span id="s861">The American troops that came in had been on C-rations or K-rations for months and all they wanted was some warm food and I ended up cooking pancakes.</span> <span id="s862">I don't know how many hundreds of pancakes I fixed until those troops left.</span> <span id="s863">Then the British army moved into Magdeburg and in the meantime I had been looking for that chief engineer who had been so incredibly unpleasant.</span> <span id="s864">When the SS pulled out, he patrolled the plant with his dog and tried to find his old slaves.</span> <span id="s865">So, I found out where he lived, talked to his neighbor, a charming lady and her daughter.</span> <span id="s866">And they promised they would tell me when he comes back.</span> <span id="s867">He had fled to the country.</span> <span id="s868">So one day they told me that he was back, and I went after him with a very unpleasant looking knife, a "pig-sticker."</span> <span id="s869">He was thoroughly intimidated, came with me.</span> <span id="s870">I took him to British Field Security Office--FSS Office--and turned him over to the sergeant.</span> <span id="s871">And then I had to fill out the form, and he looked at it and he said, "Are you from Riga?"</span> <span id="s872">and I said "Yes."</span> <span id="s873">"Do you have an uncle by the name of Aaron?"</span> <span id="s874">I said "Yes."</span> <span id="s875">He said "Well, we used to do business together."</span> <span id="s876">He said "Don't worry about that guy, but as for you, don't talk about it to anybody, but we are changing occupation zones and the Soviets are coming back here.</span> <span id="s877">So, if you don't want to go back to Riga, get out of here."</span> <span id="s878">And I told Bella and her husband that, and this little caravan soon thereafter left Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s879">Five of them in one car, my sidekick and I, each on a motorcycle.</span> <span id="s880">I had purchased from the chief of police an I.D. card identifying me being born in Marseilles.</span> <span id="s881">I didn't speak French, but neither do the Soviets.</span> <span id="s882">That worked.</span> <span id="s883">Just in case they find me they'd have to send me back to France.</span> <span id="s884">I was fine until we got to Neuwied am Rhein, which was initially in the American zone and was then taken over by the French.</span> <span id="s885">And they were concerned about this Frenchman who refused to go back home.</span> <span id="s886">So I had to leave and the rest of them left at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">06:48:05</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: Now, just logistically: you spent the last several years in Ghettos and camps.</span> <span id="s889">Clearly you don't have belongings.</span> <span id="s890">You don't have money.</span> <span id="s891">How does one get around?</span> <span id="s892">How did you purchase the fake I.D.</span> <span id="s893">How did you get from place to place?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Purchasing the I.D. was a box of American cigars.</span> <span id="s895">That is an open currency, cigars and cigarettes.</span> <span id="s896">The Germans gave each former prisoner a double ration card and enough money to buy the food on it.</span> <span id="s897">That still wasn't very much, but I went back and having a card saying I was from Polte camp was very nice.</span> <span id="s898">It was so nice, I went back twice more.</span> <span id="s899">Now, I had three I.D. cards.</span> <span id="s900">Three sets of ration cards and money to buy three sets of them.</span> <span id="s901">I was swimming in food.</span> <span id="s902">I needed that.</span> <span id="s903">I needed that food very badly.</span> <span id="s904">Also, we liberated--we stole, or broke open--a food supply warehouse for the city of Magdeburg and we, the ex-prisoners and the German civilians helped ourselves.</span> <span id="s905">And I came back to our pad with a barrel of 25 kilos--50 pounds--of butter and a bag of flour and I went into the pancake business.</span> <span id="s906">No, getting the food at that point was not a problem.</span> <span id="s907">And eventually I doubled my weight.</span> <span id="s908">I became fatso.</span> <span id="s909">In the summer of 1945 I rebuilt my system.</span> <span id="s910">It didn't take too much.</span> <span id="s911">It was boring after that.</span> <span id="s912">I felt the need to do something.</span> <span id="s913">And after Neuwied, when we got back to Frankfurt, I went one night to a German bar.</span> <span id="s914">I did a lot of that.</span> <span id="s915">I became the youngest alcoholic on record I think, but drinking my booze in that bar there was a G.I. who was fairly lost.</span> <span id="s916">He and I had a conversation of some kind in pidgin German and pidgin English and he asked if whether I had any relatives in the states, and I told him that when I was two weeks old an aunt came and visited us in Latvia from New York.</span> <span id="s917">I knew her name, but her maiden name.</span> <span id="s918">Then we parted company.</span> <span id="s919">He took that information back to his father in a letter.</span> <span id="s920">The young man's name was Oppenheimer.</span> <span id="s921">It was a clothing empire.</span> <span id="s922">They were filthy rich.</span> <span id="s923">He turned that information over to one of his minions and they found this aunt in New York rather nearby and another aunt, and an uncle and untold cousins.</span> <span id="s924">So, they now had word that I was alive, and they went -- they didn't know where I was so they went to the American Red Cross and asked to find me.</span> <span id="s925">Well, after this drinking episode I heard that the U.N. Relief and Rehabilitation Administration could use volunteers, so I went to them.</span> <span id="s926">I was interviewed by a young man who was a school teacher in New York, and he put me on.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">06:52:05</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: This was outside Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s930">The headquarters was in part of the old I.G. Farben structures.</span> <span id="s931">The same place where they used to make cyanide gas for the prison camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: So you had made your way to Frankfurt to the American zone?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s934">So, now I worked for the U.N. I was given an uniform, a G.I. uniform with the UNRRA patch on the sleeve and I was somebody.</span> <span id="s935">My assignment was to go through every incoming letter for the Central Tracing Bureau which supervised all the findings of missing people all over Germany and Austria from anywhere in the world, except from Germany.</span> <span id="s936">I would identify the most promising avenue to inquire about these missing people.</span> <span id="s937">So, I came across the request from the American Red Cross for me from those people in New York.</span> <span id="s938">I was the quickest case we solved.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: The people were writing in from everywhere about their relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yes, from anywhere.</span> <span id="s941">About 400 letters a day.</span> <span id="s942">It was a incredibly hellish parade of human misery.</span> <span id="s943">Every letter was a missing relative and it was inspiring to do something.</span> <span id="s944">The military governments of the four powers were military.</span> <span id="s945">They were not responsive to this additional burden, especially not the Soviets who didn't do anything on it.</span> <span id="s946">And so I took one of my famous boxes of cigars to the local postmaster and explained to him what we were doing.</span> <span id="s947">What these nondescript brown G.I. envelopes designated and word got out and I had an army of post men working for us.</span> <span id="s948">We were incredibly successful.</span> <span id="s949">We solved about 400 cases a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: How did you solve these cases?</span> <span id="s951">What was your process?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I sent out questionnaires to where I thought was the best address to try.</span> <span id="s953">If the people still lived there they responded on the questionnaire, and I had positive I.D. I also went through our death files and saw if we had them on record.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Cards as far as having come from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: From the Germans, from the camps, yes.</span> <span id="s956">It was a marvelous operation.</span> <span id="s957">It was the most important piece of work I ever did in my life and the most satisfying.</span> <span id="s958">When UNRRA moved its headquarters to a little place called Arolsen, near Kassel, I went with that job.</span> <span id="s959">I don't know, should I go into the politics of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">06:55:52</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: There was little love lost between the U.K. politically and the United States.</span> <span id="s963">In UNRRA, they were able to -- they being the British administrators were able to force every American out of any important position.</span> <span id="s964">The only one left was a friend of mine named Tip Westfall who had the innocuous job of supervising three ladies in something called statistics and organization.</span> <span id="s965">I joined him because I found that some of my found cases didn't make it out, didn't notify the people even though we had found the positive answers.</span> <span id="s966">So, Tip, who was former professor of English, asked me to join him.</span> <span id="s967">I turned my section over to a Luxembourg fellow and I became the eyes and ears, gave him the information and he wrote to Governor Lehmann, who was then the Director General, to no avail.</span> <span id="s968">Then he wrote another one to Fiorello LaGuardia, who came in after Lehmann and Butch LaGuardia came to Europe and fired that crew that committed this kind of sabotage and we found a thousand files that had not been acted on.</span> <span id="s969">I think that it ties in with the British access to India in the last century with the British access to their territory in Palestine and was tied in with that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s970">The head--General Morgan--of UNRRA in Europe, who was a relative of the royal family.</span> <span id="s971">He was Eisenhower's aide-de-camp during the war.</span> <span id="s972">He was untouchable until Butch Laguardia came on the scene.</span> <span id="s973">He fired him.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So you think they didn't want to help people because maybe they would get to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: They wanted to impound that information, take a bite out the U.N. and turn it over to a Red Cross organization that they would control.</span> <span id="s976">And it just further eroded our contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">TAPE #3</span></p> <p><span id="s978">07:01:08</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: You were saying that you certainly did not get cooperation from the British in terms of trying to find missing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Or from the Soviets for different reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Were you getting help from any other international organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No, the international organizations got our help.</span> <span id="s983">We were the central organization.</span> <span id="s984">We had the death records from the camps.</span> <span id="s985">We had the last available information about people, and we had access to the military governments who would accept our inquiries, and then also the German postal service.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: So you fed this information to the various relief organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: We fed it back to whoever asked for the information.</span> <span id="s988">If the information came from the American Red Cross we fed it back to them.</span> <span id="s989">If it came from a constituent of a Senator we were particularly nice to them.</span> <span id="s990">It was really a international service.</span> <span id="s991">It was not directed towards specific organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Did you have contact with any of the missing persons themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s994">That was the real welcome feedback that kept us alive because we worked very very hard.</span> <span id="s995">It was a 7 a.m. to 11:00 at night effort, because at 11:00 at night the kitchen would close.</span> <span id="s996">So, it was the only meal during the day that broke me away from that effort.</span> <span id="s997">It was truly important to combine these people.</span> <span id="s998">I would get letters from folks in South Africa, and anywhere in the world, grateful that they had been reunited with their families.</span> <span id="s999">It was very welcome.</span> <span id="s1000">I saved all those things and then lost it in a move.</span> <span id="s1001">It was a very good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Was there any kind of special sensitivity that you had to have in terms of dealing with this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Or unsensitivity: you were dealing with flesh and blood.</span> <span id="s1004">I had lost my family and I had perhaps in that respect additional sensitivity to others, but basically it was grit your teeth and do it, but by all means--do it.</span> <span id="s1005">So, it was, like I said, it was the best job I ever had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Were there many of you?</span> <span id="s1007">How many people were working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Well, I had the L section in the tracing bureau, and we did the lion's share, about 90 percent of the work.</span> <span id="s1009">I had ten typists.</span> <span id="s1010">I did all the screening and I did identification work.</span> <span id="s1011">I didn't trust anybody to do it for me.</span> <span id="s1012">I just liked the results.</span> <span id="s1013">That came to a halt when I received the visa to come to the States.</span> <span id="s1014">That came in April.</span> <span id="s1015">I was on the ship in May.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Of '46?</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Of '46.</span> <span id="s1018">I was met in New York by my uncle and two aunts and this incredible gentleman from an ethnic society, a Latvian society in New York who gave me a $20 bill, since I had no money.</span> <span id="s1019">I had nothing else.</span> <span id="s1020">That was neat.</span> <span id="s1021">I was able to spend that on the subway system and learn what New York is like and get a job as a busboy in a place called Farm Food Restaurants, near Radio City Music Hall.</span> <span id="s1022">That job lasted until August.</span> <span id="s1023">I had signed up to get my so-called first papers.</span> <span id="s1024">The first step in the naturalization process.</span> <span id="s1025">When you do that you sign up for the draft and the draft got me and I was in Ft. Belvoir, in basic training, that same fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Before you were a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1028">And then I was shipped out to Italy.</span> <span id="s1029">They wanted to send me to Potsdam, because I could speak German and Russian, and I objected.</span> <span id="s1030">The Soviets have a system of dual citizenship, and so they could put their hands on me and then I would sit someplace in the Gulag and wait for the State Department to help me.</span> <span id="s1031">So, I didn't go to Potsdam.</span> <span id="s1032">I asked for a different assignment and for the reasons given I was shipped to Italy to the 88th division up north in Gorizia.</span> <span id="s1033">I was in S-2, the intelligence section of the battalion.</span> <span id="s1034">We took care of, among other things, the 175 German PWs who were assigned to the battalion and that was an interesting ying-yang sort of change of positions.</span> <span id="s1035">They didn't know about my background, and I didn't enlighten them.</span> <span id="s1036">Unlike Stutthof, they had a club in the city.</span> <span id="s1037">They had Class-A passes.</span> <span id="s1038">It was a different kind of a life.</span> <span id="s1039">For Christmas they invited me to their party and in their toast they said, "Well, you know, it's a changing world.</span> <span id="s1040">Today it is you, tomorrow it is me."</span> <span id="s1041">I came back in May of '47, was discharged, and I now had a G.I. Bill, so I promptly went to school, found out that I was still able to sit on a school bench and then went to work for Westinghouse in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1042">That was fine until July of 1950 when the Korean War broke out.</span> <span id="s1043">I had by now received my citizenship and I thought it was only fair and proper that I would sign up for that war.</span> <span id="s1044">America had been good to me.</span> <span id="s1045">So, I signed up.</span> <span id="s1046">I was assigned to the Signal Corps Intelligence Agency in Washington, and then the Corps of Engineers Technical Intelligence in Fort Belvoir and then I was shipped off to Berlin to do some intelligence work for the American Army, which I did until July 1953.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: What was it like being back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">07:08:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Interesting.</span> <span id="s1050">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1051">I didn't answer that.</span> <span id="s1052">It had its different aspects.</span> <span id="s1053">Basically I was a civilian while I was there or at least I appeared to be a civilian.</span> <span id="s1054">I was now in a different capacity.</span> <span id="s1055">I drove a volkswagen with German police plates.</span> <span id="s1056">It was a different world, and one thing that came out of the war experience was adaptability.</span> <span id="s1057">I adapted to this life.</span> <span id="s1058">I am told that I did good work.</span> <span id="s1059">When I came back to Washington to be debriefed, some Colonel jumped up and saluted me and, through me, the effort of my group.</span> <span id="s1060">So, I was content.</span> <span id="s1061">I also met in Berlin an American girl who was there working for the Army but not in the Army, and we got married as soon as my debriefing was over and I was out of the service.</span> <span id="s1062">That brought me to the University of Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1063">That was in 1953.</span> <span id="s1064">I went to work for G.E. and in 1955 I became a nuclear engineer.</span> <span id="s1065">Anybody could be that because it wasn't taught in colleges.</span> <span id="s1066">We were self taught.</span> <span id="s1067">We worked during the day and taught ourselves at night in groups until we became good enough in our trade.</span> <span id="s1068">I did that until -- I just retired in 1994, not before my company, which by now is Raytheon, was able to send me to Europe to represent them all over Europe, mostly in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1069">I was able to go back to Riga and see the place as the guest of the Latvian government, not at the end of a bayonet.</span> <span id="s1070">I saw the Rumbula burial places.</span> <span id="s1071">There was one part of it that was particularly impressive.</span> <span id="s1072">It was a long box about six feet by six feet by 18 feet long and from it, roughly every five seconds or four seconds came the sound of a shot.</span> <span id="s1073">Since this was the burial ground of my family, it was impressive.</span> <span id="s1074">I was not successful in selling anything in Riga.</span> <span id="s1075">Subsequently a friend of mine notified a mutual friend, my old buddy Sasha Bergmans, in Riga that I was alive living at this point in Holland.</span> <span id="s1076">We corresponded and I managed to get to Riga to meet with him, to meet with three other surviving members of our class of '41.</span> <span id="s1077">We had an incredible reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">07:12:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: This is your high school class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Senior class.</span> <span id="s1081">None of the others were around.</span> <span id="s1082">And from there I went to Paris and then to Moscow to represent our government in the International Conference on Demilitarization of Chemical Warfare Agents.</span> <span id="s1083">That was an interesting exercise.</span> <span id="s1084">They're still talking about it.</span> <span id="s1085">We had the reception at the Kremlin.</span> <span id="s1086">Not bad for a graduate of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1087">The entertainment was provided by a pas de deux from Tschaichovsky's Swan Lake and eventually, at which point I had no more film left in my camera, ten young ladies came out in little wraparound skirts to do a Can-Can on roller skates.</span> <span id="s1088">In the Kremlin.</span> <span id="s1089">But Moscow wasn't what it used to be.</span> <span id="s1090">It was the second time I was there and I am told that it isn't anymore what it used to be either.</span> <span id="s1091">But enough of that.</span> <span id="s1092">I think that perhaps the second most important aspect -- one is to be caught and be incarcerated, the other is to come out and be normal, and to me that is perhaps the most important part in my judgment of my life: to be normal, to have human values, a sense of humor, and a dedication to human values.</span> <span id="s1093">That's my story.</span> <span id="s1094">Except for my marriage to Bella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Was becoming normal again difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">07:14:52</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s1098">I like music.</span> <span id="s1099">Music is a language of emotions, and I can still not listen to certain compositions without becoming emotionally deeply involved.</span> <span id="s1100">It was more pronounced in the earlier days, 1945, 1946.</span> <span id="s1101">I was a bit of a nut.</span> <span id="s1102">I couldn't stand the ticking of an alarm clock.</span> <span id="s1103">I knew I threw several through the window, the time element.</span> <span id="s1104">But aside from those idiosyncracies I think I slowly have reentered humanity.</span> <span id="s1105">I have retained certain key thoughts.</span> <span id="s1106">I have developed into an unforgiving American patriot.</span> <span id="s1107">There is so much I have received in this country, among other things, my life--how could I be otherwise?</span> <span id="s1108">This society accepted me, other societies did not, and still doesn't.</span> <span id="s1109">So, yes that is one of the residuals and I have no intention of changing that.</span> <span id="s1110">Incredible dislike for genocides in other places even though they are different from the Jewish holocaust.</span> <span id="s1111">What is now going on in some parts of former Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union for example without entering politics.</span> <span id="s1112">That is a very strong dislike I wouldn't have if I weren't burdened by those memories.</span> <span id="s1113">My memories haven't gone away as you've noticed, they're still here.</span> <span id="s1114">Perhaps more now than before, because I think more about it, because my wife, who was also in the camps in Magdeburg and married to a friend of mine subsequently, and we are now married to each other in our tenth year.</span> <span id="s1115">She has given back to me my ability to talk about it and reflect on it, which I didn't have before.</span> <span id="s1116">I have a daughter, two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1117">They are my monuments to teutonic inefficiency.</span> <span id="s1118">That is something that I will not lose, but it does stand for reentry into normality.</span> <span id="s1119">I don't know what else I can

when you came here you had to begin again, and that must have been very, very difficult although you obviously have done it successfully.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Well there is no alternative to it.</span> <span id="s1122">I could do that or I could go sit at a funny farm.</span> <span id="s1123">And I did it.</span> <span id="s1124">Yes there was a price to that.</span> <span id="s1125">There are still nightmares and they become reactivated, by some strange mechanisms I don't even know about.</span> <span id="s1126">The reentry is not total.</span> <span id="s1127">You don't experience something like that totally and then to negate what has happened, it cannot be done.</span> <span id="s1128">The death of a family doesn't act that way.</span> <span id="s1129">So, basically there is no alternative.</span> <span id="s1130">It's just a matter of how normal do you become.</span> <span id="s1131">Do you retain what was instilled in you as a child, a love of people, or do you become nasty and overbearing and discriminating.</span> <span id="s1132">There are not too many things that I really dislike.</span> <span id="s1133">I don't like stewed okra; I never developed a taste for it.</span> <span id="s1134">I don't like people who tell ethnic jokes, because you cannot hate anybody without first diminishing it him, and an ethnic joke is intended to diminish the other guy.</span> <span id="s1135">So, yes, I have my likes and dislikes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">07:20:35</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: What do you think drove you through all of these years?</span> <span id="s1138">What gave you the strength, what helped you get through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: I think the remaining strong influence of my parents.</span> <span id="s1140">I had a magnificently harmonious upbringing in spite of many ups and downs, and what they instilled in me couldn't be destroyed by a bullet and it wasn't.</span> <span id="s1141">I still have those things.</span> <span id="s1142">I still have my love of music and my emotional dialog with them via music.</span> <span id="s1143">I know what it wasn't.</span> <span id="s1144">It wasn't religion.</span> <span id="s1145">I had parting of the ways with an ever-loving God who was an alien in that environment.</span> <span id="s1146">It wasn't nationalism.</span> <span id="s1147">It wasn't love of humanity.</span> <span id="s1148">A chunk of humanity did that to us.</span> <span id="s1149">So it was really basically their influence.</span> <span id="s1150">My parents influence and good common sense and not having any alternatives.</span> <span id="s1151">If I had not survived I would not be here talking to you.</span> <span id="s1152">The probability of surviving and being here is immaterial.</span> <span id="s1153">It's very small.</span> <span id="s1154">But then we start from a different premise.</span> <span id="s1155">I really don't know how to answer that.</span> <span id="s1156">There is no fundamental philosophy that provided the will to survive.</span> <span id="s1157">Maybe it was just stubbornness, good old-fashioned stubbornness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: I just want change the emphasis.</span> <span id="s1160">I only mentioned it.</span> <span id="s1161">The desire for love of all people, the desire not to see fatal hatred.</span> <span id="s1162">We don't all love each other.</span> <span id="s1163">I hardly know you well enough to love you, besides, Bella would object, but it's a different love.</span> <span id="s1164">The actions of love is not fatal.</span> <span id="s1165">But fatal hate is a different matter.</span> <span id="s1166">The kind of thing that motivates extermination of civilians, not enemy soldiers, that is anathema.</span> <span id="s1167">I hate hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Latvian:
