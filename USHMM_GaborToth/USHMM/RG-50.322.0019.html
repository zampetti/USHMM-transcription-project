think they were there for several generations.</span> <span id="s22">Yah, I know that my grandparents lived there and, but I don’t know…you know, since everything was interrupted we don’t have pictures or anything.</span> <span id="s23">I have been -- No, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And you told me that you had one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Younger or older?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Older.</span> <span id="s28">Almost five years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: And did any other members of your family do you know live in your house before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: No.</span> <span id="s31">No.</span> <span id="s32">Just our immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And you really remember nothing about your hometown.</span> <span id="s34">Do you have any vague memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No.</span> <span id="s36">No.</span> <span id="s37">I don’t have any memories, except sometimes I saw pictures or stories that my parents would tell.</span> <span id="s38">Actually, I don’t remember anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Well, we’ll go on what your parents told you then a little bit later.</span> <span id="s40">What was your parents’ occupation?</span> <span id="s41">Did your mother work at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: No, my mother didn’t work.</span> <span id="s43">She was a housewife, well, I think she was helping my father and my father had a drug store.</span> <span id="s44">And I think she liked to help him in the store, but she had two maids at home, (chuckles) so she could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: And was your father -- had your father been a druggist also?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Right, you got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: So it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s49">So it was in the family.</span> <span id="s50">It started, I think, with my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And what kind of education did your parents have?</span> <span id="s52">Was your father apprenticed or did he go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: No, my father had -- my family came from very Orthodox Jewish family and my father had a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s54">I don’t know if you are familiar, but he was educated…had a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s55">I think he had grade school, but beyond that he didn’t go.</span> <span id="s56">I think he had tutoring mainly.</span> <span id="s57">He had tutoring.</span> <span id="s58">I know my mother had grade school, and beyond that they didn’t go because they had to study and go to school on Shabbat, on the Saturday and they had to ride, they were not allowed to ride.</span> <span id="s59">They were strictly observant Jews and so they wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s60">They did not go beyond that.</span> <span id="s61">That’s the story I got from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: They stopped going to school altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s64">They had, I think, probably just grade school and they had tutoring.</span> <span id="s65">They had tutors coming to their home and tutoring them.</span> <span id="s66">But they had Judaic studies, you know, my father attended what was called (heider).</span> <span id="s67">It was where Jewish boys were getting -- Jewish education.</span> <span id="s68">Strictly in Judaic studies, that was the main --this was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: And did your mother receive anything like that?</span> <span id="s70">Did women receive education?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: I think, no, she didn’t go to heider.</span> <span id="s72">Girls didn’t go to heider.</span> <span id="s73">.</span> <span id="s74">She went to regular school, to a grade school where Jewish girls and the gentile girls were separated.</span> <span id="s75">They were not sitting together because it was unacceptable that Jews and gentiles were in the same together.</span> <span id="s76">So I remember some stories my mother was telling me that she was blonde with blue eyes and really she didn’t look Semitic, she looked like a gentile.</span> <span id="s77">And so one time a new principal, or whoever came and he looked at the class and all of a sudden he saw her among the Jewish girls, he said to the teacher, “How come this Jewish girl is sitting with, uh, this gentile girl is sitting with Jewish kids?”</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So there was anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: There was a very big anti-Semitism in Poland, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">(tape is shut off)</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So your parents were tutored after grade school pretty much, and your father had religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, my father had religious education.</span> <span id="s83">My mother had religious education also after school like here, they have Hebrew school here for children who go to the public schools.</span> <span id="s84">She went to a public school.</span> <span id="s85">I don’t know if my father went to a public school.</span> <span id="s86">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s87">I think he may have gone to heider where he got Jewish education and he had tutors coming to his home to be tutored in math and language and history, but other than that, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s88">I know that my mother went to public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: How in depth was his religious training?</span> <span id="s90">Did he study Torah, of course, do you know if he also studied the commentaries or how in depth that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s92">He wasn’t too religious.</span> <span id="s93">He was not too -- he wasn’t very religious, though how -- it was kind of like -- I don’t know part of him that was brought up in that, but personally, I don’t know how religious he was.</span> <span id="s94">He was never observant or religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Do you have any idea if the anti-Semitism or the war affected him that way, if that was the reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I think it started even before the war.</span> <span id="s97">It was just him.</span> <span id="s98">No, it had not -- I think the war had no effect on him.</span> <span id="s99">Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Let’s see, you were Orthodox, so your father and brother attended a synagogue, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, see it all changed with the war, once we moved away.</span> <span id="s102">This is what it was before the war.</span> <span id="s103">After the war, even during the war, I don’t remember observing anything.</span> <span id="s104">We were not observing anything because it was a matter of survival, I guess, and I don’t remember observing anything.</span> <span id="s105">I think my brother was bar mitzvahed in Russia and -- but not formal Jewish education, no nothing.</span> <span id="s106">Everything was disrupted and there was not keeping kosher.</span> <span id="s107">I mean nothing.</span> <span id="s108">Absolutely nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: It was too disorganized to…</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s111">For example, while we were in Russia, I know we had -- before the war -- I know we had - the house was kosher, I’m sure, and everything, all the holidays were observed, but as I was growing up, I don’t remember anything of that.</span> <span id="s112">There were some rules, like there was never mixing dairy and meat products.</span> <span id="s113">There was never such a things like this, I thought that’s the way it was done, you know, but I don’t think there was really -- I don’t think my mother really kept kosher because now I know what that is.</span> <span id="s114">I don’t think she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So as far as having the two sets of dishes.</span> <span id="s116">It is a very complicated process.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No, I know she didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s118">I know that she had it -- it was all disrupted, it was -- it all was changed</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: What was the principal language that was spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Polish…and Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you -- what percentage of both do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s123">I was raised on Polish.</span> <span id="s124">My parents spoke between them Yiddish, especially so that we kids don’t understand.</span> <span id="s125">They were speaking Yiddish and, so really I did not know Yiddish.</span> <span id="s126">My accent, my every language after that I learned after Polish, it was with Polish, so when I spoke Hebrew it was with a Polish accent, when I speak English, I think it’s a Polish accent too.</span> <span id="s127">People who don’t know Polish don’t realize that, but yeah, Polish was my principal language.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And did your parents speak any other language besides Yiddish and Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: German.</span> <span id="s130">German.</span> <span id="s131">I think my mother took German.</span> <span id="s132">No spoke German because --my father did too, so they must have learned German.</span> <span id="s133">He may have learned maybe from tutor, my mother learned at school, you know, German was a language, I think it was the second language in those days that they were studying.</span> <span id="s134">It wasn’t English or French then, it was German.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So it sounds as though your father -- your family -- was sort of on the better off end of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: The professional class.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Business.</span> <span id="s139">They were not professional, but my father was in business.</span> <span id="s140">He was considered to be a well-to-do person.</span> <span id="s141">That’s -- I just repeat what I heard at home.</span> <span id="s142">And so later on when we were in Russia and we had nothing and we were really starving, we never felt -- and I grew up never thinking that I was poor because we didn’t have the mentality of poverty at all, even though we had nothing and there was no food.</span> <span id="s143">But everybody was in the same boat and I, now when I sit here “poor people” and I see poor.</span> <span id="s144">It was completely different.</span> <span id="s145">We didn’t have the mentality of poor people.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: What kind of family did your mother come from?</span> <span id="s147">What did her father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: He had wine store, I think.</span> <span id="s149">Wine seller.</span> <span id="s150">He was dealing with wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: So, a merchant?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s153">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s154">The whole family, everybody was a merchant.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So, she was pretty much the same level as your father then?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s157">Actually they are first cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q; Oh, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: It is a common thing.</span> <span id="s160">In the family I think there were six cousins intermarried.</span> <span id="s161">And because you know there was no intermarriage uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: You mean between…</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: …there was no such thing as intermarriage…</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Between Jews and gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Between Jews and non-Jews, it was unheard of.</span> <span id="s166">No.</span> <span id="s167">And so the people, the families were very close and it was acceptable, very acceptable that cousins married.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Sounds like they didn’t have much choice after awhile.</span> <span id="s169">The families were -- you have only a certain amount of population.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: And also it was a very common thing.</span> <span id="s171">It was a very acceptable thing, I think among the non-Jews also.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Did your parents pretty much socially only relate to other Jews or did they…</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s174">Only Jews.</span> <span id="s175">The only non-Jewish people that they had contact with were the clients that would come into the store or dealing with commerce when my father with the store would have to order products.</span> <span id="s176">This was the only contact with the non--Jewish world socially and -- it was a small town, a small shtetl.</span> <span id="s177">Although I hear it wasn’t that small, and I think there were 50 or 60% of the population was Jewish and their life was strictly with Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Were they ghettoized in any way?</span> <span id="s179">Were they --was the Jewish population of the town forced to live in a certain part of town or did they live…?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: Yes, uh.</span> <span id="s181">At certain time it was… they could live in other areas also.</span> <span id="s182">I don’t know which year it changed but, yes, the Jews at the beginning, I don’t know from what year to what year, they had to live in a certain place and after certain year they could move.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: This time when they could move out, was that a long time in the past or are we talking about something recent?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Not recent.</span> <span id="s185">It was before the war.</span> <span id="s186">I don’t know what years, I think it was the end of the eighteenth century, I mean, beginning, of the nineteenth century, or I don’t know exactly when, but I know that there was a poor section of town and my mother went on one of her visits when she came here and I started to ask her and she said that this was the section that in the earlier ages, uh, times, Jews had to live there and then as the wealthy ones move out to other places and the poor people still stayed in that same area, probably the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: I guess you don’t remember anything about what role the synagogue played in their lives.</span> <span id="s188">Did they say anything to you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s190">It was a very important role.</span> <span id="s191">My father was going every Saturday to the synagogue every Saturday.</span> <span id="s192">My grandfather was going every day, I think he was very -- both grandparents – were very orthodox.</span> <span id="s193">The grandmothers were very orthodox and…the marriages were arranged.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: The marriages were pre-arranged, my grandparents, I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Were they arranged by the Rabbi or someone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: I think no, I think by the families.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: But through the synagogue in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I don’t think do.</span> <span id="s200">No, it was just that they were so close knit, it’s nothing like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: They were just uh families, you know, and you just did --– I don’t know.</span> <span id="s202">I’m thinking, well, my -- let’s see on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s203">I don’t know how they met or what happened, but I know that on my mother’s side, I know definitely it was arranged because my mother was telling me that her father was a Czech citizen, so they were traveling between Czechoslovakia and Hungaria and I think my great grandfather, yeah, I know that my mother’s grandfather lived in Hungaria and she used to go visit him during the vacation in the summer she had.</span> <span id="s204">There were lots -- he was a very wealthy man and there were lots of cousins and all cousins and all the kids would come and gather in there.</span> <span id="s205">And so my -- her father was one of his sons, this grandfather’s son.</span> <span id="s206">How did he go to Poland?</span> <span id="s207">It must have been prearranged.</span> <span id="s208">I don’t know, but was were very orthodox very traditionally orthodox.</span> <span id="s209">They were not that much educated now, they did things without knowing why they do, but they did it.</span> <span id="s210">It’s not like today when we want to understand everything we do and why we do it.</span> <span id="s211">I mean you have the laws and the religions and now we learn and now we want to know “Why do I do what I’m doing,” but at that time I don’t think many of them knew what they are doing except that’s what you have to do, and that’s what you do, and that’s what you are supposed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: So very little, little thought, no analysis.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Well they were just very orthodox and very uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Do you know if your family -- what kind of cultural events they enjoyed?</span> <span id="s215">Were they musical or did they enjoy the theater?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s217">Theater.</span> <span id="s218">I remember -- well, theater, when theater?</span> <span id="s219">See, until we came back after the war to Poland all these years were just a matter of survival, just to find enough to eat.</span> <span id="s220">There was no, you know, nobody was thinking of -- it was the war.</span> <span id="s221">The war was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: But before the war did they…</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Before the war I don’t know.</span> <span id="s224">They probably 0uh they went to…you know I don’t know.</span> <span id="s225">I never talked about it.</span> <span id="s226">You know I have been from a very young age, quite a young age, separated from my parents and I chaneled my life in completely different directions from quite young age on.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: So they’re different kind of people than you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: In a way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Do you know anything about their politics before the war?</span> <span id="s230">Were they involved at all or was the Jewish community very self-encompassing?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I know they were very conservative, very conservative people.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Do you know what that meant politically at that time or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No.</span> <span id="s234">No I don’t, except that uh -- I don’t know if you are familiar with very orthodox Jewish people.</span> <span id="s235">Are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Their life is -- they don’t have very much to do with the outside world.</span> <span id="s238">They observe the Jewish laws and…I know that I had one aunt who was a Socialist.</span> <span id="s239">I know that that, and she was a Zionist Socialist.</span> <span id="s240">She joined a movement, a Zionist movement and she emigrated to Palestine, what was at that time, and she was only --she was the one that survived because she wasn’t with them, you know, she escaped, she left Poland in time.</span> <span id="s241">But the family was very much against it and they were so conservative and so observant and she just didn’t want to have anything to do with it, she went completely the opposite way, so they almost wanted -- didn’t want to have anything to do with her like uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: I think I see what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s244">I can’t find the word, though.</span> <span id="s245">Sometimes I have some words that I have in either language that I want.</span> <span id="s246">I know them and it escapes me in English.</span> <span id="s247">I sit and think and I know of in another language that word so I cannot say.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Sometimes there isn’t any word.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No, it’s a very simple word that I cannot say -- they just wanted completely like give her up to-uh, oh you saw Fiddler on the Roof?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: When one of the daughters got married to uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: A Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: A Christian they were sitting shiva, they were mourning because like she was dead, well the same thing was with this aunt, this was my father’s sister.</span> <span id="s254">That’s almost how they treated her because she was a Zionist and she wanted to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s255">That was a terrible thing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Do you know about what year that was that she left?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Mhm.</span> <span id="s258">I think she went in either ’34, ‘5, or ‘6 maybe ’36.</span> <span id="s259">’35 or ’36 because I know that in ’39 she was living in a kibbutz and married a Hungarian fellow, a fellow who was a Hungarian Jew who had immigrated, who was in the same organization she was.</span> <span id="s260">He emigrated to Palestine and they met and they got married and they wanted to visit their parents, both parents, his in Hungary and hers in Poland and they got caught in the war and they never saw her parents, my grandparents.</span> <span id="s261">Luckily somehow they could go back, but they almost didn’t make it, they almost got caught and would have been killed like everybody else.</span> <span id="s262">They just in time escaped and went back to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Now when you…</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: She was the radical of the family.</span> <span id="s265">She was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: When your family left Poland, obviously the war had started and Poland had been invaded, but what specific things that happened to your family caused them to leave, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Yes, I don’t recall but I know that my father, my father did not want to leave.</span> <span id="s268">My father believed that it’s not very serious and it will be over.</span> <span id="s269">My mother wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s270">She said, “Let’s take the kids and let’s run, let’s go away from here.”</span> <span id="s271">No.</span> <span id="s272">He didn’t want to go, so she took me and my brother, she took some money and she left.</span> <span id="s273">Him with his lovely store and his lovely apartment and she just left.</span> <span id="s274">And she was with another sister-in-law whose husband did the same thing, he thought that everything would be okay.</span> <span id="s275">The two of them just left with the kids.</span> <span id="s276">My other aunt had twin boys.</span> <span id="s277">And these two women just left, hired some, a cab, a car, somehow they started to go with the flow of the people who were running away.</span> <span id="s278">and somehow miraculously after awhile my father saw what’s happening and he saw that she means business, that she’s not coming back and that things were really getting bad.</span> <span id="s279">He followed her, but it was miraculous how he found.</span> <span id="s280">I just don’t know, because people were just -- there was such panic.</span> <span id="s281">And how -- somehow by asking other people and meeting people from other cities that knew her -- somehow eventually he found us.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Do you know…</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: The other sister, the other woman, my aunt, couldn’t take this hardship, so she went back with her two boys and got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Do you know how long it took him to find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Any idea -- was it a matter of months or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Probably months, I don’t know how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Do you know where you were when he found you?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Mhm.</span> <span id="s290">I believe the place was Stryl (?)</span> <span id="s291">I think so, maybe before.</span> <span id="s292">My mother was telling me something somewhere we had written all the places where we moved, one place to another.</span> <span id="s293">From one small community to another.</span> <span id="s294">At one point I remember my mother was telling me that I should have prepared.</span> <span id="s295">Now I wasn’t thinking about it.</span> <span id="s296">I have it written because we were sitting and we wanted her to tell us everything my husband and I, we were writing.</span> <span id="s297">One thing I remember they were, they came to one city, town, a village, and somebody gave them one room and they just spread some straw on the floor and that’s where we slept.</span> <span id="s298">And my father came and he was horrified to see what condition the family was in.</span> <span id="s299">Eventually we were in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Now you were, you traveled with other people, other groups of people who were also leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Lots of people went from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And you went from Jewish community to Jewish community and found shelter with…</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: I imagine.</span> <span id="s304">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s305">I was only two or three.</span> <span id="s306">The war lasted six years, I remember things from Russia.</span> <span id="s307">Once we were in Russia I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: How old were you when you finally got to Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s310">Probably took us months.</span> <span id="s311">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s312">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s313">I never asked the question how long it took us.</span> <span id="s314">I know that we spent one year in Siberia and then the rest time in middle Asian Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s315">In the Asian part of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And you basically went that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: And that’s where we lived.</span> <span id="s318">And from that place I really remember.</span> <span id="s319">And I went to school, I went to first and second grade and elementary and I think I was there until the last years of the war probably from age three, four on.</span> <span id="s320">I remember things.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Now, did you get to Siberia -- did you travel by car or by train?</span> <span id="s322">Do you know, or a combination of different ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Not car.</span> <span id="s324">Probably by train.</span> <span id="s325">Cattle trains.</span> <span id="s326">That’s the way also we came back from Russia to Poland in cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Was this organized?</span> <span id="s328">Have your parents ever mentioned if this was organized for you or did you just sort of…?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Well, yes it was organized.</span> <span id="s330">All the Polish refugees, Polish-Jewish refugees were going back…</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: I mean when you were going out there.</span> <span id="s332">Did your parents have to make arrangements to, to get the trains as they were going east, or was someone helping the refugees along in Russia, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: (Laughs).</span> <span id="s334">Like they help here?</span> <span id="s335">(Both laughs) Refugees?</span> <span id="s336">I don’t know, I doubt it.</span> <span id="s337">There must have been some Jewish, some uh, I know there must have been something.</span> <span id="s338">I don’t know because I didn’t really -- nobody told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: So you were three in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And then in Uzbekistan when you were four.</span> <span id="s342">And that was where you went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes, I went to school in Uzbekistan, Fergana was the name of the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Well in Latin alphabet it would be F-E-R-G-A-N-A, Fergana.</span> <span id="s346">But how did we spell it?</span> <span id="s347">Its in Tashkent is the capitol of Uzbekistan so it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Do you recall what your school was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yes, I remember well my school.</span> <span id="s350">My school was a Polish school which was unusual because mostly there were, no, there was not, there was maybe one more Polish school for the older Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s351">Polish, you know we were not Jews, we were Polish.</span> <span id="s352">We were Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s353">So there was one Polish school that was in our town, but I know this was very unusual.</span> <span id="s354">Most of the kids, most of the refugees were in Russian schools.</span> <span id="s355">They gave us, a part of the regular Russian school.</span> <span id="s356">We were separated, we had just like one small wing and I remember one time, I don’t know what was going on most of the time, but one time the Russian kids were throwing stones at us.</span> <span id="s357">So one time I remember that, but…and we had our teacher.</span> <span id="s358">My teacher, do you know what was my teacher’s name?</span> <span id="s359">Orenstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Well, that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: That was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: So, was she a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: No, she was just like us a Polish-Jew, a refugee, and she had I think a little boy and he was younger than we were, but there were no classes for him so he just was coming and he was sitting with us.</span> <span id="s364">The classes were not very organized.</span> <span id="s365">I have even a postcard from that time and it is written in Russian though not in Polish.</span> <span id="s366">It’s printed, very primitive, printed on a piece of paper, but it’s in Russian.</span> <span id="s367">And I must have had as a second language, you know, Russian.</span> <span id="s368">But I did learn Polish, and Russian must have been like a second language.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: So this section of your school was specifically for Polish refugees and were you all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes we were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s371">We were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s372">I think that there was maybe one child who wasn’t Jewish that was a refugee.</span> <span id="s373">A Polish boy who was non-Jewish, but no other people that escaped -- the Jews were the ones who had to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Do you recall if this gentile boy got along with the other kids or was he isolated?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A; I don’t think he was isolated.</span> <span id="s376">I think he felt like he was in the same boat with everybody.</span> <span id="s377">Of course being a girl I had just, I was around with girls, but I don’t know if he felt isolated.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So your earliest memories are from this time and from being in school and of being in Uzbekistan.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Do you recall what your home was like?</span> <span id="s381">Do you have any recollection of your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yah, I remember it and I remember it before I went to school.</span> <span id="s383">I know my mother and my father were both trying to work because, well there was simply no food and just our main thing that were craving was bread.</span> <span id="s384">Bread was very hard to get.</span> <span id="s385">And we had, there were rations of course, we had rations, everybody had rations, and it wasn’t enough, so I think my father tried to buy some coupons on the market the black market and he was caught and he was sentenced and was in prison.</span> <span id="s386">He was in prison and this was very severe in Russia.</span> <span id="s387">It is a very severe offense when you deal with the black market.</span> <span id="s388">This was his big thing that he tried to buy some extra…</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Food.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Some extra coupons to get, you know, some extra food, some extra bread.</span> <span id="s391">Bread!</span> <span id="s392">Because that was the main thing there was just not enough.</span> <span id="s393">I remember very well, distinctly being hungry and just we were dreaming of the day we would be able to sit at the table and have enough bread to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Did you feel -- was there a lot of anti-Semitism at this time in the city that you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s396">I don’t remember that much.</span> <span id="s397">Well you know we were refugees.</span> <span id="s398">I just can imagine thinking now and knowing what’s going on now and how refugees are looked upon and dealt with.</span> <span id="s399">Nobody is too kind to them, because they are some more mouths to feed and more people to eat and take away jobs and whatever, so I’m sure we were not, uh, I don’t recall any anti-Semitism uh accidents, whatever…</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: It was more of an attitude of you being Polish rather than you being Jewish.</span> <span id="s401">You mentioned the incident of the rock throwing…</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s403">This was one time at school.</span> <span id="s404">I, uh, you know mostly we were among our own, and the Uzbeks were -- they had their own life and their own society and we had our own and I was sick -- I got sick I got typhoid and I almost didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s405">But there was a nice woman doctor who was a Russian-Jew and many Russian Jews during the war they had also to leave the cities and go and they were in Uzbekistan also.</span> <span id="s406">Even that I met here some people I met from Russia they told me that during the war they were in Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s407">Or that they were natives born in Russia and Russian living in big cities and they had to -- the families had to leave and be in those -- in Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s408">In the Asian part of Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Uh.</span> <span id="s410">Now I’m not really familiar, are the Uzbeks -- Asian in appearance?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: They are dark.</span> <span id="s412">They kind of have olive skin.</span> <span id="s413">Dark hair, dark eyes.</span> <span id="s414">I remember them wearing their national costumes.</span> <span id="s415">They have their own clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Can you describe them to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Oh yes, the ladies have lots, I even bought, I have a kepah, you know what a kepah is?</span> <span id="s418">A Yarmulke.</span> <span id="s419">You know what a yarmulke is?</span> <span id="s420">The Uzbeks were wearing a type of hat -- the men.</span> <span id="s421">It is embroidered.</span> <span id="s422">That’s what the men were wearing and when we learned that we are going back to Poland I asked my mother to buy one as a souvenir and I have it here.</span> <span id="s423">And it was made, if you look at it the inside is made from old pieces of dirty pieces of material because they didn’t have soap.</span> <span id="s424">Outside it’s embroidered and it was beautiful, but inside it has dirty pieces of cloth because it was done during the war and there was no material, just scraps, from what I don’t know, but it wasn’t washed.</span> <span id="s425">But the outside is pretty because the thread is new, the embroidery was new… (Long Pause at Beginning of tape).</span></p> <p><span id="s426">…lots and lots of braids, I don’t know how many; thirty, forty, fifty, very thin tiny, tiny braids all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Kind of like what we call “corn rows” now, like Bo Derek had in that movies, uh, with the many, many small braids.</span> <span id="s428">Black women wear their hair that way now.</span> <span id="s429">I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yah, except they’re not as long.</span> <span id="s431">These women had -- it is very long and it’s not curly.</span> <span id="s432">Their hair is not as curly as the black women.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">(phone rings)</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: So you were telling me that the hair is very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yes, the hair is -- braids are very thin.</span> <span id="s436">It’s very long, they are straight, they don’t start -- they didn’t start from here, they started rather from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: So the hair in the front was not braided, it was—</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: The hair at the nape of the neck.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: They were divided here…</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Down the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Down the middle.</span> <span id="s443">And the braids started from here, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Next to the ear and around the back.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Not from the top, no not from the top.</span> <span id="s446">And they were wearing very colorful, long dresses and the men were wearing those -- they were called tibitieka or kibitieka -- the hat that they were wearing.</span> <span id="s447">I think they are Muslims, many of them.</span> <span id="s448">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s449">But uh, they were dark; they were more like, you know, they are not European-looking, not fair skinned.</span> <span id="s450">They are rather dark.</span> <span id="s451">Not black.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So the Poles -- you Poles stood out physically from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: And you didn’t dress like them.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No, we didn’t dress like that at all.</span> <span id="s456">Neither did the Russians, you know, the other Russian people.</span> <span id="s457">This is their national dresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Did they speak Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s460">They probably spoke both Russian and Uzbek language.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: But then Russian would have been the official language.</span> <span id="s462">Do you recall that you lived in the same home, or did you move from home to…</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: We moved.</span> <span id="s464">First one I remember is we lived in some place where there was no plumbing.</span> <span id="s465">We didn’t have toilets.</span> <span id="s466">(Laughs).</span> <span id="s467">I saw a toilet for the first time in my life when I was -- after the war.</span> <span id="s468">And it was 1946 I think, 1946, when we went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s469">We used to go in the back yard, dig a hole and put a straw mat around it and this was our…</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Latrine.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s472">And then we covered it with the ground and made another hole and another -- and put again the straw mat around it.</span> <span id="s473">(Laughs).</span> <span id="s474">We lived in one room.</span> <span id="s475">The floor was -- I don’t remember if the floor was dirt floor?</span> <span id="s476">It was made from -- the house, whatever you call it, shack -- was made out of mud bricks.</span> <span id="s477">What was interesting is that for years and years I didn’t remember -- you know I didn’t see it anymore.</span> <span id="s478">I kind of forgot, and when I came to this country and I lived at some point in St. Louis and I met there a girl who was in the Peace Corps and she was -- where did she serve?</span> <span id="s479">Somewhere in Asia.</span> <span id="s480">OK, or maybe she visited.</span> <span id="s481">And she took all these pictures and slides.</span> <span id="s482">And all of a sudden I said, “My gosh, these are the same places like we lived in.”</span> <span id="s483">All of a sudden I remember all that.</span> <span id="s484">And those -- they were huts made of mud brick.</span> <span id="s485">There was no plumbing.</span> <span id="s486">There was -- I think the floor was dirt floor.</span> <span id="s487">The furniture was very scarce.</span> <span id="s488">.</span> <span id="s489">We had two narrow beds.</span> <span id="s490">In one bed my parents slept and in one bed me and my brother were sleeping and it was so narrow that eventually I had to sleep on the table.</span> <span id="s491">(laughs) I was sleeping on the table, because I was the smaller one and my brother was -- and it was so narrow that when one turned around -- you had to sleep on the side because just there was no room more than that.</span> <span id="s492">So, when one turned the other had, you know, it woke up the other person.</span> <span id="s493">And we had a table, I remember, there was two, some type of wooden box that we were keeping our clothes in and it was locked.</span> <span id="s494">And clothes were (laughs) -- I don’t know what we were wearing.</span> <span id="s495">I have no idea, I know we didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s496">Oh, I know what we were wearing on, on -- as shoes.</span> <span id="s497">We didn’t have shoes, so we were wearing those -- they were called tapechte and they were knitted they were made, you know, they were crocheted with one, uh, they were made I think from cotton and you know how much you can wear those, and the roads were dirt rocks, they were not paved.</span> <span id="s498">So when you walked in this on stones and on dirt roads (laughs) it doesn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s499">Most of the time they had holes.</span> <span id="s500">And in summer it was very hot because it gets very hot.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t know how we managed.</span> <span id="s502">(Laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Yeah, it sounds so -- an incredible change for your parents.</span> <span id="s504">You know, you wouldn’t have remembered earlier, but it must have been terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: That’s when I remember -- and it’s funny, I don’t think about it, but when I start to think about it I ask, “What were we wearing?”</span> <span id="s506">and I remember those tapechke we were wearing.</span> <span id="s507">Uh, how long, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s508">At some point things probably got better.</span> <span id="s509">I don’t know, but my memories are of not having clothes, not having shoes and not having food.</span> <span id="s510">Then we moved to another place.</span> <span id="s511">This was already very fancy.</span> <span id="s512">How fancy was it?</span> <span id="s513">There was -- we had -- (laughs) there was an outhouse.</span> <span id="s514">We had an outhouse which was very primitive, but it was already -- and all the neighbors were using it, I don’t know how many families.</span> <span id="s515">It was in the y(?)</span> <span id="s516">- in the back yard, so you had to go out and it was a courtyard and lots of people were using it.</span> <span id="s517">And I remember I hated to go there.</span> <span id="s518">It wasn’t very clean, but this was already the luxury place.</span> <span id="s519">I remember we had one window in that room.</span> <span id="s520">It was also one room we had.</span> <span id="s521">I think we rented that.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Was this a building with other dwellings in it, or was this again a single?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: It wasn’t -- it was one -- on one floor.</span> <span id="s524">Building?</span> <span id="s525">I don’t know if you can call it a building.</span> <span id="s526">It was a shack.</span> <span id="s527">I wish I could see it again, you know, I really would like to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Do you recall how your parents found out they could go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: As soon as the war -- I remember when the war was over there was a big, big celebration.</span> <span id="s530">I mean, people were going out in the street and just dancing and singing and of course, we were overjoyed.</span> <span id="s531">It was so -- it was spontaneous; everybody was delighted.</span> <span id="s532">And the next thing I knew is that I was told we are going back to Poland.</span> <span id="s533">And oh!</span> <span id="s534">Things in Poland were supposed to be fantastic.</span> <span id="s535">Everything in Poland was wonderful.</span> <span id="s536">(laughs).</span> <span id="s537">Which wasn’t true, but that how -- what the stories heard and that’s how I imagined it in my imagination, my child’s imagination.</span> <span id="s538">There will be food, there will be candies!</span> <span id="s539">Will be so many candies that I won’t be able to walk on the street.</span> <span id="s540">I’ll have to push the candies (makes a swimming motion) on the sides.</span> <span id="s541">(Laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: So they pretty much knew that they could go back after the war ended then?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: And you went to…</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: We never went back to the same place where we lived before the war.</span> <span id="s546">We never went back there, so I never visited or saw that place again.</span> <span id="s547">We came back -- you know Poland was always divided between Russia and between Germany.</span> <span id="s548">On the east side is the Russian border, on the west is Germany.</span> <span id="s549">So Poland got back, after the war what was before earlier years was Poland.</span> <span id="s550">Was called schloss.</span> <span id="s551">In German schlessen.</span> <span id="s552">(She means Silesia).</span> <span id="s553">Where the border was, they got that part back.</span> <span id="s554">And that’s where all the -- most of the refugees returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: You were pretty much sent back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yes, we were sent.</span> <span id="s557">And it was a big city.</span> <span id="s558">We lived in Wroclaw what was called Wroclaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: W-R-O-C-L-A-W.</span> <span id="s561">And it was a German city before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: And were they…</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: And then it became Polish after the war.</span> <span id="s564">It was in -- when part of the eastern Poland was annexed to Russia and they got some of the part that was on the west that belonged to Germany and that’s the – where we returned, what was called in Polish the “reclaimed land.”</span> <span id="s565">Jene Robsiskane in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: And the people who lived there, did they feel that they were Germans or did they feel happy to be back in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: The Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: The, uh, the people who had lived there continuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: The people who had lived there, they were thrown out.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: They were kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Mhm.</span> <span id="s574">They were Germans.</span> <span id="s575">they were kicked out.</span> <span id="s576">And I remem (unable to complete word).</span> <span id="s577">As a matter of fact, I remember still some refugees, German refugees were leaving, the last, just like we were earlier kicked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Going through the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: They were going through that after the war.</span> <span id="s580">So I -- when we came, still in ’46, there were some remnants and I remember them going and it was a very sad sight to see.</span> <span id="s581">How they were, you know, carrying their little belongings and most of the people were probably poor people who couldn’t escape earlier and they were just, uh.</span> <span id="s582">You could see old people and children and women carrying the little, uh, belongings, you know, with everything.</span> <span id="s583">The city was destroyed.</span> <span id="s584">There were blocks and blocks they were -- it was destroyed during the bombardment, during the war, and a great part of the city was destroyed.</span> <span id="s585">It was streets, streets after streets were completely destroyed and in ruins.</span> <span id="s586">Ruins and ruins.</span> <span id="s587">And we settled, we rented -- we moved -- first we got an apartment and we had to leave it, to leave the apartment because somebody -- it belonged to somebody -- it was promised to somebody else.</span> <span id="s588">And we moved to another apartment where we lived until the time that we emigrated</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Well, I think that’s a good place to stop for right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">End of Side Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Beginning – Tape two, Side one.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: This is the second interview with Esther Lawner.</span> <span id="s593">This is Julie Orenstein.</span> <span id="s594">It is July 23, 1984.</span> <span id="s595">Let’s see, the last time we talked we got to the point where you had just come back from Uzbekistan to Poland, but I didn’t ask you very much about what your parents did in Uzbekistan.</span> <span id="s596">You said they both worked while they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Mhm.</span> <span id="s598">They worked -- I, um, let’s see.</span> <span id="s599">I don’t really remember what they did.</span> <span id="s600">I remember at one time they were selling candies.</span> <span id="s601">Candies in a, like, a little cart on the street.</span> <span id="s602">But I don’t think they did this all the time.</span> <span id="s603">Oh, I know.</span> <span id="s604">When we were --when first we arrived in Siberia, my father was working in a lumber, uh, there were lots of forest and woods and they were just cutting all the woods and I guess in a lumber yard or something.</span> <span id="s605">I remember it was very hard physical work which he wasn’t used to before, you know, he had a drug store and he was a lum--so he was like working in a lumber yard.</span> <span id="s606">Very hard physical work.</span> <span id="s607">When they moved to Uzbekistan I don’t remember what he was doing.</span> <span id="s608">I don’t know what he was doing.</span> <span id="s609">At one point I remember they had -- they -- I remember my mother working, uh, knitting gloves for the soldiers at the front.</span> <span id="s610">They were big, big winter gloves.</span> <span id="s611">Heavy, very thick, you know, for the winters in Russia, very severe winters.</span> <span id="s612">I remember her knitting these and she was working very fast and she was, like, getting prizes because she was such a fast worker.</span> <span id="s613">The other thing I remember is, they were -- had this, like a pushcart selling candies.</span> <span id="s614">This must have been toward the end, but I don’t know, I, if I remember any details, you know, I don’t know if they had a job all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: You mentioned at one time that the return to Poland was organized by someone who arranged the transportation I guess for large numbers of you.</span> <span id="s616">Do you remember anything about that?</span> <span id="s617">Who was in charge of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No, except that we knew we were refugees and we knew we are temporarily in there and as soon as the war is over we will be returning back to Poland, that’s all I remember.</span> <span id="s619">But how it was organized, and so, on I don’t know.</span> <span id="s620">I remember the journey back.</span> <span id="s621">We were traveling in the cattle trains and I remember the long, long, long ride.</span> <span id="s622">I think it wasted, like, two weeks, I don’t know how long.</span> <span id="s623">But we were just -- transportation was like cattle cars and we were just sleeping on…on…</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: On cots?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A; No, cots are very luxurious.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Were they boards just kind of hung up?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Yes, on boards they were right -- you know how they made it -- boards one on top of the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Uhm, almost like bookshelves.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Like bookshelves.</span> <span id="s630">Deep bookshelves.</span> <span id="s631">And that’s where we piled and that’s how we…</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Did you just sit on the floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s634">Either we lied or we sat on the floor.</span> <span id="s635">It was a long ride.</span> <span id="s636">No, I don’t remember any, uh, the doors were open and that’s the whole time we had some light and I think, uh, I don’t remember windows.</span> <span id="s637">I remember it wasn’t very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: It doesn’t sound very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Well, the spirit was good.</span> <span id="s640">I mean we were…</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: You were going home.</span> <span id="s642">You said last time that you had some very high expectations of going back to Poland: images of food and candy and having plenty of everything.</span> <span id="s643">It sounds as if your parents were also looking forward to it, but it also sounds as if it wasn’t what you thought it was going to be.</span> <span id="s644">Did you find that it was better when you returned to Poland?</span> <span id="s645">That your life improved?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: Uh, when we returned I remember very vividly that we were driving into ruins.</span> <span id="s647">We are driving right to a completely destroyed city.</span> <span id="s648">And I was just wondering where we are to live because all we saw were streets after streets after streets after blocks and blocks of destroyed houses, burned down houses, big blocks because it was a big city.</span> <span id="s649">We arrived in the city of Wroclaw uh, it was a German city before the war and so it was completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s650">After the war Poland got this part of, um, it was like this city before to Poland and it was taken by the Germans and after the war this whole part (Silesia?)</span> <span id="s651">was returned to Poland and so we were driving into the city and it was just terrifying.</span> <span id="s652">I thought (Well, that’s how the whole of Poland looks, just burned down.”</span> <span id="s653">Finally we arrived.</span> <span id="s654">I don’t remember after that what happened the next thing I remember is that we had some rented apartment that we had to leave after awhile because somebody else was supposed to get it, and then we moved to another place, another apartment, and then we lived there until we made Aliyah to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: And what was your parents’ reaction, do you remember?</span> <span id="s656">Were they as afraid and disappointed as you were/</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s658">Lots of sadness, anxiety, very, ud sad, ud.</span> <span id="s659">Sad.</span> <span id="s660">My parents were always sad.</span> <span id="s661">And, uh, I started to go to school.</span> <span id="s662">I was, I remember I was eight years old when we came back and I was sent to a school, to a Yiddish school.</span> <span id="s663">Where we lived -- where we found finally apartment, the city was not destroyed.</span> <span id="s664">There were here and there houses destroyed, but mainly there were still, you know, buildings.</span> <span id="s665">Where I went to school, the school where I went -- was sent -- was again in an area completely destroyed, completely burned down and it was like a ghost town and the school was there among all these ruins.</span> <span id="s666">I had to take two streetcars to get there and it was frightening.</span> <span id="s667">I had -- I went with my brother and he got mad at me one time and he told me he would leave me in the middle and I would have to get to school on my own and it was terrifying.</span> <span id="s668">It must have been, because I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s669">My father at some point went back to the city where we were born where we lived before the war and I wanted very much to go with him, but he would not take me.</span> <span id="s670">I was very bitter about it, to this day I am, because I wanted very much to go and see where it was that I was born.</span> <span id="s671">When he came back he had a breakdown, because -- of course, at that time they didn’t know what it was, and he was not hospitalized, but he must have been very depressed and he was just in bed, and I remember him being sick and I cannot -- I think -- I’m sure it was emotional.</span> <span id="s672">And in later -- in later years when I talked to my mother she told me that she feels do terribly the first -- because when he came there was nothing, there was.</span> <span id="s673">Everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s674">His property was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: When he went back, was that when he began to explore what had happened to your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: At that time he must have had an idea before that, uh, what happened.</span> <span id="s677">They probably heard because people were alive from the city and they were also from – in Wroclaw, and also in Russia we were with some people that were from the same place where we were, and they, you know, were were -- there was some communication, letters, I don’t know exactly what they knew, but when he went back to Nowy Sacd I think he wanted to find out for himself and maybe mainly for the property, for his store and his apartment and I think they owned some buildings.</span> <span id="s678">Just wanted to know what happened to all this and they found out.</span> <span id="s679">I remember he was telling us this story, he walked into the -- his store and the lady was -- asked him if she can help him and he told her, “Well, this is my store,” and she said, “No.</span> <span id="s680">it no longer is yours.”</span> <span id="s681">And, well, he was just broken up, you know, because nobody was -- everybody was gone, everyone was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Was there, uh, so the property was still there physically, it hadn’t been…</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Oh, yes, it was taken away, yes, by the government, it was confiscated, you know, it no longer was his.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: And what was the apartment like that you lived in after…</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: In Wroclaw?</span> <span id="s686">Um, it was an old building of apartments, uh, all the buildings they were only apartment buildings because it was an old city.</span> <span id="s687">We had one room, a bigger room, we had a kitchen with no windows.</span> <span id="s688">We walked in, we had a kitchen with no windows.</span> <span id="s689">We walked from the kitchen to the bigger room, that’s where we had a table and one bed.</span> <span id="s690">There was -- then from this room you walked into a smaller room and there was one bed or two beds and from that room you walked into a little niched, like.</span> <span id="s691">It was dark, there was no window.</span> <span id="s692">There was one in each of the bigger rooms, there was one window to the street and, uh, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: And was this -- did this impress you as being a better place that you had lived in in Uzbekistan?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Oh, yes, it was a better place, but there was one toilet on the floor for all the tenants.</span> <span id="s695">I don’t think we had a faucet.</span> <span id="s696">Did we have a faucet.</span> <span id="s697">I think there was just one.</span> <span id="s698">Running water was -- I can’t recall if it was in the apartment or if it was also right next to the toilet, uh, the bathroom, the restroom, outside the restroom.</span> <span id="s699">Very primitive.</span> <span id="s700">The buildings were very old.</span> <span id="s701">It was an old city.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Do you remember if you liked it there?</span> <span id="s703">You said your parents were sad.</span> <span id="s704">It must have been…</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s706">I knew that we -- we knew it was temporarily.</span> <span id="s707">We already applied for a visa to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: When did that happen?</span> <span id="s709">Was that very shortly after you arrived back in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: That we applied?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, because when we arrived in ’46 Israel was not independent yet and you couldn’t go because the British were in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: How do you -- do you recall when you first heard about Israel, or when your family first began thinking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: Well, I joined a youth movement the Shomer Hatzair it was a Zionist youth movement.</span> <span id="s715">We were organized by uh -- all the Jewish youth was organized and there were several of them and one of them was one that I joined and my brother was also already in it.</span> <span id="s716">My brother made an Aliyah.</span> <span id="s717">My brother joined -- it was called -- they organized.</span> <span id="s718">I was small -- I was eight years old, eight, nine.</span> <span id="s719">My brother was thirteen,-- fourteen.</span> <span id="s720">And he joined -- they had -- they were setting up like a kibbutz and it was -- they were preparing for the youth of Israel and they all -- we all knew that that’s where we were going</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: And what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: ’46, ’47.</span> <span id="s723">My brother went to Palestine in ’47 and he left home and he was on the ship Exodus.</span> <span id="s724">And he arrived to Palestine I think in ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And by that time you were already in the youth group?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Uh, yes, I was in the youth group.</span> <span id="s727">We were meeting one a week, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And were you also preparing to go to the kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No, I was too young.</span> <span id="s730">I would have joined my brother, but I was too young, just eight to nine years old.</span> <span id="s731">Ten years old when he left, I think -- nine years.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: So you and your brother really thought about going to Israel before your parents did.</span> <span id="s733">Or was it sort of family thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s735">We didn’t have family discussions, much family discussions.</span> <span id="s736">Uh, there was not much sharing.</span> <span id="s737">My parents didn’t share much, you know, they just made decisions and didn’t ask and that was it.</span> <span id="s738">There was not much discussions.</span> <span id="s739">My brother did not get along with my parents, with my mother, I guess, and he left, he just left when he was fourteen he left home.</span> <span id="s740">He joined one of these kibbutzim they were called I think.</span> <span id="s741">He stayed -- they stayed for awhile until they could leave to go to Palestine and he just happened to be on this Exodus, this ship in ’47 that was -- I rem he - I remember that it was in the news and I remember getting -- we got a card from him and we knew that he was on that ship and we knew what was going on that they didn’t reach -- when they reached they were sent back to Europe and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Now wasn’t there a movie made about that ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: I was wondering if that was the one.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Well, the movie was based on that, but there was also an authentic, uh, a documentary on that that I saw.</span> <span id="s746">As a matter of fact, here at JCC (Jewish Community Center) they were showing it one time and my husband and I saw it and we saw there a boy that looked like my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: It was amazing.</span> <span id="s749">Because it was taken by somebody, by an American, I think.</span> <span id="s750">I don’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s751">Meyers, I think he was just…</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Just on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: So, the journey.</span> <span id="s754">And when they came to Palestine, it was here, I saw it.</span> <span id="s755">It was my brother on the boat.</span> <span id="s756">The movie was based on that, on what happened to that ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Well, that was quite an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: He finally did make it in then.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Yes, he made it and he was 17 when he came to Israel and, uh, he joined the air force learned a profession in the air force and married a girl whom he new since -- they were together on the ship and they were -- she lost her father, her mother was a widow, she lost her father during the war and she has a brother, there were two children.</span> <span id="s761">Her mother raised her.</span> <span id="s762">They were also in Russia during the war, the same -- very similar story and they met in that kibbutz, but were still in Poland.</span> <span id="s763">Her brother and she were there and they were all coming to make an Aliyah to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: After your parents returned to Poland did they resume their religious activities, or were they able to?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Uh, on holidays we were going to a synagogue.</span> <span id="s766">I don’t remember much religion.</span> <span id="s767">I remember eating matzot during Pesach.</span> <span id="s768">My mother was making wine because there was no kosher wine so she was making her own wine.</span> <span id="s769">We were buying the matzot.</span> <span id="s770">We ate matzot for Pesach but we were not a religious family.</span> <span id="s771">No, we were not religious, only we were Jewish, we knew we are going to Israel.</span> <span id="s772">There were anti-Semites -- there was anti-Semites around us.</span> <span id="s773">After one year of being in that school I changed, I went to a Polish school.</span> <span id="s774">I had a traumatic experience in the Yiddish school because I did not know Yiddish, my parents spoke to me Polish that was the only language I knew.</span> <span id="s775">I came to that school and I did not understand anything, I mean, I picked up something throughout the year.</span> <span id="s776">I learned some somehow.</span> <span id="s777">The atmosphere in the school was wild.</span> <span id="s778">All the kids were -- had no parents, they were orphans.</span> <span id="s779">Somehow they survived the war.</span> <span id="s780">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s781">Many of them lost parents, uh, it was rough.</span> <span id="s782">It was very rough.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Were any of these children people you had known in Uzbekistan or were you not…you weren’t exactly shipped back in a unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: No, there was be-friended one friend, one girl, that became my very close friend after this -- this was in the third grade.</span> <span id="s785">After that we both left the school.</span> <span id="s786">She went to another school closer to where she lived.</span> <span id="s787">I went also to a Polish school closer to where I lived so that it was walking distance and for her it was walking distance.</span> <span id="s788">And we kept -- we were friends -- we kept up our friendship.</span> <span id="s789">We belonged to the same youth organization we were meeting there and besides we were meeting on weekends.</span> <span id="s790">She was my close friend until we made Aliyah to Israel and they could not because her brother was a professor of -- he was professor at the university, he was teaching Marxism and Leninism, he was a big Communist and they wouldn’t -- all of a sudden we wanted to make Aliyah to Israel they right away took his job they – he was without job and finally he got a job in a high school.</span> <span id="s791">The reason he wanted to go to Israel was because he had -- his fiancé left for Israel and eventually they, they -- six years later they were allowed to leave, Israel, uh, Poland and I kept up with her, she was my friend.</span> <span id="s792">But, no, -- nobody that was in Uzbekistan that I remember.</span> <span id="s793">Maybe some older people, but I did not see them myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: So, the first school you went to was a Yiddish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: And that was -- bad, uh, was that a private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I don’t know by whom it was run.</span> <span id="s798">Might have -- must have been run by the Jewish community, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s799">I -- we were not involved in any communal activity, so it is all for me very vague.</span> <span id="s800">I don’t know who was running that school.</span> <span id="s801">I remember the name of the school was named after Sholem Aleichem, the Yiddish writer, but who ran the school I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And then after that…</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I went to a Polish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: And you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I was -- I was the only Jewish girl in my class.</span> <span id="s806">I became a better student because I knew already the language.</span> <span id="s807">I was a good student.</span> <span id="s808">I had friends, but I knew I was different.</span> <span id="s809">I was -- first of all I knew that we were planning to leave, we were planning to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s810">And there was religion in the class, they were at that time in Poland they were teaching -- one of the subjects in school was religion and it was of course Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s811">I was leaving that hour.</span> <span id="s812">I didn’t have -- for me it was a free hour, that was it.</span> <span id="s813">There were some anti-Semitic incidents at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Mostly on the part of the students, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes, from the students.</span> <span id="s816">Never the teach -- never on the part of the teachers.</span> <span id="s817">I had a picture.</span> <span id="s818">I had two pictures from Russia that were very dear to me because pictures somehow were important to me.</span> <span id="s819">We never had any.</span> <span id="s820">We left everything, when the war broke out my parents just fled.</span> <span id="s821">They didn’t take any pictures, they didn’t have any pictures from what I looked like when I was little.</span> <span id="s822">I had these two pictures that were taken when we were in Russia of my class, the children that I was with and I brought them to school to show to my friends and one of these boys was terribly anti-Semitic and I remember his name and I remember how he looked, he grabbed that picture from me and he tore it to pieces.</span> <span id="s823">And because he knew that these were Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s824">However I never complained about it.</span> <span id="s825">I didn’t say anything to any of the teachers.</span> <span id="s826">I just tried to be very brave about it, but inside I was hurting terribly.</span> <span id="s827">I was very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: I guess it’s hard to complain to the teachers sometimes, I got picked on in school sometimes, too.</span> <span id="s829">So, when did your family leave Poland?</span> <span id="s830">You left with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Yes, in 1950, which was four years after we came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s832">Israel got her independence in ’48 and, uh, it took two years for us to be allowed to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Do you remember how your parents went about it, what the process was that they need to go through?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: It’s funny; I tell you I don’t know those things, sometimes I want to cry about it sometimes I want to laugh about them.</span> <span id="s835">We had -- I was -- I was -- I went on vacation with this friend of mine, the friend, her name was Rita?</span> <span id="s836">She and her mother and her brother were taking vacations every summer and one summer -- and she and I were going -- Shomer Hatzair had camps every year which we went to.</span> <span id="s837">My mother was always against -- my mother was very much opposed to me being in that organization.</span> <span id="s838">It was a Socialist Zionist movement and she was very much against that, it was too much to the left for her and I didn’t know from beans, I mean, I had the fun!</span> <span id="s839">It was wonderful and I just had great fun there.</span> <span id="s840">Anyway they closed our -- the -- in ’49 it became in Poland illegal to have Zionist organizations, they closed down all the Zionist organizations, so I couldn’t go and there was one summer left before we made an Aliyah and she went to a resort and she asked me to come along and we -- I went with them, with her mother and her brother.</span> <span id="s841">While we were there my mother came, she told me we got a visa to go to Israel and it was a great joy, I mean, I was jumping to the ceiling I was so overjoyed.</span> <span id="s842">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s843">I didn’t know my -- well, I did know my parents didn’t want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s844">My father -- my father wanted to go to America.</span> <span id="s845">My mother was Zionist.</span> <span id="s846">She wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s847">I would not hear about coming to America, I did not want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s848">I said, “My brother is in Israel, that’s where I belong, I want to go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s849">As it turned out he just had dreams, he didn’t have anybody here to sign for -- to get papers.</span> <span id="s850">It was just a dream for him.</span> <span id="s851">But we didn’t make it any easier for him to dream because I said, “You want to go to America, you go.</span> <span id="s852">The two of you.</span> <span id="s853">I am going to Israel.”</span> <span id="s854">There was no doubt in my mind that I would go only to Israel.</span> <span id="s855">And so we went.</span> <span id="s856">We were allowed to take -- we had some big crate and we were allowed to take out belongings, but no money, no silver, no gold, no jewelry, nothing like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Mhm.</span> <span id="s858">That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Definitely.</span> <span id="s860">You could take just clothes and some bedding, (very bitter), that was all, nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: The government made you leave your money.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s863">I mean we found ways.</span> <span id="s864">We didn’t have much, anyway.</span> <span id="s865">What little that we had.</span> <span id="s866">I had a Mogen David I got for my 12th birthday, my 11th birthday, I think.</span> <span id="s867">I got a gold chain with a Jewish Star on it.</span> <span id="s868">This was the only gold piece that I had and it was, you know, the chain was thin, it was little, but I was not allowed to take it and we didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s869">There was a piece, maybe my mother had a wedding band, maybe, they had a coin.</span> <span id="s870">They bought, I think a golden coin and they made a ring out of it because you were not allowed to take this and they had, maybe like, $25.00 They were not allowed to take this.</span> <span id="s871">So, you know, they made a coat for me.</span> <span id="s872">You couldn’t just, there were no -- were not available, you made your own clothes, you went to a seamstress or to a tailor and you had your clothes made, so they made for me a coat, a new, brand new coat.</span> <span id="s873">It was the first new thing that I got.</span> <span id="s874">And they made big buttons, they were fake buttons and inside that button somehow we put the $25.00 and my chain with my gold -- with my Star of David.</span> <span id="s875">It was pathetic.</span> <span id="s876">It was funny and it was sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: It’s awfully cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: I was frightened because I thought that they will -- on the border they will ask me why my buttons were so big, why my coat is open.</span> <span id="s879">It was cool.</span> <span id="s880">It was November, in Europe it was cool and I had my coat open.</span> <span id="s881">I was afraid they would ask me why is my coat open.</span> <span id="s882">I couldn’t button it up because the buttons were so huge, because they were -- inside there was this thing and I was petrified.</span> <span id="s883">My parents didn’t explain to me anything, they didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s884">So I was like -- I was so afraid.</span> <span id="s885">But nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: How old were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: I think I was twelve, 12 or close to 13.</span> <span id="s888">When we came to Israel.</span> <span id="s889">I was 13 so it must have been when I was about 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did your brother get any religious education, or was he bar mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I think he was bar mitzvah in Russia, but, uh, I don’t remember much.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Did you receive any religious education?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: No.</span> <span id="s894">No religious education.</span> <span id="s895">I did not receive -- I received Zionist education -- I was indoctrinated into, uh, I became a Zionist, but religion, no, except I knew that I had heard stories about my grandparents, that they were religious and, uh, there was not much discussion.</span> <span id="s896">There was no -- there was never good communication between, uh, in our home between my parents and the kids.</span> <span id="s897">Not much communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Sounds like they were trying very hard just to keep their own minds on straight.</span> <span id="s899">It was probably very difficult for them.</span> <span id="s900">Uh, I wanted to ask you something else.</span> <span id="s901">Oh, what kinds of jobs did your parents have in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: After the war they opened a grocery store.</span> <span id="s903">They found somebody that they knew, I think, from the same place where they -- from the same city where we were from and they opened together a grocery store.</span> <span id="s904">After awhile they separated and they stayed in the store, the other family left the partnership and my parents owned it until we made Aliyah to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: When you went to Israel did you go by boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yes, by an old boat that almost sunk twice.</span> <span id="s907">Again we were it was again like -- I read about those ships, later.</span> <span id="s908">I read about it.</span> <span id="s909">It wasn’t a picnic, I tell you.</span> <span id="s910">It wasn’t a picnic.</span> <span id="s911">We were again on those big -- they were – what did they use?</span> <span id="s912">These ships were used for, um, they were not passenger ships.</span> <span id="s913">They were made, you know, improvised for the people to leave -- for the people that were going to Israel, they made -- again we were sleeping one upon the other -- on top of the other and it was miserable.</span> <span id="s914">Oh, it was miserable.</span> <span id="s915">We were seasick.</span> <span id="s916">Oh, were we seasick.</span> <span id="s917">Terribly.</span> <span id="s918">Nobody could eat anything.</span> <span id="s919">And we were introduced for the first time to olives.</span> <span id="s920">(Both laugh)</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: While you were seasick?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Disgusting.</span> <span id="s923">It was a disaster, because it was almost like eating straight poison.</span> <span id="s924">The taste was awful.</span> <span id="s925">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s926">We were not use to olives – green olives and black olives.</span> <span id="s927">All I remember from that trip was being seasick and terribly sick and just having those olives.</span> <span id="s928">Probably there was some other food, but the olives were so bad.</span> <span id="s929">I don’t know what else we had to eat.</span> <span id="s930">It mustn’t have been very much, but we arrived, we made it.</span> <span id="s931">And my brother met us.</span> <span id="s932">He was already in the air force and we were, uh, he was in a kibbutz, he was on a kibbutz and he joined the air force.</span> <span id="s933">He never came back to live with us.</span> <span id="s934">We were living in a Ma’abara.</span> <span id="s935">Do you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: They were transient -- transit camps for new immigrants that came to Israel.</span> <span id="s938">We lived in tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: How long did that go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: It was going on for a while.</span> <span id="s941">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s942">I was -- I was miserable.</span> <span id="s943">I didn’t want to be in the te -- first we went -- like there was a camp and it was like quarantine.</span> <span id="s944">It was in Haifa and just thousands, hundreds and thousands of people from all over the world were put together, from Africa, from the Arab countries, from Europe.</span> <span id="s945">Nobody could speak the others’ language, nobody spoke Hebrew, everybody was speaking their own language, we were living in tents, it was hot, it was miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: What was the food like?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Oh!</span> <span id="s948">It was bad.</span> <span id="s949">It was bad.</span> <span id="s950">We had American cheese, again they sent us American cheese which we never had before and it was awful, it tasted to us terrible.</span> <span id="s951">It was all new foods that we were not used to and it was difficult to get used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Did your brother visit you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No, he did not visit us there.</span> <span id="s954">He came to the -- he met us when we were still – before we came into the port we were waiting -- we were in the port, but we didn’t come yet to the shore and he came on a small boat to visit us and it was – we were thrilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: How long had it been since you’d seen him?</span> <span id="s956">What amount of time had passed since you’d seen him?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Maybe even longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: And you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yeah, it was four years because it took so long.</span> <span id="s962">Somehow when you are a kid time stretches.</span> <span id="s963">It was like twenty years, it seemed to me like it was forever, but it was only four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: So it must have been very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Yes we were -- I was very happy to see him.</span> <span id="s966">I was so proud of him.</span> <span id="s967">He was wearing a uniform.</span> <span id="s968">And we were very proud of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: After the camp where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: I left the camp.</span> <span id="s971">I went to Youth Aliyah.</span> <span id="s972">Do you know what that is?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: These were schools -- those were schools and dormitories for children -- for new immigrants and my parents still stayed in the Ma’abara in the transit -- in the transit camps, but I left.</span> <span id="s975">I went to a Youth Aliyah and I was 14 by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Uhm, let me turn the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">End Side One.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Begin Side Two.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: What city was the Youth Aliyah in?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: it was in Magdiel.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And what part of Israel is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Not too far from Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s983">Central.</span> <span id="s984">The central part.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: And did you ever live with your parents again after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: One year.</span> <span id="s987">I was there from 14 until I was 17.</span> <span id="s988">At age 17 I came home because this was -- you could be there only until that age.</span> <span id="s989">I came home for one year, it was, home and then I went to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: I want to ask both what you did and what your parents did.</span> <span id="s991">I guess I’ll ask you what you did first.</span> <span id="s992">What was the Youth Aliyah like?</span> <span id="s993">What kind of -- you lived in a dormitory, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Yes.</span></p>

ok?</span> <span id="s998">We lived in bunks.</span> <span id="s999">In the bunks there were separate rooms, there were boys, maybe they had to-bunks, I think, maybe we were just divided by bunks and

fields.</span> <span id="s1007">I don’t know what they were growing.</span> <span id="s1008">I never worked in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">(phone rings) I worked in the kitchen, I worked in the clinic, they had a clinic, they had a nurse that was living in our school and they had a doctor that was coming, I think, once a week, uh, to the clinic.</span> <span id="s1010">So I worked in the clinic, I worked in the kitchen, I worked also on the grounds of the school.</span> <span id="s1011">We were tending to -- we were growing some flowers.</span> <span id="s1012">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1013">We had some chicken, raising chicken, I think, and cattle.</span> <span id="s1014">There was -- I think there was some cattle and there were some fields there were -- we were growing some -- I don’t know exactly what and I think we worked also in orchards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: So this was not a desert area then…</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: No, no, no it wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1017">It wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1018">it was an agricultural school.</span> <span id="s1019">Really they -- it was meant to prepare people to, you know, for

id="s1028">A: Hebrew, math, science, all the academic subjects, the Bible, the Tenach, our history, all the subjects that are taught in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Did you ever visit your parents at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yes, we would get holidays.</span> <span id="s1031">We were -- I don’t remember -- we could visit, I think once or twice a year.</span> <span id="s1032">I thought I would remember much more than what I do, somehow I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1033">Yeah, I’d visit with my parents.</span> <span id="s1034">My mother used to visit me, occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Did you see your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: My brother, sometimes.</span> <span id="s1037">Not very often.</span> <span id="s1038">I was

id="s1047">A: They were my -- in my -- we were divided by age groups, you know, we had groups.</span> <span id="s1048">There were kids, um, I think from nine years on, they had, so we were divided according to age and in our group, yeah, these were people, friends from my group, age group.</span> <span id="s1049">My roommates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And you worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: Did you have your evenings free pretty much?</span> <span id="s1053">Did you go into town at all, or do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Mhm, we didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s1055">Most of the kids were orphans.</span> <span id="s1056">Either they didn’t have parents or they had one parent.</span> <span id="s1057">Most of the kids were from, you know, survivors -- children that survived.</span> <span id="s1058">Also there were kids from Arab countries at that time, from Morocco, Iraq.</span> <span id="s1059">As a matter of fact my best friend was from Iraq.</span> <span id="s1060">Those were all kids whose parents had no means, you know, to give them a decent life and it was a very good solution for the children to be in a normal environment, because people were living -- at that time most of the immigrants from ’50 -- I learned -- I was --’51 I went to Youth Aliyah.</span> <span id="s1061">But everybody was still living in magarot, in those transit camps in tents, so this was a very good solution for the kids while the parents were in the meantime getting jobs and possibly getting apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: So did the school provide you with clothing and food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: Yes, they provided us with clothing and food and education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: And it was free to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: Almost free, yes, it was almost free.</span> <span id="s1066">There was a minimal charge.</span> <span id="s1067">Very minimal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: So you were there three years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And then

in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: I think that it was in ’52 that there was a big flood.</span> <span id="s1074">The rains were so heavy and they were just completely flooded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">(phone rings)</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: There was a flood in ’52…</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: Yeah, I think it was, yeah, the first year or the second year they were flooded and somebody nearby, near the Ma’abara ,near the, uh, near the camp -- some people just took them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: So they lived for two years…</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: And they rented, uh, uh, a small little apartment from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: And they lived for two years in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: I don’t know how long they lived there.</span> <span id="s1082">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: From ’50 to ’52?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: I don’t remember, you know, because I was at school.</span> <span id="s1085">I was -- and, um, I don’t know exactly how long they were there.</span> <span id="s1086">A half year, or year.</span> <span id="s1087">Maybe less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Did they have a way of making a living there or were they given money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: My father was still working in all kinds of odd jobs.</span> <span id="s1090">At the beginning he worked at buildings, in construction, uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: After the flood, then, they were taken in by some people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yeah, and they rented from them a little, like, a -- what would you call it?</span> <span id="s1093">Bungalow.</span> <span id="s1094">A small, little, one-room -- I think it was a one-room.</span> <span id="s1095">I think it was a little house, tiny house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: And your father did the construction work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Did your mother work at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: I think she got temporarily some job as a salesperson in a store.</span> <span id="s1100">I don’t know how long it lasted.</span> <span id="s1101">I wasn’t in contact with them all the time.</span> <span id="s1102">I don’t think there were letters.</span> <span id="s1103">We weren’t writing.</span> <span id="s1104">I don’t remember writing letters or getting letters at that time, so we -- I guess we just saw each other every few months</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Then when you went home were they still living in the bungalow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Yes, but then they moved to Haifa this was in place Ramat Hasharoh and after that they lived in place Kiryat/Shaul.</span> <span id="s1107">The Ma’abara, the camp was in place Ramat Hasharoh, it was very close by where they rented this little apartment and then they moved to Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Did you work after you went back to live with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: No, I went to school.</span> <span id="s1110">I went to high school, finished the high school.</span> <span id="s1111">I finished high school and then I went to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: So you went to school in Haifa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Was that similar to high school here pretty much?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Did you have more religious education than we have here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: No, no, there was no religious -- it was not a religious school.</span> <span id="s1118">I didn’t have any religious education except that, you know, we studied the Bible, you know, the Tenach, but it was not, uh, we didn’t, uh, the approach wasn’t religious.</span> <span id="s1119">It was a more historic approach.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1121">Were your parents -- were their religious activities any different in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: No, just the holidays.</span> <span id="s1123">They went just for the holidays.</span> <span id="s1124">They went, to, uh, synagogue, but my parents were not religious.</span> <span id="s1125">I have no -- after the war -- well for instance I remember I have no -- well they we`.</span> <span id="s1126">*re kind of observing the holidays, but not really religious, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: I think what I’ve heard of Israel -- there’s not a very heavy emphasis put on religion there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: That is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: So, let’s see, you went to school, you lived with your parents for a year, then what made you decide to go into the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: I had to.</span> <span id="s1131">And I wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: That’s right, women are drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah, at age 18, if you are not married, you go to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Is that for men also, if men are married they don’t have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: No.</span> <span id="s1136">Men have to.</span> <span id="s1137">Women don’t have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: And what was life like in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Well, you go first through the training period, and uh, I think it was five weeks.</span> <span id="s1140">Between five and six weeks.</span> <span id="s1141">I think so.</span> <span id="s1142">What it was like, uh, it was rough at times it was good experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: How long were you in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Did you do any traveling, or were you pretty much stationed in one place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Yes, I was stationed in one place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Near Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: And what kind of jobs did you do?</span> <span id="s1150">Did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: In -- I worked in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Did you ever see any action?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1154">No, in the evening I took classes.</span> <span id="s1155">I went to school in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: What kinds of things did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: I took Early Child Education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Was that college level then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: I think so, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: So you wanted to be a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1162">I really did not want to be a teacher, I just wanted to use my time to learn something, to just sometimes -- to use my time.</span> <span id="s1163">In the evenings, you know, I was still young and I did not have any profession and I knew when I leave the army I will have to work.</span> <span id="s1164">It was -- I really wanted to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s1165">(makes a face of suppressed rage).</span> <span id="s1166">But my mother would not allow me.</span> <span id="s1167">And she was -- and she did not let me and she did not let me go into nursing school and -- At that time supposedly I had some health problem -- physical it was something with my -- oh, it was ridiculous, I knew it was nothing.</span> <span id="s1168">They thought that I had scoliosis, which I did, but it was very, very mild, it’s in a very mild form.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: Scoliosis?</span> <span id="s1171">What is it?</span> <span id="s1172">It’s a curvature of the spine.</span> <span id="s1173">A curving of the spine.</span> <span id="s1174">It goes like “S”, but very mild.</span> <span id="s1175">It can be very severe and some people have it very severe.</span> <span id="s1176">But there are many people who have it in a very light form.</span> <span id="s1177">I have it in a very light form.</span> <span id="s1178">(In a sarcastic singsong).</span> <span id="s1179">But the doctor said to my mother that I should not do any physical work, hard work and this was considered to be a very physical, hard work to be a nurse.</span> <span id="s1180">Dumb.</span> <span id="s1181">And so I wasn’t allowed and this is what I really wanted to do so badly and I was not allowed to do it and my mother was very strong-minded woman and there was no support and nothing and I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1182">If it was today, I would sure do it.</span> <span id="s1183">Well, it’s unbelievable, I guess.</span> <span id="s1184">So her decision was that I should be a teacher, uh, early education.</span> <span id="s1185">I should take early education, uh, I should study and I should become a teacher which I never wanted to be.</span> <span id="s1186">It was just my family.</span> <span id="s1187">But I graduated, I got some education and it was very helpful to me in bringing up -- raising my children.</span> <span id="s1188">I was very grateful for what I learned.</span> <span id="s1189">I learned some psychology, which I never had any -- I did not know anything about it and it was very helpful to me, what I have learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Uh.</span> <span id="s1191">Let’s see, your brother got married when you were 19?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And you were in the army.</span> <span id="s1194">That was your first year in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Were you very close with him at that time?</span> <span id="s1197">Did you see a lot of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: No, he got married young.</span> <span id="s1199">He was, I think 23.</span> <span id="s1200">He was sent to -- he was in the air force and after his two or two-and-a-half years of duty he kept -- he continued being he chose this as his career.</span> <span id="s1201">And he was, uh, he was sent…</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">(phone rings)</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: You were saying that he was sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: He was sent to Burma when they set up their air force.</span> <span id="s1205">I think it was in ’56.</span> <span id="s1206">Yeah, I think it must have been ’56.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Where is Burma?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Thailand…Thailand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: So Israel was giving them help setting up their air force?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1211">The Israeli air force was helping the Thailand air force set up their air force.</span> <span id="s1212">And my brother was sent for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Was he married then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No, he got married after he returned, after that year of service there he returned and he got married and now he has three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Is he still in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1217">Yes my whole family is firmly settled in Israel, they would not leave Israel for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Even your parents changed their minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Well I think I’ll continue that later then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: This is the third interview session with Esther Lawner.</span> <span id="s1222">It is August 6, 1984.</span> <span id="s1223">The last time we talked you were in the army and you said that your brother had gone to Burma to help Thailand form an air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1225">He was in the air force himself and they sent over ten guys from the Israeli air force to help the Thailand air -- to set up a Thailand air force</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Um, you were in the army for two years, then, from 18 -- 20?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Then after you got out of the military, how long were you in Israel before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Until ’65, 1965.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: I wanted to go back and ask you just a few questions about Israel.</span> <span id="s1231">Something that we touched on briefly last time was that Israel is somewhat less religious than mot people in this country think it is.</span> <span id="s1232">I think people in America view Israel as being a religious entity, but it -- and are very surprised when they go over and find that the people, especially a lot of the kibbutzes, are anti-religious.</span> <span id="s1233">So you have an opinion on that as to why, why that might be the case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Uh, there are different reasons.</span> <span id="s1235">First of all, there are lots of religion, religious people.</span> <span id="s1236">There are not religious people.</span> <span id="s1237">The religious people live in their own communities where they can feel comfortable, where they don’t have to see people who desecrate the Shabbat and they feel comfortable with each other.</span> <span id="s1238">They all do the same things, they have the same lifestyle.</span> <span id="s1239">So many, many tourists, maybe, don’t go to these places, but there are parts of -- many, many religious people in Israel.</span> <span id="s1240">Why those that are not religious became not religious, well, I can think about my own family and probably it’s typical.</span> <span id="s1241">Uh, my grandparents were very religious.</span> <span id="s1242">They were so religious that they were anti-Zionist actually, when my mother was young and she wanted to study Hebrew, they would not allow her because that meant that she is plotting maybe to go to Palestine and to be a word Halutza, to be a pioneer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">(Tape is off)</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: So, your grandparents were extremely religious and then…</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Yes, and I know that before the war, my parents and my immediate family were also observant.</span> <span id="s1246">They kept the Shabbat.</span> <span id="s1247">But as soon as they left it all vanished, you know, it was a matter of survival and they were on the run all the time and they were refugees wherever they were and they were just cut off, everything, and they didn’t keep it up.</span> <span id="s1248">It was a matter of survival.</span> <span id="s1249">I don’t remember anybody from my childhood -- early childhood in Russia.</span> <span id="s1250">I remember just like one family that maybe were observant.</span> <span id="s1251">Vaguely I remember something.</span> <span id="s1252">Maybe they observed Shabbat, but everybody else was like us.</span> <span id="s1253">I don’t remember any religion.</span> <span id="s1254">Except when I was little I was -- for several years I was still saying my prayer when I went to bed and I was saying a prayer when I got up in the morning.</span> <span id="s1255">Then it vanished.</span> <span id="s1256">It just -- I don’t know when I stopped, I just decided I don’t want to do any more and, um, that was it.</span> <span id="s1257">I asked about a year ago, a friend of -- the mother of a friend of mine was here from Israel and she had the same background, religious -- from a very religious family.</span> <span id="s1258">She herself -- the mother of my friend -- just went away from that and now our generation, we are kind of -- many of us are trying to go back to the religion because we feel we really have missed things</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: So what you’re saying is that, um… (both talk at once)</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Well I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1261">I have asked her.</span> <span id="s1262">She was a survivor.</span> <span id="s1263">She was in concentration camps -- I asked her -- and then she made Aliyah, she went to Israel, had two wonderful kids, one of the daughters was here for a couple of years, now she’s going back.</span> <span id="s1264">But I asked her -- I wanted to find out why our parents went away from the religion.</span> <span id="s1265">I wanted -- because we never talk about -- and especially now that I am separated from my family, so that I have those questions I cannot ask them.</span> <span id="s1266">And this woman, I asked her, “What happened?</span> <span id="s1267">Why did you go away?”</span> <span id="s1268">She didn’t have a good answer, she said she does not know.</span> <span id="s1269">That, uh, there was the war, there was a matter of survival and evidently people, maybe, thought that, well, God abandoned them.</span> <span id="s1270">There is nothing, uh, nobody watches over them, you know.</span> <span id="s1271">See what’s happening.</span> <span id="s1272">Many people had this reaction, however, there were many people who, because they survived, became very religious and in Israel, when people came after the Holocaust -- now those people who lived there for years there are those who are religious and those who are not -- are less religious.</span> <span id="s1273">I have in my family this one aunt who was a pioneer who went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1274">She became very anti-religious.</span> <span id="s1275">So I think “Why?”</span> <span id="s1276">She saw the life of her parents.</span> <span id="s1277">She didn’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s1278">She wanted to build a new life, different.</span> <span id="s1279">She came to Palestine when there was not much there and she was a pioneer.</span> <span id="s1280">She worked very hard and met her husband and was living on a kibbutz and just -- it didn’t -- religion doesn’t mean anything for her.</span> <span id="s1281">I never discussed it with her, why she did it, but, uh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1282">However, there are many people now, our generation and younger people, who are going back, going back to religion.</span> <span id="s1283">They missed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1285">What did you do after you got out of the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: I was working as a kindergarten teacher for, I think, a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: Did you mostly teach during the rest of the time you were in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: No, after that I changed my vocation.</span> <span id="s1289">I became an architectural draftswoman -- draftsperson.</span> <span id="s1290">(laughs)</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: Did you need to go into some training for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A; Yes, I had some -- I had training.</span> <span id="s1293">I took courses and then I learned also through just practice, by just working, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: And your father was working…</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: And your father was working in construction at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: No, this was just at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1298">Later he was working -- he was working for somebody in, uh, different type of things and then they bought a grocery store and they had a small grocery store for years until my father died.</span> <span id="s1299">And after a year, I think my mother closed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Can you tell me about the events that led up to your leaving Israel, your decisions and changes in attitude that led to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: The only reason that I left Israel is because I married my husband who is an American and he found life in Israel difficult and he didn’t want to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: How did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: At a party.</span> <span id="s1304">Independence party that he threw.</span> <span id="s1305">And I was really not invited to the party.</span> <span id="s1306">Somebody else was invited and the somebody else brought, like, ten people and I was one of the ten.</span> <span id="s1307">That’s how we met.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: So he was visiting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: No, he was working.</span> <span id="s1310">He came to Israel after he finished his studies.</span> <span id="s1311">He got a job and he came for a year.</span> <span id="s1312">And I think he was seven months there when we met.</span> <span id="s1313">And then he stayed longer.</span> <span id="s1314">He stayed about a year and eight months and we got married and, uh, he didn’t want to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Was it hard for you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1317">Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Was it mostly because you were leaving your family, or did you feel you were leaving a commitment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: No, yes, not my family.</span> <span id="s1320">I wasn’t very close to my family, but I felt that I was leaving a commitment and a place where I really should live.</span> <span id="s1321">What I should support, really.</span> <span id="s1322">What I should be a part of and what I should support</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: What did you -- did you have any preconceptions about America?</span> <span id="s1324">What was your attitude toward going to America then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No, uh, somehow I didn’t think I will live here for my whole life, I just thought it will be for a number of years, but eventually my husband will realize that it is important to go back.</span> <span id="s1326">But I was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: So what did you think of America?</span> <span id="s1328">Where did you first arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: We arrived -- our first year was in Denver, Colorado.</span> <span id="s1330">First we came here and we visited -- his family was from Dayton, so we visited a few weeks and then we went to Denver, Colorado, and my husband had a job and we stayed there for a year and we moved to St. Louis and we stayed in St. Louis for three-and-a-half years and then we moved we came to Dayton.</span> <span id="s1331">We have been here 14 years.</span> <span id="s1332">The longest in my life I lived in any place.</span> <span id="s1333">Prior to coming to Dayton I was in -- I was no longer than three years in any place, I was wandering, but this is the longest I have been in any place in my life</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: And so you thought of America as a temporary home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Oh, I think it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s1336">I was excited to come and to live here for a while.</span> <span id="s1337">I liked -- first of all I love to travel.</span> <span id="s1338">I love to see the new places and meet new people.</span> <span id="s1339">I loved that.</span> <span id="s1340">It’s very exciting.</span> <span id="s1341">But I think I wanted to raise my children in Israel definitely, I wanted to raise my children in Israel.</span> <span id="s1342">And um…</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: So that hasn’t happened the way you thought it might?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: In that -- in this respect, no, but I am trying, you know, as best I can to, uh, to give them the type of education that I was hoping they would have in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: When did you begin feeling the desire to return to a religious life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: I don’t know if I have the desire to be very, very religious, you know, there are so many degrees of being religious.</span> <span id="s1347">I don’t know if you heard of Mea Shearim in Israel?</span> <span id="s1348">It is a place where very, very ultra-Orthodox Jews live.</span> <span id="s1349">Now I would never want to live this way.</span> <span id="s1350">I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1351">I just wouldn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1352">But when my kids -- when my first child was born, that’s when I realized that I had to do something so that my child will grow up to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1353">And we started having Friday nights a little service at the table which is -- every Jewish observant family has it -- it is called Kiddush in the evening Friday nights.</span> <span id="s1354">We started to do that.</span> <span id="s1355">And at first it was very phony.</span> <span id="s1356">Neither my husband or I had done this before, were not too much exposed to that, but we made the effort, we started to do it and it became like second nature and the children grew up with that.</span> <span id="s1357">They know that Friday comes, they are not going out, at least not before we eat and we have our little service.</span> <span id="s1358">Our Kiddush.</span> <span id="s1359">I like them to stay anyway, well my daughter is a teenager, so she knows I am not too excited when she goes out Friday night even after that, but on the other hand I don’t want to pressure her, make her feel guilty, because she works so hard and she needs that recreation and just the circumstances are such that most of her friends -- most of them -- all of them-- she’s the only one of all of her friends that has -- that we have that Kiddush in our house.</span> <span id="s1360">The other kids are so used to, you know, not observing anything, so I don’t want her to feel like she is different from the other kids.</span> <span id="s1361">So we are trying as much, you know, to do at home as much as possible by sending them to a camp, Camp Ramah, which is a Hebrew-speaking camp and they’re -- it’s, uh, where they have learned a lot.</span> <span id="s1362">Much more so than at home, or here in the city.</span> <span id="s1363">And by sending them to day school and by discussing with them how we feel and what is important and giving them directions and telling them -- make sure that they know who they are and making sure that they know what is important to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Have you found any kind of Jewish community in Dayton -- that there is a sense of community among at least of the Jews in Dayton?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Uh, yes, the Orthodox community which is very small, very tiny.</span> <span id="s1366">The Orthodox community -- they are members of Shomrei Emunah.</span> <span id="s1367">Its small, very small congregation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Is that the one that meets in a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1370">On Salem (Ave.), yes</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: I don’t know anything about them at all, except just the existence of the house.</span> <span id="s1372">But they do live together in a neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: Yes, because they have -- because on Shabbat they don’t drive and they have to be able to walk to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1374">So they all live in that area in Dayton View.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: But you haven’t found anything that you can feel part of, or any kind of community spirit that, uh -- I’m asking this in a way for my own benefit, too, because I’m looking for the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: No, I must say no.</span> <span id="s1377">No, I have not found it and it’s very frustrating to me.</span> <span id="s1378">When holidays come we try to do it at home you know always have people in during Pesach and Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s1379">I’m trying to -- we are always are with people who feel and want to observe the way we do.</span> <span id="s1380">Either we are invited to their houses or we invite them to our house.</span> <span id="s1381">But on a larger scale, no, it’s very frustrating for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">End Side two.</span></p></body></html>
