Rozsa.</span> <span id="s5">First name, P-A-L; last name R-O-Z-S-A.</span> <span id="s6">I was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1925, January 20.</span> <span id="s7">I always lived in Budapest and there I finished high school and later I went to university.</span> <span id="s8">My father, Dezsoh Rozsa; first name, D-E-Z-S-O-H (double-dot), was born in 1885, March 19.</span> <span id="s9">He was a teacher in Budapest for foreign languages, first of all English and French.</span> <span id="s10">He graduated in Budapest as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: He taught at a high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: He taught in a high school, yes.</span> <span id="s13">A commercial high school; that means language was real important there.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Did he have a university degree?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: A university degree, yes.</span> <span id="s16">He got his degree in Budapest, a university.</span> <span id="s17">He was an excellent teacher, a very famous one, actually.</span> <span id="s18">He got his degree from English literature.</span> <span id="s19">His doctor degree and his special field was predecessor of Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s20">Ben Johnson, Marlowe, Thompson (?)</span> <span id="s21">and all these people.</span> <span id="s22">When he was young, his special field was English literature.</span> <span id="s23">Later, the language teaching, the languages and he was very active.</span> <span id="s24">He taught in different courses for adult people, also private.</span> <span id="s25">He gave private lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: He was doing that in the 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Yes, yes he was doing all the time.</span> <span id="s28">Actually, it was a ________.</span> <span id="s29">He was paid quite well, to give private lessons, it was always well paid.</span> <span id="s30">He retired in ’40 as a consequence of the first law against Jews.</span> <span id="s31">He retired earlier than it would have been necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: He was only 55?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Fifty-five when he retired, yes.</span> <span id="s34">It was too early for it but afterwards, he was still active but, of course, less active.</span> <span id="s35">Not much time left there.</span> <span id="s36">He wrote a lot of grammar textbooks which was used all over the country for high schools and also some others which would be used by everybody.</span> <span id="s37">As a matter of fact, it is a shame that in spite of the fact that my father was a teacher of the English language, I don’t speak it better.</span> <span id="s38">My English is not very good, of course, you know how it is, being a child, it is always difficult to learn from his own parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What about his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My grandfather was also a teacher, but for music.</span> <span id="s41">He was a violinist and gave also lessons on piano.</span> <span id="s42">He studied in Germany with Yochim.</span> <span id="s43">I don’t know whether you know the name.</span> <span id="s44">He was an outstanding master in the previous century.</span> <span id="s45">He was one of his students.</span> <span id="s46">He was not a bad musician.</span> <span id="s47">He died when I was five years old so I don’t have much memories about him.</span> <span id="s48">Only I know stories going on in the family, that he was an awful person, stingy, stingy person.</span> <span id="s49">I don’t know, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Did your father have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes, he had an elder brother.</span> <span id="s52">He was an employee in a bank in bank work and he had two sisters but they died very young, not so young, they were already grown up but maybe in their twenties.</span> <span id="s53">Tuberculosis, one and I don’t know what was the matter with the other.</span> <span id="s54">Anyhow, I only knew my uncle, my father was the youngest and the brother was the eldest.</span> <span id="s55">He was not a particularly successful man, but he worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: No, no, my uncle.</span> <span id="s58">The grandfather, I don’t know very much.</span> <span id="s59">I know that his father had an inn, a small pub in old Buda --.</span> <span id="s60">That my grandfather could study and studied in Germany, that was already something.</span> <span id="s61">This way, I just wanted to give you certain background so my education was a very intellectual one.</span> <span id="s62">Also my mother --.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Did you learn a musical instrument?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Oh yes, I learned piano.</span> <span id="s65">I studied ten years and I liked it very much and I was a good level.</span> <span id="s66">Some members of the family wanted I became a musician.</span> <span id="s67">But I didn’t.</span> <span id="s68">I knew that I am not as good in music.</span> <span id="s69">It was fun but not a profession and I am sure that I was right.</span> <span id="s70">But I like it very much.</span> <span id="s71">My mother, she was born in 1890 and she was a teacher for mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What level?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: High school teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: So your parents met at university?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, no, not at the university.</span> <span id="s76">I don’t know exactly how they met each other but anyhow that was a very happy marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you celebrate the Jewish holidays?</span> <span id="s78">Or observe them, should I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s80">My father had no idea at all about religion and my mother, maybe in her family, it was more usual to keep the highest holidays.</span> <span id="s81">I remember when I was a child, she used to light the candles on Friday evening.</span> <span id="s82">I remember it and we had a very nice candleholder and some of the china or something.</span> <span id="s83">One day it broke and she stopped to do it.</span> <span id="s84">It was not a kind of being religious, just a kind of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: They were married in a secular marriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Oh, yes, secular.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t remember -- maybe the only occasion when they went to synagogue, that was -- what is the name of the memory of the parents who died?</span> <span id="s88">On Yom Kippur, how do you call it?</span> <span id="s89">Just a second.</span> <span id="s90">Anyhow, religion was not an issue in our family.</span> <span id="s91">That’s interesting, maybe I can speak about it, but what’s interesting, my mother came -- her father was a physician and he came from a very simple family from the countryside where I think there were ten brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s92">When he was a child, they sent it away because they didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s93">They told him that he should go to one relative and from there to another one.</span> <span id="s94">Somehow, he managed to finish the university.</span> <span id="s95">He became a physician.</span> <span id="s96">He had five children.</span> <span id="s97">My mother was the brightest.</span> <span id="s98">She finished and got degree in Budapest.</span> <span id="s99">She was an outstanding student and I still have her book.</span> <span id="s100">I don’t know how you call it, where all the grades are written.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Report card or a transcript?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, I don’t know how they -- maybe you don’t have it.</span> <span id="s103">Anyhow, I still have it at home and the best grades whatever students can get, she had.</span> <span id="s104">I’m very proud of her, excellent professors she had.</span> <span id="s105">Unfortunately, when they married, it was in 1914, the war came.</span> <span id="s106">After the war, it was impossible to have jobs.</span> <span id="s107">A Jewish couple couldn’t have jobs from the state, two teachers.</span> <span id="s108">My father had the job and my mother was fired.</span> <span id="s109">So she didn’t work as a teacher.</span> <span id="s110">Some years and then she stopped.</span> <span id="s111">She had also private lectures.</span> <span id="s112">Unfortunately she died very early.</span> <span id="s113">She was fifty only in ’41, just before the war.</span> <span id="s114">She was ill.</span> <span id="s115">I had a sister, an older sister.</span> <span id="s116">She was born in 1918, May 15 and she could enter the university.</span> <span id="s117">It was not easy because also as I’ve already mentioned, there was no law against Jews, however the policy was not to be accepted.</span> <span id="s118">However, since my father was a teacher and had a lot of friends and connections, he entered the university.</span> <span id="s119">She studied chemistry but never worked as a chemist, a chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s120">She got involved, very early, as a student into the communist movement.</span> <span id="s121">In ’43, there was already doings of war.</span> <span id="s122">And very many young communists were put in jail.</span> <span id="s123">She was also condemned to three years, in ’43.</span> <span id="s124">In the jail, she got ill, she got tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s125">Maybe that was her luck because on this basis we could get her out from the jail temporarily and when the Germans came into the country, the German invasion in ’44, the first thing was that all communists were taken.</span> <span id="s126">She was not registered because she was registered as somebody who is in the jail so nobody was looking for her.</span> <span id="s127">That was the way how she escaped.</span> <span id="s128">Never cured perfectly so she was working, and then again in a sanatorium and so and so.</span> <span id="s129">Finally in ’75, she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: In ’75?</span> <span id="s131">Where was she during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: She was hiding with false documents.</span> <span id="s133">As I mentioned, nobody was looking for her, because was not registered as a freed person, and so she could get false documents and she could hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Where did people hide?</span> <span id="s135">I know a lot of people hid.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: It was not very difficult because many refugees came from Transylvania.</span> <span id="s137">She had also a document as a refugee from Transylvania and she just -- I don’t know was recommended or in the newspaper -- she rented a room, a private room in a family house.</span> <span id="s138">The only danger was that somebody recognized her or was suspicious whether she is a hidden Jew.</span> <span id="s139">If they called the police, and looked after the documents, they are real.</span> <span id="s140">It was very difficult to check whether it was a real document or not because very often it was a real document.</span> <span id="s141">Only from Transylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you have to pay a lot of money to get one of those?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s144">The comrades gave her.</span> <span id="s145">She was a communist, yes.</span> <span id="s146">They helped each other --.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: You were not a communist then?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Me?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: In soul I was, only I was not a member, I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Were your parents leftist leaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, no, they were not.</span> <span id="s153">My father was a very progressive and a very open mind but he had opinions, you should know everything; you should read about everything but you should not commit.</span> <span id="s154">Don’t go close to anything.</span> <span id="s155">He was -- you know what he was -- free -- very old international movement.</span> <span id="s156">Free -- Mozart was also a --.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: A mason?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: He was a freemason?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Oh, well that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes, he was a freemason.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Did he go t meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Well, it was forbidden.</span> <span id="s165">It was not allowed, of course not.</span> <span id="s166">When it was allowed, that was before the First World War, then he went, yes.</span> <span id="s167">Maybe somewhere I still have the documents what he got there.</span> <span id="s168">Then after the First World War, it was strictly forbidden.</span> <span id="s169">Then he didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s170">At least I didn’t know about it….</span> <span id="s171">I just remember that in our library in the third row there, I found all this documents and the books about the freemasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I never completely understood, that’s very interesting, the freemasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: I didn’t understand it either.</span> <span id="s174">Anyhow, I know the ideas were very good, very nice, to help each other -- yes, freethinker.</span> <span id="s175">That was the attitude of my father.</span> <span id="s176">He was very desperate when it turned out that my sister was involved in the communist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: He was afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s179">One day in the morning at four o’clock, was ringing and they came and took my sister, you can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: That was in ___?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: That was in ’43.</span> <span id="s182">It was already the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: But he knew before that, that she was involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, he knew that she was a sympathizer.</span> <span id="s185">But that she was so much involved that ---.</span> <span id="s186">Actually she didn’t do anything, just were, leaflets distributing.</span> <span id="s187">That was what she did.</span> <span id="s188">There were some young boys in the group.</span> <span id="s189">If they got two flaps from the police, they gave out the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Informers?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Informers, yes.</span> <span id="s192">The girls never did it.</span> <span id="s193">Only the boys.</span> <span id="s194">So they were frightened very easily so they gave the names.</span> <span id="s195">I knew about it so she told me previously, today they send this one was taken by the police so I am prepared tomorrow I will be taken as well.</span> <span id="s196">It happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What was your family life, where did you live in the 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: That’s also a typical story.</span> <span id="s199">My grandfather was a physician.</span> <span id="s200">My mother’s father.</span> <span id="s201">I told you that my grandparents from father’s side died very early.</span> <span id="s202">Also this other grandfather died also very early.</span> <span id="s203">He saved some money and bought a house in Budapest.</span> <span id="s204">He had the intention that he will live together with us and my parents will take care for him until he lives a full life.</span> <span id="s205">So we can live together.</span> <span id="s206">What happened before we could move into the house, he died.</span> <span id="s207">He was old already but he got leukemia and that’s very quick.</span> <span id="s208">Then the sisters and brothers from my mother wanted their part.</span> <span id="s209">My parents didn’t want to sell the house and to give them money.</span> <span id="s210">They agreed they will pay the rest for these brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s211">Especially one sister was very rude, she made a trial against our parents.</span> <span id="s212">She won, of course, because she had the right to get the ---.</span> <span id="s213">It was not a nice thing.</span> <span id="s214">Anyhow, for me it was good because ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: What year?</span> <span id="s217">It was in ’29.</span> <span id="s218">I was four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: How can you remember it well?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I remember the grandfather and the grandparents but the whole story I learned only later.</span> <span id="s221">Actually, for me it was wonderful because this house was in Budapest, in one of the most beautiful parts, a hill on the dsboodocks.</span> <span id="s222">I was grown there in a garden.</span> <span id="s223">It’s a family house.</span> <span id="s224">It was really wonderful.</span> <span id="s225">Of course, I didn’t know about these problems with my parents.</span> <span id="s226">The house was too large because it was actually for my grandparents from father’s side and for grandfather from mother’s side and everybody died and we stayed there alone.</span> <span id="s227">Then my mother wanted to make some advantage of it and so she decided to make a boarding school from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: A school?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No -- a boarding house -- a dormitory.</span> <span id="s230">For girls who come and live there -- since both parents were teachers, they could help them.</span> <span id="s231">They could get food there and the girls can live there.</span> <span id="s232">That was in her mind.</span> <span id="s233">My mother had an excellent sense for business, so had my father, as me, too, yes, as I too.</span> <span id="s234">As a consequence there was this boarding house there, all facilities and everything, just no girls came, nobody came.</span> <span id="s235">One day somebody came, because it was really a very nice part of Budapest and the gardens, as I told you, and in summer it’s ideal, so one day somebody came and asked if they cannot get a room there to live.</span> <span id="s236">Who had vacation .</span> <span id="s237">Since there were empty rooms, my mother told yes, why not?</span> <span id="s238">After a while people came to spend their holidays, vacations there.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: So it was like a bed and breakfast?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">S: More, because they could get a full -- pension, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: That was still in the early ‘30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: 1935?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: ’32, ’33, yes already started in ’31.</span> <span id="s245">I remember all the time, it was, I was very desperate because it meant that my mother was involved in this business and she didn’t have time enough for me.</span> <span id="s246">I was jealous for these guests and I always was complaining that well -- to hell with these guests and you should care for me.</span> <span id="s247">Finally it was a very nice time.</span> <span id="s248">My sister was eight years older than I was and we were very, very close to each other.</span> <span id="s249">She had a fiancé who was a mechanical engineer.</span> <span id="s250">He was very good with me and watched interest for signs in me.</span> <span id="s251">I had all this kind of attention; from father’s side, the languages; from mother’s side, mathematics; from sister, the chemistry; from her fiancé, the engineering; but mainly mathematics was my first interest.</span> <span id="s252">Just I wanted to show that in this period, it was very nice.</span> <span id="s253">You ask whether we were religious or not.</span> <span id="s254">I had no idea what it was, Jew or not Jewish.</span> <span id="s255">The first time I had experience in this respect was when I was enrolled into primary school and religion was compulsory.</span> <span id="s256">There was a list and they ask these persons should go to this room.</span> <span id="s257">I went there and found myself in a big room.</span> <span id="s258">There were all the pupils there, not only from the first grade but all four.</span> <span id="s259">They started to pray, prayer and I didn’t understand a single word.</span> <span id="s260">It was Hebrew and I didn’t know what is is Hebrew.</span> <span id="s261">I didn’t know what is Jew; I just saw that something different.</span> <span id="s262">I was told I am a bright boy, that I’m smart.</span> <span id="s263">I was so much confused by the whole fact and I went home and asked what happened.</span> <span id="s264">Then they explained me what it was.</span> <span id="s265">This is about --.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Then you studied Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Then I studied Hebrew, I didn’t mind it.</span> <span id="s268">My teacher asked me, not me but the class, well is anybody who doesn’t pray every day?</span> <span id="s269">Since I was taught at home that you have to be always sincere and tell always the truth and you must not lie; of course, I was the only boy who said that I don’t pray, never.</span> <span id="s270">She started to make reproaches, why not?</span> <span id="s271">I don’t mind, I don’t think of it.</span> <span id="s272">Then, you don’t think that G__ will not think of you?</span> <span id="s273">I would have never thought about it!</span> <span id="s274">Finally as a consequence, I realize -- this is what I learned there -- that in certain cases it’s better if you lie.</span> <span id="s275">That was my first lesson, not to be sincere.</span> <span id="s276">Never left the religion, I’ve never denied that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s277">Of course, now I don’t.</span> <span id="s278">It’s a different thing, that’s a tradition.</span> <span id="s279">Moskir (Yiskor) what I wanted.</span> <span id="s280">Have you ever heard what is Moskir?</span> <span id="s281">Moskir is a part of a holiday prayer which is only three times a year, I think, but most important in Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s282">You know what Yom Kippur is.</span> <span id="s283">Moskir, even people who are absolutely not religions, they go to Moskir because this is again a tradition, to think of the parents.</span> <span id="s284">To pray for them, the parents, or just to think of them.</span> <span id="s285">My father who had no idea about praying at all, he went to Moskir and my mother too just because his parents went to Moskir.</span> <span id="s286">You know, you understand the situation.</span> <span id="s287">This is really, I think you will agree, it is the most important event in all the religion.</span> <span id="s288">This is really what we were taught.</span> <span id="s289">That was my childhood and then I went to high school.</span> <span id="s290">I knew, I was aware of the fact that if I want to enter the university, then I have to be the best in school.</span> <span id="s291">So I was always the best ______ without any effort because it was a public school and all the other students were not very bright so it was -- not the best school, yes.</span> <span id="s292">It was also not a bad one.</span> <span id="s293">Anyhow, it was not difficult for me to be the best but I knew that I have to be the best.</span> <span id="s294">In ’43 I graduated in high school with excellences, all the best grades.</span> <span id="s295">Is it interesting this?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes, that was also such a competition.</span> <span id="s298">I finished second in the high school among the students who just finished the high school from all over the country, from all the schools in the country.</span> <span id="s299">There I participated in this competition in physics and I got fours, a prize.</span> <span id="s300">So I was among the best and it was something.</span> <span id="s301">I hoped to enter the university, or if there is any chance to enter the university, then I can get it because I was the best in the school.</span> <span id="s302">But it was ’43 already and we had already two laws and it was very restricted and so I didn’t get into the university.</span> <span id="s303">I wanted to become an engineer which was even more difference, it was always the most difficult for a Jew to be enrolled to a technical university.</span> <span id="s304">So out of question, well what to do?</span> <span id="s305">Then I will work, that’s also a good experience, a good opportunity.</span> <span id="s306">If I want to become a mechanical engineer, I go into a factory and there I will learn.</span> <span id="s307">I will become an apprentice.</span> <span id="s308">I went to this t_____ in Ujpest, and ---,</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: The electric factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Electric factory, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Electric parts factory, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Electric parts, yes.</span> <span id="s313">It was not only for the bulbs themselves but also they produced all the machines which are necessary to produce bulbs.</span> <span id="s314">It was a very good experience.</span> <span id="s315">That was in ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Then you were__?</span> <span id="s317">How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: I was there -- I was 18.</span> <span id="s319">One year, almost a year I was working there but in ’44 March 19, as you know, the German invasion came.</span> <span id="s320">Until June, I could work there and my luck was -- I was lucky because I had to go into the forced labor camp in June.</span> <span id="s321">Otherwise, as Eva already pointed out, people who were working in Tung ---, later she will be taken to Auschwitz together out of population of Ujpest.</span> <span id="s322">Since in June, I was already in the labor camp so I could escape this experience.</span> <span id="s323">Just I wanted to tell you, it may be interesting, March 19 that was my father’s birthday.</span> <span id="s324">Then my sister was in the sanatorium because I mentioned that she could get ____.</span> <span id="s325">We visited her and that was a sanatorium outside of Budapest but very close to the border and it was a very nice place.</span> <span id="s326">We went there in the morning and my sister told us what happened, because we didn’t know about it, the German invasion, but they had the connection, the telephone, everything.</span> <span id="s327">She told us you should return as soon as possible because maybe they will close the border and you should go through the woods.</span> <span id="s328">Not the road, the regular road and don’t take the bus.</span> <span id="s329">We did it and that was our luck because this path in the forest was free, was no control.</span> <span id="s330">On the road, the regular road, the bus, they didn’t let the Jews anymore enter the city.</span> <span id="s331">If they had caught us, then it would have been worse.</span> <span id="s332">That was the last visit for us both, my father to see my sister.</span> <span id="s333">As you know, each day and each week, it became worse and worse.</span> <span id="s334">In June I had to go to the labor camp, I was really happy.</span> <span id="s335">Yes, because then there was a community, how to say, and I knew that in general the army was not as bad as the gendarmerie.</span> <span id="s336">We didn’t know what happened in other countries, in Austria, in Poland and so on.</span> <span id="s337">Being under the army, we could have more safe and secure position.</span> <span id="s338">Of course, it was no assurance for it, but in the army there were better people than otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: I know that I read that there were actually higher-ups in the army who wanted to protect --.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Oh yes, definitely there were excellent people.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: There were points when you could have been taken and this was kind of a way of protecting part of the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yes, yes that’s very true.</span> <span id="s343">{Female voice: “The young, the Jewish population who survived, they survived in the army.”}</span> <span id="s344">In the army, in this labor camp.</span> <span id="s345">Not all of them, because it was depending on the leaders of this.</span> <span id="s346">In general, they were not as bad.</span> <span id="s347">That was also -- we had to work.</span> <span id="s348">I was young and even if I didn’t have the experience in physical work, well it was not so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: You weren’t brutally treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: No, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: It was sort of like being in the army only you were in this labor service?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: {“ The places were very different.”}</span> <span id="s353">Very different.</span> <span id="s354">It depended really from the leadership.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What was the name of the place where you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Where I was?</span> <span id="s357">In summer, we were in, it’s a very small place, Chicho___, it’s in northern Transylvania.</span> <span id="s358">We were constructing a railroad.</span> <span id="s359">As ____ for the second lane.</span> <span id="s360">It was very important for the war because it was only one rail and because of the transportation, they needed, urgently, a second one.</span> <span id="s361">We were building it.</span> <span id="s362">It was summer, we were young.</span> <span id="s363">Sometimes we told each other that if we knew that we survive, then it wouldn’t be so bad, like a summer vacation.</span> <span id="s364">We had good food.</span> <span id="s365">There was a very good organization, food.</span> <span id="s366">From this respect it was not bad.</span> <span id="s367">It was in summer.</span> <span id="s368">What I thought interesting, probably you know from history, that August 23, Romania went to the Soviet side.</span> <span id="s369">That meant that the war and the front came very close.</span> <span id="s370">When we finished this second railroad, next week, later it turned out, next week another b_____ came or a group of locals and they blew up.</span> <span id="s371">What we were -- that’s an irony…we were working so much and so hard in summer.</span> <span id="s372">Then they blew up.</span> <span id="s373">That was a change of the whole situation.</span> <span id="s374">It became worse because we went to the front and we had to dig this trench a second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: It was between Cluj and Tursda.</span> <span id="s377">Tuesda is Torda so that’s a familiar.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: How do you spell the first one?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Cluj?</span> <span id="s380">In Romanian, it is C-L-U-J.</span> <span id="s381">The Hungarian name is K-O-L-O-Z-S-V-A-R.</span> <span id="s382">This is a very famous and important historical city.</span> <span id="s383">This may be the largest city in Transylvania.</span> <span id="s384">In the forties years, it belonged to Hungary, it was attached to Hungary.</span> <span id="s385">In this area we were working and it was not easy.</span> <span id="s386">We had to work in the night and in the morning, of course, attack came.</span> <span id="s387">Our work was ___.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Only Jewish men worked on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No, not only Jewish men but in our group, we were only Jews, of course.</span> <span id="s390">There were other Romanians and Serbs, you know, these minorities who were not reliable and they didn’t take them into the army as soldiers.</span> <span id="s391">They were in such labor camps.</span> <span id="s392">There was a big difference being a Jew or being a Serb.</span> <span id="s393">Danger always.</span> <span id="s394">We were not there very roughly from the soldiers.</span> <span id="s395">There were nice officers, nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You had relative freedom of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s398">We had absolutely no freedom of movement.</span> <span id="s399">We didn’t have the demand for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: You were just marched from one workplace to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: What about the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: It was good, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: You slept in barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: We lived in barracks, yes.</span> <span id="s406">Again, it was not very comfortable but we were exhausted in the evening and we could sleep so it was no problem.</span> <span id="s407">The only problem we had was lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: How long were you digging trenches?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: We left this railroad the first days of September.</span> <span id="s410">October 10, we were already liberated.</span> <span id="s411">One month.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Oh, October 19, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Forty-four.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: The Soviet army ___.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Came, yes.</span> <span id="s416">The Romanians and the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s417">Actually, what happened, we were working for this trench and I told you in the morning the attack came.</span> <span id="s418">We had to withdraw, not we, but the Hungarian and the German army, had to withdraw their troops in such a hurry, they couldn’t get into these trenches.</span> <span id="s419">They had to withdraw everybody.</span> <span id="s420">We had to march all day long.</span> <span id="s421">Now, we were very tired because all the night we were working, all the day we were marching.</span> <span id="s422">In the evening we said some of them, we were kept together, that now that’s enough.</span> <span id="s423">We have to have a rest.</span> <span id="s424">We stepped from the street into a forest and we lay there and we slept there.</span> <span id="s425">We didn’t know what happened and it could have been very dangerous; in the morning the soldiers find us and say you are deserters, right?</span> <span id="s426">We could have said well, there was such a turmoil, everybody had to leave so we are looking for our battalion.</span> <span id="s427">We don’t know where they are.</span> <span id="s428">Our luck was that the soldiers were so very eager for their own life and security; they were afraid from the enemy.</span> <span id="s429">The only thing what they were concerned about was the kitchen and the food.</span> <span id="s430">They take the kitchen and the food and the storage and run in front.</span> <span id="s431">Some other cases, could have happened that they go behind us and if somebody wants to step down, then they kill them.</span> <span id="s432">Our soldiers were not so every eager for us, they were eager for themselves.</span> <span id="s433">As it turned out, we were left behind.</span> <span id="s434">When we stepped down in the night, all the Hungarian and German troops left and in the morning, we were there.</span> <span id="s435">We didn’t know so we went further by the pretended intention to look for our lost battalion.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Did you have a special uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No, just --.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q So you were identifiable as --.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: We were identifiable -- we didn’t have to wear the stars, the David stars, that was a rude thing, but we had to wear a yellow ribbon here.</span> <span id="s440">That meant that we are Jews, they knew it, everybody who wanted to know it.</span> <span id="s441">We went in this intention to look for our battalion.</span> <span id="s442">We didn’t find any Hungarian or German soldiers but in two hours, the first Romanian soldiers who were from this particular village -- also the population told us, don’t be silly, don’t go, wait here, our people are here close to us.</span> <span id="s443">We were there without any effort, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s444">It was October 10 and this terrible thing in Hungary happened in October 15 when the Arrow Cross people, these ultra-rightist people took over the power.</span> <span id="s445">That was that.</span> <span id="s446">Then we were also lucky, in certain places, people were put into prison and took time until they could figure out that they are Jews and not enemies.</span> <span id="s447">Sometimes the Russians, especially, didn’t care for it and they took them somewhere.</span> <span id="s448">It was not a security.</span> <span id="s449">I remember just telling the joke when we were speaking among each other, when we were in this forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s450">I always told them as soon as possible I want to go over to them.</span> <span id="s451">Most people want to go to Budapest.</span> <span id="s452">What do you want in Budapest?</span> <span id="s453">What do you expect there?</span> <span id="s454">It’s nothing there and maybe we don’t find anybody there because we knew already that from the countryside everybody was taken.</span> <span id="s455">That was also what we expected from Budapest.</span> <span id="s456">But if we go on the other side, there is hope to survive.</span> <span id="s457">Some of them told me, yes and what do you want to do there?</span> <span id="s458">Then I told them, well, the worst case I go to Amskin.</span> <span id="s459">I will be at the university as a servant.</span> <span id="s460">It is even better to be a servant at Amskin Universitity than in _____ {“Amskin is a very very good university.</span> <span id="s461">It is a very high –“}.</span> <span id="s462">High -level university.</span> <span id="s463">They were always laughing, made jokes, poor Pal, he wants to be a university servant.</span> <span id="s464">Now, of course, it is easy to laugh about it but at the time it was not so.</span> <span id="s465">Finally, the 10th of October that we were liberated then we went to Turdo.</span> <span id="s466">There we got some documents and in two days, the first train went to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s467">Then I told, Well, I’m fed up with the war and everything.</span> <span id="s468">I don’t want to be here close to the front but again most colleagues wanted to go with the frontier to Budapest I don’t want to stay so close to the frontier, let’s go back.</span> <span id="s469">I went the first train to Bucharest and I waited there until I could return.</span> <span id="s470">I returned to Budapest in April.</span> <span id="s471">I lived there six months.</span> <span id="s472">I learned Jurmanian.</span> <span id="s473">I lived with a family.</span> <span id="s474">I was working as an electrician in some private business.</span> <span id="s475">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s476">Personally for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Maybe you didn’t go back because you didn’t have any family there anymore?</span> <span id="s478">Maybe you didn’t want to go back for that reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s480">I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s481">I wanted to go back -- first of all --- Well, I didn’t know what happened with my family, that was the only concern.</span> <span id="s482">I had to figure out what --.</span> <span id="s483">On the other hand, I was only 19 years old, I didn’t have anything in my hand.</span> <span id="s484">I wanted to study, the opportunity to study; the only chance was in Hungary where I was at home.</span> <span id="s485">I knew the language, the culture and I had in mind, if I survived, why not be there in Hungary?</span> <span id="s486">I didn’t have anything, I felt myself as a Hungarian, a Hungarian Jew.</span> <span id="s487">I was not a Zionist; I didn’t want to leave for Israel.</span> <span id="s488">It was enough for me the experience in the labor camp, to be together with three hundred Jews.</span> <span id="s489">Among them there were terrible people, I have to confess.</span> <span id="s490">I didn’t know what happened with my father, with my sister, with all other relatives.</span> <span id="s491">What happened with them -- as I told you, my sister was hiding and survived in this way.</span> <span id="s492">When she was liberated, she went into the Party, the Communists were there and she was working for them.</span> <span id="s493">My father, well in October 15, when this Arrow Cross people took the power, five days later, October 20, they went from house to house.</span> <span id="s494">They lived in a marked house with David’s star.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Your father did?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes, my father remarried.</span> <span id="s497">I told you my mother died in ’41 but later he married.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Who did he marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Actually, she was a woman who was taking care for my mother because my mother was very ill for one hour and a half, so she took her --.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: One year and a half?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: One year and a half, yes.</span> <span id="s502">We found her and she took care of her and you know in this situation, how it is.</span> <span id="s503">My father was in very bad condition after the death of my mother and she stayed there and finally they married.</span> <span id="s504">I was very desperate because I was 19, and for a 19 years boy, it was a disappointment that the father marries.</span> <span id="s505">{“You were not 19, but 16.”}</span> <span id="s506">Oh, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s507">I was sixteen and it was even worse, being a sixteen years boy.</span> <span id="s508">What is this age, how do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: You were an adolescent.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Adolescence, yes.</span> <span id="s511">It was a shock, really a shock.</span> <span id="s512">I liked her as a person but I was disappointed the fact that my father married so.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Was she Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yes, she was.</span> <span id="s515">She was very good to my father.</span> <span id="s516">Objectively, I didn’t have anything against it.</span> <span id="s517">Later, of course, and now I see that it was good for my father because it was somebody with him.</span> <span id="s518">They lived together and October 20, these Arrow Cross people went house to house and collected all males under 60.</span> <span id="s519">Since he was 59, he had to go.</span> <span id="s520">He was a very fragile person with a very, very thick glasses.</span> <span id="s521">Never in his life, was working physically.</span> <span id="s522">Never did any sport.</span> <span id="s523">He had to go digging the trenches.</span> <span id="s524">I don’t know how long it lasted, maybe three weeks or four and then all these people I mentioned already were taken to Austria, marching, walking.</span> <span id="s525">Because the Soviet army was very close, their last efforts was to take these people.</span> <span id="s526">I met one single --.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Were they taken by the Arrow Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s529">Everything was in Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s530">The terrible things, probably you heard --.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: This digging the trenches, that was not the army forced labor, that was a different kind of --?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s533">{“It was not.</span> <span id="s534">It was then the Arrow Cross, the Budapest Arrow Cross had to follow it even in the army.”}</span> <span id="s535">Even in the army, yes.</span> <span id="s536">{“ Because that was the capitol.</span> <span id="s537">They had their people everywhere.”}</span> <span id="s538">Everywhere.</span> <span id="s539">Actually what they did was a coup d’etat, right?</span> <span id="s540">Because Hortee was declared the peace.</span> <span id="s541">There were some soldiers around him.</span> <span id="s542">That meant these soldiers are no more reliable.</span> <span id="s543">Only the Arrow Cross people were reliable, so they took the power everywhere.</span> <span id="s544">They decided what to do.</span> <span id="s545">Then I met, when I returned to Budapest, I met a physician who knew my father and who told me that he met my father on the road to Vienna and he lost his glasses.</span> <span id="s546">He couldn’t walk and he was put on to a carriage and he gave him a shot, just to keep him somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: The physician did?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: The physician gave him, yes.</span> <span id="s549">It was a Jewish physician who was on the road and he tried to help people who were there.</span> <span id="s550">That means, I’m sure he couldn’t get to the border.</span> <span id="s551">Quite frankly, I didn’t want to know more because why would it have been better for me if I had known what circumstances and where exactly he --.</span> <span id="s552">His wife committed suicide during the siege.</span> <span id="s553">She stayed there at home.</span> <span id="s554">Later she escaped from this marked house because it became dangerous.</span> <span id="s555">She went to the house where we used to live.</span> <span id="s556">There she was hiding because we had a housekeeper there, a Christian woman who was there, who behaved very, very nicely.</span> <span id="s557">She took her, she was hiding there.</span> <span id="s558">But her nerves were not good already, so she committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Your father’s -- you didn’t want to know anymore about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: I don’t want to say I didn’t want to know but I didn’t find anything out and that’s it.</span> <span id="s561">{“We know that on the border, many people who were, transferred to the border, many were killed at the border.</span> <span id="s562">People maybe they couldn’t walk anymore or even if they could walk, many, many -----were killed.”}</span> <span id="s563">Writers, poets.</span> <span id="s564">teachers, professors, the best people and just when they saw that the war is already over.</span> <span id="s565">With their last effort, they killed them en masse.</span> <span id="s566">That was the story what I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s567">Then when I returned home in April, of course, I learned about my father, what happened.</span> <span id="s568">I found my sister who was in a sanatorium because her condition was not good enough, but of course, we were very glad to meet again.</span> <span id="s569">That was April 26.</span> <span id="s570">In five days I went to the university and I asked when it starts.</span> <span id="s571">They told me that one hour ago it started.</span> <span id="s572">I made a case I can get into the first class.</span> <span id="s573">I went.</span> <span id="s574">Everybody told me, are you silly?</span> <span id="s575">What do you want to live off?</span> <span id="s576">You don’t have any background.</span> <span id="s577">What is your imagination?</span> <span id="s578">Then I have to laugh because I told you, you are silly because if I survive all this terrible times, do you think that now I’m going to starve.</span> <span id="s579">I am happy that I can fulfill my old desire to study.</span> <span id="s580">I went to this university.</span> <span id="s581">Then, of course, the only way, we didn’t have any scholarship, the only thing what we had was a Joint.</span> <span id="s582">The Joint gave me food, it was so terrible the food, horrible it was.</span> <span id="s583">My friends and colleagues learned about my situation and they sent me pupils, students whom I could tutor and soon that was the way how I made my existence.</span> <span id="s584">It was very good, very nice.</span> <span id="s585">Altogether, I have to tell you that I was among the few people who were lucky, finally.</span> <span id="s586">In spite of it all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: There’s nothing else you __-?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: On the family, what happened with the family members.</span> <span id="s589">If I try to count how many people in the closest family have died ---.</span> <span id="s590">I mentioned that the son of the second wife of my father from the previous marriage, he died.</span> <span id="s591">My other cousin from father’s side, his older brother’s son, I don’t know how he -- he didn’t --.</span> <span id="s592">He was not considered as a Jew, probably because he converted early.</span> <span id="s593">Anyhow he was in the army and he died in the army.</span> <span id="s594">Another cousin from mother’s side died also on the Soviet front, in a labor camp; I told you that the husband of my sister, they lived seven months together; he was taken to the Soviet front, he has died.</span> <span id="s595">All of the family members of my mother’s side, her younger sister, her elder sister and her younger brother with their wives and husbands were taken to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: That was from the village?</span></p> <p><span
