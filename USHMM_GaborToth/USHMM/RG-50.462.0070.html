interview with Mr. Nathan Snyder, Nora Levin interviewing, on October 11, 1984.</span> <span id="s3">Now, Mr. Snyder, if you will be good enough to tell us a little about your early childhood, your place of birth, and a little about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">NS: I was born in Unter Stanestie, a small little town located in north Bukovina, which at that time of my birth, it was Romania, and presently, it is Russia.</span> <span id="s5">The year of my birth is May 21, 1926.</span> <span id="s6">Our town consists of approximately 250 Jewish people, which means families.</span> <span id="s7">Altogether, there were almost 60 to 70 families.</span> <span id="s8">The total population was 250.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">NL: Out of how many?</span></p> <p><span id="s10">NS: Well, the town itself, in the center of town, 99% were living Jews, but in the surrounding area, were all Ukrainians, some Poles, some Schwaben, we call them German, Volksdeutsche [ethnic Germans], and that was the surrounding.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">NL: But the little town was largely Jewish, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">NS: The town was largely Jewish from one end to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">NL: How did the Jews make their living?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">NS: Every Jew--there were professional Jews like pharmacists and a couple of doctors and engineers and lawyers and bookkeepers and dentists, and the majority were merchants with stores.</span> <span id="s15">Some were not professional people but different handicrafts like shoemakers, and furniture makers and cabinet makers and schochets, which means ritual slaughterers of the animals, and there were two rabbis.</span> <span id="s16">There were a horse shmit, [blacksmith] and there were what we call them balególes, today carriage drivers; and wood choppers and woodworkers in the forest.</span> <span id="s17">And all kinds of professions which were not considered actually professional people, but they were making a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">NL: Was it a fairly prosperous town, would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">NS: That town was prosperous.</span> <span id="s20">Everybody was making a living.</span> <span id="s21">There were also some very small minority of poor people, but the Jewish community or the Jewish kehillah [community] were always helping out the poor people through the Kultusgemeinde, which is called the Jewish community in that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">NL: And what was your father’s occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">NS: My father’s occupation was that we had a store, a manufacturing store of goods like wool and clothing and hats and all kinds of materials, shoes, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">NL: I see, very varied manufacturing.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">NS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">NL: Was it a large establishment?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">NS: It was a large establishment because in our town, everybody owned their own house and the houses were also differing from your wealth or your actual income.</span> <span id="s28">Some had small houses, and some had elaborate houses.</span> <span id="s29">And there was even a next door to us lived a Jew by the name Ostra [phonetic] who was considered as of today, as a graf.</span> <span id="s30">And how you would translate it today?</span> <span id="s31">In English I would say a..</span> <span id="s32">.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NL: A lord, a baron...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">NS: A baron.</span> <span id="s35">He had a lot of land and forests and so he was considered a graf.</span> <span id="s36">He had a big mansion next door to us, on the left hand side.</span> <span id="s37">On the right hand side lived our rabbi, the Rabbiner, who was the main principal rabbi in town.</span> <span id="s38">So as you can see, our house was located in the prime section of the town.</span> <span id="s39">Our house was a very large house.</span> <span id="s40">It consisted of over 12, 13 rooms.</span> <span id="s41">We had a summer house in the back, with a large flower garden in the front, and guest rooms.</span> <span id="s42">And we also had some domestic animals like a cow, a horse, we had like chickens, and geese and ducks and a big vegetable garden.</span> <span id="s43">We had fruit trees, and we also had a patch of a couple, two or three acres of land there for our own use.</span> <span id="s44">We used like for corn or potatoes or for feed for the animals.</span> <span id="s45">We had a servant for as long as I can remember, and this goes back before my birth.</span> <span id="s46">They always had a servant, that you called a magd, maid who was a live-in.</span> <span id="s47">She had her own quarters and she was paid very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">NL: A German girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">NS: No, Ukrainian, Ukrainian girl.</span> <span id="s50">Most of the people who were over the average middle-class could afford to have a live-in maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">NL: Did Father establish this business himself?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">NS: No, that house was originally my grandfather’s, and his name was Ephraim Yosef Binenfield, and he established that store way back in the 19th century.</span> <span id="s53">The exact date I do not have.</span> <span id="s54">And my father married my mother.</span> <span id="s55">And my father was in a town which is 80 to 90 miles away, also in Bukovina.</span> <span id="s56">And they married, I think, 1922 or 1923, the time they married.</span> <span id="s57">And then my father came over and moved over to our town and took over that store.</span> <span id="s58">The background of my father was that he had a very good educational background because his parents from Sucaveni were also barons and they owned a lot of land.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">NL: Excuse me, was this title a formal one that was given by the Austro-Hungarian empire?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">NS: That’s exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NL: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">NS: Yes, but my father had two more brothers.</span> <span id="s63">And my grandfather on my father’s side had three sons, and he owned a lot of land, I would say, land and forest.</span> <span id="s64">In that little town there were only eight Jewish families.</span> <span id="s65">There was never enough for a minyan.</span> <span id="s66">For a minyan, they had to always ask for a neighborhood the Jews to come in for a minyan, or they used to go to a bigger town to say for the holidays, yizkor [memorial prayer] or kaddish, for prayers and so on.</span> <span id="s67">So my grandfather from my father’s side could afford to send my father to a better education, and he studied in Vienna, and he finished the university.</span> <span id="s68">That’s before the First World War, he finished the university, and he enlisted in a medical school.</span> <span id="s69">His aim was to become a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">NS: But because the war broke out, he did not have a chance to continue study, and by Bukovina being under Austro-Hungarian rule at that time, my father was enlisted in the army.</span> <span id="s72">And because of his medical background, I am not sure, but I think my father went to the first year of medical school.</span> <span id="s73">But it wasn’t enough to qualify him as a doctor, but because of his medical background, he was enlisted in an officer’s school and became a first lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NL: That was quite remarkable for a Jew, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s76">I remember that when I was pretty young, like six or seven, I used to always go and browse in my father’s study room, and there were always medical books with pictures, anatomy.</span> <span id="s77">My father was very organized and very neat, and he did not want me to browse through those books so I shouldn’t upset anything, and I used to always like to look through those books.</span> <span id="s78">And I remember in the closet he had a saber.</span> <span id="s79">I don’t remember, it was a brass or, nice brass saber which was given to him as a decoration from the war and he kept it nicely in the corner, and also a couple of medals.</span> <span id="s80">I was too young to understand at that time what it means, but he didn’t let me--he was against me to play with that saber because it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NL: Something special.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">NS: Special, and I could hurt myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">NL: And also dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">NS: Dangerous because it was pointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NL: Did you get the impression that he was a patriot of the empire?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">NS: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s87">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s88">He did his duty as a citizen, but my father had always had Zionist tendencies.</span> <span id="s89">By being in Austria with Theodor Herzl, actually originally he was from Budapest, but he lived in Vienna.</span> <span id="s90">And apparently by going to meetings, the Zionist movement took roots in that area from Vienna, Vienna, Switzerland, Hungary, and so on, Central Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NL: Do you have some memories from going to any of those meetings or discussing...?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">NS: I personally, later, yes.</span> <span id="s93">As a matter of fact, I, when I started to go to cheder, [one room school in eastern Europe for religious education] before going into the public school.</span> <span id="s94">But a young age, naturally every Jewish boy in town wasn’t forced to go, but it was an honor to go to cheder.</span> <span id="s95">So, in our town we had Orthodox Jews and we had Conservative Jews.</span> <span id="s96">The majority of the Jews in town, I would say 65% - 70% were Orthodox, and the rest were Conservative, and that’s the reason that we had two rabbis.</span> <span id="s97">The rabbi who lived next to us was an Orthodox Jew, and there was another rabbi, who was a second rabbi, who was Conservative.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">NL: And your parents belonged?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">NS: My grandfather was a very, very Orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s100">As a matter of fact, my grandfather was what we call today, not a rabbi, because he had the diploma or--there is a name for that in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">NL: Smicha.</span> <span id="s102">[ordination]</span></p> <p><span id="s103">NS: Smicha to become a rabbi, but he was more like a Zsadek [pious-saintly].</span> <span id="s104">He was always studying Talmud, and this is the way, I was his protégé up till the war, up till my grandfather passed away.</span> <span id="s105">Naturally he was very Orthodox and he was a Hasid, belonging to the Vischnitzer Rabbi [also Vishniets] He was a Vischnitzer Hasid.</span> <span id="s106">[pious religious follower] Vischnitz is a town in east, near the Polish border known as today--they have Novoseller Rabbi and other rabbis, and I think there are some followers of the Vischnitzer Rabbi in Israel, who are very, very ultra-Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">NL: And your parents--Why don’t you have a drink since you are the one that is doing so much talking?</span> <span id="s108">No?</span> <span id="s109">Your parents were, their orientation was Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">NS: My mother was very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s111">My father was a modern Orthodox, considered between Conservative and Orthodox.</span> <span id="s112">My grandfather had a long beard and peyes, [side locks] and I wore peyes up till age 13, to the bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s113">My father did not have peyes or a beard, but he was very Conservative but also...</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NL: Observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">NS: Yes, very observant.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">NL: And, you were talking earlier about your interest in Zionism.</span> <span id="s117">Do you remember some early experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">NS: Yes, the Zionist movement started in our town prior to me being born because there was a movement throughout Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s119">Because of the pogroms and the misery and the killing and the suffering of Jews, and, as a matter of fact, the founders of Israel come from eastern Europe, Poland, Russia, Romania, and from that section.</span> <span id="s120">There were a lot of organizations which have, their aim was to become chalutzim [pioneers, settlers] and to go to Palestine at that time to build the land, prepare the land.</span> <span id="s121">And [unclear] there were Jabotinsky and Trumpeldor, which were actually the idols of the Betar organization, which is today Herut, and today they call them Revisionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">NL: And, is this the movement that you were attracted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NS: I was attracted to that movement.</span> <span id="s124">Yes, in my town there were general Zionists.</span> <span id="s125">There were Hashomer Hatzair, more to the Labor, to the left, to the right, to the middle and so on, and Betar, or Herut was more a little bit to the right extreme, but it wasn’t a rightist.</span> <span id="s126">It was more a nationalistic party or organization.</span> <span id="s127">Their aim was Israel, according to the Bible, belongs on both part of the Jordan.</span> <span id="s128">And there was a strong movement of Jabotinsky and Trumpeldor at that time in Bukovina, because he even came and held speeches in Czernowitz, which is a big city in Bukovina.</span> <span id="s129">My father was allgemein, general Zionist, but from cheder with my friends I joined the Betar organization in our little town.</span> <span id="s130">I was too young to understand exactly what Palestine means to the Jews at that time, but I like that organization with their songs and their stories.</span> <span id="s131">And it gave me a feeling of patriotism with the Israel flag which we displayed, at that time was blue and white with a Jewish star, which we never knew that because I was too young to understand that we are living under persecuted regime in Romania or whatever.</span> <span id="s132">In Diaspora, the Jews were not actually in command.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">NL: You were talking before, Mr. Snyder, about pogroms.</span> <span id="s134">Did your community have any direct experience of violence, violent persecution against Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">NS: Yes, my community, according to my mother’s stories, pogrom was taking place in the First World War when it was a war of Austria-Hungaria with Russia.</span> <span id="s136">Czernowitz-Bukovina [unclear] in my town was under Austria-Hungaria.</span> <span id="s137">In the First World War in one of those offensive the Russian occupied the town for a half a year.</span> <span id="s138">Naturally, the Cossacks, they were the first to come into the town, and they raped, plundered, killed, robbed, maimed, and naturally, this is what is called a pogrom, mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s139">After six months they were thrown out by the Austro-Hungarians so, my town experienced that pogrom already, and I don’t know exactly it was 1915 or 1916.</span> <span id="s140">There is a history of pogroms, not only my town but in the entire region.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: What about persecution from the Romanian side?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">NS: Well, antisemitism was always, but we as Jews, unfortunately, we always lived, we always were used to be bent down with the head down, not up, submitting, submission.</span> <span id="s143">We knew that we are second-grade, second class.</span> <span id="s144">That is not our country, so, we felt antisemitism and prejudice in school, on the streets.</span> <span id="s145">Many times we had fights, the young boys in groups, together fighting with others who called us “Dirty Jew” or other derogatory names.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">NL: Did your father have some unfortunate experiences in connection with his business, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NS: No, because, mostly our customers were Ukrainians and we had a very good relationship, because my father was very humble man so, most of them, I would say 99% of our customers never paid cash, C.O.D. up front, they always have credit with us.</span> <span id="s148">They used to come in, like to fill out a dowry for their daughters or whatever, and it was big sum of money, so we always have creditors.</span> <span id="s149">I’m sorry, I don’t mean creditors, I mean debtors.</span> <span id="s150">They always took money from us and paid us in installments, so we had a good relationship with all the Ukrainian customers.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">NL: Now, can you tell us a little about your experiences in cheder.</span> <span id="s152">You went as a very young child, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">NS: I was, yes, I was I think I was age five or six when I started to go to cheder.</span> <span id="s154">And we had different classes, age group, and the rabbis or the teachers from that cheder were not local.</span> <span id="s155">They were professionals, mostly came from Hungary, or Transylvania, which is called in German Siebenbürgen, [state in Germany] which was actually at that time Austria and Hungary was together, so Transylvania was part of Romania.</span> <span id="s156">And they were hired for a year or two contract, the teachers, and they were good.</span> <span id="s157">They were supervised actually by the local kehillah, [community] the teaching.</span> <span id="s158">They give us a good value of Judaism or Talmud or preparing us for bar mitzvah and so on.</span> <span id="s159">My years in cheder were very fruitful.</span> <span id="s160">Naturally, as young boys we had different mischiefs and adventures and so, like all the young boys had.</span> <span id="s161">And I was prepared for my bar mitzvah and my grandfather had a big influence on me.</span> <span id="s162">He wanted me to become a Hasid [follower of Baal Shem-Tov - Pious one] like he is.</span> <span id="s163">I remember that he used to travel once a year to Vischnitzer, where there was like a reunion, or better to say, what do you call that, assembly, and I went once to his assembly, and it took three days.</span> <span id="s164">They used to bring different fruits, and chicken, and flowers and so on, and he took me to that rabbi, to the Vischnitzer Rabbi, for one reason, that I should be blessed, and the rabbi did bless me.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">NL: Were you impressed with that or frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NS: I will never forget.</span> <span id="s167">I remember that he was sitting with a white caftan on a high stool.</span> <span id="s168">And my grandfather came in and he said, “I want you to bless my grandson because he is not good.”</span> <span id="s169">“Not good,” means that he is mischievous.</span> <span id="s170">“I want him to be more settled,” and he gave me a shmirah, [amulet] a shmire.</span> <span id="s171">[amulet] It was made from lead, and also another shmirah made from silver, or something like that.</span> <span id="s172">And we should put it on a little string on my neck, and he put his hand on me, naturally I had a yarmulke [skullcap] on, and said a broche [blessing] and he blessed me.</span> <span id="s173">And then this was my adventure which I can recall, the Hasidim with the dancers, with the prayers and all that.</span> <span id="s174">It was like a festival, and this town was a very religious town.</span> <span id="s175">Friday night was the ritual to go to the mikveh [ritual bath] and at three or four o’clock everyone was preparing themselves for the big Shabbat day.</span> <span id="s176">Every woman on Thursday started to clean and scrub and prepare and change, and bake and cook, and it was all Thursday night preparing for the day of Shabbat, and my mother was one of those that used to prepare all kinds of meats and dishes and so on.</span> <span id="s177">Then came Friday at five o’clock, and the town was still because everybody used to go to the synagogue and there was erev shabbos [before sabbath] for mincha [late afternoon prayer service] and ma’ariv, [evening prayer] and so on, and shabbat all day, we used to be half a day in shul, [synagogue] with shaharis [morning] and musaf, additional sabbath and holiday service; all special parts of the service and so on.</span> <span id="s178">It was a holy day, and naturally no one smoked, and no one went traveling, because cars didn’t exist, but people had horses and carriages.</span> <span id="s179">No work was done, even not lit a fire because we had the shabbos-goy.</span> <span id="s180">Some had cholent [sabbath stew] already from Friday that you don’t have to lit nothing in the oven, and we had a cholent every Friday, so we didn’t even have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">NL: You had mentioned your sister Miriam before.</span> <span id="s182">Did she have a Jewish education?</span> <span id="s183">Did girls have a Jewish education, in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">NS: The Jewish girls, unfortunately, is not like in the modern time today, in the present time, because for some reason, Jewish girls, their education was more home, but their mothers has to go in public.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">NL: She went to public school, of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">NS: Oh sure, but I remember in the synagogue, women and men did not sit together.</span> <span id="s187">The women had upstairs a balcony, separated.</span> <span id="s188">So the girls did not go to cheder.</span> <span id="s189">My sister did not get the Hebrew school education, but she got it at home, with prayers with my mother, with the broches, [blessings] and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">NL: Now, when did you start going to public school?</span> <span id="s191">How old were you, Mr. Snyder?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">NS: I don’t recall exactly but it must have been age six or seven that I went to public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">NL: You went to cheder and public school simultaneously.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">NS: Together, yes.</span> <span id="s195">Cheder on Sunday, we had all day cheder, and then during the day from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday we had--Thursday was examining day, that was the test day--we had after school.</span> <span id="s196">We used to come home and have a bit and then go to cheder which was not too far away.</span> <span id="s197">And I remember that Thursday was--why I remember Thursday was examining day, because if you did not know the pusik [Hebrew: p’suk – verse] from that week, we used to get a little willow over your hands, so many.</span> <span id="s198">You have to know, you have to actually learn and pay attention the pusik from that week.</span> <span id="s199">Pusik, it means “segment”.</span> <span id="s200">He was a very tough rabbi, I understand, he did for our interest, but as kids we didn’t pay attention at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">NL: It’s a very typical story.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">NS: But we did learn a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">NL: And your experience in public school?</span> <span id="s204">Can you say a few words about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NS: We went to public school, and the teachers in public school naturally were all non-Jews and...</span></p> <p><span id="s206">NL: No Jewish teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">NS: No Jewish teachers.</span> <span id="s208">No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">NL: They simply were not accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">NS: Not accepted, exactly, because that was a class where Jews were not admitted to that.</span> <span id="s211">We have learned prejudice and antisemitism in school day out and day in.</span> <span id="s212">As an example, every day we had prayers in school where we were all standing up, and we had to stand up, and they were kneeling and we were forced to kneel, too, except they made the cross and we did not, but they were always bringing up in that prayers.</span> <span id="s213">And this is the way the indoctrinated the Jew-hating into children of my age, about how Jesus Christ was crucified by the Jews, and then used to go out.</span> <span id="s214">“Our Lord was killed by the Jews.”</span> <span id="s215">That’s simple.</span> <span id="s216">It happened 2000 years ago, but kids my age did not understand that.</span> <span id="s217">And when we had recess, we used to go out in the courtyard, and we used to get beaten up by them, because they said, “You killed our Lord, Jesus Christ,” and I said, “I didn’t.”</span> <span id="s218">What did I do?</span> <span id="s219">I am innocent.</span> <span id="s220">I don’t know nothing about this.”</span> <span id="s221">So then we started defending ourselves, and then we used to have fights.</span> <span id="s222">Some time the fight was followed after school, home, and most of the time we were victorious.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">NL: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">NS: Yes, because I was known as a bully, and I used to beat up a lot of them.</span> <span id="s225">This is what I am saying.</span> <span id="s226">I had a nationalistic feeling at the time.</span> <span id="s227">You have to take defense in your own hands, because no one would defend you.</span> <span id="s228">But I was too young to understand and never dreamed what would follow later, but we always had fights.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">NL: Did you have any friends among the non-Jewish boys, Mr. Snyder, anyone you could really call a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">NS: Well, there was a girl, who was the daughter of a judge.</span> <span id="s231">There was one judge in town.</span> <span id="s232">He was called “The Hanging Judge”.</span> <span id="s233">That judge, most of his friends were Jews.</span> <span id="s234">He used to come together with the Jews, with the doctors and with my father, and with the pharmacists, with the intellectuals in town, playing rummy, bridge, coffee klatches [get together] and so on.</span> <span id="s235">Beneath his surface, he was a Jew-hater but...</span></p> <p><span id="s236">NL: He liked the company?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">NS: Yes, and he used to get a lot of gifts and bribes, and then they built him a nice villa there, and he was the judge.</span> <span id="s238">There weren’t too many criminal cases in that town.</span> <span id="s239">We didn’t have any rapes and murders in that town.</span> <span id="s240">Maybe a dispute over land, or a dispute over business or debts, those were actually the trials there.</span> <span id="s241">But he lived not too far from us, and he had a daughter my age, must have been seven or eight years old, and we were good friends.</span> <span id="s242">As a matter of fact, I used to come to their home, and she used to come to my home.</span> <span id="s243">As a matter of fact, she liked me and I liked her, and we never discussed about who is Jew and who is not and who is Christian and who is not--and...</span></p> <p><span id="s244">NL: That was an exception?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">NS: That was an exception.</span> <span id="s246">Maybe yeah.</span> <span id="s247">That’s one, and then I had another friend, who was non-Jew, from school, but one day he told me that his father told him that he’s not allowed to be friends with me, and I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s248">I didn’t do nothing to you,” and he said, “Well, my father told me that you are a “Stinking Jew”, and that you killed our Lord.”</span></p> <p><span id="s249">NL: This was when you were eleven or twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">NS: No, this was younger, like eight or nine.</span> <span id="s251">I came home to my father, and I told him that, and I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s252">I didn’t do nothing,” so, Jews learned to absorb like a sponge.</span> <span id="s253">That is how it is supposed to be, and it goes on for generations.</span> <span id="s254">You live with that, but the brain-washing and the poisoning of the mind was going on for years.</span> <span id="s255">No wonder what happened later, during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s256">I learned from experiences always that--I remember that I used to play soccer, there it used to be called football, and we had in our group mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s257">We had our own club and I was already eleven or twelve years old.</span> <span id="s258">Naturally, we played not in a field, we had just grass and barefoot without shoes.</span> <span id="s259">That is called village playing.</span> <span id="s260">We used to always play against another group who were non-Jews.</span> <span id="s261">We always used to win, and after the game was over, we had fights.</span> <span id="s262">They used to attack us.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NL: For winning?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">NS: For winning.</span> <span id="s265">So then we used to [unclear] them, because we used to beat them up.</span> <span id="s266">So the next time it used to come in school, it used to be beaten up by others, because he beat them up, and this was going on all the time.</span> <span id="s267">It wasn’t something that was frightful, because this was the life.</span> <span id="s268">This is it.</span> <span id="s269">There isn’t something else.</span> <span id="s270">In the meantime, I got my education in Zionism.</span> <span id="s271">And I knew that there was a homeland which has to built, and is now Palestine.</span> <span id="s272">And the aim is for all the Jews to live there, like they used to say in all the prayers, “Leshanah ha-ba’ah b’Yerushalayim.”</span> <span id="s273">[Next year in Jerusalem] So it was like a dream for us at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">NL: But, your parents didn’t think about going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">NS: No one thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">NL: No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">NS: There were some very young ones, like in the twenties, who had more understanding...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s279">NS: They took off.</span> <span id="s280">We heard that they went as chalutzim [pioneers] to work for six months or a year.</span> <span id="s281">And then they wound up in Israel, Eretz [Land] Israel, we used to call it at that time, as chalutzim, pioneers, and so on.</span> <span id="s282">We heard that, but the majority of the Jews never talked about going there because the Zionist movement wasn’t a daily obsession.</span> <span id="s283">Everyone was interested in making a living, and living peacefully in a house and surviving.</span> <span id="s284">That’s what everybody care.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NL: Now, you had, or course, many reactionary regimes in Romania in the early to middle thirties?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">NS: When I reached the age of eleven or twelve, then we had, yes, we had the regimes from the king, there were parties like the Iron Cross, and the anti-Jewish movements started at that time.</span> <span id="s287">They hate of, they call them Cuzars [from Alexandrer Cuza (1857-1946), leader of antisemitic policies and parties] like the Nazi brown shirts in Germany, demonstrating, parading with the flags.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">NL: Even in your little town?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">NS: Yes, in the little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">NL: This would be in the middle thirties or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">NS: That was in ‘37 or ‘38 when Hitler started to kick in Germany, that disease has spread all over Europe.</span> <span id="s292">Naturally, not all the population took place.</span> <span id="s293">Mostly there were some rough guys.</span> <span id="s294">Intelligentsia were the leaders, but they had to be educated, like the postmaster, or the clerk that worked in the city hall.</span> <span id="s295">They were the leaders, and the peasants followed.</span> <span id="s296">Not too many, but we saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">NL: In the Iron Cross movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">NS: In the Iron Cross movement, yes, because, after the First World War, when Romania joined the Allies, it was given to them Bukovina, so, they were not the Romanian population there, but Romania occupied by authorities.</span> <span id="s299">So, naturally, the influence came from Romania, and so some of the Christians joined that movement.</span> <span id="s300">They even used to walk by and break windows, throw bricks or stones into the windows, and this was like a rash for two or three hours, and the next day it was forgotten.</span> <span id="s301">But then the Jews were worried about it.</span> <span id="s302">Why did they do this to us?</span> <span id="s303">Because here we shake hands with them and don't do anything to them which is bad or destructive, and they hate us so much.</span> <span id="s304">But I was too young to understand it at that time, why, but I had a feeling, that I couldn’t understand--Why, it was not my fault that I was born a Jew.</span> <span id="s305">I am a human being the same as them, and suddenly they hate me.</span> <span id="s306">It was a fear like on holidays, or New Year’s.</span> <span id="s307">They had a whole ritual of Coza, which means they used to dress like a goat and walk around.</span> <span id="s308">That ritual goes back a couple of hundred years.</span> <span id="s309">That ritual was the dressing of the goat, a head of a goat, and it was to disperse the devil, which actually isn’t a Jew, but it had something to do with a Jewish devil, which was to be dispersed, and the coming of the New Year.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">NL: This was an annual...?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">NS: That is a Ukrainian annual ritual, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">NL: What time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">NS: Exactly on the 31st of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">NL: I’ve never heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">NS: Then they used to go and...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">NL: And a large part of the population participated?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">NS: Oh, yes, they used to go around, and that goat had two horns was representing the Jews, the Devil, and there was always one other one in the back dressed in a national costume with a long whip and he used to whip him symbolically.</span> <span id="s318">And he used to then jump up like suffering pain and he used to say, “Curse you, Jew, curse you, Jew!”</span></p> <p><span id="s319">NL: A real scapegoat.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">NS: Yes, a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s321">Not, that exactly.</span> <span id="s322">At that time the Jews were always closing their doors.</span> <span id="s323">They didn’t let us out from the house because of violence, but I used to watch from the windows all of the time.</span> <span id="s324">They used to go by and say their prayers and the church bells used to ring and so on.</span> <span id="s325">It was like a festivity until late night and the next day was New Year’s Day.</span> <span id="s326">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">NL: And then you would have a period of quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">NS: Then quiet, and then the other period which was unrest was Easter, naturally, Resurrection.</span> <span id="s329">I am sorry, not Resurrection, it was when Jesus was crucified.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">NL: Good Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">NS: Good Friday was a very, very solemn day for them, and a very frightful day for us, because at that time the hate was more outspoken.</span> <span id="s332">Jesus was crucified, and so, I remember, that even in school they used to teach in front of us, and we were also punished in school many times, standing I remember for nothing.</span> <span id="s333">Like we used to be punished, the punishment was to stand in a corner, and hot, dry corn, was thrown on the floor, and we had to stay on our naked knees on the corn with our hands up.</span> <span id="s334">And now you know what’s happening.</span> <span id="s335">It wasn’t a lot of corn, it was like ten different pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">NL: Kernels.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">NS: Kernels, and it used to dig in you, and to stay there because of unrespect or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s338">Mostly Jews got punished in that corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">NL: How long were you able to stay in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">NS: I stayed in school until 1940, when the Russians marched into our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">NL: This was Gymnasium [high school]?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">NS: No, no, no, no, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s343">In 1938 my father had me transferred to Czernowitz, a big city, to go to Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">NL: Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">NS: Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s346">I left the high school, what we called elementary school, the public school.</span> <span id="s347">The public school consists of , if I am not mistaken, eight or ten classes, but I only did four or five, and then I was transferred.</span> <span id="s348">It cost money.</span> <span id="s349">That was...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">NL: Tuition?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">NS: Tuition.</span> <span id="s352">Yes, to the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s353">I don't know how you call it here, but Gymnasium was more a private.</span> <span id="s354">You had to pay money, and there were all kinds.</span> <span id="s355">There were business and technical and all kinds for professional later life.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">NL: And where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NS: When I was in Czernowitz, I lived with my aunt, my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s358">I lived there and studied in the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s359">You had a special uniform, and I liked it there.</span> <span id="s360">We had more friends.</span> <span id="s361">There was a lot of girls and fellows, we used to go to the movies.</span> <span id="s362">For the first time in my life I saw a movie.</span> <span id="s363">We lived in a big town with a tramway, which we called street cars, and there were more cars and buses, and it was more like city life.</span> <span id="s364">There were parks and so on, and there we did not feel so much antisemitism, because in that school, I used to go, and I will never forget the name, it was called “Gymnasium of Commerce, Julia Valeor”.</span> <span id="s365">Julia Valeor was our main hero and it was named after him, and 90% were Jews and, 90% of the professors were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">NL: How do you account for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">NS: In the big cities, yes, Czernowitz was a city of 100,000 Jews, and predominately the entire city was not controlled, but lived in, and I would say, 90% were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">NL: And you were in the commercial courses?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">NS: I was in the commercial Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s370">If I would have graduated from the Gymnasium, I would have gone on to be an accountant or a financial advisor, whatever you want to call it, it’s like a commercial--specialized...</span></p> <p><span id="s371">NL: But you had to leave by 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">NS: That happened in 1938 or ‘39.</span> <span id="s373">In 1939 the war started between Germany, no, Germany occupied half of Poland.</span> <span id="s374">I’m not sure if it’s ‘39 or ‘40.</span> <span id="s375">No, in ‘39 they were busy in Austria, Czechoslovakia and all of the rest, but in 1940 exactly, when Stalin made a pact with Hitler: “Let’s divide Poland in half.”</span> <span id="s376">The Germans marched into Poland, and they had a war with Poland.</span> <span id="s377">You know, they took half of Poland, so the Russian said, “We will take the other half.”</span> <span id="s378">Naturally, we were in their path, so they took us, too.</span> <span id="s379">They occupied Bukovina, Bessarabia, which is on the east side of Romania.</span> <span id="s380">It used to belong many, many years to the Czars, so he claimed it, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.</span> <span id="s381">So, those five provinces Russia occupied without asking the United Nations, well, they didn’t exist, without asking the Allies.</span> <span id="s382">They just walked in and took it.</span> <span id="s383">Like Hitler took the rest of Europe, and it made a nice pact between them.</span> <span id="s384">So, now we lived under a different regime, and it was called the Russian, the Communists, the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">NL: How did that affect your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">NS: Well, it affected it a lot because, there were a lot of Jews, because of the repression and the prejudice, many Jews joined the Communist party.</span> <span id="s387">It wasn’t actually the Communist party at that time, it was a movement which considers everybody equal.</span> <span id="s388">According to Marx and Lenin’s teaching, which is not today, and it’s only a bluff, but that goes that everybody is equal.</span> <span id="s389">There is no religion, there is no nothing, everybody that is a human being is equal against the rich and so on, proktar.</span> <span id="s390">[unclear] So, many Jews had no choice, but it was better to be with the light-headed devil than the dark devil.</span> <span id="s391">Between the two devils you choose the best one.</span> <span id="s392">Naturally, they welcomed the Russian.</span> <span id="s393">I remember before the Russian came in, we had already came back to our town, because we knew that something, is going back across the border.</span> <span id="s394">Nobody opposed them.</span> <span id="s395">The Romanians went back to Romania, and I came back to town, and they came back.</span> <span id="s396">They marched in with a couple of tanks, and troops came in, and they threw flowers and candies to the kids, and everybody welcomed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">NL: Your father wasn’t too worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">NS: No one was worried.</span> <span id="s399">Actually we welcomed them.</span> <span id="s400">At least the Iron Cross and the Jew-haters are not going to hurt us, because in that time in the Russian army there were a lot of Jewish officers, a lot of Jewish commissars, a lot of Jews in Russia at that time held a high position, and so on.</span> <span id="s401">Stalin’s brother-in-law was Jewish--Kaganovich [Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich]</span></p> <p><span id="s402">NL: How was father’s business affected?</span> <span id="s403">Did the Russian take over?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">NS: Well, that is a chapter by itself.</span> <span id="s405">As soon as the Russian walked in, after a week, if not sooner, they nationalized everyone, including your house.</span> <span id="s406">You did not own nothing.</span> <span id="s407">Everything that you have belongs to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">NL: You had no idea...?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">NS: And, whatever you had belongs to us.</span> <span id="s410">So we actually became suddenly owned by the state, belonged to the state.</span> <span id="s411">But they didn’t throw you out from your house, but the house that you live in is not yours.</span> <span id="s412">Naturally, they closed all the shops.</span> <span id="s413">What they did is, they came over and they nationalized.</span> <span id="s414">They took inventory and they took over the store.</span> <span id="s415">We couldn’t have a store anymore.</span> <span id="s416">They dispersed the stores, because they had one department store for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">NL: And, what sort of work was Father given?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">NS: My father had to work, because if you didn’t work, you were a parasite, a germ, a parasite, a vagabond.</span> <span id="s419">So, my father got a job to work in a, not a taproom but it was like a Schenke.</span> <span id="s420">It’s a big, big beer hall, and mostly peasants used to come in there, and my father was the manager over there, he and another one.</span> <span id="s421">One was the manager, and one was the financial bookkeeper and so on.</span> <span id="s422">It was owned by the state.</span> <span id="s423">They used to get the beer and disperse it, so he worked over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">NL: And he was given a salary?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">NS: Yes, he was given a salary and free beer.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">NL: Do you want to rest for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">NS: No, no.</span> <span id="s428">I went to school, naturally.</span> <span id="s429">Everybody had to go to the Russian school, and Russian school has changed, different now, but me being already in the Gymnasium, in higher education, and there I joined the Russian but the equivalent so I wind up like being in the 10th grade as far as the Russian were concerned.</span> <span id="s430">Now, the teachers have changed, too.</span> <span id="s431">A couple of teachers remained, they changed their, their...</span></p> <p><span id="s432">NL: Philosophy?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">NS: No, their clothing.</span> <span id="s434">Superficial.</span> <span id="s435">They no longer made any remarks about Jews, about Jesus Christ, about Jews being the Christ-killers.</span> <span id="s436">They had to teach according to the Russian philosophy and...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">NL: Was it more comfortable?</span> <span id="s438">Did you feel more secure?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">NS: Yes, we felt more secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">NL: Were there any Jewish teachers in...?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">NS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">NL: There were?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s444">Not from town, but some [unclear] Jewish teachers from outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">NL: Were you now back in Czernowitz, or did you stay in your little town?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">NS: No, I stayed in the little town.</span> <span id="s447">Life was going on, and it was different.</span> <span id="s448">The Jews felt more equal, not their superior, but more equal, because there was somebody in Moscow who was protecting everybody, the citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NL: No antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">NS: Well, still antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">NL: But not official?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">NS: Not official, exactly.</span> <span id="s453">Because you must understand that those who became authorities from the Russian, there were also some Jews, which we didn’t know in the beginning.</span> <span id="s454">They said, “Look, I am a Jew born, but I’m a Russian first.</span> <span id="s455">I am a Communist, so I don't make any difference between you and him, so they were actually brainwashed already from the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s456">We didn’t realize what would happen eleven months later.</span> <span id="s457">You know, that’s happened a year later.</span> <span id="s458">So that was going on...</span></p> <p><span id="s459">NL: What did you study?</span> <span id="s460">Were you still in a commercial course?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">NS: No, what happened is...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">NL: Under the Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">NS: What happened is, we knew that when you reached the age of seventeen, you will have to go to the army.</span> <span id="s464">If I am not mistaken, there was a war between Finland and Russia at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">NL: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">NS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">NL: The Russian were losing.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">NS: The Russian were losing yes, and some of the local Jews that were age twenty-one, twenty-two, I won’t say teenagers, but the young people, they were recruited in the army and went to fight in Finland, and they came back with decorations and so on.</span> <span id="s469">They were integrated in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s470">But in May of 1941, life was going on, as they say.</span> <span id="s471">We knew one thing: that the Russian relocate people, because they did it in the Ukraine and all over when they come in, they used to take the rich people, the bourgeoisie, and deport them.</span> <span id="s472">They used to call it relocation, not deportation.</span> <span id="s473">But, in May, they started to deport Jews from our town, We were on the list, we know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">NL: As bourgeoisie?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NS: Oh yes, they deported every night like three families.</span> <span id="s476">They come in a big black truck with the pajamas.</span> <span id="s477">They say, “Go in,” and the next morning you find out that the house is sealed and they are gone.</span> <span id="s478">Where, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s479">We found out later that they put them in a cattle train and back to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">NL: By the way, did you have many people now living in your house after it was nationalized?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">NS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">NL: Just your own family?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NS: And, no more maid.</span> <span

school?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s488">A lot of propaganda.</span> <span id="s489">And anti-religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">NL: Anti-religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">NS: Take a look and ask and pray, “Does God come?</span> <span id="s492">No, he doesn’t.”</span> <span id="s493">Now you say: It started, “Our Father, our provider,” And the door opens and the sandwiches come in.</span> <span id="s494">Those things, that’s how they brain-wash you.</span> <span id="s495">It had an effect on the little babies who were only five or six years old.</span> <span id="s496">On us, we knew that it was only a comedy.</span> <span id="s497">But those were the propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">NL: What were you learning?</span> <span

history, Communist.</span> <span id="s502">I actually wanted to do something for the future, and by my father being a businessman, a merchant, there was a spot, a bad spot in my biography.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">NS: So, I wanted to become a train locomotive engineer, and actually there was a question for volunteers, for young kids to go to school in Kharkov which is in Russia, and they used to go there for two to three years and be trained.</span> <span id="s505">To me that was adventurous, to travel on a choo-choo train all over Russia, thousands and thousands of miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">NL: And some Jewish boys were doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">NS: Yes, a couple left, and they had to take tests, physically and mentally, and so on, and I remember that there were two Ukrainian boys and two Jews, there were four of us, we went to Czernowitz to make a test, and we were all together and we had nice uniforms and food, and travel, and they will train us.</span> <span id="s508">That’s it and actually I registered for it, but my mother was very much against it and my father, too, but I figured that, that it’s an adventure, and sometimes you don’t think about your consequences in the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">NL: By the way, did the boys who went for a few years come back, or did they stay in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">NS: I never knew, to this day, what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">NL: They may have been caught up in the war, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">NS: I remember that we came back from the test, and we had approval.</span> <span id="s513">Well, three weeks later the war started.</span> <span id="s514">Why I mentioned two Christians and two Jews went, because we were all friends, and we were going to be together, to sleep tighter in one room together and so forth.</span> <span id="s515">During the massacre, one of those Christians was one of the guards at the house where those Jews were kept.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">NL: I am not clear about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">NS: One of those young Christian so-called friends, who was supposed to go with me to that special school, became, during the massacre of the Jews, three weeks later he became, one of the guards, involved outside.</span> <span id="s518">He had a machete or knife or a rifle, I don’t remember; and I approached him before we went in, before they wheeled us into the [unclear], I said, “Why is it, why is everybody armed?</span> <span id="s519">We didn’t do nothing.”</span> <span id="s520">He said, “I am sorry, we were friends, but I can’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s521">That is the law.</span> <span id="s522">I have to listen to others.”</span> <span id="s523">But I said, “We are friends.</span> <span id="s524">Remember we were supposed to go together.”</span> <span id="s525">He said, “I know but I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s526">I am sorry.”</span> <span id="s527">I will never forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">NL: We’ll come back to that in a moment, Mr. Snyder.</span> <span id="s529">Tell me a little more about the deportations.</span> <span id="s530">You said that three families or so every night were taken, and these were those labeled as bourgeoisie.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s532">They took away--like one had a forest, a rich Jew by the name of Karpel, which is mentioned in his book.</span> <span id="s533">Another one was Meltzer, rich.</span> <span id="s534">What I mean by rich, they had assets in forest and fields, and they were the first ones.</span> <span id="s535">They took away the whole family, and the next morning we found out they disappeared, they’re gone, relocated.</span> <span id="s536">But somebody told us that they come with big black trucks at night time, and they come in and take you out in pajamas, the way you are, and load you up and good-bye, and you can take nothing with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">NL: And they were destined to go to Siberia?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">NS: We were also.</span> <span id="s539">We were on the list.</span> <span id="s540">Why we were on the list, because somebody was [unclear] worked in the City Hall, and he was Jewish, and somehow he leaked it out, which families, he didn’t know when, but are destined, are going to be deported.</span> <span id="s541">We would be better off at that time.</span> <span id="s542">Those who were deported to Siberia survived.</span> <span id="s543">Those who didn’t die from starvation or from cold survived: after the war they came back.</span> <span id="s544">Maybe it would have been better.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">NL: But you didn’t know that, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">NS: Yes, we were on the list, because we had a store and a beautiful home and so on.</span> <span id="s547">I think they deported all together no more that seven or eight Jewish families.</span> <span id="s548">Also non-Jewish families, rich Ukrainians, too.</span> <span id="s549">who owned land, who had ten cows.</span> <span id="s550">They considered them, “Kulak,” they called them.</span> <span id="s551">You know, “exploiters”.</span> <span id="s552">They deported them, too; it was not only Jews.</span> <span id="s553">But we were on the list; if on the 22nd of June 1941 the war wouldn’t have started, we would have been deported maybe two or three days later.</span> <span id="s554">We were prepared, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s555">We knew that we couldn’t take anything with us, but every night we were waiting for the truck to come, and knock on the door that we should get deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">NL: These people that came were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">NS: Can you stop it for a minute, please?</span> <span id="s558">[Pause] That was the episode with the deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">NL: Now, what happened on June 22, 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">NS: I remember another incident which related back to 1940 [1939] when Germany attacked Poland and the Polish army fell apart, a lot of them run away to the border, because we were only 25 miles from the Polish border, Galicia.</span> <span id="s561">They came through Romania.</span> <span id="s562">Naturally, they wind up later in Constanta [Port city in Romania] which is a port, on ships and went to England, where the Free Polish Army fought with the Allies.</span> <span id="s563">Mostly Polish officers and very rich Poles, and they came with their entourage, their big dogs and their families and their jewels, and they came in their army trucks, and they run to our town.</span> <span id="s564">We as Jews were very humble and we wanted to help them, with food, and we felt sorry for them.</span> <span id="s565">For the first time in my life I saw refugees.</span> <span id="s566">We knew that the Germans have invaded their country, so, we were helping them, trying to help them, and I remember that personally we walked out and said, “Would you like to have water, juice, or anything?”</span> <span id="s567">So, they used to say in Polish “From a Jew we don’t take nothing”, used to say “a Polish phrase,” which means--excuse me for saying it-- “I better make in my pants before I give up to a Jew or before I accept from a Jew.”</span> <span id="s568">And I said, “Why?”</span> <span id="s569">The Germans, we didn’t know at that time, the Nazis, are beating them, and they come to us through our town, and we want to help them, and they don't accept nothing from us.</span> <span id="s570">So, the Polish aristocracy already were infected with Jew-hating, so that is another incident which relates back.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">NL: By the way, before we go on, Mr. Snyder, were you in your little town at all aware of what was happening to German Jews under Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">NS: No.</span> <span id="s573">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">NL: Nothing.</span> <span id="s575">You knew nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">NS: No.</span> <span id="s577">I know only one thing, that we had an uncle who lived in Vienna in Austria, who was a step-brother of my mother, and his name was [unclear].</span> <span id="s578">And in 1939, before Hitler invaded Austria, Vienna, in 1938, he was smart enough to emigrate to America, to the United States, and the reason why was because he knew there’s going to be Anschluss.</span> <span id="s579">[political union of Nazi Germany and Austria - 1938].</span> <span id="s580">That Hitler already started making waves, so he knew, and then he found out that they had to go away because they didn’t want to live under Hitler, because from all of his speeches he knew that Hitler was not a friend of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NL: Did you know what was happening to Polish Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">NS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">NL: You didn’t even know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">NS: No, nothing, because those Poles who were retreating were mostly officers and aristocrats.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">NL: No news?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">NS: No, because the Jews from Poland who succeeded to escape from the onslaught of the Germans in 1940 didn’t come to us.</span> <span id="s587">They went to Russia, toward the Russian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">NL: But you didn’t hear anything in the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">NS: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">NL: Your Jewish leaders in the kehillah didn’t inform you?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">NS: They knew that there was a war going on, and the Russian took half Poland and Germans took half Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">NL: Those in Vienna knew, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">NS: We didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">NL: All right, so now on June 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">NS: On June 22 at four o’clock in the morning, we had radios, all, in our town there was no electricity, and we had petroleum lamps, nice chandeliers with petroleum lamps all over the house.</span> <span id="s596">We didn’t have any sanitation facilities, we had outhouses, which were very nice and elegant outside the house.</span> <span id="s597">We didn’t have gas because we used to heat with wood.</span> <span id="s598">It was old-fashioned.</span> <span id="s599">The radios were operated by batteries.</span> <span id="s600">So, we heard that the war started, that the Germans bombed and attacked Russia.</span> <span id="s601">It was June the 22nd, 1941, and by eight o’clock we knew in town that something is going on.</span> <span id="s602">We didn’t know that the outcome, but we saw Russian, our town wasn’t strategic, really, Czernov was the most strategic.</span> <span id="s603">But it was not too far, we saw Russian trucks going back and forth, back and forth, and traveling through, and you couldn’t ask them, because they wouldn’t have told you.</span> <span id="s604">A couple of tanks went through, planes overhead, German planes, Russian planes, but we didn’t know what the outcome is.</span> <span id="s605">Had we known that the outcome was going to be the massacres, we would have picked up at that time, with nothing, just like we are, and just run to Russia.</span> <span id="s606">Well, some of them did that, some who were actually in the Communist Party, some who were active, really didn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">NL: Followed the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">NS: No, before even the army ran.</span> <span id="s609">They knew that when the Germans came in, they were going to be in trouble so they took off.</span> <span id="s610">Some succeeded, some were caught, because there was a Blitzkrieg.</span> <span id="s611">[Fast-like lightening warfare].</span> <span id="s612">We call Blitzkrieg fast.</span> <span id="s613">The Russian caught them, and they were shot, or they ended up in concentration camps, or whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">NS’s wife: The Germans caught them, not the Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">NS: But some Jews from our town, very few, I would say, maybe five or six families, were smart enough to leave Stanestie and go to Czernowitz, because it is a big city.</span> <span id="s616">They had some intuition, some gut feeling that it is not good to stay here, and they went to Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s617">We never thought about that.</span> <span id="s618">We had friendly Ukrainian neighbors for years.</span> <span id="s619">My father had in that town two Ukrainians who he was together in the Austrian-Hungarian army in the First World War.</span> <span id="s620">The one was a sergeant, and the other was also some title in the army, and they were all together in the same outfit.</span> <span id="s621">So he figured, “I have nothing to fear, I didn’t do nothing,” and no one feared.</span> <span id="s622">So, the war started on June 22nd, and on the 23rd and the 24th, those who were working, there was a commissar or like the militia, or police-a couple of them who were working with the authorities, they all took off.</span> <span id="s623">In the morning we woke up and they were gone.</span> <span id="s624">So, the town was left like open.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">NL: Leaderless?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">NS: Leaderless.</span> <span id="s627">And, if I’m not mistaken, it was the 22nd, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.</span> <span id="s628">By Thursday Jews couldn’t get out from the house, because what happened is, Ukrainians appointed themselves juror and judge.</span> <span id="s629">They were patrolling the street and say, “It is wartime.</span> <span id="s630">No one can go out from this house.</span> <span id="s631">It has to be curfew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s632">NL: This was before the Germans came?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">NS: Oh, the Germans were not even there.</span> <span id="s634">So everyone starts to prepare food.</span> <span id="s635">You know, whatever you have, corn, prepared food, and fruit and vegetables, because we used to keep vegetables from the winter in our cellar.</span> <span id="s636">And made preparation for food and such, because you don't know what will happen, and we didn’t know how long the war was going to last.</span> <span id="s637">But, then we have the news that the Germans are already over the Russian border and they are advancing, and somebody says, “More up north.”</span> <span id="s638">Friday the Jews start to go to synagogue and they couldn’t, or the mikveh, [ritual bath] and they couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">NL: They were blocked?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">NS: Blocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">NL: By the Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">NS: By the Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s643">They were not letting any Jew out of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">NL: And in this blockage were some people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">NS: Oh yes, they were all Jews in the same...</span></p> <p><span id="s646">NL: I mean the Ukrainians that you knew, neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">NS: Right.</span> <span id="s648">They didn’t even let us out of the house, to go to the next door Jewish neighbors, to ask what was going on.</span> <span id="s649">So everybody was locked in their own house.</span> <span id="s650">So was my mother, my father and my sister and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">NL: And these were self-appointed?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">NS: Self-appointed.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s654">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">NS: We looked out the Venetian blinds and this was Friday afternoon, I understand, I remember that my mother made the regular shabbos.</span> <span id="s656">[Sabbath] She made challah [sabbath bread] and cholent [sabbath meal] and gefilte fish, [variety of fishes ground together and cooked] not gefilte fish--what we call carpfish--regular fish--and soup and chicken and so on, and Braten, [roast] and all that.</span> <span id="s657">Everything was prepared in the house.</span> <span id="s658">We didn’t have a maid at that time; everything was done by mother.</span> <span id="s659">But I looked out, adventuresome I was a boy, and in 1941 I was exactly thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s660">I looked out, and I see the Ukrainians going back and forth.</span> <span id="s661">They didn’t have cars or jeeps, but they were running back and forth and everyone was armed with a rifle, or if they didn’t have a rifle, they had a tool, a machete, a long knife, a spike or anything.</span> <span id="s662">And back and forth and back and forth, and I did not know, no one dreamed what would happen, but we were in fear.</span> <span id="s663">And this is Friday night.</span> <span id="s664">We didn’t sleep all night, we were all watching the windows, off and on, maybe we fell asleep for a couple of minutes or so.</span> <span id="s665">Saturday morning we couldn’t go to the synagogue, we couldn’t communicate with anybody, because the houses were single houses, not like here row houses.</span> <span id="s666">And Saturday around eleven o’clock or twelve o’clock in the afternoon, we looked out the window, and we saw Jewish families marching, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters and so on, and behind were two Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s667">We saw other families going with two Ukrainians, and we saw others; everybody had an escort.</span> <span id="s668">We wondered where they are going, and my father says “[unclear], I don't think anybody will come after us because I didn’t do nothing wrong.”</span> <span id="s669">And then when he looks out and sees one of his friends who was his buddy in the army, and I will never forget his name--his name is Chuvick.</span> <span id="s670">He was going, and he said, “He, escorting!”</span> <span id="s671">Well, four o’clock in the afternoon he came to our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">NL: This very same man?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">NS: This same man who was my father’s friend from the army, and he apologized in a nice way.</span> <span id="s674">He says, “I am sorry, but I have orders.”</span></p> <p><span id="s675">NL: Where did he get his orders from?</span> <span id="s676">He was just making this up?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s678">He says, “We have a new regime now.</span> <span id="s679">We have a city hall.</span> <span id="s680">Every Jew has to register.</span> <span id="s681">Any anybody who wasn’t a Communist, I know you were not a Communist, doesn’t have to be afraid.</span> <span id="s682">Who was a Communist, is going to be punished by the tribunal, and you don't have to be afraid, but there has to be registration.</span> <span id="s683">Everybody has to register.”</span> <span id="s684">So my father says, “Look, why do you have to take us?</span> <span id="s685">You know that...” He says, “I’m sorry, but this is the way it is supposed to be.</span> <span id="s686">I have an order.</span> <span id="s687">I must do it.</span> <span id="s688">I feel bad, very bad, but I must do that.”</span> <span id="s689">Going back to that, in the morning, Saturday morning, when we knew something was wrong, my mother took all the jewelry from the house.</span> <span id="s690">Today I think it would be very valuable, because she had good jewelry many years ago, and she put it in a bag.</span> <span id="s691">We didn’t have plastic at that time.</span> <span id="s692">She put it in a bag, and then a box and she went outside in our garden in the back, and dug a hole with her hands and just threw it inside.</span> <span id="s693">Then my father had a couple of fur coats, my mother had fur coats, minks and so on, because men used to wear mink coats, and they put them in our summer house, in the top of the attic.</span> <span id="s694">Well it was good bye, we never saw it again.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Going back to that Saturday, we came out, and we wanted to take some clothes with us, and food, and he said, “Nothing.</span> <span id="s696">You will be back in five minutes or ten minutes, registering, and come back.</span> <span id="s697">You don’t have to worry about it.</span> <span id="s698">Don’t take nothing with you.”</span> <span id="s699">So we left as we were, shirts and pants, my mother’s, my father’s, my sister and I, and I will never forget that walk.</span> <span id="s700">As we were walking, we saw from every side, the shtetl [village] had no side streets, from every side street, from everywhere, families are going.</span> <span id="s701">No one talks to each other.</span> <span id="s702">They were sad, scared, and frightened, pale in their face.</span> <span id="s703">They are going, no one knows.</span> <span id="s704">They have to register.</span> <span id="s705">The assembly was in a big, big solid concrete brick building, strong building which was actually das Richthaus, the court house.</span> <span id="s706">It was the only big solid building, because the City Hall was a smaller building, which was about a quarter of a mile further down, and wasn’t so solid.</span> <span id="s707">We found out later that about ten or fifteen percent of the Jewish were taken there, and about eighty to eighty-five were taken to this building.</span> <span id="s708">The reason why they took the others over there, because this was overfilled already.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">NL: They must have been bringing them in from other communities too.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">NS: No.</span> <span id="s711">No.</span> <span id="s712">Just from this community.</span> <span id="s713">Other communities, another fate happened.</span> <span id="s714">Other communities that there were only like twenty or thirty families.</span> <span id="s715">They massacred the whole family, wife, children, the whole thing, everything.</span> <span id="s716">There were only thirty or forty Jews, so they took them to a mass grave, and they massacred.</span> <span id="s717">No one escaped in the small communities.</span> <span id="s718">But us, we were like 250 people, a bigger community.</span> <span id="s719">They assembled us, and I remember there was not room enough in one big room.</span> <span id="s720">The room was maybe the size of this--how could they put in 250 people so they made two rooms and all around us we were surrounded by Ukrainians with arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">NL: No Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">NS: No Germans, no Romanians, no nothing.</span> <span id="s723">No Russian, naturally.</span> <span id="s724">Some had First World War arms, hunting rifles, machetes, any weapons.</span> <span id="s725">They even had what you call--what you turn over the earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">NL: Spades?</span> <span id="s727">Shovels?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">NS: Spades.</span> <span id="s729">No, where you grab hay with those forks, [pitchforks?]</span> <span id="s730">hatchets they had on their shoulder.</span> <span id="s731">So we knew that something is, they don't have to watch us with hatchets, but no one thought that there could be such inhuman cruelty, human against human.</span> <span id="s732">But, anyway, we were assembled there in that room, and we waited there.</span> <span id="s733">It was five, six, seven o’clock, eight o’clock, and outside we saw, because each window had bars, heavy bars, and they were low, so we could look out, and we saw them going around with activities, coming and going, in two and three.</span> <span id="s734">They own our lives, and we didn’t know what would happen, but we knew something was not kosher.</span> <span id="s735">They said, “Later on everybody is going to be taken to the City Hall to be registered.”</span> <span id="s736">So, at twelve o’clock midnight, the heavy door opened, and one Ukrainian followed by two in the back came in with a list and started reading the list.</span> <span id="s737">“Chaim Feldman and his two sons, Moishe and Yankel, registration, male.”</span> <span id="s738">It doesn’t matter if he was three or four years old, male--They went.</span> <span id="s739">Another group came in.</span> <span id="s740">“Shutzman, Moishe and his son.”</span> <span id="s741">No females.</span> <span id="s742">And this is the way it went.</span> <span id="s743">But they never came back.</span> <span id="s744">My mother, like I said, it was my destiny to live and tell this story, my mother had some intuition that something was not kosher, so she threw me on the floor in a position of doggie style, like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">NL: On your hands and knees.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">NS: Like this.</span> <span id="s747">She took off her big shawl, she had a big shawl, like women used to wear.</span> <span id="s748">And she threw it on me, and she sat down on me like a bench, and asked also two other ladies.</span> <span id="s749">Unfortunately those two ladies, their husbands went to be massacred.</span> <span id="s750">They all three sat on the bench, and I didn’t want to, but she pushed my head down and said, “Sit.”</span></p> <p><span id="s751">NL: Your father didn’t have this feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s753">No.</span> <span id="s754">This happened in the last ten minutes, and we looked around, and it was like two or three o’clock in the morning, and when we looked around, there was no men anymore.</span> <span id="s755">Only women.</span> <span id="s756">Some were crying and so on.</span> <span id="s757">Here and there a couple of men.</span> <span id="s758">Unfortunately, my father was the last man, so you can see how much he was not wanted, because when they stopped, they said, “That’s it.”</span> <span id="s759">The last one was my father.</span> <span id="s760">The man who came to pick him up was named Subkov.</span> <span id="s761">I think he lives now in some place in Canada or South America, or maybe he lives in Philadelphia, a good citizen protected by the United States Constitution.</span> <span id="s762">That bandit, that murderer!</span> <span id="s763">He came in, “Schneider, Yaacov, and Nathan” and my mother says that I went already.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">NL: Aha.</span> <span id="s765">How clever!</span> <span id="s766">How clever!</span></p> <p><span id="s767">NS: So he says, “All right, and my father took off his wedding ring and gave it to my mother, and he kissed my mother and my sister, and he couldn’t kiss me because I was under the blanket, and he left.</span> <span id="s768">He says, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s769">He says in German, he says: “I have nothing to fear; I am innocent and I will be back very soon, with the papers, with the registration papers.”</span> <span id="s770">That was the last time we saw my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">NL: They were taken to a field and shot?</span> <span id="s772">Is that what you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">NS: No one remained from that group.</span> <span id="s774">From that group I was the one survivor.</span> <span id="s775">One man hid himself between a chimney and the wall.</span> <span id="s776">He crawled in, a very thin man.</span> <span id="s777">Another one crawled in behind a partition.</span> <span id="s778">There were three survivors in this room.</span> <span id="s779">Outside there were a couple more survivors.</span> <span id="s780">What happened to them, it passed an hour or so, and we heard terrible screaming and yelling, like hyenas, howling, “aoooo,” it was actually the cries from the massacred, and we didn’t realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">NL: You didn’t realize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">NS: No, but the windows were open.</span> <span id="s783">It was in June.</span> <span id="s784">You could hear from far away.</span> <span id="s785">It was a mile away, so we could hear it.</span> <span id="s786">I could hear it and I will never forget it.</span> <span id="s787">I was out from the blanket already, because they stopped already the taking out.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">NL: They went out...</span></p> <p><span id="s789">NS: We heard the crying, “gevalt!</span> <span id="s790">,” [raise a cry] the pain, the massacre, and then it quieted down.</span> <span id="s791">About four o’clock the sun came out, one guy came in, I went in the blanket again and says, “As soon as it, tomorrow, we will take the women for registration, and the wives, the women and the girls, the females, to registration, and you will join your husbands.”</span> <span id="s792">What happened that night is they didn’t take all the men together, they herded them like cattle.</span> <span id="s793">They took them individual.</span> <span id="s794">It was all organized by the Ukrainian intelligentsia, the educated men, the postmaster and so on, like I mentioned before, the son of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s795">NL: White-collar--The elite.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">NS: White-collar--the elite.</span> <span id="s797">By the way, the priest was the biggest organizer.</span> <span id="s798">What they did with them is, they were taken individually to about a half a mile away to a big, big barn.</span> <span id="s799">There they were stripped completely of everything, their jewelry, whatever they had, their clothing, completely naked, and then individually they were escorted by two Ukrainians, this is what was told later, two maybe one, or three Ukrainians, it depended, to the place of the massacre, and imagine they already knew when they were stripped naked, where they were going, and that place was, there was already a ditch that was prepared, in those days they prepared a ditch in the bottom of a mountain, which I know exactly where the location is.</span> <span id="s800">It’s called, a kever [grave] and there they said to those henchmen, “Here is yours.</span> <span id="s801">Do whatever you want to do.”</span> <span id="s802">The fate of the Jews over there, very few were shot because they had no bullets.</span> <span id="s803">Most of them were hacked to death, like they say about the story about the rabbi, they cut his head off, and they spiked it up on a big, big stick.</span> <span id="s804">They were dancing around like wild Indians over there.</span> <span id="s805">Some of them they put in sacks, in cotton sacks, and tied the sacks, and as you know, years ago when they used to, grain, wheat, and so on, they used to have two sticks together, they used to hit the grain until the corn fell out.</span> <span id="s806">This is the way they used to beat that in the sack, until he was massacred.</span> <span id="s807">What kind of my father died, I will never know, but naturally he had a very bitter fate.</span> <span id="s808">The Jews were hacked to death, and they were left over there.</span> <span id="s809">One was a survivor from there, who has seen all of that.</span> <span id="s810">That’s the way we know.</span> <span id="s811">Apparently, he was hit by somebody who felt sorry for him, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s812">NL: By a Ukrainian?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s814">He hit him and he says, “Make believe you are dead,” and he fell down in the ditch, with dead bodies on top of him, with blood running all over the place, and when everything quieted down, he ran away naked.</span> <span id="s815">He was wounded, with blood.</span> <span id="s816">He ran away in a cornfield to another town and another town, they caught him over there, and they beat him up, and they gave him to the main authorities, and he wound up being in a concentration camp and survived, and he told the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">NL: Do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">NS: His name was--I’m sorry there were two, one was Lauffer, and the other one was Hecht.</span> <span id="s819">Hecht survived.</span> <span id="s820">He was in Israel; Lauffer survived, and he ran about two or three miles to a peasant family, and they said, “Sure, sure, sure.”</span> <span id="s821">What they did is put you in a wagon with straw, and take you to the next town, and while they were taking him to the town, they killed him on the way.</span> <span id="s822">What happened is that eye-witnesses told us after the war, and during the war we had also, that they assembled the entire town, all women, children, and everybody had to come like to a festival to watch that massacre.</span> <span id="s823">Some of them were crying, weeping, crossing themselves, because some of them were God-fearing, some of them had some humanity in them.</span> <span id="s824">I would say some of them.</span> <span id="s825">Most not.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">NL: And this was going on in other towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">NS: In other towns was going on, yes, completely, massacres.</span> <span id="s828">Lucky here they took all the men and the women the next time because there were too many.</span> <span id="s829">In other towns where there were only ten or twenty families, they massacred them the first night.</span> <span id="s830">Saturday was the massacre night.</span> <span id="s831">[Pause - Mrs. Snyder offered some information here.]</span></p> <p><span id="s832">NL: But, he gave testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">NS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s834">So, the eye-witnesses told us that when they left, like four, five o’clock and the sun started coming up, they left there that bloody mess, and dogs were ripping to pieces, and running around with hands and pieces of flesh all over the place.</span> <span id="s835">What happened is Sunday morning the Romanian troops marched in.</span> <span id="s836">There were no Germans, by the way.</span> <span id="s837">No German uniforms, no Nazis, nothing.</span> <span id="s838">The Romanians were allies to the Germans.</span> <span id="s839">So they marched into our town, and they stopped the massacre.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">NL: They stopped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">NS: They stopped them from killing women and children.</span> <span id="s842">This is the reason that we are alive today.</span> <span id="s843">I understand that the Romanian troops, when they watched that, when they came to the massacre and seen the bloody mess, as a soldier, you know, you have to shoot and get killed or kill--even the Germans used to shoot machine guns rather than...</span></p> <p><span id="s844">NL: Hack...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">NS: Hack.</span> <span id="s846">That is a bestial murder, hacking to death.</span> <span id="s847">The Germans [Mr. Snyder may mean Romanians here.]</span> <span id="s848">stopped it because it wasn’t a nice thing, from a human point of view.</span> <span id="s849">They didn’t arrest them but they stopped it.</span> <span id="s850">So Sunday, I remember around eleven or twelve o’clock, the high officer, a colonel or major, came into the prison where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">NL: Excuse me for just a moment, that terrible night, about two or three in the morning, did Mother then take you out of the blanket and take you back to the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">NS: No, we couldn’t leave there, but in the morning we felt safe when the Romanians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s854">[Mrs. Snyder made a comment here.]</span></p> <p><span id="s855">NS: The first question was, when we asked the Ukrainians who were watching us, “Where are our husbands?”</span> <span id="s856">“Oh, they are fine; they are all being registered and you will follow them.”</span> <span id="s857">So we said, “They’re supposed to be registered.</span> <span id="s858">So why can’t we seem them?”</span> <span id="s859">We said, “What was this hollering and screaming?”</span> <span id="s860">and they said, “Oh, dogs.”</span> <span id="s861">They didn’t tell us the truth.</span> <span id="s862">But when the Romanians came in, they said, “You are all Jews, and you are all going to be relocated in a labor camp; you are going to live in hygiene, and you are going to live and work for our country to victory to smash the Communists,” and so on.</span> <span id="s863">They didn’t say nothing to us about what happened, and they said, “Now we have to have a list of all of you who are here.”</span> <span id="s864">And then a couple of Romanian soldiers came in, and that day, a Sunday afternoon, they allowed all of the women, everybody in that imprisonment, to go to their homes.</span> <span id="s865">The reason why is, “Gather your belongings because tomorrow morning, Monday morning, you all have to assemble and march--all of us because we don’t have no train or trucks.</span> <span id="s866">We have to march to a little town called [unclear] which is close by, and there you will meet the other Jews and we will all take you to the relocation camp, so you will have to be deported.”</span> <span id="s867">So, that particular Sunday they let us out.</span> <span id="s868">So, when we came home, we found the home completely empty.</span> <span id="s869">While we were locked up all day Saturday before the massacre, the Ukrainians had ransacked and plundered everything single Jewish home, to the nail on the wall.</span> <span id="s870">We came in and we could not find nothing in the house.</span> <span id="s871">Nothing, empty walls.</span> <span id="s872">They even ripped out the plates from the stove, the cast iron plates.</span> <span id="s873">My mother went first to look for the box of jewelry.</span> <span id="s874">Gone.</span> <span id="s875">Looked in the attic for the fur coats, gone.</span> <span id="s876">So she found a couple of shmattes.</span> <span id="s877">[rags].</span> <span id="s878">What we found is tefillin [phylacteries worn on the forehead and left arm by observant Jews] which they were not interested.</span> <span id="s879">I have the tefillin with me, upstairs.</span> <span id="s880">The leather is getting already a little warped.</span> <span id="s881">We gathered together a couple of shmattes--that means a couple of rags, that we had there for our journey, our unknown journey, and we found some challah still, and we took the challah.</span> <span id="s882">Next door at that Ostra, the Jewish baron, at his mansion, the Romanian Kommandatur, the Romanian commanders, had set up their main headquarters there, next to us.</span> <span id="s883">The house didn’t belong to us.</span> <span id="s884">There were other Jews who had connections.</span> <span id="s885">Romanians like bribes, so a lot of Jewish women still had left jewelry, and for jewelry they promised that they would give us an escort, and maybe they would give you two wagons with two horses for the very sick and old and little children, because it is a long journey of hundreds of miles.</span> <span id="s886">They didn’t tell us that we were being deported to Russia or to Ukrainia or Transnistria, but one thing, we were safe, that no more killing would happen.</span> <span id="s887">We had never seen Germans.</span> <span id="s888">Now in our walk, we couldn’t walk too much, just in town, and asked, “Where are husbands?”</span> <span id="s889">And the answer was, “They took them away for labor.</span> <span id="s890">They have to work for the Fatherland to help beat the Russians.</span> <span id="s891">They took to them to a labor camp.”</span> <span id="s892">So, when we asked the Ukrainians, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s893">no one talked.</span> <span id="s894">There was like a silence, and the Romanians did us not tell us either.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">NL: Did Mother have some intuition about that, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">NS: My mother and most of the women say, “We will never see them again.”</span> <span id="s897">But we never thought that they would massacre them in such a beastly way.</span> <span id="s898">We thought that they were deported someplace.</span> <span id="s899">And they were in a labor camp, and working because they needed them for reconstructing bridges because they were bombed or something, and maybe one day they will come back.</span> <span id="s900">But we never, I will say that for the next two years we thought they were going to come back.</span> <span id="s901">We never realized...</span></p> <p><span id="s902">NL: You didn’t know that they were massacred?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">NS: No.</span> <span id="s904">After the war, we knew exactly what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">NL: You didn’t know for the next few years?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">NS: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">NL: You started to walk then...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">NS: The next day we started to walk.</span> <span id="s909">I remember there was one wagon with one horse which they provided, and they gave us an escort of two or three soldiers, Romanian soldiers.</span> <span id="s910">They were just regular soldiers walking with us.</span> <span id="s911">We bribed them so much that if we wanted to stop, they stopped with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">NL: Did they give you any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">NS: No.</span> <span id="s914">That is the reason we assembled to get the food that is left in the homes, eggs and vegetables, challah and jars with water and so forth, and then we marched on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">NL: How many were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">NS: Altogether--the whole town, what was left, I would say no more than 75.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">NL: All women and children, girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">NS: Yes, and a couple of men.</span> <span id="s919">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s920">Yes, and by the way, one man hid himself in a cornfield.</span> <span id="s921">He was not brought into the assembly, and he survived.</span> <span id="s922">And I would say there were no more than five men left in this town alive.</span> <span id="s923">And they marched us to a big town called--Washkautz Vischnitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">NL: Could you spell that, Mr. Snyder?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s926">W-A-S-H-K-A-U-T-Z.</span> <span id="s927">That is the first time that we saw a camp.</span> <span id="s928">It wasn’t actually a ghetto, but it was a camp which is closed in with barbed wire, and there were Jewish survivors from other localities, towns, which were left alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">NL: In Bukovina?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">NS: Not in Bukovina, not in that section.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">NL: From various parts of Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">NS: No, from various parts of our little region.</span> <span id="s933">Not too many were left, because, like I said, in the small places whole families, everything was wiped out.</span> <span id="s934">We found out later.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">NL: This was going toward the Russian border?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">NS: No, towards the Polish border, but the aim was to drive us like cattle into Czernowitz, into the ghetto, in Czernowitz ghetto.</span> <span id="s937">What they did is they assembled all the Jews that remained.</span> <span id="s938">When they assembled all the Jews in Czernowitz, there were no other Jews left in Bukovina.</span> <span id="s939">All survivors were in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s940">In Czernowitz, they didn’t have a pogrom.</span> <span id="s941">In Czernowitz, the Germans came in so they did their own thing over there, they did executions.</span> <span id="s942">Took them out, like couple hundred and shoot them here, and a couple of hundred there and so on.</span> <span id="s943">Not Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s944">They wouldn’t dare to into a town with a couple hundred thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s945">The Germans came in because that was a strategic city.</span> <span id="s946">It’s a big city.</span> <span id="s947">So they brought us all to Czernowitz, and brought us in to the big ghetto which was prepared.</span> <span id="s948">The journey took about three, four, five days.</span> <span id="s949">Some got sick, some died on the road, and we made some stopover.</span> <span id="s950">We bribed the soldiers, and we joined up with other groups coming from other areas, and in the meantime we were stoned by peasants.</span> <span id="s951">We had to go through villages on the country roads.</span> <span id="s952">We were stoned by them.</span> <span id="s953">They felt bad that we were still alive.</span> <span id="s954">Then we came in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s955">This was where my mother’s sister lived, and they herded us into a ghetto, and in that ghetto we thought that this is it, we are going to survive.</span> <span id="s956">And in the meantime, the war, the Russian are already not too far from Moscow, [unclear] Blitzkrieg.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">NL: You mean the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">NS: The Germans are already advancing very much into the Russian territory.</span> <span id="s959">Then they had, they gave us all documents, and we all had to wear first of all stars.</span> <span id="s960">Everybody had to wear stars, on here and here.</span> <span id="s961">They give us certain documents that are stamped “Jew”, yellow stamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">NL: The Romanians did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">NS: The Romanian authorities.</span> <span id="s964">The Germans were like supervisors there.</span> <span id="s965">They were the SS and Gestapo and so on, and we didn’t have too much contact with the peasants there, because the town was mostly blue-collar workers, in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s966">It was a big town like Allentown, I would say, not like Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s967">Then they start to organize deportation with cattle boxes, trains, to Transnistria, which is across the border in Ukrainia.</span> <span id="s968">They said, “Relocation to a new land, a promised land”.</span> <span id="s969">And the way it was going, I would never find it out, because in Czernowitz you also have a Jewish community, which they were wheeling and dealing with authorities to leave the sick and the wounded.</span> <span id="s970">And people tried to bribe not to be first on the list, and it was all really wheeling and dealing all right.</span> <span id="s971">It’s the fate of every one.</span> <span id="s972">Every single day one thousand to two thousand is to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">NL: Who drew up the lists?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">NS: I think the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s975">You had to give them the list of the Jews, and they selected whoever they wanted to.</span> <span id="s976">They only left behind those who got a temporary, is called a temporary, but a permanent stay, somebody who was needed for defense.</span> <span id="s977">My uncle, my mother’s sister’s husband was a textile designer.</span> <span id="s978">They needed uniforms for the war, and he worked in a textile factory.</span> <span id="s979">They have him what we call an exemption, a stay, and he took us in as his dependents, my mother and me and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s981">So then you were exempted.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">NS: Because we lived together in his household.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">NL: His house was in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">NS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s985">His house was.</span> <span id="s986">In one room we lived ten families.</span> <span id="s987">We had a little corner, and this corner was our room and we were exempt, so called, temporary only, naturally.</span> <span id="s988">Every day they had transports, of a thousand, five hundred Jews going to Transnistria, to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s989">We were staying in ghetto.</span> <span id="s990">There was barbed wire all around, with Romanian soldiers watching, watch towers, the same like the ghetto.</span> <span id="s991">You couldn’t get out from there.</span> <span id="s992">Food was scarce, but like I said, Jews always know how to survive.</span> <span id="s993">They used to sell their pants and their shirts, and their gold and...</span></p> <p><span id="s994">NL: Were some of them able to work in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s996">No, some could work outside, because they needed them for defense, like doctors or dentists, or textile workers or mechanics, or those who were specialized in the electric company.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">NL: Some skill.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">NS: Skilled people.</span> <span id="s999">They used to be escorted outside with the soldiers, and then escorted back in.</span> <span id="s1000">They could not go free outside the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">NL: But everyday, the ghetto was being diminished by the transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1003">Yes, the ghetto was diminished every single day, and we had diseases there, and typhus and dysentery and fleas and bed bugs and all kinds of makkos.</span> <span id="s1004">[Yiddish: plagues, trouble]</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">NL: Did you hear of any word at all about a possible underground resistance?</span> <span id="s1006">Was there a Zionist underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">NS: Yes, we did have, we did have partisans outside in the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">NL: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">NS: Jewish partisans, Russian partisans mixed together, which are fighting the Russians [?]</span> <span id="s1010">but we didn’t know where, and it wasn’t near Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s1011">It could have been a couple of hundred miles from Czernowitz, in the forest because only there could you survive, fighting the Nazis, the Hitlers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">NL: And you could not, the Czernowitz Jews in the ghetto could not possibly join them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">NS: I understand that a couple escaped from there under the barbed wire, and joined the partisans.</span> <span id="s1014">While we were there, if I am not mistaken, the Jewish community made contact with a Palestine paratrooper, a parachutist to Eastern Europe, in Romania, and somehow he winded up in Czernowitz making contact not with me, but with some of them.</span> <span id="s1015">They were also in Hungaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">NL: You were saying that you did hear about a parachutist through some Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">NS: Yes--Zionist organization--No one talked about resistance.</span> <span id="s1019">You couldn’t fight the German army, but somehow a way to escape, or a way of putting up resistance, not fighting but putting up resistance, but that was too late.</span> <span id="s1020">So, in the meantime, the ghetto was diminishing.</span> <span id="s1021">Some of them were taken out for forced labor, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1022">The Germans took our men, select, for forced labor.</span> <span id="s1023">They never came back.</span> <span id="s1024">We found out the next day that they were taken to the bridge that was bombed by the Russian.</span> <span id="s1025">A big bridge over a big river like the Delaware, which is called the Prut, [river in Romania] and they had to work there, and after the work was over, the Germans took them out and machine-gunned them.</span> <span id="s1026">They just felt like it, so they never came back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1027">They took me to work one day.</span> <span id="s1028">They selected me, because we were registered there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">NL: You were then thirteen or fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">NS: I was then--‘41, ‘42--14 1/2.</span> <span id="s1031">They took me to work, and put me with some other friends of mine, and they took us to the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">NL: To the Prut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1034">We didn’t realized what had happened.</span> <span id="s1035">Later how lucky we were to escape.</span> <span id="s1036">They had us working in that water, and even though it was in the summer, we were without shirts, and the water was up to our necks.</span> <span id="s1037">We had to lift those heavy iron bars and so on, tied with ropes.</span> <span id="s1038">They tried to reconstruct the bridge when it was bombed.</span> <span id="s1039">The Germans were watching us, not the Romanian.</span> <span id="s1040">If I am not mistaken, they were the Germans in black uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">NL: SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">NS: And I saw there personally, eyewitnessed an execution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">NL: Shootings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">NS: A shooting of an elderly man who could not lift, was incapable, they took him out, made him kneel down, and they shot him in the back of his head because he did not put out production.</span> <span id="s1045">But, we still took life not seriously at that time, because we didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1046">It was like, “So what?</span> <span id="s1047">So they shoot you.”</span> <span id="s1048">Life didn’t have any meaning at all, so we were used to that, danger and adventure, day by day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">NL: And death?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">NS: And death.</span> <span id="s1051">The next time they took us to forced labor to clean, what do you call, pig sties and B.M. and other places, and Russian army camps who were left behind.</span> <span id="s1052">Romanians took them and moved in.</span> <span id="s1053">They took us now to snow shoveling.</span> <span id="s1054">This was a daily routine.</span> <span id="s1055">We had to go in the winter shoveling snow every single day, and I liked it because an adventure, you could feel free, breathe the fresh air and shovel snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">NL: Were you getting any food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">NS: From them, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">NL: How did you provide your food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">NS: We used to come back and eat.</span> <span id="s1060">We had dried bread.</span> <span id="s1061">Some of them they smuggled food in there, and we ate potato peels, and whatever remnants were left.</span> <span id="s1062">We used to trade our clothes and whatever we could, and a little business was going on in the ghetto--Jews know how to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">NL: And your mother, how was she managing with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">NS: My mother and my sister was there in the ghetto and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">NL: You saw them every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">NS: Yes, and I was at that time very adventurous.</span> <span id="s1067">I had a couple of friends, and we adventured us outside the ghetto, under the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1068">It was very stupid at that time, because our life was in danger, but as a young boy you never think the danger is close to you.</span> <span id="s1069">So you figure, “What the heck!”</span> <span id="s1070">I remember that we used to go out of the ghetto, and we met on a place on a little hill with trees outside the city, and we used to play cards there.</span> <span id="s1071">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">NL: This would be after work or when you were not on forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">NS: When I was not in forced labor.</span> <span id="s1074">There was one friend who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1075">He was half-Jewish actually.</span> <span id="s1076">His father was a colonel in the Romanian army, and his mother was Jewish, and he was very pro-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1077">He came from Romania and settled there, his father.</span> <span id="s1078">He was very much against what was happening.</span> <span id="s1079">His mother was not in the ghetto, because she passed as a non-Jew, because she was the wife of a Romanian officer, but he had some Jewish feeling.</span> <span id="s1080">I will never forget to this day, he was a very nice guy, and we became good friends.</span> <span id="s1081">We used to meet every single day, his name was Osiah [phonetic] and he used to say, ”I am a Jew, too, but my father is a Romanian officer, so who cares?</span> <span id="s1082">I hate the Germans.</span> <span id="s1083">He wants me to become an officer and fight in the war.</span> <span id="s1084">I don't want to die.”</span> <span id="s1085">He was more like my age, but he knew that one day that he has to go into the army.</span> <span id="s1086">He actually talked me into going to a movie!</span> <span id="s1087">That is very funny, and it’s tragicomic, to go in a movie with him...</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">NL: And you had your stars on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">NS: No, we used to under the barbed wire and we took off the stars, and we didn’t have any papers or documents in case we got caught.</span> <span id="s1090">So one day he says to me, “Do you want to go in a movie with me?”</span> <span id="s1091">It was a movie playing, it was called propaganda movie called “Jud Suss” and I did not understand until I came into the movie, and I said: “But how am I going to go in?</span> <span id="s1092">You know they have razzias.”</span> <span id="s1093">Razzias mean they close up the places, streets, and they check the papers.</span> <span id="s1094">“If they catch me they will kill me.”</span> <span id="s1095">He said, “Don’t worry, I am going to give you a silver swastika.</span> <span id="s1096">You’ll put it on here, and if you get stopped by the SS or the Gestapo, you just say ‘Heil Hitler’ and then you go through.”</span> <span id="s1097">My mother didn’t know all of the stupid things that I did.</span> <span id="s1098">I went with him to the movie, and it happened that the movie was a very repugnant against Jews.</span> <span id="s1099">I remember when we went to the movie, it was very repugnant to us.</span> <span id="s1100">It showed how the Jew with a long nose tried to cheat and rape a German blue-eyed, blond-haired girl, Aryan, and so on.</span> <span id="s1101">After they show the movie, I remember that the people were so instigated by the movie that they stood up and said, “Heil Hitler!</span> <span id="s1102">Kill the Jews!</span> <span id="s1103">Kill the Jews!”</span> <span id="s1104">So antisemitic propaganda was that movie.</span> <span id="s1105">When the movie ended, we walked out.</span> <span id="s1106">As we walked out…</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">NL: This young friend didn’t realize what this movie was about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">NS: No.</span> <span id="s1109">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">NL: He meant to entertain you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">NS: To entertain.</span> <span id="s1112">What kind of movies did they show at that time?</span> <span id="s1113">They didn’t show no cowboy movies.</span> <span id="s1114">Those were the kind of movies they showed.</span> <span id="s1115">I like movies, and when I was in Czernowitz, in Gymnasium, I like to go to movies all the time.</span> <span id="s1116">I was a movie buff.</span> <span id="s1117">When we walked out from the movie, naturally, by the door there is a Razzia, Gestapo, asking for papers.</span> <span id="s1118">I didn’t have any papers, but right away my friend said to me.</span> <span id="s1119">“He had papers,” but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1120">But I had this.</span> <span id="s1121">He said, “When they stop you, what you do is [unclear] ‘Heil Hitler’ and you say you forgot the papers.</span> <span id="s1122">You are a Volksdeutsche.”</span> <span id="s1123">Because you speak German.</span> <span id="s1124">As a matter of fact, I used to go with short pants and I had very short hair, crew cut.</span> <span id="s1125">I looked like a Volksdeutsche, and exactly this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1126">My heart actually stood still, and I did say that, and they were suspicious, and my friend said, showed his papers, and they figured we were together, and he is Christian, so why will I be a Jew?</span> <span id="s1127">, so they let us go.</span> <span id="s1128">I came home and I told my mother and my aunt, and they all said, “You are not normal.</span> <span id="s1129">You are out of your mind.</span> <span id="s1130">How could you do something like that?</span> <span id="s1131">You are taking your life in your own hands.</span> <span id="s1132">You are risking your life.”</span> <span id="s1133">And I said, “That’s is what life is all about.</span> <span id="s1134">I’m an adventurer.”</span> <span id="s1135">There were other episodes.</span> <span id="s1136">The other time I got caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">NL: You didn’t go back to the movie?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">NS: No, I got caught in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">NL: Outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">NS: I used to go walking on the Herrengasse.</span> <span id="s1141">It was like Chestnut Street or Wall Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">NL: Outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">NS: Walking, looking, seeing nice girls walking by.</span> <span id="s1144">I was young boy, and here they closed up the street, and started asking for papers.</span> <span id="s1145">I didn’t have that little.</span> <span id="s1146">That was my security.</span> <span id="s1147">He had it, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">NL: You kept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">NS: Yes, No.</span> <span id="s1150">He had it.</span> <span id="s1151">Every time I used to go with him, I wouldn’t know if I would get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">NL: He had it for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">NS: They stopped us and asked us for papers, and there was also another friend of mine, also Jewish, and this time it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1154">This time, papers.</span> <span id="s1155">I did not have papers, and they arrested us both.</span> <span id="s1156">They brought us to the Gestapo headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">NL: They arrested you both?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">NS: Both my friend and me.</span> <span id="s1159">I claimed that I am not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1160">I don’t have any papers.</span> <span id="s1161">I have white socks and black short pants and a crew cut, and I spoke German and I am not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1162">As a proof I went with our friend that was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1163">How dare I come out from the ghetto being a Jew?</span> <span id="s1164">And they claimed that we are spies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">NL: Russian spies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">NS: Russian spies, naturally.</span> <span id="s1167">So, they said that you know that we make you talk, so they put us in a cell together and they later--just as a joke--they made us clean a clogged up washroom with our bare hands.</span> <span id="s1168">With a bucket, we had to do that.</span> <span id="s1169">We did it with our hands, and they were standing there with a machine gun, that German SS soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">NL: This was a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1172">This was a Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s1173">But they had German soldiers inside.</span> <span id="s1174">I said, “This is the end of it.</span> <span id="s1175">They aren’t even going to deport us.</span> <span id="s1176">They are going to shoot us.</span> <span id="s1177">They are going to take us in the yard and shoot us because we are spies.”</span> <span id="s1178">Then came the interrogation.</span> <span id="s1179">They called us in and he said, “Tell me the truth.</span> <span id="s1180">If you tell me the truth, and then we will forgive you.”</span> <span id="s1181">They thought we’re young and they could brainwash us.</span> <span id="s1182">“Who sent you?</span> <span id="s1183">From where are you?</span> <span id="s1184">You are spies.</span> <span id="s1185">You are not Volkdeutsche.</span> <span id="s1186">You are Russian or Jews, but you are spies.”</span> <span id="s1187">And we claimed that we are not.</span> <span id="s1188">We are not, and not, and not.</span> <span id="s1189">We are Volkdeutsches.</span> <span id="s1190">“Where are your parents?”</span> <span id="s1191">and I said, “We lost our parents in the war because they got deported by the Russian.</span> <span id="s1192">We just left and traveled.</span> <span id="s1193">We have no home, and we just live with friends, back and forth.”</span> <span id="s1194">We gave them what we call bubba meisas.</span> <span id="s1195">[old grandmother tales]</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">NL: And they believed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">NS: No, they didn’t</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">NL: They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">NS: No.</span> <span id="s1200">In the meantime, our friend, the non-Christian [perhaps Mr. Snyder means “Christian”] I didn’t have a father, went in the ghetto, cause Christians could go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1201">Jews couldn’t get out, but Christians could go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1202">He went into the ghetto to my friend’s father.</span> <span id="s1203">My other friend, the Jewish friend had a father, who was a good businessman.</span> <span id="s1204">He used to deal with dollars, in gold, and this is what you do during the war.</span> <span id="s1205">Bribe, and the black market, and he told them what happened.</span> <span id="s1206">He said, “Natan and Bubi was my other friend.</span> <span id="s1207">They are both locked up in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1208">They caught them over there, and something has to be done.”</span> <span id="s1209">So, he said, “You know, Germans don’t take bribes.</span> <span id="s1210">Romanians we can bribe; they would sell their own mothers, but not Germans.</span> <span id="s1211">So, I will try.”</span> <span id="s1212">He tried a Romanian connection, but I found out later that it did not work, but my friend, the non-Christian, influenced his father, who was a colonel in the Romanian army, and he says, “Here are my two buddies,” if he called us Jews or non-Jews I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1213">“Two friends of mine are accused,” --we would go to this house sometimes, he says, “My buddies are accused of being spies.</span> <span id="s1214">Can you put your influence?”</span> <span id="s1215">and so on.</span> <span id="s1216">All we know is that they came into the cell, and they opened the door, and he says “Raus.</span> <span id="s1217">Out!”</span> <span id="s1218">and we were scared because we know that the Germans used to have a trick.</span> <span id="s1219">They say, “Go” and they shoot you in the back, so we came out slowly, not running, and as we came around the corner, we run like we never run in my life.</span> <span id="s1220">We run for our life, and we never stopped until we couldn’t breathe anymore.</span> <span id="s1221">Later we met with our friend, and he told us that he asked his father how he did, where he did--See, the Romanians were actually running the country.</span> <span id="s1222">The Germans were only there like supervising, or guests.</span> <span id="s1223">So apparently he had some influence and so on.</span> <span id="s1224">I think I was near to death many, many times, and I escaped and I said, “This is my destiny.”</span> <span id="s1225">So that was life in ghetto, and it was going on day by day.</span> <span id="s1226">I’ve seen people die, I’ve seen people getting beaten, I’ve seen people getting shot...</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">NL: Were the Romanians in charge of the ghetto, Mr. Snyder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">NS: Romanians, but there were also some Germans used to walk through patrols.</span> <span id="s1229">Another incident was another one, which I will never forget.</span> <span id="s1230">They took us out for forced labor.</span> <span id="s1231">Outside the city, we had to clear a road, a dam was built there, or a road was built there.</span> <span id="s1232">It was big boulders and stones, and there were big trucks, and we had to pick up the big stones and throw them by hand into the trucks, and there were Germans who were supervising that project, and we were working there, and, if I am not mistaken, they gave us one piece of bread, and some [unclear] from grass, some soup like a [unclear] because we don’t have no food, and without nourishment you cannot work, and they needed us as slaves, and that afternoon--we were marched there by the Romanians--but the Germans took us over.</span> <span id="s1233">Then the Romanians were supposed to bring us back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1234">They was working in combination.</span> <span id="s1235">A German jeep came with two officers, and they stopped, and we didn’t pay attention too much and suddenly they said, “Line up, all of you, in one line!”</span> <span id="s1236">and he walked by and pulled out every fifth or sixth or seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">NL: And shot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">NS: Now, when he start to count, you know sometimes he can go one side like “fier, funf,’ and then he goes “funf,” and then he can say “seven” --he starts to gamble, like playing the casino in Atlantic City, and we were looking who was the fifth or was it the sixth?</span> <span id="s1239">I don’t remember because our heart was down in our pants.</span> <span id="s1240">Again, we didn’t think too much about life or death, because we were all stupid or we didn’t care about life, so it was not in panic.</span> <span id="s1241">If it would happen today, I will have a heart attack, and they took them out, and they took them away for a special Sonderkommando, what we heard is later, trrrr, we heard the machine gun fire, and we did not see them killed but we know that they killed them.</span> <span id="s1242">Why?</span> <span id="s1243">Because it was a sport like people go hunting in here, killing animals.</span> <span id="s1244">That was a sport.</span> <span id="s1245">He feels like killing a couple of Jews.</span> <span id="s1246">Nobody is going to punish him for that.</span> <span id="s1247">When we came back to the ghetto, I remember the daughters, the mothers, the girlfriends--they used to wait at the gate and they saw how many less came back, and we told them we don’t know where they are.</span> <span id="s1248">Some of them said, “Yeah, maybe.”</span> <span id="s1249">But they knew, and they started crying and there was mourning.</span> <span id="s1250">“How come you went out with fifty and you came back only forty or thirty-eight?”</span> <span id="s1251">So those are the adventures.</span> <span id="s1252">Again, I said life has played a joke, actually in my advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">NL: Were people still being taken for Transnistria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">NS: Daily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">NL: This continued for what, a year or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">NS: It wasn’t every day, it was every other day or maybe twice a week, but constantly they were taking people.</span> <span id="s1257">It was a norm that the Romanians had to fill, to take out so many Jews.</span> <span id="s1258">It was according to how many cattle wagons were on the train, because you must understand that the train was used for transporting troops to the front, bringing back wounded or material, so they couldn’t just take all the trains just for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1259">When they had available one train, Jews are coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">NL: Did you hear anything from people in Transnistria?</span> <span id="s1261">Did you get any information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">NS: Yes, we got information back from soldiers who came back from the front line who passed through there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">NL: Romanian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">NS: Yes, for bribes they would do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">NL: And what did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">NS: They said what misery they lived there, that there some are living, some are dying.</span> <span id="s1267">We even could send postal packages, packages with a lot of--Now someone came on leave from Stalingrad, and he passed through.</span> <span id="s1268">He had to pass through Transnistria.</span> <span id="s1269">Transnistria was like New Jersey, a whole section.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">NL: Southern Ukraine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">NS: Southern Ukraine, Russia.</span> <span id="s1272">And they would say, “Look...” You wanted to get gold or money, they would pay you .</span> <span id="s1273">You go to China with “Just look up there in the ghetto my sister,” and sometimes some of the packages were given to them, plus the money and jewelry--never arrived, but many of them received.</span> <span id="s1274">See because there was some good humanity as far as the soldiers are concerned.</span> <span id="s1275">Maybe they’re tired of war.</span> <span id="s1276">Maybe they see too much killing, and when they went back, they gave those packages, because then we were notified that they did receive that, medication and so on.</span> <span id="s1277">You see we could have money freely because we had contact with the civilized world, but they were there more like in a concentration camp in the wilderness.</span> <span id="s1278">Some were Germans.</span> <span id="s1279">Some were Romanians, but not in poverty.</span> <span id="s1280">This is what happened.</span> <span id="s1281">They were not in ghettos.</span> <span id="s1282">The whole area was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1283">In the ghetto you could bribe, and you could breathe.</span> <span id="s1284">There was even a couple of weddings in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1285">We had a Hebrew school in the ghetto, we taught the kids how to read and to say broches [blessings] and learn aleph-bet.</span> <span id="s1286">[Hebrew alphabet] A lot of things were going on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1287">Weddings, and girls used to go with guys and get engaged, fall in love.</span> <span id="s1288">There was life and death in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1289">We didn’t realize what happened in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1290">We didn’t know what happened in the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">NL: Did you hear the word?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1293">Absolutely, you never knew what was happening past that border, what was happening in Poland, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1294">We were cut off.</span> <span id="s1295">We didn’t hear nothing.</span> <span id="s1296">As a matter of fact, we knew that the Hungarian Jews were the most happiest, luckiest Jews, because they were not occupied.</span> <span id="s1297">They were still free.</span> <span id="s1298">So many Jews who could escape, escaped to Hungaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">NL: Some did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">NS: Yes, you know why?</span> <span id="s1301">Because we were not too far from the Transylvanian border.</span> <span id="s1302">Transylvania belonged at that time to Hungaria.</span> <span id="s1303">You just had to cross Transylvania and you were there, Szeged, Kolozsvar, Temesvár.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">NL: And some Jews from Czernovitz went into Transylvania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">NS: To escape the terror and live a little bit, and not under much freedom but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">NL: But relatively.</span> <span id="s1307">So they knew that Hungary was still safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">NS: Until 1944.</span> <span id="s1309">This was in 1942 when they escaped, so for two years they had more liberty.</span> <span id="s1310">Then the fate of Hungarians was worse than anybody else, but we didn’t know what happened in Poland and Austria.</span> <span id="s1311">We knew that there was ghettos all over, but we didn’t know that they were massacring and burning by the millions.</span> <span id="s1312">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1313">Now one thing that we always wished was that we would like to see American planes come and paratroopers and save us.</span> <span id="s1314">We would like to see the American planes bomb; we would like to see some help from the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">NL: Did you know that America was in the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">NS: Oh, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">NL: You did know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">NS: Yes, America joined the war in 1941.</span> <span id="s1319">We knew that right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">NL: Was anybody listening to BBC, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">NS: Yes, but if you got caught, you got shot.</span> <span id="s1322">We had little radios with BBC from England, and it was in the German language, so some that couldn’t understand English could listen.</span> <span id="s1323">We knew about the American landing in Africa.</span> <span id="s1324">We knew about that but it was a long way from Africa to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">NL: But you had some hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">NS: We knew about Ploesti, Bucharest was bombed, when the Americans flew over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">NL: You did know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">NS: Oh yes, see the Romania-Jews had a different fate.</span> <span id="s1329">They were more like in Hungaria, and other Romanian Jews survived, others got killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">NL: From what I understand, the Jews in the occupied or annexed territories, as they were called, Bessarabia, Bukovina, they had it much worse than the people from so-called Old Romania, the basic nucleus of the country.</span> <span id="s1331">Most of those Jews were saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">NS: Yes, they were taken to forced labor, but at night-time they used to go home to their homes.</span> <span id="s1333">They used to be beaten and spit and sometime abused, but killed--some of them were taken out and killed.</span> <span id="s1334">I saw in the beginning, but they were not herded into ghettos like we.</span> <span id="s1335">We were considered Commies, because of the Bolsheviks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">NL: Or even foreign because you were not part of the Old Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">NS: Right, we were considered foreign, too, because we were occupied by Russia for a year.</span> <span id="s1338">We were traitors, because the Romanians, when they came in on June 22, they all had, every soldier had it here.</span> <span id="s1339">I remember that, I will never forget, armbands with a ring of black, with a big cross, and it said, “The War of the Christian Liberation,” or something like that, “In the name of Jesus, Christian Liberation,” something like that.</span> <span id="s1340">They want to liberate the world from Bolshevism.</span> <span id="s1341">So now, we are there the tool of Bolshevism.</span> <span id="s1342">The Jews are always blamed.</span> <span id="s1343">That is the reason that they had so many massacres.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">NL: Did you know the name of Antonescu?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">NS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1346">He was the butcher.</span> <span id="s1347">He was the prime minister of Romania while we were in ghetto, because Bukovina now belonged to Romania.</span> <span id="s1348">Romania took back Bukovina.</span> <span id="s1349">The reason why they took back Bukovina, Bessarabia because they joined Germany fighting Russia so the Germans as a gift give us back your territory.</span> <span id="s1350">Antonescu was the prime minister or the commander-in-chief of the Romanian army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">NL: How about the name of Filderman?</span> <span id="s1352">Filderman was the head of the old Romanian Jewish community...</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">NS: I never heard of his.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">NL: Who intervened to a great extent on behalf of the Jews in Transnistria.</span> <span id="s1355">He was a high school chum of Antonescu and used that connection.</span> <span id="s1356">Also he threatened economic sabotage of the Romanian economy if Antonescu wouldn’t give certain concessions to Romania.</span> <span id="s1357">You didn’t hear that name?</span> <span id="s1358">Filderman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">NS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">NL: He eventually was taken to Transnistria, but survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">NS: You shouldn’t misunderstand.</span> <span id="s1362">They took some Jews from Romania also to Transnistria, but not from Southern Romania, more like from Moldavia, like from Jassy [also Iasi] and from the southern part of Bukovina, closer to Bukovina, like the northern part of Old Romania.</span> <span id="s1363">In some of the locations they had massacres, pogroms, and they took the Jews into concentration camps to Transnistria.</span> <span id="s1364">But from Bucharest, from deep Romania, never.</span> <span id="s1365">The Jews over there lived; they were more assimilated there, they were more assimilated there in the south.</span> <span id="s1366">They didn’t speak Yiddish, they all spoke the Romanian language.</span> <span id="s1367">You see in Moldavia, between Bessarabia and Bukovina, they had the influence from Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s1368">Zionism was there, more Hassidim.</span> <span id="s1369">You didn’t find too many Hassidim, Orthodox Jews, in the south of Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">NL: Also, I think Antonescu, toward the end of 1942, began to worry about a possible Russian occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">NS: A Russian occupation and a Russian revenge.</span> <span id="s1372">Yes, but it was too late.</span> <span id="s1373">I think he was tried and hung.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">NL: So how long did you stay then in Czernowitz, then, Mr. Snyder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">NS: We stayed in Czernowitz until March of 1944, when the war took a turn for the good, and the Russian advanced on all the fronts and beat the Germans back, and the beginning of March, the first or second week of March, the Russian entered Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">NL: Were you able to get more food?</span> <span id="s1377">I understand that in some ghettos people just starved right and left.</span> <span id="s1378">How did Mother and you as children survived?</span> <span id="s1379">Did she still have things to sell, or were you earning something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">NS: No, my mother was a very capable woman in business, in surviving, in wheeling and dealing.</span> <span id="s1381">She made commissions from selling this and that, and from nothing she was making a living and supporting us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">NL: So in March, then, there was this turn...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">NS: There were a lot of more adventures in the ghetto that I need maybe ten more tapes to go over that.</span> <span id="s1384">I would say, starting in March when the Russian came in Czernowitz, as a matter of fact, before the Russian in 1944, at the end of ‘43, when Stalingrad fell, the entire attitude of the Romanians took a different turn.</span> <span id="s1385">They were scared.</span> <span id="s1386">I am talking about the Romanian occupation and even the local people, if the Russian would come back and they want to massacre them.</span> <span id="s1387">So what they did is, in certain occasion, they have opened the ghetto for people who are working steady for defense.</span> <span id="s1388">My uncle was one.</span> <span id="s1389">They let him go back to his own place.</span> <span id="s1390">That was the end of ’43, in November of ‘43, to his home, but it wasn’t the same home any more.</span> <span id="s1391">We only had one room to live, all of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">NL: But you were out of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">NS: Yes, but you could not live there too long, because it was like scattered, so they herded us into another home about a block away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1394">But it was called also the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1395">Because my uncle worked in the textile mill, day and night manufacturing blankets and uniforms for the army, and there we survived also by wheeling and dealing with my mother, selling whatever we can and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">NL: And your uncle was making some income?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">NS: Income, yes, and now we knew that the war already was coming to an end, because the Russian were very close, and a week before the Russian came in, all the Romanian authorities took off.</span> <span id="s1398">The Germans stayed, but the Romanians took off.</span> <span id="s1399">The Germans took over the city.</span> <span id="s1400">Then started another chapter of terror.</span> <span id="s1401">What they did, they killed a lot in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1402">They did their own deed.</span> <span id="s1403">Those who lived in scattered houses like we were--they didn’t have any lists or addresses--they just went by what non-Jews were telling them.</span> <span id="s1404">There is a living a Jewish family, there is living a Jewish family, and so on.</span> <span id="s1405">But we were prepared for the day that we were liberated by the Russian.</span> <span id="s1406">Then we saw some American planes flying over, and we knew that the war was very close to the end, and we were waiting for the victory day, Liberation Day, and this happened in March when the Russian came in.</span> <span id="s1407">I remember two days before that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">NL: Now, Mr. Snyder, do you recall any other episodes or events, or developments in the ghetto, before the Russian came that you might want to record?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">NS: Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s1411">Going back to the ghetto life, in the city of Czernowitz from the year 1941 until 1943, I’m sorry 1944, when the Russian liberated us, when all of the Jews were driven from the surroundings--Czernowitz was the main city in North Bukovina--and when the Jews were driven from all the surrounding little towns and villages, those who survived, on their way to the concentration camps in Transnistria, they were first deposited or gathered together in the ghetto, those Jews that came from surrounding, they came absolutely with nothing as far as money or clothing.</span> <span id="s1412">They were just escaped with their bare life, but the Jews who were right from Czernowitz, from the city which I mentioned before--there were a big Jewish population there, they had a chance to take some of their belongings like jewelry or clothing which they later exchanged with the non-Jews, with the Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">NL: Excuse me, and also gold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">NS: Gold, naturally, and clothing and furs and so on, so they could survive that horrible times in the ghetto, because the authorities never supplied any food.</span> <span id="s1415">The Romanians, forget about the Germans, but the Romanian authorities never supplied any food, so the only food which was in exchange for goods with the non-Jewish, with the Christians from outside the ghetto, and the exchange was done that in a way illegal, at night time through the barbed wires or the certain days the certain hours that the non-Jewish were permitted to get into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">NL: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">NS: Yes, they could get into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">NL: For purposes of trading?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">NS: Trading or just to visit and see how the Jews--it was a tragic comedy to see how the Jews lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">NL: The Germans set this up, or the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">NS: I’m not sure, but I think the Romania authorities.</span> <span id="s1422">They ruled actually, the Romanian authorities ruled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">NL: And these visitors came really to mock, or did some show some sympathy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">NS: Very few but some showed sympathy, that’s true, but mostly they came to mock you, yes.</span> <span id="s1425">The Jews, how they lived together, herded together in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1426">They knew the destiny.</span> <span id="s1427">We didn’t.</span> <span id="s1428">They knew exactly what will happen to the Jews because apparently, in their speeches or in their propaganda their aim was the destruction of the Jews, but we were not aware of that, our fate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">NL: Excuse me, what did the Romanians exchange for the gold and clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">NS: Flour, dried fat, eggs, milk for the children.</span> <span id="s1431">Very few I know that got meat, chicken, sometimes, fruit, dried fruit, and fresh vegetables.</span> <span id="s1432">After all, people had to survive, they couldn’t survive just on air.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">NL: And now the question is, did only the wealthy Jews who had the jewelry and gold benefit, or was this produce distributed among other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">NS: In some cases it was distributed among the other Jews but some of the Jews who really received that didn’t have a chance to really enjoy it, because you never knew when is your day that you will be deported.</span> <span id="s1435">Like, the lists were prepared and the next day the lists were issued, and Jews had to report to a certain gathering place where they were driven to the main railroad station which was outside the ghetto, and they were herded into cattle cars and away they went.</span> <span id="s1436">[inaudible – Mrs. Snyder talking]</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">NL: Were there any soup kitchens, for instance, for the poorer Jews in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">NS: Yes, there were soup kitchens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">NL: Who organized those?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">NS: The Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">NL: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">NS: Yes, the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1443">It was called in Yiddish the Jewish kehillah, Yiddishe kehillah, which organized--also prepared food packages like dried bread and some sugar and some other provisions for those who were deported to the long journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">NL: To Transnistria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">NS: To Transnistria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">NL: Were you getting any organized help from so-called Old Romania?</span> <span id="s1447">Was the ghetto getting any?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1449">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1450">The connection with the Jews in Old Romania was completely cut.</span> <span id="s1451">We didn’t have any connection whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">NL: How about with Bessarabia?</span> <span id="s1453">Any connections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">NS: Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s1455">The Jews from Bessarabia, I understand they were deported direct from Bessarabia and most of them were massacred and the rest were transported to Transnistria before.</span> <span id="s1456">[Mrs. Snyder requested that we stop for a pause.]</span> <span id="s1457">The Jews from Bessarabia were all deported to Transnistria before the Jews from Bukovina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">NL: And you had no contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">NS: No contact whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1460">As a matter of fact, we had no contact with any Jews from other parts of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">NL: Mr. Snyder, do you recall your mother or any other adult speaking about the kehillah either negatively or positively?</span> <span id="s1462">In some ghettos, you of course, know that there was a lot of criticism.</span> <span id="s1463">[unclear]</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">NS: That is true, and the criticism was valid because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">NL: In Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">NS: Yes, the Jewish Kultusgemeinde [Jewish Community Organization] was actually formed with approval of Romanian authorities and there was prominent Jews and Jews who had the insight to the authorities or connections and so on, and supposedly they were the ones who were preparing the lists of the Jews who supposed to be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">NL: To Transnistria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">NS: To Transnistria.</span> <span id="s1469">The Romanian authorities did not go by the lists only those supplied by the community.</span> <span id="s1470">In other words, they were demanding, they want 1500 Jews by Monday morning at 10 o’clock to be ready, so the list was prepared with the names of whole families or singles or so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">NL: On what basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">NS: On what basis I do not know, but they were preparing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">NL: But you also, I think, you also said that non-Jews would point to Jews and Jews were picked up that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">NS: No, there was no sense of pointing because Jews would gather together in the ghetto anyway.</span> <span id="s1475">They were all together in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1476">It was before the ghetto they were pointing where the Jews are so they could be gathered together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">NL: But once in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">NS: Once in the ghetto they were under one umbrella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">NL: There the kehillah drew up lists for deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">NS: For deportation.</span> <span id="s1481">Those were essential for the government, like I said professionals, like doctors or engineers or skilled workers, they were left for a later date.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">NL: So, your feeling is that the kehillah members protected themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">NS: Oh sure, as a matter of fact, I understand there were instances that by having money, what we call today, bribe, which is an ugly word--you could survive another six or three months or so on.</span> <span id="s1484">Actually that bribe was supposed to go to the Romanian authorities, because the Romanians are known through history for bakshish [a gift or gratuity] which comes from the Turkish language because Turks ruled not only in Romania, but in the part of southern Europe for centuries, so that word--bakshish was very common.</span> <span id="s1485">In Romania not that you had to offer, but sometimes it was requested, bakshish.</span> <span id="s1486">A lot of Jews actually survived on that word bakshish, by bribing authorities and by sheer luck they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">NL: Were there any non-official groups, for instance, Zionist groups or socialist groups in the ghetto that opposed the policies of the kehillah and/or organized programs of their own, soup kitchens and such?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">NS: I was too young and I was not aware of it.</span> <span id="s1489">It could be that there was some opposition, but in the ghetto you had all kinds of organizations.</span> <span id="s1490">You had Zionist movements, you also had Communist movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">NL: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">NS: In the ghetto, and because in desperation people are apt to cling on anything.</span> <span id="s1493">There were all kinds of movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">NL: And, they held meetings, these groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">NS: Yes, they had meetings and they were trying to encourage people to just have faith and so on.</span> <span id="s1496">There were even rumors that outside Czernowitz, in the woods, there are Russian partisans organized with Jewish partisans together fighting the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">NL: But you weren’t aware of any youths within the ghetto who were trying to escape to the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">NS: No.</span> <span id="s1499">No.</span> <span id="s1500">There were even later, there were rumors that there were some illegal from Palestine, underground, illegal emissaries dropped with parachutes who were trying to help Jews escape, but where are you going to escape?</span> <span id="s1501">All the doors and gates were locked from Europe, so escape was an Utopia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">NL: You had mentioned before some secret radio listening.</span> <span id="s1503">Could you speak about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1505">Yes, most of the Jews had short-wave radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">NL: Most?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">NS: Not most, I am sorry, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">NL: A goodly number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">NS: If they had a radio, a short wave radios were used.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">NL: Those radios were not confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">NS: Well, if you were caught with a short-wave radio, the sentence was death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">NL: By the Romanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">NS: By the Germans or the Romanians, so there was a big risk to it, but everybody took the risk on their own and used that radio with the outside world, which they usually listened to B.B.C., which was also transmitted in German language from England, from London.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s1515">So you had some news.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">NS: So, they knew exactly what was going on the Russian front or on the Western front.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">NL: Were there any newspapers in the ghetto, as far as you know?</span> <span id="s1518">How was this news spread?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">NS: I think there were some bulletins--but not newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">NL: Were the Communists agitating for a Russian victory as far as you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">NS: Yes, naturally, the Communists were agitating for Russian victory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">NL: Can you remember approximately when you had the sense that the Romanian government was shifting to a pro-Allied or anti-German orientation, or sensed that they were worried about Allied bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">NS: That didn’t happen until six months before the Russian actually entered our region.</span> <span id="s1524">That shift happened after the Stalingrad affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">NL: February, 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">NS: In 1943, when they were defeated and so many hundred of thousands of Romanians fell prisoners to the Russian and the Germans and they were defeated--the entire world knew that--and we knew it too by radio.</span> <span id="s1527">At that time the Romanians got scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">NL: Was this reflected in the behavior of the Romanians in Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">NS: A little bit, not too much.</span> <span id="s1530">At that time I was out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">NL: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">NS: Like I mentioned in the previous conversation, interview, that my uncle was essential for the government as engineer, textile, so he was allowed to leave the ghetto, not too far, just a block and a half in a place where we lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">NL: But Mother was still in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">NS: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">NL: She came with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">NS: It was my uncle and his brother and his wife, and naturally, my aunt took her sister as a dependent, with me and two orphans, because we were, my sister and myself, and we lived under one roof.</span> <span id="s1537">We had one room, with a small kitchen the size of a telephone booth, and we lived there, which was not too far from the ghetto and with the permission of the, with a permit of the Romanian government which kept an eye on us, and with restrictions, a curfew.</span> <span id="s1538">You couldn’t walk outside the house except from eight o’clock in the morning until about five and after that it was curfew, and you couldn’t shop in certain--shopping was done only after the non-Jews finished their shopping: the Jews could go in and shop.</span> <span id="s1539">Certain stores you couldn’t go in.</span> <span id="s1540">You couldn’t walk on the pavement.</span> <span id="s1541">You had to walk in the middle of the street.</span> <span id="s1542">Naturally, if you were caught wearing, not wearing the Jewish star, which was very visible, you could be shot on the spot, so no one took the risk of not wearing it.</span> <span id="s1543">The Jewish star was worn on the left lapel and also on the arm band so it’s very obvious that an individual walking in the middle of the road with horses and carriages which only used that middle of the road, usually human beings walking on the pavement, the only walking in the middle of the road together with the horses and carriages were the Jews.</span> <span id="s1544">Those few, not too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">NL: I was going to ask if there was a considerable number who were allowed to live outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">NS: Yes, those who were essential for the government, professional or skilled workers, like special mechanics, engineers, and architects, doctors, pharmacists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">NL: And what was your sister doing at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">NS: My sister was much younger, like me, and we lived together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">NL: She wasn’t in school, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">NS: No.</span> <span id="s1551">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">NL: She just stayed at home with your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">NS: Yes, we stayed together and waited for the day of victory which occurred later in 1944, but in the meantime we heard horror stories coming back from Transnistria because, like I mentioned before, there were some Romanian soldiers who came back from the front, from the battlefront, the Russian battlefront, which I would say succeeded only in 30% out of a hundred because sometimes a package sent to the loved ones or to families never arrived, but sometimes they did arrive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">NL: Did any of the soldiers that you know of or knew of speak about the German defeat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">NS: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">NL: Or, did you know that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">NS: They never spoke.</span> <span id="s1558">As a matter of fact, I think that some of the soldiers found themselves in glory that they will be joining those glorious German troops who ruled the entire world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">NL: But after Stalingrad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">NS: After Stalingrad they were actually bowed with their head down because of fear, not else, of fear because the reprisals of the Allies, mostly the Russian, what will they do when they come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">NL: So, after Stalingrad, you perceive...</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">NS: The wind has shifted.</span> <span id="s1563">Then we knew that victory is close.</span> <span id="s1564">We didn’t know when, but we were also afraid that not too many will survive that day of victory, of liberation because in the ghetto, in the meantime, in 1943, end of ‘43, the ghetto almost emptied, was empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">NL: All had been deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">NS: Deported.</span> <span id="s1567">The ghetto in the end of 1943, the ghetto was dissolved.</span> <span id="s1568">The barbed wire and all the gates and so on were taken down.</span> <span id="s1569">What remained from that section I do not know, but those few hundreds of Jews who succeeded in staying, in living outside the ghetto were under constant fear and under constant pressure and under control.</span> <span id="s1570">They had to produce, like my uncle, who was a textile engineer, and made a meager living from day to day and with constant fear.</span> <span id="s1571">There was some also--my mother was very productive and she did some exchange of produce and things with the non-Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">NL: Which helped you survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">NS: Yes, it helped us survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">NL: I understand that toward the end of ‘43, early ‘44, there were contacts between the Romanian government and an American representative named Ira Hirschmann.</span> <span id="s1575">Does that name mean anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">NS: Maybe the Romanian government in the deep south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">NL: Old Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">NS: Old Romania, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">NL: And, as a consequence, Antonescu permitted some of the inmates in Transnistria to return to Romania, but this didn’t happen in Czernowitz apparently and you didn’t know what happened to the last groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">NS: No, maybe it happened to the Jews from Old Romania because like I mentioned before, there were some Jews in some cities or villages from the Old Romania who were also deported, not all of them.</span> <span id="s1581">So it could be those from Old Romania.</span> <span id="s1582">You must understand that we from North Bukovina--who were under Russian occupation for one year, from 1940 to ‘41, were considered Bolsheviks, enemies of civilization, spies, undesirables, and destined for extermination because we did not invite the Russian in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">NL: But you were tagged with that label.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">NS: We were tagged as Bolsheviks.</span> <span id="s1585">The Romanian Jews from the Old Romania, they are not under the same umbrella.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">NL: It’s an important point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">NS: Very important point.</span> <span id="s1588">That’s the reason so many survived from them and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">NL: Not from Bukovina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">NS: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1591">Bukovina, Bessarabia were destined to be exterminated, to the last.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">NL: Now, when did the first Russian troops first come into Czernovitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">NS: Getting back to the ghetto, excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">NS: I remember instances that people were trying during the night or sometimes during the day, if they had courage, to crawl under the barbed wire by digging into the ground, into the earth, and they were shot right there and then because they got caught.</span> <span id="s1596">The Romanian used to patrol around the barbed wire, which was miles and miles and miles, a whole quarter of the city, but they didn’t have posted, stationed sentries.</span> <span id="s1597">But if they got caught or by the Germans, they got shot because that was the order of the day.</span> <span id="s1598">They took the risk in their own hand and you know for instances that they were brought back, the bodies were brought back and said they were shot by the barbed wires.</span> <span id="s1599">They got caught, so there was a risk, but with all this risk I adventured many times.</span> <span id="s1600">I and my friends my age and we used to crawl, we had a special spot under the barbed wire near a tree where we used to crawl out on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">NS: At night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">NS: Yes, like from the dark side to the light side,--no, during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">NL: And there were no guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">NS: We watched for the guards because we had lookouts, and we used to walk out on the other side, take off our red, I’m sorry, our yellow star and posing as non-Jews and sometime mingling with the population on the street.</span> <span id="s1605">I even have a picture today with a friend of mine parading in one of the biggest, nicest boulevards, like we say here Chestnut Street, or Walnut Street, where I am parading with him on the street taking a stroll out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1606">And one danger was that they would close up the streets and ask for the papers and if they did, I wouldn’t have any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">NL: And you did this many times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">NS: Many times, not only me but a couple, we were daring young boys, we didn’t realize that so close death was or what danger is because you understand we went through so much in our lives that maybe life didn’t have any meaning or it was stupidity, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">NL: Besides that one time that you were stopped at the movie, were there any other times when you were stopped when the Romanians or Germans checked your papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">NS: Several times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">NL: And how did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">NS: As a matter of fact most of the stopping, the razzias were done by the Germans with the help of the Romanians.</span> <span id="s1613">The Germans were the masters, even where the Romanian authorities ruled and the Germans didn’t have too many troops there so they, the Romanians were assisting them.</span> <span id="s1614">Many times I was stopped, but I could wiggle myself out by speaking German language, by lying to them or smiling to them straight to their face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">NL: Or bribing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">NS: No bribing, God forbid, bribe was, you sentenced yourself to die, their pride would not allow them to take any bribe even if they want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">NS: Just by bluffing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">NL: Where did you learn such expert German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">NS: From the little town that I come from, Unter Stanestie we spoke German.</span> <span id="s1621">The Jews spoke German, 90% of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">NL: Not Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">NS: Only 10% Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1624">In cheder we spoke Yiddish, but at home my mother language is German.</span> <span id="s1625">As a matter of fact, I spoke German with my mother and sister ‘till three months ago when my mother passed away.</span> <span id="s1626">All my correspondence, all the letters I have is in German.</span> <span id="s1627">Today when I converse with my sister on the telephone it is in German.</span> <span id="s1628">German language was our mother language.</span> <span id="s1629">Also when I was very young in pre-school I went to kindergarten in a German Schwabendorf and we learned Gothish language.</span> <span id="s1630">It means Old German, straight up and down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">NL: So this came in handy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">NS: Yes, I used to go to the German Schwäbishe [kindergarten] and I learned German with Old Gothish [Gothic] alphabet and German was spoken in our home so I was speaking German very fluently which I speak today, today maybe I have a little accent but I could always smart myself out or fool them out with my German, insisting that I am a Volksdeutsche, because any German who lived outside Germany was considered a Volksdeutsche and there were many Germans who lived in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungaria, Romania, even in Russia they had Volksdeutsche, all over the world.</span> <span id="s1633">So they were considered Volkdeutsche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">NL: Besides these strolls along this street and occasionally going to a movie do you remember any other adventures that you had?</span> <span id="s1635">Did you go into cafes or coffee houses for a snack or was it just to walk and feel free?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">NS: To walk and feel free and feel freedom which was a forbidden freedom.</span> <span id="s1637">Naturally when we used to meet with our friends, like I mentioned we had a non-Jewish friend whose father was an officer and his mother was Jewish and he was our best friend.</span> <span id="s1638">We swore friendships between us and we trusted him.</span> <span id="s1639">He never betrayed us, and he was telling us that the Germans and the Romanians are getting slowly defeated on the Russian front because he knew about the wounded troops that are coming back from there with all those horror stories.</span> <span id="s1640">He also told us about a lot of Jews who were destroyed in Russia on their way; the troops with heroic stories telling the folks back home what happened to the Jews in Russia on their way on their goal through Moscow advancing in Russian territory.</span> <span id="s1641">In other words, they were telling the cowardly heroic stories show Jews were massacred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">NL: Where was his father do you know, Mr. Snyder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">NS: His father was stationed in Chernovitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">NL: But, he obviously got news from the eastern front or there were radio reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">NS: His father knew that he had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">NL: But I mean the stories of the Romania and German defeat, his father certainly knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">NS: Naturally, yes.</span> <span id="s1648">There are many other episodes which I do not recall now in ghetto but life was going on and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">NL: But the ghetto was being reduced until it was finally...</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">NS: It was being reduced because the faces that you see today you haven’t seen the next day and you ask what happened to him and they say oh, he’s on his way to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">NL: And so...</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">NL: So, do you recall the approximate date when the Russian came into Chernovitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">NS: I have another episode which I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">NL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">NS: As far as immigration to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">NL: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">NS: In 1943, in fall of 1943, there was a movement organized, I think, from outside, from overseas.</span> <span id="s1659">It could be from governments, from Zionist movements in the world--with a lot of money to bribe the Romanian government to let, especially youngsters, young people out.</span> <span id="s1660">We called it Aliyat ha-Noar, and together also families even during the war, ‘43 was in the middle of the war--The payment was very high and not too many families could afford it, and it was a movement which first of all, people didn’t trust but then later they got news that some did arrive to destination.</span> <span id="s1661">The rule is as follows: You had to get permission from the government and you were on a special list and you got special traveling papers and you traveled to Constanta which was a port on the Black Sea and there were ships provided by the movement organizations--I’m sorry by Zionist organizations, which was illegal because the British did not allow the Jews to get into Israel and one of those unfortunate ships was the Struma, it sunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">NL: You knew about that, or you heard about it later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">NS: I heard it later, we didn’t know nothing about what happened to the Struma, but we knew that some of the ships went through and the Struma was one of them who was sunk.</span> <span id="s1664">And I understand that we even tried to formalize and arrange our departure from there but it was impossible because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">NL: Too costly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">NS: Too costly and we didn’t have direct contact with the Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">NL: Did you know any young people who did succeed in making the contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">NS: I know people who left at that time and it was mostly young people actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">NL: I think this is all described in a book that you know about called The Last Escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">NS: No, I did not read that book.</span> <span id="s1671">I don't know if the Germans knew about it or the Romanians did it on their own or whatever it was but it wasn’t advertised in the radio or newspaper but it was like a secret movement which was on the side streets.</span> <span id="s1672">Money had to be paid to different middlemen, and you were on a special list and sometimes you gave the money and you never succeeded because you were swindled out of that, but there was an aim to escape.</span> <span id="s1673">You don't care where but just escape.</span> <span id="s1674">We had a relative in Switzerland; my mother had a step-brother who lived in Switzerland, a step-brother or a cousin, I am sorry, a cousin.</span> <span id="s1675">Switzerland was neutral so we tried to communicate through the Red Cross for help so that maybe we can get some packages of food or clothing, and we did succeed to send the Red Cross a letter, and we got from them on many occasions, we got from them, from Switzerland sent through the Red Cross some packages of food and clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">NL: Interesting.</span> <span id="s1677">That’s the first I’ve heard of something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">NS: Yes, from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1679">But, we even tried, which was an idea, also an Utopia, maybe we could leave for Switzerland, but it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1680">In our dream, we thought that any escape would do good to us.</span> <span id="s1681">That is the episode I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s1683">I am glad you mentioned it because there was an official negotiation with Antonescu about departure for Palestine, and some Jews did succeed.</span> <span id="s1684">I will mention the book a little later.</span> <span id="s1685">Now, would you like to come to the Russian segment?</span> <span id="s1686">Of course if you think of anything else in the past we can always incorporate that.</span> <span id="s1687">So, it was when, early ‘44 that the Russian first came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">NS: Before the Russian came in, the Romanian troops were on edge.</span> <span id="s1689">The Romanian authorities and whatever Romanian troops were left, but they retreated; we knew that the reason why they retreated because there was fear of the Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">NL: Would this be late ‘43 or early ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">NS: That was early ’44.</span> <span id="s1692">So more Romanians left.</span> <span id="s1693">Their place was taken by Germans and that was our biggest fear, because when the Germans take over, we knew that comes the total destruction.</span> <span id="s1694">Naturally, under the Romanian we were more safer than under the Germans, but the Germans took the place of the Romanian which left, and not only they left the troops, but there were a lot of families who came officers of state and government officials who lived with their families and they just evacuated to the Old Romania; didn’t want to stay there while the Russian were advancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">NL: And the Germans, these were army units or SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">NS: SS and Gestapo and they start to patrol the streets more frequently and you see more Germans like Romanians.</span> <span id="s1697">Now, like I mentioned before, there were some Jews who were living in different sections of the city, but they were not known to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1698">The Romanian authorities were aware of that, but I don't think the Romanian authorities gave them exactly the addresses which was a risk too.</span> <span id="s1699">So the Germans were not sure how many are outside left and how many are living in hiding.</span> <span id="s1700">So that was a risk, that is fate, destiny.</span> <span id="s1701">So in the beginning of 1944, more and more Germans appeared on the streets.</span> <span id="s1702">Stores and government buildings and offices were closed, and we actually dared using our radio to the BBC, and even we caught a couple times the “Voice of America” in the Romanian or in German language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">NL: Was your uncle still working for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">NS: Yes, he was working for the same factory.</span> <span id="s1705">That factory had to put output for the troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">NL: So, you were getting news.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">NS: We knew about Stalingrad, that was defeated, and the Russian were advancing closer and closer; we knew exactly.</span> <span id="s1708">My uncle was a strategist or a military buff because in the First World War when he was in the Austrian-Hungarian army, he was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s1709">He was three and a half to four years a prisoner in Russia so he knew the whole sections, from Kiev and Kharkov, and so on.</span> <span id="s1710">We followed exactly the map, where the Russian are advancing and where the German are retreating and where the battles are taking place and some of the cities were taken two or three times, occupied back and forth, back and forth but we knew that the Russian are retreating slowly and we knew by their retreat, they will destroy all the evidence behind them.</span> <span id="s1711">The Germans, I mean, so we were in constant fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">NL: Did the German police, the SS, actually seize some Jews during this time?</span> <span id="s1713">Did they take them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">NS: Yes, when they found out where any Jews were living, they were taken away.</span> <span id="s1715">Where they were taken away or how they disappeared, no one knows because I don't think anybody had the courage to go to investigate.</span> <span id="s1716">I think that even some of the members from the Jewish community were deported, and that fell apart.</span> <span id="s1717">So, he became a stateless no-man’s land, the city of Czernowitz, which is a big city and that was our luck.</span> <span id="s1718">In a small town we could not hide out and survive.</span> <span id="s1719">We had all the non-Jewish living there.</span> <span id="s1720">Some of the non-Jewish knew that we are Jews and that we are living there.</span> <span id="s1721">As a matter of fact, in the same house that we lived, it was an apartment house there was what we called the administrator of that apartment house, was a non-Jewish young lady who was the house-meister, what you call that house-meister, house administrator, was taking care of the apartment.</span> <span id="s1722">She blackmailed us that if we don't give her certain things, she is going to denounce us, so we used to always give her and more we gave, more she demanded, and she had a boyfriend who was a Romanian officer who used to come back and forth from the front to visit her, and one day we had a confrontation that he personally came in and demanded that we should give him a couple fur coats which my uncle had personally hidden, and money and some jewelry, whatever is left.</span> <span id="s1723">If not he will denounce us to the German government.</span> <span id="s1724">So, we gave him but he never actually brought the Germans.</span> <span id="s1725">It was more like a blackmail, and he didn’t do that because of good conscious.</span> <span id="s1726">He was scared too and she was scared because if the Russian will come in, what would happen to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">NL: You could then denounce them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">NS: That’s exactly.</span> <span id="s1729">In a friendly way, yes.</span> <span id="s1730">The existence was very poor.</span> <span id="s1731">We were living from scraps; food was not available and we used to live from dried bread, which was cut in small pieces and then baked in the oven as hot biscuits which could stay for a long time, preserve for a long time and we used to have ration.</span> <span id="s1732">We used to have so many pieces a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">NL: That was your total.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">NS: We used to eat beans and bread and onions and garlic and we lived from that; we didn’t have any other, no meat, no eggs, no milk.</span> <span id="s1735">We just survived from day to day from the poor food we got scrapped together from back and forth.</span> <span id="s1736">In March of 1944, the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s1737">I don't recall the date but it must have been the 15th or the 16th of March.</span> <span id="s1738">A big part of the city became a ghost town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">NL: The Germans left, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">NS: The German troops left but not the SS.</span> <span id="s1741">The SS took over the whole city, and I remember why they were the SS.</span> <span id="s1742">They were in black uniforms and they had that skull on their heads and they were patrolling in those small jeeps and armored trucks throughout the city.</span> <span id="s1743">In the apartment house where I lived, we lived, there was a big court-yard and one day three armored trucks and a jeep came into our yard.</span> <span id="s1744">They parked in our yard; we looked up from the window and in our house we also had a basement.</span> <span id="s1745">Most of the basements there were also protection during the war against bombs so it was like a shelter and you had a small little window just for a lookout and we were hidden all in the basement and we looked out, and here they are parked in our yard.</span> <span id="s1746">We figured it doesn’t make sense to stay there; we have to make contact, so I walked out and I start a conversation with them and they did not know that I am Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">NL: What did you say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1749">I just came out and I said, “We would like to say we are Volksdeutsche.”</span> <span id="s1750">I remember they had biscuits and chocolates and they were looking for schnapps which was very scarce.</span> <span id="s1751">My mother had some regular rubbing alcohol, which we knew that this is a scarce product.</span> <span id="s1752">During the war, any troops, you can exchange that for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">NL: Plain alcohol?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">NS: Plain alcohol, which we had it several bottles in the house and we mixed that with kimmel.</span> <span id="s1755">Kimmel is what would you call that?</span> <span id="s1756">Caraway seeds, and we made from one bottle of 100-proof alcohol, we made like four or five bottles of schnapps, and so I went out to the soldiers who were lingering around, and I told them would they like to have a bottle of schnapps for some food.</span> <span id="s1757">Also, the electricity didn’t exist because electricity was cut off so the only way of lightning, we used petroleum naphtha.</span> <span id="s1758">They also had those half tanks.</span> <span id="s1759">They had diesel motors and they had naphtha.</span> <span id="s1760">So we tried to get a couple liter of naphtha for lighting the candles, so, I made an exchange with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">NL: They agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">NS: And, I made a conversation with a young German, and I didn’t realize that he was an Austrian and he was telling me that he wasn’t SS, but he was telling me that he knows the war is coming to an end but he is innocent.</span> <span id="s1763">He said, “I didn’t want that war.</span> <span id="s1764">I am from Austria, I have a wife and two kids and I don't want to fight in this war, but they forced me to get into it.</span> <span id="s1765">He didn’t know I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1766">I had a conversation with him like on a side.</span> <span id="s1767">It wasn’t an obvious conversation, just privately, as a young boy I was discussing with him; he didn’t know that I am Jewish and we made that exchange.</span> <span id="s1768">As a matter of fact, we have a couple laughs and a couple jokes, and I took the things necessary for us.</span> <span id="s1769">That we had the biscuits and the chocolate and that naphtha or petroleum for the alcohol, the schnapps.</span> <span id="s1770">Because schnapps they didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">NL: Your mother didn’t try to hold you back, Mr. Snyder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">NS: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1773">I was very adventurous like I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">NL: She must have been terrified.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">NS: Yes, but she was very glad when I came in with that what I obtained from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">NL: They didn’t enter the apartment then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">NS: No.</span> <span id="s1778">No, because it doesn’t a direct entrance.</span> <span id="s1779">I had to go like over a fence and then back-track myself so they didn’t know exactly from where I am coming.</span> <span id="s1780">They didn’t know I was from the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">NL: Were there other Jewish families in that complex?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">NS: No.</span> <span id="s1783">Us but there were some others about three or four houses away.</span> <span id="s1784">We knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">NL: These men were no longer interested in seizing Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">NS: They were interested in saving their own hide.</span> <span id="s1787">He told me that, “Hitler is kaput; the war is kaput.</span> <span id="s1788">The Bolsheviks are coming, and they are going to pay back what we did to them, they are going to pay back to us.”</span> <span id="s1789">He was concerned for his family in Austria.</span> <span id="s1790">So, he was telling me, “You can run, don't stay here because you know what will happen to you.”</span> <span id="s1791">And I told him, “I only have a sick mother and I don't have my family.”</span> <span id="s1792">I said that my father is some place in the war, and I told him I am a Volksdeutsche and he was taken away to the war and I don't even know where he is, and he said, “You better take off as soon as possible.”</span> <span id="s1793">As a matter of fact he even offered me a ride with him.</span> <span id="s1794">If I want to come with him.</span> <span id="s1795">I says, “Oh yes we won’t stay here; in the next 24 hours, we will also go we will leave.”</span> <span id="s1796">So, a nice conversation with him, and after about two days they left.</span> <span id="s1797">While they were there, no one dared come out from the house.</span> <span id="s1798">I was the only one which I came out for like I said, sidetracked myself.</span> <span id="s1799">That helped us a lot-those biscuits and chocolates and they also gave us some cans.</span> <span id="s1800">If I can remember with some, it looked like dog food, but it was rations in cans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">NL: K rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">NS: K rations.</span> <span id="s1803">It was a mixture of rice and meat and something like that.</span> <span id="s1804">That helped us a lot because we haven’t have that for a long time.</span> <span id="s1805">In a way, I felt bad for them because they were scared; they were very, very scared and two days later, they just took off and left.</span> <span id="s1806">But the funniest thing is, the irony of that is that he apologized to me that he didn’t want that war, that he was forced into the war because he is an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1807">The name Austrian means you are not so guilty like the Germans; it means that you are more innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">NL: A bubba meise.</span> <span id="s1809">They were looking for rationalization .</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">NS: Yes, rationalization, had a guilty conscience.</span> <span id="s1811">No one forced them to go to the SS; but I understand that to the SS you had to volunteer.</span> <span id="s1812">No one forced them on gunpoint to join the SS.</span> <span id="s1813">I never asked him about his adventures, but naturally he came through from Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1814">Who knows how many Jews and how many non-Jews were killed by the SS; how much he has on his conscious, but that is another story.</span> <span id="s1815">Our only aim was to survive, so as it came near, we didn’t know when but we actually heard already the battle not too far, the noise of the battle, the artillery close in.</span> <span id="s1816">We were not too far from a big river which is called the Prut and by rumors we found out that the Russian were on the other side, and the Germans were defending in their retreat on this side and there were two large bridges.</span> <span id="s1817">One was a railroad bridge and one was a regular bridge.</span> <span id="s1818">Twenty four hours before that the Russian entering, we heard a loud explosion.</span> <span id="s1819">The Germans blew up both bridges and then we heard the artillery in a rapid motion.</span> <span id="s1820">Actually we didn’t realize that they were the Katyushas.</span> <span id="s1821">We called the “Rocket”.</span> <span id="s1822">It was like a boom, boom, boom, boom.</span> <span id="s1823">It was not just the regular artillery.</span> <span id="s1824">The Russian had their own forces and they were pumping them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">The Germans were in full retreat, so about twenty four hours prior to that, the city was totally deserted.</span> <span id="s1826">You haven’t seen a soul on the street.</span> <span id="s1827">Every one was locked in, even the non-Jews were locked into their houses and the only one who you could see on the streets when you looked out, we saw were the German SS patrolling in their jeeps in two or four or in those half-trucks back and forth throughout the city.</span> <span id="s1828">A day or twelve hours prior to the Russian entering, it was the last day of the German occupation and they moved around with loud speakers and we hear the loudspeakers and we were curious to know what they are saying.</span> <span id="s1829">They were saying in German: “Population, we are going to blow up the warehouse which is located by the railroad.”</span> <span id="s1830">[The railroad was a mile from the footbridge to the river].</span> <span id="s1831">“We don’t want to leave the Bolsheviks absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1832">So it’s open, if you want to plunder, take anything you want, come the warehouses is open, take as much as you can.</span> <span id="s1833">The more you take, the less there is for the Russian.</span> <span id="s1834">For the Bolsheviks.”</span> <span id="s1835">And this was going on for hours with loud speakers throughout the whole neighborhood and all along the streets.</span> <span id="s1836">So when I heard that I figured this is the best occasion to do that.</span> <span id="s1837">My mother objected to that.</span> <span id="s1838">And my uncle objected to that.</span> <span id="s1839">He said, “You are foolish, stupid for doing that.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">NL: They thought it was a trick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">NS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">NL: They just knew that you would be in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">NS: In danger to go and I said, “I must go because I have a friend.”</span> <span id="s1844">As a matter of fact, no, I don't have a friend, I’m sorry, that friend which was I lost contact with and because of the curfew, I didn’t know exactly where his is; he lived in the other part of the city.</span> <span id="s1845">So, I did go, and I said, “I must because even the Russian come in, we won’t have any food, the war still goes on.”</span> <span id="s1846">So, I went out.</span> <span id="s1847">I snuck out from the house.</span> <span id="s1848">Naturally I was dressed in white socks and black short pants, and a crew cut and I spoke good German so I was a Volksdeutsche, and as I was going down, there was a hill down to the, from where I lived I would say about a mile and a half going, or two miles to that railroad main station which all the warehouses are located.</span> <span id="s1849">And as I was going down, I seen population, non-Jews, women and men and youngsters from each corners they are coming to get whatever they can.</span> <span id="s1850">The Germans said, “It is free, come and take it, come and get it.”</span> <span id="s1851">Naturally I went down.</span> <span id="s1852">So, in that commotion I came down and I seen the SS troops standing over there opening all of the warehouses.</span> <span id="s1853">And they say, “Take it, don’t leave for the Bolsheviks, take what you can.”</span> <span id="s1854">And in that commotion I did not know, I was like too much confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">So some people went in and had taken like say whole bales of linen like for suits, or linen for sheets or for clothing, valuable leather and some other things.</span> <span id="s1856">I don't think there was any food left; the food the Germans needed.</span> <span id="s1857">There was mostly produce – not produce goods.</span> <span id="s1858">And I, that warehouse I walked in.</span> <span id="s1859">There were shoes for the shoe department, shoes, shoes.</span> <span id="s1860">I grabbed two big bags [the Germans supplied you bags, big bags like army duffel bags] but big ones.</span> <span id="s1861">The bag was bigger like me, and I start stuffing in.</span> <span id="s1862">I didn’t realize I was stuffing in shoes almost lefts, from each shoe.</span> <span id="s1863">I was in such commotion.</span> <span id="s1864">The people were coming in, it was like a circus.</span> <span id="s1865">They were grabbing and I took about a dozen shoes that were all lefts.</span> <span id="s1866">It is funny but tragic.</span> <span id="s1867">And the hats I took from boxes and stuffed them in.</span> <span id="s1868">Then the most valuable which I actually took was yarn for shoemakers, waxed yarn.</span> <span id="s1869">We lived on that after that for six months.</span> <span id="s1870">I stuffed in as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1871">Also, in olden times they used for heavy boots and for heavy shoes, they used horseshoe, metal horseshoe to protect the heels, so I grabbed.</span> <span id="s1872">It was heavy.</span> <span id="s1873">I grabbed a couple boxes and emptied it in my bag.</span> <span id="s1874">Also, I took some bales of linen.</span> <span id="s1875">It wasn’t linen, I’m sorry, it was silk.</span> <span id="s1876">I didn’t realize silk, and because it was so clumsy in that long roll, so I unrolled it and stuffed it in, as much as I could, and I figured I only can get two.</span> <span id="s1877">Near me was another guy who was a non-Jew, who was Ukrainian, but a local from Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s1878">He was doing the same thing, so we were both taking nonsense but we were stuffing.</span> <span id="s1879">And I looked outside and I see that people are going.</span> <span id="s1880">And it is unbelievable, people are mad, dragging things.</span> <span id="s1881">And then came the loudspeaker that says “You have one more hour because we are going to blow them up; that’s it.</span> <span id="s1882">You don't have too much time, we will blow them up one hour.”</span> <span id="s1883">The dynamite was already put under those warehouses; they just have to lit a fuse.</span> <span id="s1884">I said, More, more, more, more.”</span> <span id="s1885">So finally, I and that unknown stranger who was my age, I the Jew and he the non-Jew became friends.</span> <span id="s1886">And in our walking together out from there he said, “You are Jewish” and I said, “Yes, I am Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1887">He says “Well, in short while we will both be liberated.”</span> <span id="s1888">This is what he was telling me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">NL: What made him say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">NS: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1891">I trusted him because I figured he is in the same boat with me and through stupidity I said, “Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s1892">I had some trust because he was my age and I figured we had the same destiny.</span> <span id="s1893">And then I had my two bags.</span> <span id="s1894">I think each bag weighed at least 75 to 80 pounds, so I had them both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">NL: And, you had to walk a mile and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">NS: After walking out from that, I see that there is nobody walking; we were the only ones because we were late, and we walked about 1/2 mile into the main road, then we heard the explosion.</span> <span id="s1897">The Germans blew up the warehouses.</span> <span id="s1898">You could see smoke and everything was shaking.</span> <span id="s1899">And as we walked into the main road and this was March and the day is short and it must have been five o’clock and the day became getting, not dark, but close to the night and as we are walking the first thing we saw is SS patrols.</span> <span id="s1900">And it was such mishmash, such a confusion, they were not aware those troops who were patrolling were not aware from where we are coming.</span> <span id="s1901">Maybe they are not communicating, who knows, but anyway, as we were walking with those two bags they suddenly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Tape four, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">NL: Yes, what happened when you encountered the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">NS: The first thing they say naturally is “Halt”, and when he said “Halt”, he said, “Hands up”, we had to drop the two bags, and the bags when they fall to the floor with all those iron horseshoes and it was making a terrible noise and then they were suspicious that we had ammunition there.</span> <span id="s1905">We dropped them and they said, “Where are you coming?”</span> <span id="s1906">and we told them we just came.</span> <span id="s1907">“Your friends told us to go and plunder and take,” and they said, “Don't you know it’s curfew?</span> <span id="s1908">The time is over.”</span> <span id="s1909">I don’t remember the time, but they said, “It was five o’clock was the last and you can’t walk on the streets.</span> <span id="s1910">What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s1911">So they said, “Who are you?</span> <span id="s1912">Jews?”</span> <span id="s1913">and I said, “Heil Hitler, I am a Volksdeutsche”, and my friend was near me and he did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">NL: He didn’t denounce it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">NS: He did not denounce it.</span> <span id="s1916">That is one good fate in a human being, and a friend, it wasn’t a friend to me before.</span> <span id="s1917">I just met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">NL: Just luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">NS: Just luck.</span> <span id="s1920">He could have said, “He’s a Jew, but he didn’t.”</span> <span id="s1921">So he says, “Los,” Run.</span> <span id="s1922">Then we begged him and we said, “Look, we are Volksdeutsches and we don’t have any parents.</span> <span id="s1923">We are going to run also but we have nothing.</span> <span id="s1924">This is all of our belongings we have.</span> <span id="s1925">Will you let us take the bags?”</span> <span id="s1926">So he opened the bags and he saw this inside shmattes, all those shoes and all that, so he says, “Go ahead and take it, but run.”</span> <span id="s1927">We know the old trick of the Germans: they say “Run”, and they shoot you in the back, so we were running zig-zag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">NL: The Ukrainian also was somewhat careful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">NS: Yes, oh yes, and then we came to a crossroad, and he lived on a different section and he said to me, “Good luck, good bye,” and he took off left and I went right.</span> <span id="s1930">I went to my street.</span> <span id="s1931">I will never forget the street.</span> <span id="s1932">The street was called “Yeremea Unesco”.</span> <span id="s1933">Was the street which I supposed to go, where our house was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">NL: Which means?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">NS: That street was called “Yeremea Unesco”, that street which is apparently changed today in Romania.</span> <span id="s1936">That is the street where we lived.</span> <span id="s1937">And as I was going around the corner, here is a jeep passing by with four SS and they stop right away and all of them with their automatic machine guns stop, and here, single, I was more suspicious.</span> <span id="s1938">“Hand up!</span> <span id="s1939">Stop!</span> <span id="s1940">Who are you?</span> <span id="s1941">You are a Russian spy?</span> <span id="s1942">You’re a Jew” and I said, “No, I am a Volksdeutsche,” and I made a salute.</span> <span id="s1943">The awful salute which actually saved my life.</span> <span id="s1944">And I told them in a half-crying, not actually crying, but I made believe that a young boy, I have a sick mother and my father is fighting in the front someplace.</span> <span id="s1945">And we are ready to leave, too, but in case we cannot we have to survive, so that is why I should take it home.</span> <span id="s1946">One says, “Take it.”</span> <span id="s1947">The other one says, “No leave it.”</span> <span id="s1948">So finally, they decide to let me go and he says, “Take it.”</span> <span id="s1949">And I encountered one more, exactly 400 yards from my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">NL: Another unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">NS: Another unit.</span> <span id="s1952">Okay.</span> <span id="s1953">My uncle, my mother, my aunt were looking out from the basement.</span> <span id="s1954">They were hidden in the cellar looking out from this little tiny window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">NL: Waiting for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">NS: Waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1957">You could hear artillery shots.</span> <span id="s1958">The sky is lighting.</span> <span id="s1959">The Russian at that point, the Russian were trying to cross the river.</span> <span id="s1960">There was a big battle was going on.</span> <span id="s1961">So you could see it when it gets dark, you could see the flashes of the light in the sky.</span> <span id="s1962">I didn’t realize the danger, but I would not let those bags go.</span> <span id="s1963">Those are my bags.</span> <span id="s1964">Somebody else would leave the bags and run for your life, but I had to have those bags.</span> <span id="s1965">So it was about 300 or 400 yards I would say from my house.</span> <span id="s1966">I could not show him where I live because they might follow me and find everybody there.</span> <span id="s1967">So I figured I have to out-maneuver them and the same story.</span> <span id="s1968">You know, “I was late coming because it’s heavy bags” and they said, “Curfew.</span> <span id="s1969">You know you can be shot.</span> <span id="s1970">You can be shot right now because you are not allowed to be on the streets.”</span> <span id="s1971">I begged him and again I did the salute, that awful salute which I despise it but it saved my life.</span> <span id="s1972">And I told him, I said, “Please, please, let me take this.</span> <span id="s1973">This is my only belongings that I have.</span> <span id="s1974">I am an orphan...” This time I changed my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">“I am an orphan, I have nobody.”</span> <span id="s1976">“Where do you go?</span> <span id="s1977">Where do you live?”</span> <span id="s1978">, they say.</span> <span id="s1979">“I live someplace.</span> <span id="s1980">I don't have nowhere under a door step or someplace.”</span> <span id="s1981">I gave them some foolish story so they said, “Fine, all right.</span> <span id="s1982">Can you run?”</span> <span id="s1983">And I knew that old saying, when the Germans say, “Can you run?”</span> <span id="s1984">, they shoot you in the back.</span> <span id="s1985">That’s a pleasure for them to do that, so I figured I’d take that risk and I grabbed the two bags.</span> <span id="s1986">And I was tired already from lifting those bags, so I dragging them actually on the floor and I was running all in zig-zag but running for my life.</span> <span id="s1987">And that street bends, so in the meantime, I looked back and the jeep disappeared.</span> <span id="s1988">So what I did as I was passing in front of our courtyard, I threw the two bags in.</span> <span id="s1989">I threw one bag in and the second, so I was free.</span> <span id="s1990">As soon as I threw them in the courtyard, I was personally free but I could not enter the yard for fear that maybe...</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">NL: They followed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">NS: They follow me and then they would discover everybody.</span> <span id="s1993">So I was running around the bend to the corner, into a courtyard.</span> <span id="s1994">And from there, I climbed two different fences and from under fences and under the tree and I landed into the yard where I live.</span> <span id="s1995">And it became darker and when I walked in, the reception I had there was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1996">My mother almost had a heart attack; my uncle was speechless and my aunt says, “You are out of your mind; you lost your mind.</span> <span id="s1997">You know you could be shot; you could have brought the Germans to us.</span> <span id="s1998">What did you do?</span> <span id="s1999">I said, “I brought you in here so we can survive for six months.”</span> <span id="s2000">And when they opened the bags they said, “What did you bring in here?</span> <span id="s2001">You brought a dozen left shoes?</span> <span id="s2002">We cannot sell.</span> <span id="s2003">We don’t have to have a one-legged man!”</span> <span id="s2004">I says, “In the commotion I grabbed whatever I could.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">NL: Then they saw the silk...</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">NS: The silk and the yarn, because this was very important for shoe makers.</span> <span id="s2007">And from this yarn was big rolls.</span> <span id="s2008">And we lived actually six, seven months, trading when the Russian came in, we lived on that and this was our income.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">NL: That is some story, Mr. Snyder, do you want to rest for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">NS: No, I can continue.</span> <span id="s2011">And we stood there waiting actually for the Russian to enter and naturally we didn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s2012">It was twelve o’clock midnight and suddenly everything became still.</span> <span id="s2013">Quiet down, like from a nightmare, there became a peaceful vision.</span> <span id="s2014">Not a light, not a sound, quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">NL: But no sign of troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">NS: No sign of troops, no sign of trucks no jeeps, not nothing.</span> <span id="s2017">I think those were the last troops who retreated.</span> <span id="s2018">So, we knew that--you could hear a fly buzz.</span> <span id="s2019">Something will happen, but we knew that the Germans have tricks.</span> <span id="s2020">Don't go out from the houses.</span> <span id="s2021">They wait for you to go out so that they can kill you, shoot you, or find out your hideout.</span> <span id="s2022">So we waited.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">NL: For days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">NS: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2025">At one o’clock, no one slept and I understand later in conversation with other Jews, and even non-Jews, no one slept.</span> <span id="s2026">One o’clock, two, three, four,--at five o’clock in the morning we heard a noise like rumbling trucks or tank treads from far away and that was going on for hours.</span> <span id="s2027">What happened actually is the Russian had broken through with pontoon bridges over the big river and were advancing to the city.</span> <span id="s2028">So, again, I was adventurous and I walked out from the house into the streets.</span> <span id="s2029">The streets were deserted but here and there somebody else came out from the house because they didn’t see no Germans.</span> <span id="s2030">We didn’t see no Russian.</span> <span id="s2031">We didn’t see no Germans.</span> <span id="s2032">We heard the noise from the rumbling trucks.</span> <span id="s2033">So, around seven o’clock in the morning, we seen the first liberators, the Russian troops.</span> <span id="s2034">And they were going under cover alongside the houses and to me they were not the same Russian like in 1940.</span> <span id="s2035">They were Mongols, Siberian troops, they were the Mongols, with slanted eyes which I had not seen in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">NL: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">NS: No, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2038">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s2039">They were all battle-ready with full automatic, ready, combat-ready, going alongside from both sides from the houses.</span> <span id="s2040">And when they saw us, the first thing they said in Russian [In Russian], “Where are the Nazis?</span> <span id="s2041">Where are the Fascists?”</span> <span id="s2042">And we told them, “We are Jews.</span> <span id="s2043">We are Jews.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">NL: Did they know that word?</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">NS: Evrei, In Russian, Jew mean Evrei--We are Evrei yes, they knew.</span> <span id="s2046">They said, “Where are the Germans?”</span> <span id="s2047">And we said, “The Germans must be left on the main highway.”</span> <span id="s2048">So then came the trucks and tanks and then later came more troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">NL: Some European troops?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">NS: European troops, mixed, but all first were those Mongolian shock troops.</span> <span id="s2051">Naturally they came not as occupiers like they entered the Austro-Hungaria or other countries.</span> <span id="s2052">They came as liberators because this is their territory.</span> <span id="s2053">So they brought food, they threw food from their trucks and they threw flowers; they threw chocolates and they threw bread.</span> <span id="s2054">They had ready-baked bread.</span> <span id="s2055">And all of the population came outside, and some jumped on the trucks and the tanks.</span> <span id="s2056">And suddenly a couple flags came out from hiding--Russian flags, and they put it up and it was the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s2057">And most of the forward troops--they were chasing the Germans back into deep Romania.</span> <span id="s2058">I understand that the Romanian troops at that time turned coat and joined the allies.</span> <span id="s2059">The king made a pact or somehow with the Russian to fight against the Germans.</span> <span id="s2060">Those Germans actually, I understand, those Germans who left, who retreated from Czernowitz were all captured because the Russian entered through Bessarabia, through south Romania from near the Black Sea.</span> <span id="s2061">And those Germans who retreated from the north to deep Romania, to Old Romania, they were all captured by the Russian.</span> <span id="s2062">The Romanian actually joined.</span> <span id="s2063">We had a letter that the Romanian joined together to fight with the allies against the Germans.</span> <span id="s2064">But this wasn’t our concern.</span> <span id="s2065">We were under Russian occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">The Russian did not administer the city.</span> <span id="s2067">The troops, they came and went through the city.</span> <span id="s2068">Because Czernowitz was a strategic city.</span> <span id="s2069">There were a couple commissars, civilians coming over there.</span> <span id="s2070">They urged that in Czernowitz they should form a civilian guard until the authorities will come and establish a mayor, police for law and order, form a civilian guard.</span> <span id="s2071">There was a Zionist movement, a Communist movement, mostly youth, youngsters from age 14 to age 25, and the Russian left a lot of weapons.</span> <span id="s2072">They gave us the Russian automatic machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">NL: Really!</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">NS: Yes, because mostly there were Jews.</span> <span id="s2075">There was 99.9% were Jews in the city who were survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">NL: Did you meet any Jewish soldiers in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">NS: Yes, we met some Jewish soldiers and they said, they told us horrible stories about massacres and at that time we found out about Kiev and we found out in every city they massacred thousands and thousands of families.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">NL: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">NS: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">NL: And the Jewish soldiers told you these stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">NS: Yes, they said, “You don’t know what kind of horrors we went through, what horrors we seen, chasing the Germans” and they said, “Now the Jews from Transnistria are on their way back”, but this not a priority for us.</span> <span id="s2082">They are coming back.</span> <span id="s2083">They are free to go.</span> <span id="s2084">But are they coming back with transports?</span> <span id="s2085">How they can come?</span> <span id="s2086">Some of the trucks and some of the troops, slowly, slowly some of the survivors came back.</span> <span id="s2087">But, in the meantime, the first order of the day was to form a civilian militia to protect the city for vandalism or for law and order and the Russian organizers left a lot of weapons there.</span> <span id="s2088">Now I found out that some of my friends from school even are there already, they survived.</span> <span id="s2089">And I remember that they came to my house and they had--automatic Russian weapons, and said, “Natan, take it and come with us.”</span> <span id="s2090">And my mother right away took a white handkerchief and wetted it and put it on my head and says, “I have a terrible headache.”</span> <span id="s2091">She said I cannot go because I have a terrible headache.</span> <span id="s2092">Years ago when you had a headache you put around a white handkerchief, a cold compress around your forehead.</span> <span id="s2093">And I said, “No don’t do that.</span> <span id="s2094">I am not a coward, I will go.”</span> <span id="s2095">And she says, “You will get killed” and I says, “I have to take revenge to what happened to our people, to my father.</span> <span id="s2096">We want to find the Nazis and not only Germans, but Nazis, criminals, murderers.</span> <span id="s2097">We have to find them.</span> <span id="s2098">We have to protect.</span> <span id="s2099">This is our city,” and out we went, and we joined I would say with 60 or 70 or 80 and we went in the center of the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">NL: All Jewish youths?</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">NS: All Jewish youths went in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s2102">And this is where one account said, and I understand that he was in touch with the underground, Russian partisans, so he became the chief of it and he told us, “Now, we are going to patrol.</span> <span id="s2103">I want two and three together patrolling the city.</span> <span id="s2104">Take sections.</span> <span id="s2105">You take this section, you take that section,” and we start patrolling.</span> <span id="s2106">We went through the synagogues.</span> <span id="s2107">And all the synagogues were all destroyed and some of them were burned and houses were boarded up.</span> <span id="s2108">There wasn’t damage done as far as war in Czernowitz, because the war was outside the city, but the destruction which the Romanian and the Germans did while they were in the city...</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">NL: Did you find any Jews in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">NS: No, the Jews that were in hiding all came out, who were left, and it was more or less adventure for me to go around.</span> <span id="s2111">And I remember day and night we had to patrol.</span> <span id="s2112">And we had like, eight to eight was your shift, and you, from eight o’clock to the next morning.</span> <span id="s2113">And for two days we patrolled the city and then they organized a search and destroy or, better to say, search and capture of Nazi, Germans who were hiding and couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s2114">SS who were hiding between the Ukrainian population outside the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">NL: There were some?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">NS: Oh yes, and this was very dangerous because when the Russian entered, they had bands formed, anti-Communist bands, or anti-Russian bands.</span> <span id="s2117">They were fascist bands.</span> <span id="s2118">They were deserters from the German army, those who couldn’t escape from the German army, those who were in hiding.</span> <span id="s2119">Ukrainians who were afraid because they murdered the Jews and they couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s2120">Those who couldn’t escape, or Polish or any undesirable Nazis, fascists, band together in the hills and into the forest and they called themselves Banderovtsi.</span> <span id="s2121">They took the name after a General Bandera.</span> <span id="s2122">In the first World War they had Petliura.</span> <span id="s2123">They were named after a General Petliura [Petliura - Last Premier of Independent Ukraine (Jewish Holocaust Encycl.)]</span> <span id="s2124">was his name.</span> <span id="s2125">And so this Bandera was a Ukrainian general who surrounded, no I am sorry, who actually betrayed the Russian.</span> <span id="s2126">When the Germans advanced to Russia, he being the general of the Ukrainian army of their troops, he surrendered to the Germans with a whole division.</span> <span id="s2127">He went with the Germans to fight the Bolsheviks, to so-called to liberate the Ukrainian nationalists.</span> <span id="s2128">They promised them that they would have a Ukrainian state by themselves and his name was Bandera.</span> <span id="s2129">[Stefan Bandera, leader of the extremist Ukrainian Nationalists, who was actually imprisoned by the Germans in 1941 in Sachsenhausen, after Eastern Galicia was annexed to the Government-General in Poland - an event which was bitterly disappointing to those Ukrainians who had expected the Germans to help them establish an independent state.]</span> <span id="s2130">So, actually, those remnants of bandists called themselves Banderovtsis, which is in plural.</span> <span id="s2131">I understand that Bandera succeeded to run away to Germany and he lived there until the late 50s in Germany, and I think that the Russian KGB got him.</span> <span id="s2132">Yah, they got him there.</span> <span id="s2133">Actually he also was participating in the “Voice of America” in Germany, a propaganda against Russia because he was anti-Communist, no matter what kind of criminal he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Those Ukrainians, who actually those Ukrainians volunteers, the volunteers who went to fight with the Germans against the Russian, I understand they were the biggest killers of the Jews.</span> <span id="s2135">They helped the Germans killing Jews.</span> <span id="s2136">They were the tool of killers, the tools of killings.</span> <span id="s2137">The Germans liked that.</span> <span id="s2138">Why should they do the dirty work?</span> <span id="s2139">So, those who couldn’t escape organized under bands in the woods.</span> <span id="s2140">And it was dangerous to go outside the city.</span> <span id="s2141">And it happened incidents that the Jews went back to see the little towns where they belonged and so on, and they were massacred and killed--many of them and, as a matter of fact, it happened to two cousins of mine.</span> <span id="s2142">They went back in a town, not in my town, but two towns away...</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">NL: By Ukrainians?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">NS: By the so-called Banderovtsi.</span> <span id="s2145">They killed them and the Russian troops found them.</span> <span id="s2146">The Russian did not have enough troops to go and wipe them out because most of the troops were fighting the Germans on the battle-front.</span> <span id="s2147">So it was 1944, it was even before the landing in June 4th, in Normandy, so the Russian were busy chasing and fighting the Germans.</span> <span id="s2148">I understand at that time we did go out.</span> <span id="s2149">In the meantime, a lot of Germans were found hidden in basements and attics by non-Jews who were hiding them, and they were all assembled.</span> <span id="s2150">Naturally the Russian troops there, too.</span> <span id="s2151">We were not under our own control.</span> <span id="s2152">They did not say “The city is yours and you rule it now”, but we were like helping them.</span> <span id="s2153">Naturally, for us it was like revenge.</span> <span id="s2154">So, they gathered a lot of them.</span> <span id="s2155">They even brought them back, some of the Russian who captured them, in conflicts they couldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s2156">They brought them back into the city and they assembled them right in the middle.</span> <span id="s2157">Czernowitz had a big center, it’s called the Ringplatz, which means a round circle.</span> <span id="s2158">It’s like here in Philadelphia, in City Hall, we do not have a plaza, but it’s a big, big plaza, it’s called the Ringplatz.</span> <span id="s2159">It’s like in the center where the city hall was, and the big government buildings.</span> <span id="s2160">And they assembled them over there and the Russian were actually kept them there as prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">But our aim was to go out and find not so much the Germans but Ukrainian murderers who run away from the small towns.</span> <span id="s2162">We figured that in small towns they obvious can be discovered, but in a big town, in a big city like Czernowitz they can get lost.</span> <span id="s2163">So some of them run away to the big city, not knowing that most of them run with the German troops as they retreated back to Hungaria-Austria into Germany who later claimed to the American troops that they were anti-Communist, poor slave labors deported by the Germans to work in the mines and in slave labor camps.</span> <span id="s2164">They don’t want to go back to Russia because they are anti-Communist, so they would like to live in the West.</span> <span id="s2165">And they fooled the English, the American.</span> <span id="s2166">They even got help, some of them, from the Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s2167">From the so-called UNRRA, they got blankets and chocolates and food, and stayed in the DP camps in Germany.</span> <span id="s2168">And later two years or a year later, they emigrated to Canada, Australia, South America and all over the world, fooling them, giving false names and false ages and so on.</span> <span id="s2169">Everybody was born in Kiev and Moscow; nobody was born in small little towns.</span> <span id="s2170">But everybody was born in Moscow or in Kiev and they fooled the authorities and we know from now, we discovered that there is one [name - unclear] living here that was a murderer, and there is thousands of them that we don’t even know about them or we don’t want to go after them, not we, but the authorities.</span> <span id="s2171">So, to get away from that subject, our aim is to find those murderers.</span> <span id="s2172">So we went into towns and they succeeded in bringing back, but not too far.</span> <span id="s2173">Just, in fact, six miles out of the city…</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">NL: You did find some?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">NS: Oh yes, we brought them back and had them assembled together with those--Also, we found Romanian cowards, Romanian soldiers, who could not retreat or did not have time to retreat.</span> <span id="s2176">And they were hiding, or did not want to fight anymore the Germans or didn’t want to fight in the war, so they were hiding as villagers, as peasants, and they were discovered by the Russian troops and brought back as prisoners.</span> <span id="s2177">Some in uniform and some without.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">NL: So you must have enjoyed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2180">The one thing which I didn’t enjoy, but I was too young to understand, that the Romanians who were assembled in that Ringplatz, a day later, they were kept over there as prisoners.</span> <span id="s2181">And I remember that there was a whole group, and as my memory dictates, the Romanians were released.</span> <span id="s2182">The Russian didn’t consider the Romanians too much as fighters.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">NL: Well, they were now allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">NS: Now only that, but when they were captured they were still not allies, they were not fighting now the Russian, they were still remnants of the old army.</span> <span id="s2185">They were making fun of them.</span> <span id="s2186">They were taking off their shoes, took their weapons, ripped off their epaulets, kicked them in behind and says, “Go home to your family, you coward.”</span> <span id="s2187">In a joke, no respect from them, they kicked them in the behind and they didn’t want to take them as prisoners and they said, “Go home.”</span> <span id="s2188">But this didn’t affect the Germans because those Germans who were captured--the Russian killed them, right in the same place.</span> <span id="s2189">They put up machine guns because most of the Germans who were caught were actually SS.</span> <span id="s2190">The Russian had a code.</span> <span id="s2191">I think it was from Stalin who issued it in 1943; “Any SS or Gestapo should not be taken prisoner alive.”</span> <span id="s2192">They were not regular army.</span> <span id="s2193">They were all in black uniforms.</span> <span id="s2194">They couldn’t hide because they also had that tattoo under the arm but the Russian had them all killed and I understand some of the bodies were hanging around for 24 hours right there in the square.</span> <span id="s2195">It wasn’t for us a pleasure to see that because we had never--in a way we felt sorry even though they were our tormentors.</span> <span id="s2196">We felt sorry because we figured maybe one of them is innocent, and maybe he does have a wife and children home and maybe he was forced into that.</span> <span id="s2197">But that is war, that is the fate of war, that is the destiny.</span> <span id="s2198">I--That patrolling was for a short-live because after three, four days the Russian brought in their own authorities.</span> <span id="s2199">And there came the chief of the militia and a couple judges and a couple authorities in government and so on; they eliminated all that so-called self-appointed civilian guard.</span> <span id="s2200">We had to surrender all of arms, all the weapons and so on.</span> <span id="s2201">And then they opened recruitment...</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">NL: To their army?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">NS: Their army, and every youngster from age 16 had to be registered to be inducted into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">NL: You were then how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">NS: In 1944--I was born in ‘26, I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s2206">Yes.</span> <span id="s2207">Every youngster has to report for indoctrination, registration.</span> <span id="s2208">Naturally, it was an order to go and fight the fascists to the end.</span> <span id="s2209">To victory.</span> <span id="s2210">Everybody was going to register and I registered too.</span> <span id="s2211">At the same time we went to school, because it doesn’t mean if you go in and register, they took you right away.</span> <span id="s2212">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">NL: You and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">NS: I don’t remember my sister.</span> <span id="s2215">My sister was much younger but I went to school.</span> <span id="s2216">It wasn’t a school, it wasn’t a Gymnasium, or it wasn’t a high school or an elementary school.</span> <span id="s2217">It was one school called the Russian school.</span> <span id="s2218">And they taught Russian, you talked in Russian, you learned Russian, the language, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">NL: No other language?</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">NS: No other language, and you learned there mathematics and chemistry and history and propaganda and the language in the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">NL: By the way, what language did you use when you spoke to the Russian soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">NS: Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">NL: You knew a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">NS: Yes, Russian because I knew Ukrainian because a lot of Ukrainians lived there.</span> <span id="s2225">Just the accent is a little different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">NL: I see, so how was life in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">NS: Well, we enjoyed it in school because most our professors were--some of them Russian and some of them Jewish and we learned there.</span> <span id="s2228">We didn’t know it would be short-lived our studies because eventually we would have to go to the army, but we learned there and it was very interesting and very enjoyable but...</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">NL: And your uncle, was he required to work for the Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">NS: Yes, my uncle got a job back in the same factory that was owned by the government.</span> <span id="s2231">Everybody was nationalized.</span> <span id="s2232">There was no more private homes, nothing belongs to you, everything belongs to the government and you are an object of the government, but people had the liberty and freedom and...</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Tape four, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">NL: Was there enough food now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">NS: Yes, the food we brought out from the peasants.</span> <span id="s2236">All around was an exchange.</span> <span id="s2237">The Russian brought in, it was more organized.</span> <span id="s2238">There was some stores opened and, I like I mentioned before, my mother, we had no income, so a lot of exchange because a lot of the items were scarce.</span> <span id="s2239">You couldn’t find no leather your shoes, your clothing, wool...</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">NL: This is when the yarn came in handy and the silk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">NS: That’s right [Mrs. S. makes a comment.]</span> <span id="s2242">.</span> <span id="s2243">There were rubles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">NL: Romanian money wasn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2246">But rubles.</span> <span id="s2247">People were living, making a living.</span> <span id="s2248">And most the others came back from concentration camps, people we seen and were lucky to seen.</span> <span id="s2249">People came back sick and then we found out--the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s2250">This is 1944.</span> <span id="s2251">Then we heard about the horrors of the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">NL: The first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">NS: We heard about the horrors in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2254">First time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">NL: Who told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">NS: The Russian, the Jewish were in the Russian army, Russian themselves--News--the order of Stalin...</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">NL: The Russian supplied some of this news?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">NS: Yes, they were telling us and mostly Jews that were in the Russian army who had traveled around, because you could travel in all the occupied territories where the Russian occupied and look for your loved ones or for relatives.</span> <span id="s2259">It was, like, disorganized.</span> <span id="s2260">It wasn’t an organized police state at that time.</span> <span id="s2261">Their aim was to destroy, to crush fascism, so everybody could join.</span> <span id="s2262">It wasn’t so much I would say dictatorship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">NL: You felt free?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2265">Totalitarian regime, we know as of now it didn’t exist at that time because it was like wartime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">NL: Did you have any interest in going back to your old town?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">NS: Oh sure, but we were told not, because our town was heavily overtaken by the Banderovtsi because two of my cousins they were killed about ten miles away and the Russian were against it.</span> <span id="s2268">They themselves, instances, they killed Russian troops.</span> <span id="s2269">The Russian trucks and jeeps that went in adventured themselves to go into the back country, the villages, never came back.</span> <span id="s2270">So the Russian did not have the mobilization to fight them, so they were ruling over the mountains and forests, and that was a problem.</span> <span id="s2271">So the Jews, they never went back and they said, “One day we will go back.”</span> <span id="s2272">I wanted to go back for one reason, to see my home where I was born and to see the grave of my father, where he is buried.</span> <span id="s2273">We were told they buried all in a mass grave.</span> <span id="s2274">But where, the location?</span> <span id="s2275">Maybe they take them out and put them on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s2276">The Jewish cemetery was desecrated.</span> <span id="s2277">I mean there was nothing left from it.</span> <span id="s2278">I understand they took out the stones for pavement, for buildings and so on.</span> <span id="s2279">But, I never went back; my mother never went back to our town to this day.</span> <span id="s2280">My only wish is one time in life to go back to that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">NL: So, you were relatively free in the first weeks of the Russian occupation, and you were enjoying school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">NS: Right.</span> <span id="s2283">Then started the mobilization.</span> <span id="s2284">At the school.</span> <span id="s2285">About three months later it was April, May, June--In July we didn’t finish the school, they said, “You come back from war, then you finish school.</span> <span id="s2286">You have to go and fight”.</span> <span id="s2287">So they took everybody, got their induction, a letter home and was asked to join the Red army, and more and more and more went and so on.</span> <span id="s2288">There was no way that you could avoid it because that is an impossibility.</span> <span id="s2289">And I wanted to go because I want to take revenge for my father and for all the rest of the Jews who were massacred to fight the fascists.</span> <span id="s2290">My mother was very scared because she lost her husband, my father, so she want me alive.</span> <span id="s2291">And she knew that going as cannon into the war, we didn’t mean nothing to the Russian, to sacrifice 100,000 soldiers for their aim and their victory.</span> <span id="s2292">People don’t mean nothing to them, numbers, I mean.</span> <span id="s2293">So, many went and never came back.</span> <span id="s2294">Then, I was taken into for induction into that army camp, which I went very proudly.</span> <span id="s2295">What actually happened is...</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">NL: Was the camp close to Czernowitz?</span> <span id="s2297">Or, did you go East?</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">NS: It was in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s2299">It was an old Romanian military camp.</span> <span id="s2300">It was the headquarters for recruitment.</span> <span id="s2301">What happened is that those that had some education were taken into special schools.</span> <span id="s2302">And most of them were Jewish, and even some non-Jewish who had education, even some of the peasants who had a little bit education and were able to read and understand a little bit mathematics, and physics and so on.</span> <span id="s2303">They were taken into a school, a special course.</span> <span id="s2304">Not sending us infantry.</span> <span id="s2305">Just cannon for front line which were integrated into the Russian army.</span> <span id="s2306">There was no separate.</span> <span id="s2307">In special school.</span> <span id="s2308">You had to bribe to get to that special school.</span> <span id="s2309">Why you had to bribe to get to that special school?</span> <span id="s2310">Because there they were serving good food and you had good conditions.</span> <span id="s2311">For us to--good living quarters and for ninety days, for three months you were there, safe from the massacre on the front line.</span> <span id="s2312">And we never know what would happen because the biggest battle in this time was going on in Konigsberg, the whole line at the front in Konigsberg in Hochprussia.</span> <span id="s2313">Budapest in Hungaria, Warsaw in Poland, and Konigsberg--these were the three major battles going on at that time between the Russian and the Germans.</span> <span id="s2314">They were pushing into the German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">NL: When you say bribe, how was that accomplished?</span> <span id="s2316">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">NS: In other words, the Russian are known for taking bribes.</span> <span id="s2318">With a couple thousand rubles, you could bribe an officer to admit you in that school.</span> <span id="s2319">So this is what happened, my mother did bribe.</span> <span id="s2320">It was middleman, not direct.</span> <span id="s2321">Somebody who knew also an officer knew that friend and so on and that is I got into that school.</span> <span id="s2322">We did not realize that school belonged to the polytechnic division.</span> <span id="s2323">It was nothing else like a school for living mines which is called demolition squad.</span> <span id="s2324">You’re trying to escape from a window and you fall into a hole into the other side.</span> <span id="s2325">In the meantime, we got news from friends, that fell--a very good friend of mine.</span> <span id="s2326">His parents got a letter.</span> <span id="s2327">The letters used to come from the authorities with a black rim.</span> <span id="s2328">He fell to the Fatherland at Konigsberg.</span> <span id="s2329">He died there, so we knew that life doesn’t mean nothing.</span> <span id="s2330">So you go and you have a chance of coming back and maybe not.</span> <span id="s2331">The battles were very crucial battles.</span> <span id="s2332">Crushing the main German offensive.</span> <span id="s2333">So, we went to that school.</span> <span id="s2334">We were assigned to that school, and we were a group of, I would say, 30 to 35 youngsters.</span> <span id="s2335">I would say that half of them were Jews and half were non-Jews.</span> <span id="s2336">And we had a commander who was a Cossack, tall, dark hair, dressed as a Cossack, with those knives on the side, on the pockets, knives sticking out, with a big fur hat, just like a Cossack.</span> <span id="s2337">And he was a commander.</span> <span id="s2338">He was the captain.</span> <span id="s2339">His name was Vassily Vanovich, so we knew that he is a Cossack.</span> <span id="s2340">And then he had officers under him, lieutenants and sergeants and so on, and the sergeant happened to be a Ukrainian who was a Jew-hater.</span> <span id="s2341">He was antisemitic.</span> <span id="s2342">We were there in the school, and we had half a day classes and half day of practice.</span> <span id="s2343">What we were learning is demolition, how to take out all kinds of mines, Russian mines and American mines, English mines, and German mines and Hungarian and Finland which were allies to the German.</span> <span id="s2344">Naturally, the German mines which was the most important.</span> <span id="s2345">And then we had practice, and we were learning also the technical part of it, how it’s constructed, how it functions, and so on.</span> <span id="s2346">Then we moved from there closer to the front line and we were integrated to a division which was called at that time Demolition Squad.</span> <span id="s2347">I forgot in Russian.</span> <span id="s2348">We were attached to the military police because our job was to remove the mines from the fields before the troops advanced, and remove the mines from the territory that was occupied, the remaining mines.</span> <span id="s2349">The Germans had mines all over the place.</span> <span id="s2350">At the same time, help combat the military police or the army--those Banderovtsis.</span> <span id="s2351">If we had nothing to do, they used to take us into the woods to fight and capture those Banderovtsis.</span> <span id="s2352">Any available troops, they sent in to fight them and to destroy them which was impossible at that time.</span> <span id="s2353">Then they took us out actually in the real war which was that in terror and in danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">NL: This was now west, toward Konigsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">NS: No, that was in Poland, Galicia in Poland--in that section.</span> <span id="s2356">We were attached to the army.</span> <span id="s2357">I don’t remember if it was Fourth Ukrainian or the Second Russian or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2358">But we had our group, our company, and that captain was outnumbered and we were dressed as soldiers but we also had the emblem of the military police.</span> <span id="s2359">It was red and blue on our epaulets, which means that we could also assist, not assist, but when they had German prisoners-of-war, help transport them, watch them, participate in watching prisoners-of-wars.</span> <span id="s2360">When they used to take them in cattle trains back to Russia, we had to take them from this point to that point and other groups would take them over and further down or watch them prisoner of camps.</span> <span id="s2361">So actually, we were work, miscellaneous--not really combat, fighting on the front.</span> <span id="s2362">So that was a good point in that.</span> <span id="s2363">One day they took us to the real war which was actually taking out a mine field, which was not too far from the battle because we heard the artillery and the fights going on, and so on, and a lot of them died there over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">NL: A lot of your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">NS: Yes, for me it was at that time, I didn’t realize what death is...</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">NL: It was still an adventure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">NS: Yes, for me it was a big adventure at that time.</span> <span id="s2368">But in one way I wanted to go and revenge the death of our brothers and my father and so on, and the same time, I had no fear.</span> <span id="s2369">To me it was an adventure and I remember we were stationed, we arrived actually in a small town, and in the outskirts of the town was a strategic passway where the German were defeated and the whole town is mined, deserted.</span> <span id="s2370">The reason why we knew was because there were cows blown up and dogs blown up, trees and houses and everything was mined, the trees, the houses, the roads, the fields.</span> <span id="s2371">The troops could not pass, but they were not the first troops who were fighting.</span> <span id="s2372">The other troops of occupation they could not go through, they send us.</span> <span id="s2373">We are the specialists, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">NL: How long did you serve there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">NS: Under that I served--I would say about until September or October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">NL: And you cleared the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">NS: Oh yes, we cleared enough because we were specialized.</span> <span id="s2378">First of all we had mine detectors, and some of them were plastic mines and we had to use our bayonets and just find them.</span> <span id="s2379">We were specialized, we were trained for that.</span> <span id="s2380">There were the “S” mines which were wired with thin green hair wires and they exploded like ten together.</span> <span id="s2381">Then we have tank mines.</span> <span id="s2382">We were taking out a day, our group, at least a couple thousand mines and soon as you take the mines out, the capsules taken out, the mines were not in danger anymore.</span> <span id="s2383">I remember we used to have hills, mountains of those mines that were not dangerous because the capsules were out.</span> <span id="s2384">The capsules, they looked like a bullet, and they were dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">NL: How did you defuse them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">NS: How do you defuse them: There is a little spring and you grab that spring.</span> <span id="s2387">Each mine has a different mechanism, some are more dangerous but the capsule itself the explosive.</span> <span id="s2388">And I collected a lot of souvenirs and being as a soldier, we had a satchel, like and I filled it up day by day I filled it up full of those capsules, and didn’t realize that I’m sitting on a time bomb.</span> <span id="s2389">But for me it was an adventure, and even we used to take some of the mines and put them up for target shooting and so on, and we lived there and every single day we had causalities.</span> <span id="s2390">And as the people were dwindling down they brought in more reinforcement, Russian, not from our group, just Russian who were assigned to that.</span> <span id="s2391">In the same occupation, so the group had to be the number of 35, and I remember that sergeant.</span> <span id="s2392">He was blown up and I felt so bad for him because he went into the field and they brought him out on a stretcher and the guts were hanging down.</span> <span id="s2393">And I looked to him and it wasn’t horrified to me.</span> <span id="s2394">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s2395">I didn’t realize that that could happen to me too.</span> <span id="s2396">Once we were going into the field in different pattern, it was like a plan because we had no map.</span> <span id="s2397">Russian maps we had for Russian mines, but not from the Germans, so we had to go by puzzle.</span> <span id="s2398">I remember that suddenly in the back to the left, boom, an explosion and all that remained was pieces of flesh or clothing on the trees and there was nothing to collect, but it didn’t scare us or me personally because--what happened and it was dumb.</span> <span id="s2399">I was a little bit afraid but it didn’t scare me or others too.</span> <span id="s2400">This was going on for months.</span> <span id="s2401">One day they sent us into the woods, what we call “search and destroy” to get those Banderovtsis.</span> <span id="s2402">Because what happened is a couple of trucks of soldiers went into one of the major holdouts where they were stationed and they never came back.</span> <span id="s2403">They were all killed, so they figured they had to send in more.</span> <span id="s2404">They sent in troops and they sent us to help them, and that I was scared, that I was scared because I figured you are fighting against the unknown.</span> <span id="s2405">It’s partisans.</span> <span id="s2406">It is like fighting the Viet Cong in Viet Nam.</span> <span id="s2407">You don’t know whom you are fighting.</span> <span id="s2408">So, we went to two missions, to two missions we went and both missions--what they did actually, they didn’t capture anybody because, in the meantime, the Russian had brought more troops from the front back to combat those guerrillas.</span> <span id="s2409">They had more pieces of artillery and what they were doing was they were surrounding the entire forest, from all around with ketyushas and artillery.</span> <span id="s2410">They decimated the whole forest, so it was a victory for us because we didn’t have to go combat to combat.</span> <span id="s2411">They were willing to take just prisoners.</span> <span id="s2412">I understand they had bunkers under the ground but they eliminated everything, destroyed it.</span> <span id="s2413">They are know for that; they don’t play around.</span> <span id="s2414">There is no civilization, or in civilized manner.</span> <span id="s2415">They just massacred everybody and destroyed everything.</span> <span id="s2416">But, I went for two of those missions.</span> <span id="s2417">One time we went at night time for a mission and they did capture three Germans who were in civilian clothes and a couple Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s2418">They were hiding out in a big farm like and they found them in a barn and they were taken away and I am sure they were executed.</span> <span id="s2419">There was no trials, they just took them aside and they were executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">NL: And then you went back to demolition work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">NS: I went back to demolition work and then we realized between us, our fellow friends and so on, that we are in danger because they were talking about sending us to the front line.</span> <span id="s2422">And that is the biggest danger, because if you went to the front line it was a suicide squad.</span> <span id="s2423">It means “No man’s land.”</span> <span id="s2424">The Russian are on the one side and the Germans on the other side, and between them is called a “no man’s land”--a stretch of two, three miles.</span> <span id="s2425">This is where they are sending the demolition squad to clear that particular area before the troops can advance.</span> <span id="s2426">So, we knew that that was like signing your own death sentence.</span> <span id="s2427">And for some reason, we had in our group a guy who was like 26 or 27, he was much older and he said that he can make a deal with the captain.</span> <span id="s2428">But we didn’t have any money, so we all gave our watches because they love watches, so I had a watch at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">NL: What kind of deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">NS: We give him the watches and he is going to keep us longer there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">NL: I see</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">NS: Not sending us to the front lines.</span> <span id="s2433">We were ready to give our watches and we were told one day that in the evening that he was going to meet with us as a group--At that time we had 15 to 18 Jewish guys.</span> <span id="s2434">He’s going to meet with us.</span> <span id="s2435">And he met with us.</span> <span id="s2436">And I remember, it was like outside, in a village, outside the house under a tree we were sitting down, it was leisure time and he sat down and he said, “Let me tell you something.”</span> <span id="s2437">And we had a lot of respect for the guy and we knew that, you know, Cossacks are fearless.</span> <span id="s2438">“My name is Vassily Ivanovich [Gregorovich].</span> <span id="s2439">And you know that I am a Cossack, but I am not, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s2440">My name is Abraham Schwartzman.</span> <span id="s2441">I am from Kiev.</span> <span id="s2442">I am an Israelite.</span> <span id="s2443">I am part of the Israeli folk, the Yiddishe folk.</span> <span id="s2444">The reason I am dressed that way, you will ask the question Why?</span> <span id="s2445">My wife and my children, my in-laws, my entire family, a family of forty were massacred in Babi Yar in Kiev.</span> <span id="s2446">I was in the army; I was lucky.</span> <span id="s2447">When I came back to Kiev, they were all massacred.</span> <span id="s2448">At that time, I figured, if I get captured into the Russian or the German hands as a Jew, naturally they will kill me.</span> <span id="s2449">As a Cossack I had better chance of survival.”</span> <span id="s2450">So, he dressed himself, because he was very tall, with black hair, he fit in to be a Cossack.</span> <span id="s2451">He assumed the name of Vasily Gregorovich Ivanovich.</span> <span id="s2452">As a Cossack, the Germans will never suspect he was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">NL: And, neither did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">NS: He says, “Let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s2455">It’s good to fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2456">We should fight them to the end and take revenge for the blood they spilled, but after the war, he says, “I go to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s2457">This is where I belong.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">NL: That is some story!</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">NS: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2460">He said, “I am a Jew, oh yes.”</span> <span id="s2461">He says, “Look, I am trying to protect you guys as much as I can.</span> <span id="s2462">There is antisemitism in the Russian army.</span> <span id="s2463">They don’t like the Jews in here.</span> <span id="s2464">They hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s2465">They hate the Germans first, but the Jews second.</span> <span id="s2466">Don’t think that they are your friends.</span> <span id="s2467">I have learned on my own skin, but this has to remain very discreet because if you uncover me then I am undone.”</span> <span id="s2468">Because in case he goes into war, he is finished.</span> <span id="s2469">It was a relief to us that we could find a Jewish officer who is...</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">NL: A friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">NS: A friend.</span> <span id="s2472">He said, “As soon as I come over closer to the western countries like Austria, I will go to Italy and from there I am going to go to Palestine, at that it wasn’t Israel, to Palestine because this is where I belong.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">NL: Did he ever explain what his background was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">NS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2475">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2476">He says...</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">NL: Did he come from a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">NS: His father, himself.</span> <span id="s2479">He wasn’t religious, but he said they belonged to the Hashomer Hatzair...</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">NL: His father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">NS: Their family and so on.</span> <span id="s2482">He was a Zionist, and they had a big movement in Kiev.</span> <span id="s2483">He said he has a lot of cousins who live in Israel, in Palestine, who left 30 years ago and who are living there at least they are alive.</span> <span id="s2484">It is a very hard life but at least they are alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">NL: So you stayed in this unit for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">NS: Yes, that watch business was only a bluff.</span> <span id="s2487">A maneuver to get us together.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">NL: So he returned them to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">NS: He didn’t even take them.</span> <span id="s2490">We were supposed to send him our watches.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">NL: He just wanted to meet with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">NS: Exactly.</span> <span id="s2493">He didn’t know in what way to do that, so he says, “I will protect you as much as I can, but my lieutenant is a Jew-hater.</span> <span id="s2494">He doesn’t know that I am Jewish, and even if you say he’s nice and so on, he is not your friend.”</span> <span id="s2495">So, he did everything in his power to keep us there and late in September it was beyond his power, and they attached us to the main division.</span> <span id="s2496">And for some reason, I, we lost contact with him.</span> <span id="s2497">Apparently he was reassigned or whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2498">I’m sure that he today is living in Israel because if his aim was to escape, he will.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">NL: I hope he did.</span> <span id="s2500">And what happened to you, Mr. Snyder?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">NS: Then what happened is they attached us to the main division.</span> <span id="s2502">They gave us rations, shaved our heads because of disease, lice and so on, and we knew that we were going to the front line and they gave us rations, brown sugar, dry bread and cans.</span> <span id="s2503">We saw for the first time, written in Russian imported from America, it was pork stew.</span> <span id="s2504">It was like silver cans, so we knew--oh, yes, and we knew the landing is taking place, that the American, the English and the French are advancing there, the Germans are crushed from both sides and victory will be very soon.</span> <span id="s2505">But still there were battles going on.</span> <span id="s2506">There was the Battle of the Bulge, and American planes came overhead and we even saw Americans or English or French officers who were mixed, with the attaches or whatever, delegations, liaison, and so on.</span> <span id="s2507">They prepared us to march down to [unclear].</span> <span id="s2508">For some reason, I did not want to be a statistic of Konigsberg because we knew how much they were aiming for one victory.</span> <span id="s2509">That’s true.</span> <span id="s2510">The victory was to crush the Germans.</span> <span id="s2511">But as the months went on, I was always aiming for survival, and that is a human instinct.</span> <span id="s2512">So they marched us down to the railroad.</span> <span id="s2513">It was supposed to be embarkation, taking place, going to the front line and that happened.</span> <span id="s2514">We were told that we were going to Budapest.</span> <span id="s2515">That was the biggest battle at that time, it was a crucial battle, for Budapest.</span> <span id="s2516">So, they integrated us.</span> <span id="s2517">You see every regiment, in Russian they called us sapior, which means mine sweeper, or demolition squad, and every regiment had like a dozen or two of those attached, but for some reason my friends and I were in the same group.</span> <span id="s2518">Some were taken away and attached to others, so we lost contact, but I still remained with eight or nine friends of mine into that group and we were taken down.</span> <span id="s2519">But one thing that I don’t understand, as we were going to that camp--about two or three miles march down to the railroad station, where the embarkation took place, why did they have to have guards with bayonets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">NL: Guarding you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">NS: Guarding us, because we found our later, we didn’t know at that time, that there was a lot of desertion was going on.</span> <span id="s2522">Even original Russian, I understand that after the war they were telling stories about Russian--I don’t call them cowards--but guys who were smart and survived the war.</span> <span id="s2523">They were traveling for four years back and forth on trains from east to west and from west to east and from east to west and whenever they got caught they were saying that they went to the bathroom a leak.</span> <span id="s2524">And they lost their train and they put them on another train and the train was going in the opposite direction and they were looking for the units.</span> <span id="s2525">And not too many, we found out after the war how they survived.</span> <span id="s2526">Because in a war like that, with such a big region all most all over Europe on a front from Finland to the Black Sea, naturally, it was a disorganized situation, so some of them will slip through.</span> <span id="s2527">That is the reason that they had us guarded.</span> <span id="s2528">The Russians had one single goal or method.</span> <span id="s2529">If a commander, let’s say a lieutenant, had 150 soldiers that he has to bring them this point, from point A to point B, and when he comes close to point B and he sees that from 150 there is now 145, his head is rolling.</span> <span id="s2530">He gets executed if five are missing, so he will capture five people, kidnap, he doesn’t care if they are cripples, one-legged men.</span> <span id="s2531">This happened they took a one-legged man who were invalids and he says, “Why are you taking me?</span> <span id="s2532">I only have one foot.”</span> <span id="s2533">And he says, “You don’t have to run.</span> <span id="s2534">You can sit on a truck and shoot.”</span> <span id="s2535">So, they were taking people who are exempt from army because you are working in the electric company, the telephone company, and the gas company, and other kinds of factory.</span> <span id="s2536">Very important.</span> <span id="s2537">They don’t care, they grab you.</span> <span id="s2538">You could have papers...</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">Tape five, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">NS: As I was saying, we had those side troops, the sentries alongside from the left side and the right side, guarding us with the rifles with the bayonets up and that I rejected.</span> <span id="s2541">Not only I.</span> <span id="s2542">We all resented that and rejected that.</span> <span id="s2543">How come we are going to fight the Nazis, we are going into the battle, going down to the embarkation point, to go to the front line and we have to be guarded, and we resented that very very much.</span> <span id="s2544">We felt like we were prisoners, forced to go, sacrificed for the war, and my aim was to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">NS: Yes, and I figured, I want to fight the Nazis, I want to take revenge, but not that way.</span> <span id="s2547">Not this way.</span> <span id="s2548">I did perform my duty under different circumstances, but they didn’t have any trust because too many were deserting, so they have no choice.</span> <span id="s2549">They had to make sure that no one escapes from that group.</span> <span id="s2550">So, as we came to the railroad, and I remember that we were going and the irony of that is that as we were marching down, because it was like a hill going down, and we were singing patriotic marches, patriotic songs, like Stalin, fighting the Nazis, and so on--but we have guards, so we shouldn’t escape.</span> <span id="s2551">So that is the irony of that.</span> <span id="s2552">When we arrived there, here the commotion started.</span> <span id="s2553">Disorganized commotion.</span> <span id="s2554">Trains coming back with prisoners of war, some wounded Russian soldiers, and tanks and supplies and trucks and troops going to the front, and we were there stationed in one place, and then, finally, that train came with cattle cars and so on.</span> <span id="s2555">And naturally they had attached us to each 20 or 30.</span> <span id="s2556">I remember into each car of the train and they gave us supplies and so on, but my aim was to escape, and I, from that day on, I lost contact with my friends, with my Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">NL: They were in other groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">NS: Other groups attached and they apparently went ahead and I was the one who dipped, they call.</span> <span id="s2559">When I entered from the front and I exit from the back, I made believe I was going to the bathroom, naturally, to relieve myself.</span> <span id="s2560">If somebody asked me, I was relieving myself not only for only for five minutes or two minutes but I relieved myself for a half hour waiting for the train to leave.</span> <span id="s2561">So in case they see me I says, “Look, I am doing my duty.”</span> <span id="s2562">And, finally the train took off, and I am here stationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">NL: What is the city now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">NS: Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s2565">The train took off and I said, “Fine, at least I am away from that group,” but this is no way of saying that they wouldn’t attach me to another group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">NL: But you are surrounded by Red Army people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">NS: Oh sure, there are troops all over the place.</span> <span id="s2568">And they have those armies what do you call?</span> <span id="s2569">Railroad M.P.’s they call them militia, NKVD, the army KGB, which, you know, so, finally, I went to the, I had to report, because I was in uniform and I just couldn’t walk away.</span> <span id="s2570">I went to the Kommandatur, and I reported and said, “I lost my train.”</span> <span id="s2571">So, he said, “What was your group?”</span> <span id="s2572">I don’t recall but I gave him the name of the group.</span> <span id="s2573">And he says, “No problem.</span> <span id="s2574">On the next train you join them, or we attach you to somebody else.”</span> <span id="s2575">So, he said to me, “Wait here.”</span> <span id="s2576">So, I waited in his office and I was sitting down, and I waited.</span> <span id="s2577">And as I was waiting there, I figured well, “That is my destiny, there is nothing I can do.”</span> <span id="s2578">And he said, “Aren’t you deserting?”</span> <span id="s2579">And I said, “No, I went to relieve myself, the train took off and I was whistling and screaming and hollering but it was too late.”</span> <span id="s2580">I said, but so many trains coming to us.</span> <span id="s2581">He said, “Those trains which are coming through are supply trains.</span> <span id="s2582">You are not allowed to go on those trains, you have to go on a troop train.”</span> <span id="s2583">And for awhile he was writing and making telephone calls and people were coming in and coming out and after about a half hour he walked out from there.</span> <span id="s2584">He left me alone in there, and another officer came in, I don’t remember if it was a higher officer or a lower officer, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2585">He came in, in a very good mood, smoking his cigar cigarette made from newspapers usually with cut tobacco, which we naturally all smoked at that time, and whistling and he says, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s2586">And I said, “I am waiting to go back.</span> <span id="s2587">I am going on furlough.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">NL: Furlough!</span> <span id="s2589">Another story!</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">NS: And he says, “You cannot go on furlough on an army train which goes back, that’s going back hinterland.</span> <span id="s2591">He says No.</span> <span id="s2592">Army secrets.</span> <span id="s2593">You cannot go on a train like that.”</span> <span id="s2594">I say, “But I was promised,” and he says, “I am sorry, you just have to go on your own, leave and go on your own.”</span> <span id="s2595">I said thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">NL: Oh, my word!</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">NS: So, I walked out--and I went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">NL: You didn’t need a pass, or a paper or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">NS: It was a very big confusion.</span> <span id="s2600">I walked out from there.</span> <span id="s2601">From that station, the office was near the main road like and there was a guard rail there and there was so much commotion.</span> <span id="s2602">There were trains going and trains going, and at that time a train with prisoners came, and they had to give them water and bread and so on, and guard them and so on, I just walked from there.</span> <span id="s2603">I was not running, just walking slowly through town, but I had a paper with me that I am a soldier, but if somebody stops me I figured I am going to say that I lost my train and I am lost, I am lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">I remember another thing going back to that.</span> <span id="s2605">While we were actually under, this is prior like a month or two months prior to that, and we were asked to escort a train of German prisoners, and we went about 40 or 50 miles into--close to the Polish border, which was in Galicia, because when escorts--they did not go the whole way.</span> <span id="s2606">The trains, originate let’s say, in Budapest or in Warsaw, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2607">They escorts.</span> <span id="s2608">They didn’t go from there up to the Donbas to the kolkhoz [Soviet collective farm].</span> <span id="s2609">They went 50 miles and another escort took over, and another escort and so on and this is the way it worked.</span> <span id="s2610">So we took over a train to escort it over, actually fresh troops to the front, and, in a way, I felt bad because they were mostly young guys.</span> <span id="s2611">So after about seven or eight hours traveling, they stopped at a small station, a small town, like a railroad station, where from the humanity point of view, they had to supply them with food and water.</span> <span id="s2612">And there was population standing over there, some women and some children, and I don’t think they were Jews, because there were no Jews living in those little towns.</span> <span id="s2613">But to show them the sympathy--the Russian against the Germans--they were against Germans now.</span> <span id="s2614">This is the way Ukrainians are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">So, the train stopped and they had over there big buckets of water.</span> <span id="s2616">Big buckets like for horses and they had heavy bread which was half sawdust and half bread, brown, and it was like long.</span> <span id="s2617">And in each car, they were throwing like they were packed, they were throwing ten breads and two buckets of water, like they don't deserve better.</span> <span id="s2618">So what happened, they opened the doors, they were like sliding doors, and they opened the doors first of all for fresh air and they had two bars in front of it.</span> <span id="s2619">Two bars, horizontal bars, this is where they were standing over there and I, being as a Russian soldier, looked there and facing them here they were all young 15, 16, 17 years old.</span> <span id="s2620">They came fresh from the front because some even had mud on their hands and feet and faces and they were bandaged and they were, naturally, prisoners.</span> <span id="s2621">A lot were in black uniforms.</span> <span id="s2622">They were mixed black and gray uniforms.</span> <span id="s2623">The population that were standing on the outside were cursing them: “You Nazis, you murderers!</span> <span id="s2624">You Nazis, you murderers.</span> <span id="s2625">And I will never forget: That here are German prisoners I am taking about SS, youngsters, brainwashed were standing there on a Russian train who’s going to their destiny, which they didn’t know where it’s going, but it’s going back east.</span> <span id="s2626">They are prisoners.</span> <span id="s2627">They give them bread and water.</span> <span id="s2628">The population here’s against them and they stood up, all of them especially in that train, I will never forget the picture what fanaticism can do to a human being stood up with a hand raised and says, “Long live the Fuhrer!</span> <span id="s2629">Heil Hitler!”</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">NL: Oh, my!</span> <span id="s2631">Unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s2633">Yes.</span> <span id="s2634">So brainwashed were those Germans.</span> <span id="s2635">No wonder they fought to the last day, to the last man and no wonder they were killing by order.</span> <span id="s2636">“Long live the Fuhrer!</span> <span id="s2637">Heil Hitler!”</span> <span id="s2638">in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">NL: On their way to their deaths, because all prisoners were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">NS: Yes, because I understand when they went back into Russian territory, those in gray uniforms were taken away.</span> <span id="s2641">They were actually separated from the SS.</span> <span id="s2642">The SS were all killed, machined gunned.</span> <span id="s2643">They used to bring the cattle trains into the Donbas kolkhoz into the mountains and they didn’t even kill them.</span> <span id="s2644">They used to dump them down into the ravines.</span> <span id="s2645">Revenge is revenge, you know, and I don’t mean that they deserved better, because they were all killers, but, anyway.</span> <span id="s2646">That picture I will never forget.</span> <span id="s2647">What fanatism fanaticism is!</span> <span id="s2648">And I was at that time 18, they were maybe 17 or 18.</span> <span id="s2649">But if you are a prisoner and you lost a battle, at least say I am sorry.</span> <span id="s2650">Now the Russian soldiers didn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s2651">Because they were used to it.</span> <span id="s2652">Apparently when they captured them.</span> <span id="s2653">They were used to that, but the population was outraged, so they started throwing stones and everything at them, and they closed right away the doors.</span> <span id="s2654">Then we escorted them for about 20 or 30 miles to the next and then another group took them over.</span> <span id="s2655">I personally never had animosity.</span> <span id="s2656">I felt in a way, I felt--I had a human side to me.</span> <span id="s2657">I felt bad because they were young and they were doomed, but I would not say I would take revenge and go and kill half of them, but I felt bad for them in a way, which is stupid.</span> <span id="s2658">Wasted lives.</span> <span id="s2659">I was satisfied with one thing that they won’t do anymore what they were supposed to do because they were already incapacitated.</span> <span id="s2660">At least they are in good hands, because if they had fallen in to American hands, I am sure they would have given them chewing gum and chocolates and blankets and denazification and in maybe two years they would have been out in the street, but not with the Russians.</span> <span id="s2661">So, it’s a shame that not all of the German prisoners, Nazis I am talking about, criminals, SS, did not fall in their hands.</span> <span id="s2662">Then they would have not been today no Nazis organization all over the world.</span> <span id="s2663">This is one episode as I remember, but getting back to that--when I left and this was the last time I had the uniforms on...</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">NL: You went to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">NS: I went A.W.O.L., because I figured, I am not saying that it was the last time I had my uniform on.</span> <span id="s2666">I am sorry.</span> <span id="s2667">But it was the last time that I every went--I wasn’t volunteering but not under escort going to fight.</span> <span id="s2668">So I took a chance and I went back.</span> <span id="s2669">I couldn’t go home.</span> <span id="s2670">I was afraid to jeopardize my uncle and my mother and aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">NL: Were you afraid that you would be searched?</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">NS: No, I was afraid that in a couple of days--I didn’t know how organized they are.</span> <span id="s2673">But I figured, they were not organized.</span> <span id="s2674">If it’s organized then they have a list and they know where they are going to look for me, but it wasn’t so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">NL: So, what did you do, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">NS: I went to a cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">NL: In Czernowitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">NS: Yes, and naturally, right away I took the uniform off and burned it and he said, “You know that you cannot be here because if they catch us they shall kill us too.”</span> <span id="s2679">And he says “Why did you run away?”</span> <span id="s2680">And I told him the whole story.</span> <span id="s2681">That nonsense.</span> <span id="s2682">In the meantime more news was coming back from friends which we knew, from neighbors.</span> <span id="s2683">Their sons fell, father and sons fell, you know, together.</span> <span id="s2684">I mean there was a massacre going on in the front line.</span> <span id="s2685">We know the battles over there.</span> <span id="s2686">So, “I was there for a--and then I went to another place and I was a couple of weeks there, and one day I was going to Zonio [phonetic] who was a dentist.</span> <span id="s2687">He was aged at that time and he was like 45 years old.</span> <span id="s2688">They needed dentists because he was also working for officers for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s2689">So I hide in his place and I was going on the road I got stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">NL: You were in civilian clothes, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">NS: Sure.</span> <span id="s2692">I was stopped.</span> <span id="s2693">No questions.</span> <span id="s2694">They didn’t even ask me for documents.</span> <span id="s2695">They just herded me together with another group of guys and they took me to the same place that I started in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2696">Like I mentioned before, if five are missing, five are going to capture.</span> <span id="s2697">I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">NL: What story did you give them this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2700">What can you do?</span> <span id="s2701">They took me.</span> <span id="s2702">First of all, he says, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s2703">and I told him, “I am going nowhere.”</span> <span id="s2704">and he said, “Why aren’t you in the army?”</span> <span id="s2705">and I said, “Well, I am going to the army.”</span> <span id="s2706">You know, I was young.</span> <span id="s2707">He said, “Why aren’t you fighting?”</span> <span id="s2708">because you didn’t see any men in the street.</span> <span id="s2709">The only men you saw were 80 year old men and mostly women.</span> <span id="s2710">There were no men in the streets.</span> <span id="s2711">Youngsters, or children nine or ten years old.</span> <span id="s2712">No males--naturally it was obvious.</span> <span id="s2713">There were patrols, not the NKVD, not the KGB, they were regular military police.</span> <span id="s2714">They were rounding up men for the front, so they took me in and where they took me?</span> <span id="s2715">To the same place where I started from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">Here, starts a new chapter completely because, when I came in there, I found over there guys told me that they ran away two or three time and they capture again.</span> <span id="s2717">Ukrainian, Jews, Poles, all kinds and even Russian soldiers that told me they went as far as Kharkov and they were brought back and forth and back and forth.</span> <span id="s2718">So, here starts another chapter of my story and that is a very interesting chapter because I will never forget this chapter.</span> <span id="s2719">And maybe this is the reason that I am alive today.</span> <span id="s2720">Coming in there, naturally, you have to register.</span> <span id="s2721">My name was Snyder, so my name was Natan.</span> <span id="s2722">You always had a middle name there, your father’s name is a middle name.</span> <span id="s2723">There, so they gave me the name and naturally, Natsha Yakobovitch Schneiderov.</span> <span id="s2724">Yakobovitch was my middle name.</span> <span id="s2725">And they attached me to a regular infantry group.</span> <span id="s2726">That means carrying by foot.</span> <span id="s2727">There were older guys in their 40's and 50's, 20's, 18, 30's and all kinds of groups, and they gave me another uniform there and another provision over there and we were not under guard because it was a free big army camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">That army camp was an old Romanian army camp, like I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s2729">Kaserne, they call in German.</span> <span id="s2730">It was built in such a way, in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s2731">It used to be from the First World War.</span> <span id="s2732">It used to be for the cavalry.</span> <span id="s2733">They had under low, low level they had stables for horses, for the Austrian-Hungarian War, and the First World War.</span> <span id="s2734">It was formed in a U, one wall, two walls, three walls, and the front was the entrance with a big gate, and it was huge.</span> <span id="s2735">Inside was housing and housing and second floor and third floor and forth floor up to the basement and the lower sub-basement, this was where the stables were.</span> <span id="s2736">There were there I would say at least 2000, and they used to bring in more, and some would depart and then more.</span> <span id="s2737">And, they assembled us there and they assigned us to a group and that group was housed in those three sections over there.</span> <span id="s2738">They gave us provisions and we were sitting, I remember it was a big room, with no benches, no beds, no nothing, and I was in a lousy uniform with some felt boots, shaved in the head, with a fur hat on my head, with a little satchel of provisions.</span> <span id="s2739">And naturally I had my; no, they didn’t give us the weapon at that time because the weapon they would give us as we come to the train, when we were attached to the regiment, they would give us weapons.</span> <span id="s2740">We had no weapons.</span> <span id="s2741">We were only recruits, and I was sitting there on the floor and it was night time and there was one little bulb in the ceiling, a very depressing scene.</span> <span id="s2742">We were there about 30 in the room and I was the only one Jew.</span> <span id="s2743">They were all Ukrainians and Poles and Russian and so on, and, as we were sitting, they knew that I am Jewish, by my accent or by my name or by my face, but they knew I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s2744">And they were talking and they said,” Oh, yeah, we are going in there and who knows if we are coming back?</span> <span id="s2745">And it’s bad.”</span> <span id="s2746">And someone says, “Oh, I like to go and fight,” and all kinds of stories like men have stories to say.</span> <span id="s2747">And one guy sitting across from me says to me.</span> <span id="s2748">“You know, you ‘stinking Jew’” and a smile, he says, “You know, when I come to the front line the first bullet, I will be behind you,” he says,” and instead of shooting the Germans, I will shoot you first.</span> <span id="s2749">I will be behind you and I will give you the first bullet your head in the back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">NL: And he is somebody in the Russian army now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">NS: Right, and I said, “Why would you do that?”</span> <span id="s2752">and he said, “Because you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s2753">You are a ‘stinking Jews’.”</span> <span id="s2754">In Ukrainian it’s called zhid porkhaty or zhid voniuchy, which means “stinking Jew”.</span> <span id="s2755">And I resented him that a lot because I see here is a guy who is going to fight with me and he’s supposed to be my comrade.</span> <span id="s2756">Comradery in war.</span> <span id="s2757">He’s going to shoot me in the back.</span> <span id="s2758">Instead of shooting the Germans he will shoot me.</span> <span id="s2759">I don’t understand that.</span> <span id="s2760">So, I made an excuse to go out, like, to the bathroom and I went and reported it to one of the officers outside and I salute and I said to him, “Somebody made a remark and called me a ‘stinking Jew’, and he said forget it.</span> <span id="s2761">“Disregard it.”</span> <span id="s2762">He was a Jew-hater too, so I figured there was no sense going to somebody higher.</span> <span id="s2763">I think he wasn’t a lieutenant, he was a sergeant or sergeant-major or whatever.</span> <span id="s2764">It doesn’t make sense to go up higher because you go to up higher somebody maybe the same way.</span> <span id="s2765">They don’t care.</span> <span id="s2766">He needs bodies.</span> <span id="s2767">So I let it go with his way, but I took one aim, my goal-to stay, again, and that was my aim.</span> <span id="s2768">Now, you must understand that when I was an active graduate from that mine school, demolition squad, we all had, they gave us grades, ranks, automatically, because we had educational course.</span> <span id="s2769">And I became a sergeant-major or whatever you want to call that, which we had three epaulets in here.</span> <span id="s2770">This is original.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">NL: But you threw those away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">NS: Oh, yes, and here I was only a soldier.</span> <span id="s2773">No epaulets at all.</span> <span id="s2774">But I had three epaulets in here.</span> <span id="s2775">So I figured; escape.</span> <span id="s2776">This was like four or five o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s2777">We were told that around eight o’clock they were going to march the whole band, empty, that because they were getting more recruits.</span> <span id="s2778">[unclear] I say, “Good”.</span> <span id="s2779">When I walked into here I saw that they had a sentry in front.</span> <span id="s2780">This is the building here, and I figured there is no way you can walk out from there and, going from the train again.</span> <span id="s2781">Maybe somebody would recognize me, so I had to find an escape route from here.</span> <span id="s2782">So what I did is, I start going out.</span> <span id="s2783">There were three or four floors--people were sitting there and some were playing balalaika, the guitar, and there were singing groups, and so on, all kinds singing together, and everybody knew that tomorrow morning at eight they would be all gone.</span> <span id="s2784">So what I did was, I start going around looking for an escape.</span> <span id="s2785">I wanted to assess the building.</span> <span id="s2786">I wanted to investigate where I am.</span> <span id="s2787">I am free to go.</span> <span id="s2788">No one stops you, not realizing that I walked out from there, another dozen were after me, Ukrainian, not the Ukrainian who made the remark to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">NL: Just because you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">NS: Just walking after me.</span> <span id="s2791">Why am I going?</span> <span id="s2792">So they walk after me.</span> <span id="s2793">Or somebody that had a sense of whatever it is and there must have been eight or ten walking after me.</span> <span id="s2794">It didn’t bother me that they were walking after me because you were free to walk around.</span> <span id="s2795">After all you’re not in a concentration camp, and I was walking down.</span> <span id="s2796">I was going down.</span> <span id="s2797">I figured that up was impossible, go down, down basement and then sub-basement, and there were stalls for horses but there were no horses but you could still smell the horses left from so many years.</span> <span id="s2798">There was no straw or anything but there were the stalls, where the horses were supposed to be with partitions like.</span> <span id="s2799">And I am going over there and it is ancient it must be about 200 years old, at that camp.</span> <span id="s2800">So, I am going around and looking around and I see that every window which you look, tiny little windows, you look out is very low.</span> <span id="s2801">If somebody is walking you will see only his heels.</span> <span id="s2802">So we are walking around and I see those guys behind me and I says, “Where are you going guys?”</span> <span id="s2803">And they say, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s2804">And I said, “Well, I am just walking around,” And they said, “Well, when you walk around, we will walk with you.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">NL: They wanted to escape, too.</span> <span id="s2806">Now you had nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2807">NS: They were all young guys.</span> <span id="s2808">So I said, “I don’t know you guys.”</span> <span id="s2809">And they said, “You don’t have to know us.</span> <span id="s2810">What do you think we are stupid, we go there and die like flies?”</span> <span id="s2811">So, for some reason, we had some confidence in each other.</span> <span id="s2812">I figure we are together in it.</span> <span id="s2813">So, as we go, it goes around this way and that way and it was like catacombs, in and out.</span> <span id="s2814">So, finally, we came to a big big grand door with three or four steps going up to that door.</span> <span id="s2815">It was a big old iron door, and the door must have been about two tons weight, but rusty.</span> <span id="s2816">And across the door was a big heavy, that alone weighed about 1,000 pounds, big bar.</span> <span id="s2817">And, at the end of the bar was a big old fashioned, must of been from the Kaiser Franz Joseph from the Austrian-Hungarian, was a big lock the size of this tape recorder, old fashioned.</span> <span id="s2818">So I looked in it and they looked in it and I said, “I wonder what is behind that door.”</span> <span id="s2819">So I figured why should I use my muscles?</span> <span id="s2820">I says, “Guys, do you want to start ripping that lock?”</span> <span id="s2821">And they ripped and ripped and twisted and twisted and that lock was snapping off.</span> <span id="s2822">And then they took that heavy bar--two people had to lift that bar aside.</span> <span id="s2823">And here I am facing there were two doors, big iron doors and there were cobwebs over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Now, you must understand, this is early in the morning.</span> <span id="s2825">It is like five in the morning, and I am looking out.</span> <span id="s2826">And finally, I open I would say like like half an inch, and I see the sunlight, I mean the daylight, coming in.</span> <span id="s2827">In summer at 5:30 in the morning, there is sun out, well, daylight, and I look out and I see pavement and a side street and I say, “This is it!”</span> <span id="s2828">But, I look inside and I see a sentry going, so what happens is, this is the entrance.</span> <span id="s2829">We were in the opposite of the army camp.</span> <span id="s2830">There are two sentries going.</span> <span id="s2831">One starts on this side and one starts on this corner and they meet together and they turn around and they go back.</span> <span id="s2832">They turn around like the palace guards.</span> <span id="s2833">They coming back, they meet each other, turn around and go back.</span> <span id="s2834">I observed that and I said, “No people in the street.”</span> <span id="s2835">That’s dangerous.</span> <span id="s2836">You walk out.</span> <span id="s2837">They said eight o’clock, could be nine or ten.</span> <span id="s2838">They are going to look for us.</span> <span id="s2839">We have to assemble there and march out, going toward war.</span> <span id="s2840">So I am waiting until we see people coming up on the street.</span> <span id="s2841">We want to see more people walking in the street.</span> <span id="s2842">So I said to the guys.</span> <span id="s2843">“Look, we have one chance to leave if you listen to me.</span> <span id="s2844">Organize.</span> <span id="s2845">Anybody who is not going to listen to me, you know you get shot on the spot, so be organized and listen very carefully.</span> <span id="s2846">We have to wait until the day is going to be more public.</span> <span id="s2847">More traffic.”</span> <span id="s2848">So, we waited maybe about an hour and a half or so on to about seven or seven thirty in the morning.</span> <span id="s2849">We saw traffic, women going to work and men and whatever.</span> <span id="s2850">Children going to school.</span> <span id="s2851">Those sentries are going the same.</span> <span id="s2852">We didn’t know when they changed the sentries, but I opened again.</span> <span id="s2853">We could hear the sentries going by.</span> <span id="s2854">I knew they are away.</span> <span id="s2855">It must have been the center of that wall, I said to myself, “Why should I be the first?</span> <span id="s2856">I’ll get shot and, besides, if I go out first, they will be disorganized in the back and they will run out like rabbits behind me and we will all get shot.”</span> <span id="s2857">So there are two points which made me be the last one: I will organize them in a quiet way and they should go out one by one, and I will be the last one and then I will know that no one is behind me rushing, and this is what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">NL: And they agreed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">NS: They agreed, and I said, “Good luck,” and we shook hands.</span> <span id="s2860">They were all from different towns.</span> <span id="s2861">Ukrainians, from different towns, and I didn’t care what happened, if they participated in murders, or their parents.</span> <span id="s2862">They were all youngsters on, but we had the same fate, we had the same destiny at that time.</span> <span id="s2863">All the sentries were parting and going to their post to their quarters, and I opened the door and said, “You go.</span> <span id="s2864">Don’t run, just go to the middle of the street and walk.”</span> <span id="s2865">This took a good half hour.</span> <span id="s2866">One left, one right, one left, one right.</span> <span id="s2867">I was the last one.</span> <span id="s2868">The same thing, open.</span> <span id="s2869">And I remember when I walked out from there, the two doors you see, when I was in the inside I could hold the doors back, the doors...</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">Tape five, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">NL: So, how did you get through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">NS: Okay, as you walked out from there, you must understand my head was shaved and I was in a shabby uniform.</span> <span id="s2873">And I was walking very quietly with the fear that at any time I will hear the word, “Stop!”</span> <span id="s2874">But, that sound did not come.</span> <span id="s2875">It didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s2876">Maybe there was, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">NL: You got lost in traffic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">NS: I was lost in traffic.</span> <span id="s2879">Yes, and I walked straight to my aunt who was the mother of my cousin the dentist.</span> <span id="s2880">And I walked in and she said, “You know, your mother is trying to give somebody a thousand rubles to take you out of there, and I think she already gave the deposit or something, and she did.</span> <span id="s2881">The money was lost.</span> <span id="s2882">Somebody who knows somebody, an officer who likes to drink and so on, but anyway, you are out, thank God.</span> <span id="s2883">But, now what?</span> <span id="s2884">You cannot stay here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">NL: You were still in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">NS: Yes, take off your uniform and we will give you some shorts or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">NL: But your head is shaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">NS: That’s it.</span> <span id="s2889">That was the one mark which I had.</span> <span id="s2890">Put a hat on, a sport hat on my head, but “You can not stay here.</span> <span id="s2891">I will notify your mother.”</span> <span id="s2892">She ran to my mother and my mother was very thrilled, and the family knew it, I’m alive and I’m out.</span> <span id="s2893">Don’t tell.</span> <span id="s2894">The rubles are gone.</span> <span id="s2895">For good.</span> <span id="s2896">Now, we had to find a place that we could hide out.</span> <span id="s2897">This was in October and we tried, but one members of the family were afraid to take us, because they’d get shot, but finally they found a woman.</span> <span id="s2898">Actually I was over a cousin, an elderly cousin, but she was afraid too, because she used to have some commissars coming over there, because her brother worked in a forest.</span> <span id="s2899">He was like a manager of a forest and the commissars used to come to dinners.</span> <span id="s2900">So she was afraid.</span> <span id="s2901">So, finally, they found a woman whose husband and son was on the battle front.</span> <span id="s2902">They were taken into the army and she had a daughter fourteen or fifteen year old daughter and she is in need.</span> <span id="s2903">She can use the money.</span> <span id="s2904">So my mother told her that she would pay her, I don’t remember how much, so much for a day and supplies and food to keep me in hiding.</span> <span id="s2905">And there I was in hiding end of October, November, December, January and February.</span> <span id="s2906">For four months I was hiding there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">NL: You didn’t dare go out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2908">NS: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2909">There I was in hiding and she lived on the first floor and on the front, there was a clinic, a regular clinic where a lot of Russian, not army but Russian officials, they used to come to the clinic.</span> <span id="s2910">They used to park their jeeps and army cars and so on in the courtyard, so I was in hiding in a room, a dark room.</span> <span id="s2911">Nobody used to come into the house.</span> <span id="s2912">Sometime it became so dangerous because somebody wanted to come in and drink water or need water for their radiator, so it became dangerous later, about six or seven weeks later.</span> <span id="s2913">She used to send me up to the second floor where a woman lived over there.</span> <span id="s2914">Her husband worked in the railroad, like I said.</span> <span id="s2915">He wasn’t taken into the army, he was a railroad specialist.</span> <span id="s2916">They needed him for the railroad, and he was all day away and she used to hide me on the second floor.</span> <span id="s2917">Night time I used to come sleep downstairs, until they made my preparation to get me out of there to Romania, across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">NL: Oh, this is still Bukovina?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">NS: Czernowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">NL: This is now Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">NS: Yes, Russia, and they will get me over to Romania.</span> <span id="s2922">Now in the meantime, Warsaw fell, Budapest fell--The Germans were almost crushed.</span> <span id="s2923">The Russian are already on the outskirts of Berlin, the Allies were closer in.</span> <span id="s2924">Remember, it’s a month before victory and a lot of troops came back, and in the meantime they decimated all those bandits.</span> <span id="s2925">They cleaned them up.</span> <span id="s2926">They deported their wives and children all to Russia.</span> <span id="s2927">Relocated whole villages.</span> <span id="s2928">You know that they are specialists in deporting.</span> <span id="s2929">They relocated Russian families to here and took out three-quarters, half of the Ukrainian population and deported them back to Russia, because they didn’t trust them anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">So, we knew that the victory was going to come any day, but I had to get out of there.</span> <span id="s2931">In that tumult in that confusion, I crossed the border.</span> <span id="s2932">This is where my mother negotiated.</span> <span id="s2933">And, in the meantime, more refugees came back from concentration camps, and as far as from Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and from Transnistria.</span> <span id="s2934">And people were wandering around looking like skeletons and looking for families from the leftovers.</span> <span id="s2935">And it was coming and going, coming and going, and my mother.</span> <span id="s2936">You know, you must understand there were a lot of guys doing the false documents, collections.</span> <span id="s2937">They were forging documents, working with Zionist organizations or individuals.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">NL: What was her contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">NS: Her contact was with somebody who forged my documents, made me under the name Ruby Weissberg, a youngster who was born in Suceava, was South Bukovina.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">NL: Old Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">NS: Yes, across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">NL: What about herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">NS: Nothing.</span> <span id="s2944">She stayed there.</span> <span id="s2945">She wasn’t in danger.</span> <span id="s2946">I was in danger, if the NKVD, the KGB had caught me they would have shot me on sight.</span> <span id="s2947">So she made the papers like I was Ruby Weissberg and I was born in Suceava, the same age.</span> <span id="s2948">Ruby Weissberg really lived in Suceava and he died in a concentration camp with his entire family, but I was the Ruby Weissberg who actually survived.</span> <span id="s2949">My family all perished and I am going back to Suceava.</span> <span id="s2950">I am coming from a concentration camp, I was a skeleton, you know, a survivor.</span> <span id="s2951">But even that was dangerous because they still can capture you and put you in the army.</span> <span id="s2952">So I was given this document, and with a contact through a peasant and taken to another town.</span> <span id="s2953">And in that town I had my cousin who also worked as a manager of big big farms over there and he kept me there.</span> <span id="s2954">It was about five miles from the border and I stayed with him there as his assistant there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">NL: How did you get there?</span> <span id="s2956">You walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">NS: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2958">I went with the train, there very simple under Ruby Weissberg the other name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">NL: Your hair was already grown?</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">NS: Yes, Nathan Snyder doesn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s2961">I was stopped many times.</span> <span id="s2962">And when I was stopped I showed my papers and I go through.</span> <span id="s2963">And I lived there for a couple of weeks, and there arrangements were made with the peasants.</span> <span id="s2964">A whole organization...</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">NL: Which your mother worked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">NS: Yes worked out.</span> <span id="s2967">I was sitting there on the straw, not under it but on it, and we came to the border and showed my papers that I am Ruby Weissberg and am going home.</span> <span id="s2968">I am coming from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2969">And I crossed over the border to Romania, and that was a hassle by itself because they had to stop us for hours.</span> <span id="s2970">And they had to search the wagon and they searched us, and there were a lot of refugees from Romania who came back from Transnistria going back into Old Romania.</span> <span id="s2971">Who don’t live in Bukovina under the Russians.</span> <span id="s2972">They claimed they’re Romanian citizens.</span> <span id="s2973">There were a whole group of people over there.</span> <span id="s2974">I lived as Ruby Weissberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">NL: With whom, did you stay with someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2976">NS: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s2977">I crossed the border and I did not stay in Suceava.</span> <span id="s2978">Oh, no because in Suceava somebody from the town says that Ruby Weissberg didn’t look like you, so, I was registered there but I had to move on because his name was there.</span> <span id="s2979">So, from there I went straight down to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s2980">I took the train and this was already, in the meantime, peace came.</span> <span id="s2981">It was after May, I came straight down to the train officially, and took the train down to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s2982">And in Bucharest was the main Zionist nucleus organization with preparation for Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">NL: And that is what you intended to do?</span> <span id="s2984">Did you work this out with mother, too?</span> <span id="s2985">And she would then re-unite with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">NS: Yes, I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s2987">Yes.</span> <span id="s2988">My aim was to get out from there because we knew that even the king abdicated from Romania.</span> <span id="s2989">And then Romania became a socialist, not a communist government, it was a socialist government and the Prime Minister was a Jewish woman, I forgot her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">NL: Anna somebody.</span> <span id="s2991">She was killed later.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">NS: Yes, it was like this.</span> <span id="s2993">It was very bad for the rich.</span> <span id="s2994">It was better for the poor.</span> <span id="s2995">It was more equal.</span> <span id="s2996">It was a socialism not communism, there was equality...</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">NL: Was it Anna Pauker?</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">NS: Anna Pauker.</span> <span id="s2999">They were hunting down Nazis back and forth and those criminals Romanians and prisoners came back from Russia.</span> <span id="s3000">Two years later it became a really communist government, a satellite, but it wasn’t a satellite in that year.</span> <span id="s3001">So Zionism was open, free, I would say 1945, ‘46, up till ‘47 Zionist flourished all over.</span> <span id="s3002">They were from Palestine shlichim [Emissary] coming over organized.</span> <span id="s3003">Hashomer Hatzair and Gordonia [other names] and Mizrachi.</span> <span id="s3004">They were organizing.</span> <span id="s3005">[tape off, then on] Now Israel was not born at that time because Israel was born in ‘48, but the movements and transports.</span> <span id="s3006">They were trying to get Jews out, as much as the survivors left over from the Holocaust, from concentration camps, from Hungaria, [Hungary] from Czechoslovakia, from wherever they can, get from Romania out.</span> <span id="s3007">Illegally, naturally, into Palestine.</span> <span id="s3008">The English didn’t allow this into Palestine.</span> <span id="s3009">And I was in Bucharest and I went to live with one of my cousins which is, her father and my father were brothers.</span> <span id="s3010">My father had two brothers.</span> <span id="s3011">I’m sorry, her mother was a sister to my father.</span> <span id="s3012">My father had two brothers and they were deported with their wives and children to the concentration camp Transnistria.</span> <span id="s3013">But they were very neat and very obvious clean and they couldn’t take the lice and the diphtheria and the dysentery and all the sickness and they committed suicide.</span> <span id="s3014">They threw themselves in a well.</span> <span id="s3015">I was told later.</span> <span id="s3016">In a big well they threw themselves, those old fashioned wells where you bring up the water on a chain.</span> <span id="s3017">They committed suicide because they could not take that life.</span> <span id="s3018">So nobody was left on my father’s side except that my father had an older sister and this was her daughter who lived in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s3019">She lived there all her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">NL: She wasn’t hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">NS: No, she wasn’t hurt.</span> <span id="s3022">Her husband was a stock broker with a beautiful home there and they had a son who lives now in Israel.</span> <span id="s3023">He was at that time, studying to be an engineer and I lived there.</span> <span id="s3024">It was my first freedom.</span> <span id="s3025">Do whatever you want to, we don’t care, and go to movies and enjoy life.</span> <span id="s3026">What are you going to do with yourself?</span> <span id="s3027">Do you want to go to college and study and become something?</span> <span id="s3028">I said, “No.</span> <span id="s3029">I want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s3030">I want to go to Palestine and fight.”</span> <span id="s3031">Now we don't have the Nazis, but let’s fight the English because the English don’t give us the land.</span> <span id="s3032">And I was influenced from before, so I joined some organizations.</span> <span id="s3033">And naturally, Betar organization was at that time the choice, toss up between Betar and Ben Gurion’s party, which was Gordonia, Mapai, so I joined a group which was Betar, not realizing at that time that it was part of the Irgun Zvi Leumi, which Begin was the leader.</span> <span id="s3034">We heard stories, about blowing up, the war is going on, and so on.</span> <span id="s3035">They took us to a special camp to train us to fight and I told them I had been in the demolition squad and that they could use me for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">NL: Perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">NS: So, they took us up in Transylvania, because Transylvania belonged to Romania now.</span> <span id="s3038">They took it away from Hungaria, [Hungary] because Romania joined the Allies they gave them back everything except northern Bukovina and Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s3039">So I went to Transylvania, someplace in the mountains we had a camp.</span> <span id="s3040">It was like a summer camp, in a top of a mountain.</span> <span id="s3041">And there they trained us and they called us madrichim, teachers who helped to teach others.</span> <span id="s3042">And they taught us judo, knives, demolition, small arms, sharp-shooting, rope-climbing, all kinds of hand-to-hand fighting and our personal madriach was a man by the name of Yehuda Avriel.</span> <span id="s3043">Yehuda Avriel plays a big chapter in the Israeli history.</span> <span id="s3044">Yehuda Avriel was born in Austria.</span> <span id="s3045">He was a solid guy, husky guy, with blond hair, reddish hair, who came as a child to Israel and, naturally, he joined with an underground organization.</span> <span id="s3046">Later, I understand that he was an emissary of Ben Gurion.</span> <span id="s3047">You read it in the books.</span> <span id="s3048">Ben Gurion sent him to buy weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">NL: To Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">NS: Czechoslovakia, to buy weapons and, while he was there, he also came to be our madriach, not day by day but every other day he was there.</span> <span id="s3051">And he personally gave us judo lessons and I remember that I had to combat fight with him.</span> <span id="s3052">He was a husky guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">NL: My, oh my, what a story!</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">NS: Yehuda Avriel saved me, not saved me, but helped me a lot eight years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s3055">NL: In Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">NS: In Israel yes, when I had to come to the United States with the American Embassy because of my two names, Weissberg, Ruby and Natan Snyder.</span> <span id="s3057">He is the one that helped me.</span> <span id="s3058">At that time he was Secretary of State, at that time for a short while, in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">NL: Wasn’t he an Ambassador to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">NS: He was an ambassador later when Israel became a State, he was the first ambassador to Romania, because he was stationed there.</span> <span id="s3061">But we were there having a good time, we were trained, really, I remember we had all kinds of exercises with the hands tied together.</span> <span id="s3062">Our heads was trained to open doors, in case your prisoners tried to escape, and knife-throwing, I mean we were the best knife throwers.</span> <span id="s3063">I had callouses all over my muscles.</span> <span id="s3064">I mean that they made us fighting machines.</span> <span id="s3065">And we were two girls and about 18 guys, 20 of us, and we said we will become madrichim when we come to Israel.</span> <span id="s3066">When we come to Israel before, when Israel will become a state, our aim was to come there to get the English before Israel became a state.</span> <span id="s3067">We would automatically become officers in the Israeli army and we would train others.</span> <span id="s3068">We would organize the illegal aliyah [emigration] throughout Europe, and they would send us to Italy, to Czechoslovakia to organize how to get illegals to trains and ships and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">NL: How long did you stay in Transylvania?</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">NS: We stayed there for about four or five months.</span> <span id="s3071">There was good food and we ate and we had a nice stream there on top of the mountains.</span> <span id="s3072">And we could shoot and nobody could come there because it was on top of the mountain, and if somebody did come through there, we said it was a summer camp.</span> <span id="s3073">Only a hunter could come there.</span> <span id="s3074">When we were on top of the peak, we could look down.</span> <span id="s3075">The rest of the mountains look valleys, and it was very, very top.</span> <span id="s3076">You had to climb for four or five hours to get to the top, that plateau and it was not too far from Kolozsvar [Clug], Klausenberg.</span> <span id="s3077">And it was very very high, but from there we had to travel on a mountain train.</span> <span id="s3078">I remember a small mountain train and from there we took another little transportation and then we walked for a day and then another four hours climbing, so it was out of civilization.</span> <span id="s3079">And this is where we had our camp.</span> <span id="s3080">And actually for the government it was illegal because we trained to be terrorists, soldiers, but we helped a lot--I was selected because of that experience in demolition and so on.</span> <span id="s3081">And this is where we stayed over there and after we were finished with the course they sent us to a different towns.</span> <span id="s3082">I went to [unclear] to organize a group, and some went to Bucharest, back and some went to Jassy, and all kinds of cities, Satmar...</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">NL: To organize Zionist groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">NS: Yes.</span> <span id="s3085">In the meantime, Betar itself did not have chalutzim, hachshara.</span> <span id="s3086">Mostly they were from Mapai, Mapam, Agudat Israel.</span> <span id="s3087">They have the hachsharas which means for the future chalutzim pioneers of Israel, and this ‘46.</span> <span id="s3088">My mother came in ‘46 over the border illegally, but they let all of the Jews who wanted to leave for some reason.</span> <span id="s3089">You had to pay some money there, but most of the Jews left Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s3090">They let anybody go, anybody that wants to to.</span> <span id="s3091">So, my mother, and my sister and my uncle they all came and they settled in Kolozsvar until they came to Israel.</span> <span id="s3092">So I was not too far from my mother.</span> <span id="s3093">I lived there as Ruby Weissberg, not as Natan Snyder, so I came there as a cousin.</span> <span id="s3094">I wasn’t their son.</span> <span id="s3095">No one from the neighbors knew that because I was afraid.</span> <span id="s3096">Slowly slowly the government became more communistic, more taken over by the Russian, more controlled by the Russian.</span> <span id="s3097">And Anna Pauker left and [unclear] somebody else came there and it became a terror.</span> <span id="s3098">It became a totalitarian regime and I was participating, taking part in different groups of aliyah, and, as a matter of fact, we escorted a couple of groups to Constanta, but we didn’t go because our aim was...</span></p> <p><span id="s3099">NL: That was illegal by this time, I suppose, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3100">NS: It was legal for the Romanian government but illegal for the English.</span> <span id="s3101">They didn’t want the English to find out, but we used to transport them and to show them how quiet they had to be.</span> <span id="s3102">Those boats were not actually in the main port, they were outside, with little barges, and some were going to Yugoslavia, Belgrade, to Italy, to Trieste.</span> <span id="s3103">Some were going to Budapest, Hungaria [Hungary],Vienna, and then Italy, so every point leads to Jerusalem, let me say, a lot of aliyahs and I said, “When are we going to go?”</span> <span id="s3104">and they said, “You are the main guys, you have to organize so that the others should go.”</span> <span id="s3105">Thousands went.</span> <span id="s3106">This was when Cyprus was filled up, with all the Jews mostly from Romania who were caught illegally.</span> <span id="s3107">And, I would say, not all of them, but maybe a quarter of the Cyprus Jews were the ones which I escorted and my heart was breaking.</span> <span id="s3108">I had to take them and then come back.</span> <span id="s3109">They were going and I said, “Good bye, good luck,” and I had to go back because more others had to go.</span> <span id="s3110">And this was going on until the government started clamping down and one day they made Zionist organization, Zionist movement, illegal.</span> <span id="s3111">This happened in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">It became a real communistic authoritarian dictatorship.</span> <span id="s3113">They declared illegal.</span> <span id="s3114">Naturally, it won’t disappear overnight--Zionism or the Zionist organization, so they went underground.</span> <span id="s3115">And, at that time, I joined a hachshara group and I was afraid to go to my mother now too much.</span> <span id="s3116">I used to come as a visitor there and there were a lot of Romanian Jews from Czernowitz who lived in Kolozsvar, and they were waiting to come to Israel.</span> <span id="s3117">You had to have a passport and you had to pay so much money to get authorization, legally, to leave Romania to go to Pale--to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">Israel was not born at that time.</span> <span id="s3119">This is 1948, but in the meantime it became illegal to be a Zionist, so I had to join a hachshara group and I joined in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s3120">I figured it was better for me to be in a big city because we had lessons during the war.</span> <span id="s3121">In a big city, you get lost in the crowd and this was supported by the Zionist organization from Palestine and we had help from the Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s3122">We got a lot of help, packages came from the United States.</span> <span id="s3123">Most of the food was from the United States, and we had to go and work.</span> <span id="s3124">We lived in a nice, nice mansion outside the city and we had our own songs and dances, and we learned Hebrew and we had all kinds of lecturers.</span> <span id="s3125">Madrichim used to come there from different kibbutzim, from Degania Alef from Degania Bet and from all kinds of places, and they were telling us some of the stories, learning about history and so on.</span> <span id="s3126">And it became worse and worse and worse for the Zionist organization because they really clamped down and tightened up and then they made restrictions of quotas of leaving the country.</span> <span id="s3127">And--Israel became a state in 1948 and Avriel became the first Ambassador from Israel.</span> <span id="s3128">He didn’t have to go too far.</span> <span id="s3129">He just stayed there and took over the Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">NL: Change your clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">NS: Yes, and he became the first Ambassador.</span> <span id="s3132">And naturally it was celebrated and that was in May, 1948, and we all celebrated and so on, and the Zionist organization became illegal, underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">NL: Even though Romania recognized the State, the Zionist movement was illegal?</span></p> <p><span id="s3134">NS: It was “decadent”.</span> <span id="s3135">It was pressure from Russia so, naturally, we had to go underground.</span> <span id="s3136">Dissolved that place completely and some of our group members did leave because so many places were there.</span> <span id="s3137">Now, we were supposed to go on a train, one transport four o’clock it wasn’t illegal.</span> <span id="s3138">It was legal.</span> <span id="s3139">There was a train I remember and we were supposed to meet in a small little--ten kilometers outside the city.</span> <span id="s3140">We will board a train which goes actually, from there it goes to Timisoara and from Timisoara we would illegally cross the border to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s3141">We had already people waiting there for us to cross the border--and from there we would go through Yugoslavia to Italy.</span> <span id="s3142">And at that border we would go straight and there was a ship waiting for us and, if we get caught, we get caught.</span> <span id="s3143">And four o’clock we were supposed to leave and at 12 o’clock one of our chiefs came in and, “Sorry, you are not going to go.”</span> <span id="s3144">And I said, “Why?</span> <span id="s3145">I mean, we did our duty,” and he said, “Your places were sold.”</span> <span id="s3146">I said, “What do you mean ‘were sold’,” and he said, “We sold your places for many thousands of dollars because we need money.</span> <span id="s3147">That money we need.</span> <span id="s3148">I don’t know for what reasons, for ships, for weapons but for that reason we sold your places.</span> <span id="s3149">Remember, as a good patriot we did not do it to put in our pockets.</span> <span id="s3150">Your place is, If a very rich Jew wants to go, he pays $10,000.”</span> <span id="s3151">“Let me go.”</span> <span id="s3152">So that was the reason our places were sold and we were very upset.</span> <span id="s3153">He told us, we were waiting so long.</span> <span id="s3154">We helped others and now we cannot get out.</span> <span id="s3155">I had to run because my name was in danger.</span> <span id="s3156">And I knew from experience, that as soon as it became more totalitarian, they will have the KGB here and maybe Nathan Snyder is a deserter and they are looking for him, and how long can I survive under Ruby Weissberg.</span> <span id="s3157">I was in danger so I had to run.</span> <span id="s3158">So I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s3159">My mother used to say, “Don’t come anymore here.</span> <span id="s3160">You are endangering us.”</span> <span id="s3161">So I used to go there and stay for a couple of hours and come back.</span> <span id="s3162">And did some black-market in the meantime with one of my cousins the professor, which is now in Israel, with Salamis and [unclear] from Kolozsvar and back.</span> <span id="s3163">We traveled around the country, but then I was told that it tightened up so much that you couldn’t walk on the street without having a labor pass.</span> <span id="s3164">You had to work some place.</span> <span id="s3165">And if you didn’t work, you were called, “hooligan,” a “parasite” and they take you to a labor camp, which was on the [unclear].</span> <span id="s3166">They used to build big dams over there, and all the “parasites” worked there.</span> <span id="s3167">I didn’t have a job.</span> <span id="s3168">I couldn’t work some place.</span> <span id="s3169">So finally a friend of mine and I--Robert Lable, he was one of the top madrichim in the Zionist organization and he got a job in Bucharest in the Ministry of Agriculture and he took me in there to work.</span> <span id="s3170">Somehow he took me in there to work and we started both off as clerks in the stationery department, to give us stationery.</span> <span id="s3171">By the time we disappeared from there, I was head of a department and he was head of a department.</span> <span id="s3172">I was under Weissberg, Ruby and he was under Robert Lable.</span> <span id="s3173">That bluff that he played there was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s3174">First of all, you know when you get a job there with the government, you have to have an autobiography.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">NL: I don’t think we’ll have time for that and I want to get the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">NS: My father was a shoemaker and my mother used to go home to home washing clothes.</span> <span id="s3177">I was very, very poor and I come from Suceava, and it so happened that the Weissberg’s were very poor people.</span> <span id="s3178">I was in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s3179">They made me a [unclear].</span> <span id="s3180">They want to send me up to the Komsomol, and he made another story, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3181">NL: All fabricated.</span></p> <p><span id="s3182">NS: All fabricated and I bluffed him so much that we came to meetings and I had to tell him my life story and I was a double-agent, like.</span> <span id="s3183">I was a..</span> <span id="s3184">.</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">NL: Dual personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">NS: I lived with him in the apartment and he said, “How many times can you bluff them?</span> <span id="s3187">One day you will make a mistake.”</span> <span id="s3188">I have a picture now, I look like a proletariat.</span> <span id="s3189">My name was every week on the workers’ employees’ bulletin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">NL: Oh, my word.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">NS: I have my name there, the Man of the Year, the Man of the Month, of the Day...</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">NL: Proletarian Hero!</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">NS: Right!</span> <span id="s3194">And I bluffed them so much.</span> <span id="s3195">Then I got the word that you are taking chances in your own hand.</span> <span id="s3196">Disappear.</span> <span id="s3197">Disappear, from the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">NL: Who warned you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">NS: The Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s3200">Disappear.</span> <span id="s3201">Both of us.</span> <span id="s3202">Take off.</span> <span id="s3203">Just one day don’t go into work.</span> <span id="s3204">We both ended up in the Israeli Consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">NL: The Israeli Consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">NS: We took refuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">NL: You took refuge and you got immunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">NS: No, they didn’t know we were there.</span> <span id="s3209">We walked in and we never walked out till the day I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">NL: Which was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">NS: 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">NL: So you had to stay in Romania, then, another three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">NS: No, I was in the Consulate off and on.</span> <span id="s3214">I left and out, no, this wasn’t four years.</span> <span id="s3215">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s3216">The Israeli government was recognized in 1948.</span> <span id="s3217">I was there about one year in hiding.</span> <span id="s3218">Who was the ambassador?</span> <span id="s3219">Yehuda Avriel.</span> <span id="s3220">I was in the basement with all the machineries, all of the communications and so on, I was trusted...</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">[recording stops for several movements]</span></p> <p><span id="s3222">NL: I’m afraid we’re coming to the end of the tape, Mr. Snyder, and so I have to say we have to finish now.</span> <span id="s3223">Thank you very, very much for this exceedingly interesting and valuable testimony.</span></p></body></html>
