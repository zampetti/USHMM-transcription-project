and uh lived there 'til my...'til I was twenty- seven, when I married and I left Bratislava to live in another uh city--in _ilina, in the northern part of Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s21">During uh these early years, tell me a little about your parents and the family that you grew up in.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s23">My father was a furrier.</span> <span id="s24">And I was the eighth child in the family; so that means a big family.</span> <span id="s25">We went through the First World War.</span> <span id="s26">This was very hard time.</span> <span id="s27">When I was five years old, I had to still get up early--five o'clock in the morning--and stand in the queue to get bread or milk, or whatever was available.</span> <span id="s28">It...I started to go still in the Hungarian schools.</span> <span id="s29">Then later on...and actually later in...in the grade uh nine and ten-- what you could call here nine, uh grade nine and ten--I went to, in a commercial Schule [school].</span> <span id="s30">That's a school...and had my education mixed German and Hungarian.</span> <span id="s31">When I was sixteen, I started to uh...I went as apprentice in a business to be trained as a salesman.</span> <span id="s32">And it was a textile business.</span> <span id="s33">I worked there from 1926 'til 1930.</span> <span id="s34">Then I was called up to the army for the service.</span> <span id="s35">I did my eighteen months.</span> <span id="s36">After eighteen months service, I started to work as a commercial traveller [NB: a salesman], which I did 'til uh 1942--with certain interruptions, because I was representing the firma...the company AGFA, photo company.</span> <span id="s37">And in 1938, I was dismissed because of my Jewish origin.</span> <span id="s38">After that, I had different jobs--whatever I could find to feed my family--because I married in 1930 uh...37, in January.</span> <span id="s39">We had a son in November [1937]; and in...(cough) we lived this time already in _ilina where I was travelling around a lot.</span> <span id="s40">We choose _ilina as a point to live because that was more or less in the center of the country, my region....</span> <span id="s41">How you call it?</span> <span id="s42">Where...where I had to work, and I could be more often with my...with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And if we were to think now about the time when the war broke out, could you tell us your memory of the actual beginning of the war, as it affected you and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: The first uh...that was already before the war, that I lost my job.</span> <span id="s45">And the second thing was affected me personally is, when the new Slovakian state was established we was thrown out from our apartment what we had in a quiet uh good uh neighborhood and had to move out in the outen [NB: outer] uh reg...region of that...of the city.</span> <span id="s46">So this been actually only everything personally.</span> <span id="s47">Then I had different jobs and worked around.</span> <span id="s48">Then ...when the...the day-to-day life naturally was always full of uh fear and uh...tension; because every...every night or every day, when you heard somebody walking by under your window, you never knew if he is coming to pick you up or what...what is he will.</span> <span id="s49">What is tense, the way if the sound of the steps will stop in front of you, or if they are going further up.</span> <span id="s50">So in...1940, 1941, we been once picked up from the Hlinka Guard to taken away to be deported.</span> <span id="s51">Through some unknown uh reasons, we been...after a few days we been released, and we came back.</span> <span id="s52">But before, when we been taken in...in the camp, in these camps where there are concentrated uh people, they took away half our belongings.</span> <span id="s53">Which...which we didn't get back when we have been released, naturally.</span> <span id="s54">So that made our lives even again very hard, because no income but needs was here.</span> <span id="s55">So we struggled through 'til the second uh time.</span> <span id="s56">One day after Yom Kippur in 1942--it was the 21st or 22nd of uh September--a knock on the door for two men in civil clothing, two men in the...in the Hlinka Guard uniform.</span> <span id="s57">"You have a half an hour time.</span> <span id="s58">Pick up your belongings and follow us.”</span> <span id="s59">So they took us to the camp where we arrived.</span> <span id="s60">They let us stay in in front of the office on the camp.</span> <span id="s61">I didn't know what is going on inside, because it was a big excitement.</span> <span id="s62">After a while, a man came out with a bundle of uh papers which later ...which I found out later was the list of the deportees, every where going forty...forty names of every list.</span> <span id="s63">So when he came out, he said, "Take your belongings and follow me.”</span> <span id="s64">And the train was already prepared, standing there not far away...about hundred twenty, hundred fifty meters away.</span> <span id="s65">That was a small railway station.</span> <span id="s66">"Go up!"</span> <span id="s67">And a few minutes after that, the doors was closed.</span> <span id="s68">Yeah, and they put into every carriage they put in a list.</span> <span id="s69">One man was the responsible for the order in the ...that special wagon in which, how I mentioned before, forty people was uh...only forty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Because they from other countries, from Poland and from France, and from Greece...there came up to hundred twenty, hundred fifty forced in.</span> <span id="s71">So we had a very luxurious uh travel comparing to them.</span> <span id="s72">So when the door was closed, I went to the man whom I know and ask him, "Let me see that uh piece of paper what you got.</span> <span id="s73">Give it to me.”</span> <span id="s74">So I saw forty names typed with a typewriter; and during the forty names, five names was uh...four names was crossed out, and our four names--I myself, my wife, my son and my mother-in-law--put in with pencil.</span> <span id="s75">That was the machination of that people who run the camp; and they been the real collaborators.</span> <span id="s76">And they got what they deserved.</span> <span id="s77">Because then in 1944, they came to Auschwitz where some of them have been thrown against the electric wires and some of them have been killed by the inmates, just who remembered what they have done.</span> <span id="s78">So we ca...we arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s79">The usual uh selections: women and children and olderly [NB: elderly] on this side; Arbeitszwang, how they called it--the people who was able to work--on this side.</span> <span id="s80">So these people went to the gas chambers, and we went to the uh camp.</span> <span id="s81">I don't know for what reason we have been registered in a different place like the usual.</span> <span id="s82">We been taken straight away in a [Struhutstamm (ph)] [to] Lager Auschwitz, where we got a shower.</span> <span id="s83">We had to throw everything on a heap.</span> <span id="s84">Our luggage we had to leave on the on the ramp in the railway...in the railway station.</span> <span id="s85">And...somehow, I don't know what happened, they said everybody can keep his shoes.</span> <span id="s86">Anything else...not socks, nothing.</span> <span id="s87">Only shoes.</span> <span id="s88">And I got, after the shower what we got...they didn't gave us any towels.</span> <span id="s89">They gave me a shirt which was two numbers too small.</span> <span id="s90">So 'til I was working myself into that shirt, I had my shoes between my legs.</span> <span id="s91">I got from somebody, from one of the old Häftlings who had something...something to work there, a push.</span> <span id="s92">I lost my balance.</span> <span id="s93">He grabbed my shoes and ran away.</span> <span id="s94">And I knew very well the shoes are life there.</span> <span id="s95">So again by accident, I had still my watch on.</span> <span id="s96">I don't know why I had still my watch on.</span> <span id="s97">A Polish man, I know his name.</span> <span id="s98">They called him "Bogdan.”</span> <span id="s99">He was working in the Politisch Abteilung [Trans: "Political Department"]--that was the Lager Gestapo.</span> <span id="s100">And he told me, "Give me your watch.”</span> <span id="s101">I told him, "Listen.</span> <span id="s102">I give you my watch, because I know what is going on.</span> <span id="s103">But I see you have to...it seems to me that you have here some kind of a influence.</span> <span id="s104">That what did happen with my shoes.</span> <span id="s105">Bring me a pair of shoes.”</span> <span id="s106">So he did.</span> <span id="s107">He did.</span> <span id="s108">So when we was uh...we got the normal stripped clothes, and we was taken to our barracks.</span> <span id="s109">This time we was uh placed in the Barrack number 10.</span> <span id="s110">This Barrack number 10 has... has a special history; because there used to be woman in that barrack, and later on it was the experimental block again--the same block.</span> <span id="s111">Next to it was a block--Block number 11--which was the execution block.</span> <span id="s112">And the windows on the Block 10, in between Block 11 and 10, was all uh covered up, boarded up.</span> <span id="s113">We could sometimes peep through little space with little cracks and...and see what is going on.</span> <span id="s114">So I been this uh block a few days when the first...shock was big naturally.</span> <span id="s115">The first even bigger shock came when one when one of these uh Kommandos--in which one of my friends went out--came home, and they brought him home dead.</span> <span id="s116">That was about the fourth or maybe fifth days...day what we been there.</span> <span id="s117">So I started to ask questions: how did that that fellow uh was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">What...what has he done?</span> <span id="s119">So, nothing special; only his Polish Vorarbeiter [Trans: "foreman" or "gang boss"] came to him and said, "Listen, if you promise me that you'll give me your ration in the evening then I will keep you alone...uh, leave you alone.</span> <span id="s120">I won't uh beat you.”</span> <span id="s121">And he sometime...he get got angry.</span> <span id="s122">He had still a little bit cour...courage.</span> <span id="s123">And lifted his spade against that fellow.</span> <span id="s124">He was a prisoner, too.</span> <span id="s125">And naturally that was [in]subordination.</span> <span id="s126">A few German colleagues of his saw.</span> <span id="s127">So they beat him to death with the spades.</span> <span id="s128">That was...and a few different...uh, similar experiences, what I..</span> <span id="s129">.</span> <span id="s130">what we went through in the first day.</span> <span id="s131">The endless standing and Schikanieren [NB: chicanery] what they had.</span> <span id="s132">Twelve o'clock in the night they woke us up: "Alles andrehen!"</span> <span id="s133">For say the "Appell," for no reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s134">Sometimes they...they chased us down to the...the front of the building.</span> <span id="s135">Sometimes they let us stand for hours in the rooms that we're standing next to our beds.</span> <span id="s136">And...so, like naturally everybody had to work.</span> <span id="s137">Nobody could and should stay at home without special permit.</span> <span id="s138">If somebody was caught up in the camp from SS man or from anybody who ask him, "What you are doing here in...in the camp during the day?"</span> <span id="s139">When you didn't have the proper excuse, it was finish.</span> <span id="s140">Straight away into the Block 11 this times; and the next transport, crematorium.</span> <span id="s141">Regardless your health, stand [NB: state] of health, or whatever.</span> <span id="s142">So I..</span> <span id="s143">.</span> <span id="s144">we worked in different uh Kommandos, different work places...</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What kind of work place were you assigned to?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: In uh in one stage I was uh working in one group with that builded uh...build a bridge above the River So_a.</span> <span id="s147">That was a tributary of the uh River Wis_a.</span> <span id="s148">Vistula, if you heard about these names.</span> <span id="s149">That they planned there a bridge, a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s150">My first job to cleaning the big pine trees from the uh...to clean it up that the [people (ph)] should be absolutely clean.</span> <span id="s151">That was my job.</span> <span id="s152">And how with a spade, just to scratch it.</span> <span id="s153">And later I came their building company...company.</span> <span id="s154">That was the Un...later on, it was the Union uh ammunition factory out of it.</span> <span id="s155">I started to dig the foundations.</span> <span id="s156">And the German Kapo, who was a [kaminlog (ph)]-- somehow because I spoke a very perfect German, he talked somehow to me.</span> <span id="s157">And he talked me in, because he was more or less analphabet, you know.</span> <span id="s158">You know what...illiterate.</span> <span id="s159">Illiterate.</span> <span id="s160">So I did the writing jobs for him; and he looked so far after me that he organized for me clean clothes.</span> <span id="s161">That was something what saved later--in a few weeks later--my life, when we are coming to it.</span> <span id="s162">I worked there with 'til about beginning of January of '43.</span> <span id="s163">One evening, we are marching in from the...from work.</span> <span id="s164">I was already quite weak from three month nothing.</span> <span id="s165">Just the exact rations, and no source sometime...somewhere to get something extra.</span> <span id="s166">We marching through...through the door; and we uh...SS is standing at the door and screaming, "All the Jews to the parade ...to the parade place.”</span> <span id="s167">The Appellplatz, where they....</span> <span id="s168">That never sounded very well, but what we had to do?</span> <span id="s169">We went there.</span> <span id="s170">We didn't know what the reason was.</span> <span id="s171">And one of the Kommandoführers--[Stibbitz (ph)] was his name--came and started to count and sort out from these...I don't know how many thousand people...uh, and put and told them, "Go here.</span> <span id="s172">Go here.”</span> <span id="s173">And he came to me, and I was the last one.</span> <span id="s174">Looked at me and told me, "Oh, you look quite good.</span> <span id="s175">You uh...you....</span> <span id="s176">Du bist gut aus."</span> <span id="s177">-- "You look quite well.”</span> <span id="s178">Uh, and that I was the last one.</span> <span id="s179">"Turn left.</span> <span id="s180">March!"</span> <span id="s181">I didn't know where.</span> <span id="s182">And it turned out that was the Kommando Kanada where I was uh uh assigned to.</span> <span id="s183">So next day morning, we marched out.</span> <span id="s184">We went to Kanada.</span> <span id="s185">We saw what is going on.</span> <span id="s186">We could get some food, changed underwear...</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Let's go back just a moment.</span> <span id="s188">You say you saw what was going on.</span> <span id="s189">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: It was going on that...that all the effects, all the effects from the people who came with the transport was brought to us and we had to sort them out.</span> <span id="s191">And what was uh uh useful for them, that was sorted out and sent everything to Germany.</span> <span id="s192">We had daily a few wagons of different type of uh goods which went to Germany.</span> <span id="s193">I, for instance, I was working in a magazine.</span> <span id="s194">I packed the spectacles, the glasses, the cutlery, the...the shaving brushes and differents...these small things, in big baskets.</span> <span id="s195">I don't know if you remember these old pleated travel baskets from heavy...from heavy uh cane.</span> <span id="s196">So we had to pack them full, close them up.</span> <span id="s197">I had to write on "KL Au," which mean KL Auschwitz, the number what...what was on the [to goes (ph)] would be the papers, wind it...wind strings around it, and up it goes.</span> <span id="s198">Hundreds and hundreds of these baskets with uh brea...with uh spectacles, with everything--items what I mentioned before--went there.</span> <span id="s199">So when somebody is coming today to Auschwitz in the museum, and sees a heap of uh spectacles and shav...shaving uh uh brushes, he thinks whatever.</span> <span id="s200">But that was only a ver...that is only a very, very small percentage of that what went, that effects we went through.</span> <span id="s201">So, in beginning of 19...in about mid-April in 1943, I got typhus.</span> <span id="s202">So naturally I didn't went in the beginning to the so-called hospital; and I went every day to work with ninety degrees temperature.</span> <span id="s203">That was three kilometers there, three kilometers back.</span> <span id="s204">Maybe a little bit less.</span> <span id="s205">You know, actually...I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s206">I am mistaken.</span> <span id="s207">It was less; because this time uh the Kommando was still in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s208">And...wait a minute...I have to rectify myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Something is wrong.</span> <span id="s210">End of January, one day when we went from the Kommando instead to go to back to Auschwitz, they turned us to the right and they took us to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Which was...that was more than three kilometres coming in.</span> <span id="s212">We went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s213">We got the uh...we been relocated there.</span> <span id="s214">We had to come everyday these three kilometers from and to, to work.</span> <span id="s215">And then happened that I got the uh typhus, and with ninety degree I had to walk this three kilometers every day, now and back.</span> <span id="s216">In about end of May '43, something...I can't remember exactly what happened in the Kommando.</span> <span id="s217">And uh our Hauptscharführer, who was our uh supervisor there, took us--about five or six of us-- brought out from one of the magazines the heaviest fur coats what he could ever find.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">The heavy Russian fur coats, what the Russian peasants used to wear in winter.</span> <span id="s219">The lambs wool.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, sheeps...sheepskin, not lambs' wool.</span> <span id="s221">Sheepskin.</span> <span id="s222">Such a coat was at least five, six kilogram heavy.</span> <span id="s223">That's means ten, twelve pound; and that was a very, very hot day.</span> <span id="s224">I had ninety degrees.</span> <span id="s225">And he commanded us to "make sport"--that was express what they used.</span> <span id="s226">Run, lie down.</span> <span id="s227">Up, run, up, run...and so on.</span> <span id="s228">He did it with us one hour long, the whole so-called lunch time.</span> <span id="s229">Naturally, I was extremely exhausted after that when we finished.</span> <span id="s230">So I went uh...I said I can't go back to the next day; so I went in the evening to the so-called "Revier"--Krankenbau [NB: the "sick bay"].</span> <span id="s231">So when I came there, I saw the Krankenbau is nearly empty.</span> <span id="s232">And a friend of mine who was working there said, "The Krankenbau was taken to the gas chambers yesterday.</span> <span id="s233">You have a few days time.</span> <span id="s234">You can rest here.”</span> <span id="s235">So I had been there about five or six days.</span> <span id="s236">The Krankenbau filled up, so the danger came always closer.</span> <span id="s237">I decided to tell him, "Listen, check me out from here.”</span> <span id="s238">What he did; and really the next day the whole Krankenbau went to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s239">Again a brush with death.</span> <span id="s240">So I came uh out, back to the work force.</span> <span id="s241">How you say it?</span> <span id="s242">And for some reason, they didn't want to do...to take me back to the Kanada.</span> <span id="s243">So I started again and going out for manual work.</span> <span id="s244">And then...just a moment, I remember now something which was before what was actually the reason from...for that what they made the sport.</span> <span id="s245">I had a friend in uh...in Birkenau who was a dentist.</span> <span id="s246">And I had one of my tooth hurted, so I went to him he should pull me it out.</span> <span id="s247">So I wanted to uh show my appreciation for it.</span> <span id="s248">So I brought him a little bit of a..</span> <span id="s249">.</span> <span id="s250">of Tabak, cigarette Tabak [NB: tobacco] what I found in the Kanada.</span> <span id="s251">And on the way back, they let us...undressed us, naked, and they found the cigarette.</span> <span id="s252">And for that I got a two month...two months in the Straf company [NB: Strafkommando = "punishment brigade"].</span> <span id="s253">The Straf company is the...everybody knows what a straf company...company is.</span> <span id="s254">So it was very hard.</span> <span id="s255">When we work, our work was there.</span> <span id="s256">We was digging uh a channel to...to let off the water; because that was swamp area, a canalization.</span> <span id="s257">And we was digging it to the...down to the banks of the Vistula, that it shouldn't be the...the terrain should be dry, the possibility to dry out.</span> <span id="s258">I was working up 'til here in mud.</span> <span id="s259">On the end of the work, my colleagues had to pull me out; because by myself, between the cane what was going there, I would never came out by myself.</span> <span id="s260">Only with help.</span> <span id="s261">I did it...to our good luck, we...we have been released for some reason not in two months [but] after six weeks.</span> <span id="s262">So I came out.</span> <span id="s263">So I turned to a few friends for help.</span> <span id="s264">So they helped me a little bit--here a piece of bread, here a little bit something to eat, something else.</span> <span id="s265">And naturally that was the time when we came back to workforce.</span> <span id="s266">Meantime, I had already a few people whom I know.</span> <span id="s267">So I started to work; and again thanks to my knowledge in German, I got different uh jobs more or less...at least part Schreiber [Trans: "scribe"].</span> <span id="s268">And now I work, say two hours; and two hours I worked in one small Kommando as Schreiber.</span> <span id="s269">In the afternoon, again I worked two hours, and went two hours this so-called clerical work.</span> <span id="s270">So that...what I made my life a little bit easier; because as a reward for my Schreiber work, I got a little bit of a soup extra from the kapo of that Kommando.</span> <span id="s271">Then...one of my...a friend of mine, he get...uh got a position in the Kanada Kommando.</span> <span id="s272">He some...somehow was uh promoted there.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">And I go...go to...went to him, and told him, "Listen.”</span> <span id="s274">Uh, Carl was his name.</span> <span id="s275">"Say, Carl, can you do something for me?</span> <span id="s276">Look how I am.</span> <span id="s277">Look how I look.</span> <span id="s278">I would need a little bit to recover.</span> <span id="s279">Take me back to the Kommando.”</span> <span id="s280">"Oh, yes, I will arrange that you are coming tomorrow to the Kommando.”</span> <span id="s281">So I have been there a couple of weeks; and some jealousy and intrigues started against that man who brought me back.</span> <span id="s282">So say the...the...the Häftlings, the prisoners, uh claimed that I was working for him.</span> <span id="s283">That mean, I was stealing goods from the Kommando and carrying it for him.</span> <span id="s284">It wasn't true.</span> <span id="s285">The only thing what I ever "organized"--that was the slang expression for stealing--I organized only food.</span> <span id="s286">For myself, and for a few friends for whom I could help with what I brought home.</span> <span id="s287">I could share with them.</span> <span id="s288">So it went so far that they started to uh work against me.</span> <span id="s289">'Til one day, one of the fellows came to me and told me, "When you are coming tomorrow morning to work, you are not going home.”</span> <span id="s290">So naturally I didn't came.</span> <span id="s291">This time a new Kommando started to...came in existence.</span> <span id="s292">Our job was to dismantle airplanes which has been shot up around that area, regardless German, English, American.</span> <span id="s293">And I befriended myself with that kapo.</span> <span id="s294">I knew him from before.</span> <span id="s295">We worked always...already sometime together.</span> <span id="s296">He knew about my knowledge of the German language.</span> <span id="s297">So I started there as a Schreiber.</span> <span id="s298">We started there with about a hundred uh prisoners, and slowly it was built up to about thirteen hundred.</span> <span id="s299">So the responsibility was quite big, because we had to have very exact evidence--every single number who was in the Kommando.</span> <span id="s300">In one case, I had a case when two Russian prisoners uh tried to escape.</span> <span id="s301">I don't know if they succeeded or...or not.</span> <span id="s302">But the fact was they didn't came in to the camp.</span> <span id="s303">Big excitement.</span> <span id="s304">"Schreiber from [zelligbatterie (ph)], nach voraus!"</span> <span id="s305">--"To the front to the gate.</span> <span id="s306">Give me the numbers uh from these two men who are missing.”</span> <span id="s307">I didn't have that on me.</span> <span id="s308">I turned around to go back; and I saw my assistant was already running behind me waving the piece of paper where the two numbers have been written down.</span> <span id="s309">Because that what happens in the morning before we went out.</span> <span id="s310">Every group of twenty had to be...uh their...his...their numbers had to written down on a piece of paper.</span> <span id="s311">And they had to be compared during the day, if he was yesterday in at work or not.</span> <span id="s312">So a lot of uh unnecessary scribbling.</span> <span id="s313">But he...so he came.</span> <span id="s314">He gave up that piece of paper to the SS in the front.</span> <span id="s315">They look at that are the numbers.</span> <span id="s316">"Hör auf!"</span> <span id="s317">That mean, "Disappear!"</span> <span id="s318">So we went back with no consequences whatsoever for us, because we been right.</span> <span id="s319">If I couldn't have produced the two numbers, that would be the end of...of me.</span> <span id="s320">So I just want to mention that what uh kind of job and what...what the...what uh dangers in there...have been there everyday.</span> <span id="s321">Every moment was dangerous.</span> <span id="s322">Having a assistant this time, the new transport arrived on the same uh track where we got the wagons where we unloaded the remnantses [sic] and the raw material from the planes.</span> <span id="s323">The aluminum and every usable part was uh sorted out.</span> <span id="s324">The old aluminum what went in the mills or in the factories, that was recycled.</span> <span id="s325">So...and sometime on the same track came new transports.</span> <span id="s326">And in the Kanada, they had the duty...when a transport came, they had been on the ramp; and when they threw away their belongings, they had to collect it, pick it up and throw it on the trucks which took them to the working place of the Kanada.</span> <span id="s327">But they been quite experienced already to sneak out where is something to eat.</span> <span id="s328">So one of my friend--his name was [Juri (ph)] Fried.</span> <span id="s329">I don't know where he exists today, and looking for him in Israel now when I've been there; but I couldn't get any uh news about him, where he exists.</span> <span id="s330">So he...I have to mention that on the end of this place where the newcomers has to disembark from the train was a little hut.</span> <span id="s331">I went there when I saw from afar that the transport is coming.</span> <span id="s332">So I went there, hide myself in the hut; and [Juri (ph)] Fried came with...always with bags full of food.</span> <span id="s333">I was staying there and waiting 'til everything was over with, 'til the ramp was empty.</span> <span id="s334">So I took my harvest what I had and went back to the main Kommando.</span> <span id="s335">And here in one day I had a quite a good harvest.</span> <span id="s336">I called up all the Kapos.</span> <span id="s337">I had uh twenty-six of them; because thirteen hundred people...every hundred had two kapos.</span> <span id="s338">I called them up and told them, "Listen.</span> <span id="s339">I want your sticks what you are using to beating the people.”</span> <span id="s340">Very big surprise.</span> <span id="s341">"What is this?"</span> <span id="s342">"You are getting from me food for it.</span> <span id="s343">I don't mind if you have a small vine from some of the bushes here in your hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">But the big heavy ones I want to have, because I need it as heating material for I will let cook for you something to eat.</span> <span id="s345">I have the raw material.”</span> <span id="s346">So that was one of my biggest deeds, in my opinion, what I did in the interest of my uh friends and prisoners.</span> <span id="s347">'Specially I didn't know everybody personally.</span> <span id="s348">But if only one was saved from two or three uh hits through a day, that was already something.</span> <span id="s349">So slowly, slowly they got used to it; and the beating let up.</span> <span id="s350">Screaming, yes.</span> <span id="s351">Screaming doesn't hurt to anybody.</span> <span id="s352">So then one day in August 19 uh...44, we been on the march home uh from the....</span> <span id="s353">We worked on Sundays too.</span> <span id="s354">Coming uh home, coming in front...one of my duties was to arrange the hundreds that they should be at the long march.</span> <span id="s355">We had about nearly four kilometer march, and thirteen hundred people are walking tired.</span> <span id="s356">They are not walking like soldiers.</span> <span id="s357">So in front of the uh came about hundred fifty, two hundred meters--and that was exactly opposite the Lager C where my wife used to be this time.</span> <span id="s358">And I stopped there, without looking back what is going on behind my back.</span> <span id="s359">Just at that moment, I saw a group of girls standing there around.</span> <span id="s360">I didn't know how they came there, what they did there.</span> <span id="s361">And during the time I was ordered...making that order, the SS man who was in charge in front of the camp in a wooden barrack, he called my wife in.</span> <span id="s362">"Come here.”</span> <span id="s363">She went there.</span> <span id="s364">She made the procedure that uh how she had to report.</span> <span id="s365">And that...and he was drunk.</span> <span id="s366">He hardly saw (laughter)...and he hardly knew what he is doing.</span> <span id="s367">And asked her, "Do you have a boyfriend?"</span> <span id="s368">She was surprised about that question, and said, "No, I haven't got one.”</span> <span id="s369">And he asked, "Why?"</span> <span id="s370">"Because nobody wants me," she said to him.</span> <span id="s371">And he said, "I will take care that somebody should want you.</span> <span id="s372">The first man who is passing here by, they had to want...have to want you.”</span> <span id="s373">So the first one who came by was myself.</span> <span id="s374">So he told me, "Talk to her!"</span> <span id="s375">So, naturally, on her number I recognized right away that she is a girl from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s376">And uh, naturally, I ask, "What is your name?</span> <span id="s377">What...where are you from?"</span> <span id="s378">And about one or two such trivial questions.</span> <span id="s379">When she said, "I can't talk like this....” To the SS man.</span> <span id="s380">"I can't talk to this...to a man whom I never saw before like this on the street.</span> <span id="s381">And except [NB: besides], he has other duties to do.”</span> <span id="s382">And he said, "Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s383">You are...you are right.”</span> <span id="s384">He called me.</span> <span id="s385">"Come here!"</span> <span id="s386">I told him, "Yes, what you want?"</span> <span id="s387">He said, "Tomorrow morning you are reporting here.</span> <span id="s388">And you have to come to the camp.”</span> <span id="s389">And to her, she [NB: he] said, "You will be here in the morning, and you will stay here in the window.</span> <span id="s390">And when he cames, you will write his number in in the book.”</span> <span id="s391">Because everybody who came in or out was registered in a book, to keep it very exact and clear.</span> <span id="s392">So with that episode finished in that moment.</span> <span id="s393">So I, I did my job further; and I joined to the last five people who went in uh... went into the barrack.</span> <span id="s394">So straight away, when I came in, I went to my close friend, Erich Kulka--who is now here as a historian, he just recently got his doctorate for something--with whom we are still in good friendship.</span> <span id="s395">So I went to him.</span> <span id="s396">He was one of the maintenance men in the camp, and one of the few who had a pass to go everywhere in the different camps, when if something was broken down he was the man who had to repair it.</span> <span id="s397">He was working there as a engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">They call in English "engineer," but a Schlosser [Trans: locksmith, mechanic or fitter]-- he was a fitter, or something like this.</span> <span id="s399">So he...I knew that he went quite often in the womans camps, too; and I knew that he knows Magda.</span> <span id="s400">So I went straight to him and asked him, "Listen, Erich.</span> <span id="s401">What is your opinion about Magda?</span> <span id="s402">Do you know her?"</span> <span id="s403">"Yes, I know her very well.”</span> <span id="s404">"And what is your opinion?"</span> <span id="s405">He said, "I will tell it to you in one sentence.</span> <span id="s406">(Pause-choking up) She is one...she is one of the few woman or persons here in the camp who manage to be still human.”</span> <span id="s407">I mean, I couldn't ask for a better information.</span> <span id="s408">So I started to run around; I organized again a..</span> <span id="s409">.</span> <span id="s410">a bottle of schnapps.</span> <span id="s411">Because that was definitely the best uh currency between SS and Häftlings what you can imagine.</span> <span id="s412">Better than today the American dollar or the Fren...or the Japanese yen.</span> <span id="s413">So I got it through my connections.</span> <span id="s414">The next day in the morning, really, I went in.</span> <span id="s415">When I came to the gate, I took out from under my arm where I have hidden the bottle, put it on the window.</span> <span id="s416">And really Magda was there.</span> <span id="s417">She write down my name.</span> <span id="s418">I mean, we didn't have names.</span> <span id="s419">Uh, my number; and uh so I could go in.</span> <span id="s420">She was very uh embarrassed.</span> <span id="s421">She...because she wasn't expecting that I will come.</span> <span id="s422">But for curiosity, I wanted to find out what is going on, wanted from her certain in...information.</span> <span id="s423">So we went in.</span> <span id="s424">She was running away, hiding somewhere.</span> <span id="s425">After few uh time...because in after short time, we met.</span> <span id="s426">We had uh the opportunity to talk a few words.</span> <span id="s427">So when I uh came in her room, because as in her functions she had the right to have a small room which was about two by four meter big.</span> <span id="s428">That her own...she had her own bed.</span> <span id="s429">And when...when I saw her belongings, the few belongings what she had.</span> <span id="s430">So she reminded me somehow of my wife.</span> <span id="s431">And later on she was uh still very uh embarrassed, and a little bit out of shape; so she turns, she had a small mirror there hanging on the wall.</span> <span id="s432">She went there and started with her fingers to arrange her hair.</span> <span id="s433">When I told her, "Listen, it is quite a few years that I saw a woman standing in front of a mirror and getting, combing on her hair.”</span> <span id="s434">And that somehow touched her, too.</span> <span id="s435">I was very touched, and she was very touched.</span> <span id="s436">And that somehow brought us close.</span> <span id="s437">Closer.</span> <span id="s438">And in the next few weeks, now and then I asked permission from my Oberkapo that he let me one or a few times to go and visit her.</span> <span id="s439">Just harmless talk, because everything else was dangerous.</span> <span id="s440">And it was because the fact was, I didn't want to be somehow too much uh interested; because when you are not uh....</span> <span id="s441">I don't know how you said that.</span> <span id="s442">Fallstrick [Trans: pitfall, trap].</span> <span id="s443">When you are not careful enough, it can can bring you in trouble; and that is what we... nobody needed.</span> <span id="s444">So the whole relationship, all the time what we went in, was absolute platonic.</span> <span id="s445">So the time went by.</span> <span id="s446">I saw her about five or six times.</span> <span id="s447">And I started to like her; because I saw what she's doing, how's she's doing, how....</span> <span id="s448">And I knew her reputation in the camp.</span> <span id="s449">Because everybody knew all about her, everybody in the men's camp knew about her and knew about her deeds--what she is doing and how she is doing.</span> <span id="s450">She had a wonderful reputation in the...in the camp.</span> <span id="s451">And naturally I was very much impressed with that.</span> <span id="s452">And later on, end of November or so, '44, some difficulties started on in my Kommando.</span> <span id="s453">I had that...I was already one and a half years there.</span> <span id="s454">So she arranged somehow that I could join to a small Kommando which came regularly every day to her camp to do some maintenance work.</span> <span id="s455">There was a small magazine.</span> <span id="s456">There been a small, uh a few old sewing machines.</span> <span id="s457">It was our duty to clean them and bring them to shape.</span> <span id="s458">But we always was talking and never did real, some real work.</span> <span id="s459">So then came the 18th of January [1945].</span> <span id="s460">The 18th of January was the day when the death march from Auschwitz started.</span> <span id="s461">So we, we...uh we marched late afternoon from Birkenau.</span> <span id="s462">We was taken over to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s463">I tried to hide there, to stay there what maybe I hoped.</span> <span id="s464">But then the rumors went around [that] the whole camp is undermined, that there exist a plan that camps uh will be bombarded from all sides with artillery and with the planes, to make it to disappear.</span> <span id="s465">And...but still I went up in one of the blocks.</span> <span id="s466">I was very tired; because the whole day, we...the stress.</span> <span id="s467">We had to "antrehen, abtreten, antreten, abtreten" [report, get dismissed, report, get dismissed] about five or six times during the day.</span> <span id="s468">So I went in one of the blocks which was already empty.</span> <span id="s469">I hide...I hid myself under...in one of the beds, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s470">Around midnight, all of a sudden I am woken up from the absolute quietness what was in the la...what was it in the camp.</span> <span id="s471">And I was very curious what is happening.</span> <span id="s472">So I went down, opened the gate; and in that moment two of my friends with whom I used to work together in Kanada passed by.</span> <span id="s473">They saw me.</span> <span id="s474">They say, "What you are doing here?"</span> <span id="s475">"I want to stay here.</span> <span id="s476">I don't want to...I have enough.</span> <span id="s477">I tried....” "No, don't stay here.</span> <span id="s478">That will be blown up everything.</span> <span id="s479">It is dangerous.</span> <span id="s480">Come.</span> <span id="s481">Come.</span> <span id="s482">We are going.</span> <span id="s483">Come with us.”</span> <span id="s484">So I went.</span> <span id="s485">So I did it, that death march.</span> <span id="s486">We walked through uh three uh nights, days and nights.</span> <span id="s487">And in one intersection we collided with the woman.</span> <span id="s488">We came from ...from a different...they came from a different way than we.</span> <span id="s489">And the woman, they looked for men.</span> <span id="s490">The men looked for woman, if somebody's there.</span> <span id="s491">Relation, friend or something.</span> <span id="s492">The woman... the girls went to the SS woman asking for permission, if they could give them a permission to talk to us; because somebody recognized me there from one of her friends and told that "Bela is there.</span> <span id="s493">Try what you can do.”</span> <span id="s494">But meantime a big crowd started; because such a mass of people, two or four SS woman or men couldn't keep uh back even if they would start to shoot or whatever.</span> <span id="s495">So they started a big crowd; and we somehow came close to each other and we spoke a few words, and then...to each other.</span> <span id="s496">And I told her, "Listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">We are now in a situation we know the war can't keep very long any more.</span> <span id="s498">So if we are coming home, I want to meet you.”</span> <span id="s499">And she told me, "Ah!</span> <span id="s500">Who knows how we will meet?"</span> <span id="s501">I..</span> <span id="s502">.</span> <span id="s503">we...somehow we been so uh used to that not to have names but we had only numbers.</span> <span id="s504">But I wasn't thinking on it that when we are coming home and we will be registered somewhere that I won't register under names, but under numbers.</span> <span id="s505">And I told her, "Listen.</span> <span id="s506">I tell you...look when you...when you are coming home and you are coming home, look for my number.”</span> <span id="s507">"Oh, I never will remember your number.”</span> <span id="s508">"You will.</span> <span id="s509">I will explain to you how.”</span> <span id="s510">And I showed her: "Listen.</span> <span id="s511">I have 65066, is my number.</span> <span id="s512">Your number, 2318.</span> <span id="s513">These your four numbers are included in my five.”</span> <span id="s514">She asked how.</span> <span id="s515">I said, "Look, 5 - 6 - 11 - 12 is 23.</span> <span id="s516">Three 6 is 18.</span> <span id="s517">Simple as that.”</span> <span id="s518">You know?</span> <span id="s519">Good that we haven't been registered, thank heavens, on the numbers but on the names.</span> <span id="s520">She came some where in East...to East Germany.</span> <span id="s521">I came to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s522">I was in one month in Mauthausen, in the so-called quarantine.</span> <span id="s523">Naturally, when we arrived we been uh...stripped what we had.</span> <span id="s524">I had relative good clothes.</span> <span id="s525">And in my pocket--to our bad luck, Magda got from a woman from Bratislava a check to the uh...to one of the English banks.</span> <span id="s526">I don't know where that woman had transferred before the war big money from Bratislava to that...I think it was the Barclay Bank.</span> <span id="s527">I am not sure any more.</span> <span id="s528">And that woman came to Magda one day and told her, "Listen.</span> <span id="s529">I see what you are doing here.</span> <span id="s530">I am a very rich woman.</span> <span id="s531">We have a lot of money in...in uh England, and all over the world.</span> <span id="s532">I have a little chance to survive.</span> <span id="s533">I am older than you.</span> <span id="s534">Maybe you will survive.</span> <span id="s535">As a gratitude for that what you are doing here, I give you that check of thousand dollars, thousand pounds.”</span> <span id="s536">And when we met on that place what I mentioned before, she [NB: Magda] told me, "You are a man.</span> <span id="s537">Take that check to you.</span> <span id="s538">Maybe it is safer with you.”</span> <span id="s539">Unfortunately, it worked out if it would stay with her she could keep it.</span> <span id="s540">I couldn't; because when we came to Mauthausen, they stripped us.</span> <span id="s541">They stole all our uh better clothing what we had.</span> <span id="s542">And I didn't had...I wasn't thinking on it; and even if I would think it on it to take it out from my pocket, I had not the where to hide it.</span> <span id="s543">It was written on a thin paper.</span> <span id="s544">If I put it in my mouth, it would be dissolved; and go through the shower and save it, such a piece of paper....</span> <span id="s545">So....</span> <span id="s546">But I honestly admit, I wasn't even thinking on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You were then in Mauthausen until what time?</span> <span id="s548">A: In Mauthausen, we been about one month.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: From Mauthausen, we was taken over to Gusen,which been an ammunition factories, partly.</span> <span id="s551">And Gusen I and Gusen II was uh factory...one of the factories was the Messerschmitt uh Werke, for the Messerschmitt planes--war planes.</span> <span id="s552">So I was uh assigned.</span> <span id="s553">Because when they asked my profession, I told them I am an engineer.</span> <span id="s554">I thought it doesn't do any harm not to be a laborer, or a accountant or a doctor or a solicitor, whatever.</span> <span id="s555">So, OK.</span> <span id="s556">So they registered me as an engineer; and when it came to that uh Gusen II needed people, they sended us there.</span> <span id="s557">And I was assigned to work in the part to uh fix the petrol tanks, the gas tanks, in the uh wings of the Messerschmitt.</span> <span id="s558">I don't which number was it-- 87, or the 111.</span> <span id="s559">I don't...can't remember anymore.</span> <span id="s560">But we didn't do a lot of work, because we didn't got any raw material.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s562">If those were the final days of the war, how did the liberation come to your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: On the first of May; and to tell that when we got up in the morning, and instead to take us back in the Messerschmitt uh factory, they took us to a place in the name Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s564">That's supposed to be one of the new camps in that area which Hitler in his fantasy and in his dreams thought he will keep the last resistance 'til his [wonderritens (ph)] will be completed.</span> <span id="s565">And he can uh resist there in that area ad infinitum.</span> <span id="s566">But this camp was in the beginning stadion [NB: stages].</span> <span id="s567">That it what was a camp the Germans put in middle in the forest a big uh saw machine, driven with a..</span> <span id="s568">.</span> <span id="s569">uh petrol engine.</span> <span id="s570">They cut off the trees, put it on the machine, made boards out of it and [brewed (ph)] the bark.</span> <span id="s571">When we came there it was the First of May.</span> <span id="s572">Accident...accidentally, I remember the day exactly; because on the way, when we went on the...uh road, a old uh Wehrmachts man who was called up--he was this time about fifty--started to talk with me, and he still believed that Hitler will win the war.</span> <span id="s573">It was the First of May '45.</span> <span id="s574">So...so when we came in...in the camp, the barracks wasn't ready.</span> <span id="s575">No windows, no doors and no roof.</span> <span id="s576">The roof was only the main pillars; but empty in between, so that water, snow, everything could go through.</span> <span id="s577">Luckily the rain stopped just a few days before we....</span> <span id="s578">And the nice, very nice spring weather started.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Excuse me, but at that time who...which army liberated you?</span> <span id="s580">A: American.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: The American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">1 Subcamp of Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">2 Another subcamp of Mauthausen located in Austria.</span> <span id="s584">From his subsequent description, it is clear that he was sent to the Waldwerke I section of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: American.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: How did you first see them come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I didn't saw them at all.</span> <span id="s588">I just heared...heard them.</span> <span id="s589">I mean, in the beginning uh....</span> <span id="s590">It was the 7th of May in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s591">I was wandering around in the camp; because in the same camp arrived a lot of Hungarian uh men who came from the Don and from the Dnieper.</span> <span id="s592">From these area, from deep in uh...in Russia.</span> <span id="s593">And from the Ukraine, there came a forced march.</span> <span id="s594">And being Hungarian, and I had relatives in a certain township in Hungaria [Hungary].</span> <span id="s595">So I went around in the hope that I will find somebody whom I know.</span> <span id="s596">So I went in one of the barracks; and a fellow came out.</span> <span id="s597">And I ask him, "I hear uh people from Szombathely....” That is the place where I had an uncle.</span> <span id="s598">And I knew...know he had four sons and three daughters, or whatsoever.</span> <span id="s599">And somebody told me, "Yes, there are here.</span> <span id="s600">Whom you think?"</span> <span id="s601">I said, "I would like now if one of the Blau boys are here.”</span> <span id="s602">I couldn't tell the name, which of them could be, because there are four boys.</span> <span id="s603">He told me, "Yes, they are here.</span> <span id="s604">One is here.”</span> <span id="s605">"Where is he?"</span> <span id="s606">Indeed I ask.</span> <span id="s607">I..</span> <span id="s608">.</span> <span id="s609">he looked back.</span> <span id="s610">"Yes, he's coming here.</span> <span id="s611">That is him.”</span> <span id="s612">So we came, we started to talk a few words with each other.</span> <span id="s613">Because I never saw him in my life before.</span> <span id="s614">One of his brothers I knew, his father I knew, one of his sisters I knew....</span> <span id="s615">Because this time from Bratislava to Hungary to travel wasn't so easy.</span> <span id="s616">And uh only by very special occasions could somebody come over.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Mr. Blau, I have to interrupt you now at this point, because technically the tape has run out.</span></p></body></html>
