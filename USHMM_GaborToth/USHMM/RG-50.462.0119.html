id="s2">ER: This is Ellen Rofman on June 27, 1983, interviewing Rabbi Mayer Relles.</span> <span id="s3">Could you please tell me where you were born and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">MR: I was born June 2, 1908.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">ER: Can you tell me a little bit about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">MR: About my family?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">ER: What was your father's occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">MR: My father was a carpenter until 1908, until the year I was born, after, on account of his sickness, he got a heart condition, he put this job away and he became a builder, not like here in America.</span> <span id="s9">A Jew needed a house, so my father would show him, my father was not learned, all he had was three classes, elementary school, but he was a self-made man.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">ER: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">MR: He knew math and really he did well.</span> <span id="s12">I remember later he showed me how he knew geometry, he knew logarithms, with three elementary classes.</span> <span id="s13">He learned by himself and he became a builder and this is what he did to the very end.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">ER: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">MR: I had one brother so far as I know, and seven sisters, but they all died when they were young, I don't remember them.</span> <span id="s16">I remember only two sisters, and I had a sister who lived in Vienna, she married in 1912, and died in 1920--no, in 1918 and she left two daughters and they live here in California.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">ER: OK.</span> <span id="s18">What was the economic status of your family before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">MR: Before World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">ER: Yes, before World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">MR: Well, my father made a good living; he worked only summer because in winter in Poland there was no building and of course he made very well.</span> <span id="s22">I don't remember misery or hardship.</span> <span id="s23">Of course we lived very, how would I say, sparingly.</span> <span id="s24">Why, because we had two girls to marry and it meant a dowry.</span> <span id="s25">So my father would always put away--my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">ER: Did your family belong to a religious organization or to a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">MR: To a synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">ER: Were they assimilated or did they have a sense of their Jewish identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">MR: Oh, absolutely, they were Jewish people, what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">ER: Can you tell me about your schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">MR: My schooling, I did not attend grammar school.</span> <span id="s32">I started secular studies when I was eighteen years old.</span> <span id="s33">Until eighteen years, from four until eighteen, I learned only Jewish subjects like Bible, very little, but lots of Talmud and of course the Jewish Code.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">ER: Did you have non-Jewish playmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">MR: Not until I left my town.</span> <span id="s36">But playmates, in 1926 I left for L'vov which is Leopolis and there of course I had non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">ER: Can you describe the life of Jews in your particular town before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">MR: No, I've been asking myself how could we survive?</span> <span id="s39">How could we live.</span> <span id="s40">A town where you had no water.</span> <span id="s41">The water you had to buy, we had no sewers and people would throw out everything in the street and of course our police would wait for them to try to give them a fine.</span> <span id="s42">I remember we lived very, very badly, not that we were hungry, we were not hungry, but I remember for example, from 1918 to 1924, bread was a luxury.</span> <span id="s43">When mother made bread, for 2 or 3 weeks she would say, don't be a fresser, don't be a glutton, slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">ER: But, that was not because you were Jewish, that was the general condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">MR: No, there was great misery because after 1918 we had a Civil War between Poland, the Polish people and the Ukrainians, and we had fear that the war, the battlefields, we had a few pogroms, not in our town but in the surroundings, because we lived not far from the Russian border, the Petluritses [Black Hundred Gangs] which the Ukrainians, they made a few pogroms, Proskurov and other cities, I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">ER: Was there a large population of Jews in your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">MR: About seventeen hundred.</span> <span id="s48">This is what my father wrote to me in 1940.</span> <span id="s49">It was a ghost town.</span> <span id="s50">Why, because before World War I there were smuggling.</span> <span id="s51">For example, people would bring tobacco from Russia to our town and after it would go farther.</span> <span id="s52">From our town people would smuggle fabrics, like scarves, shirts, skirts all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s53">So we had about fifty villages from the Russian border, from Russia, which would come across the river, Juznyj-Bug, and do business with us.</span> <span id="s54">But after World War I, when Communist Russia took over, they were against it, so we were cut off.</span> <span id="s55">We had no background, we had a few villages, but those villages they would, instead of coming to us to sell their produce and buy things, they would go to Borscov.</span> <span id="s56">Why, because in Borscov they had the court and all kinds of offices.</span> <span id="s57">They would not be interested in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">ER: Did the Jews in your town experience any antisemitism prior to the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">MR: Oy, of course, but it was a hidden antisemitism.</span> <span id="s60">Why?</span> <span id="s61">Because we had a majority of Ukrainians, but the Polish people ruled, in other words Poland would send her employees and they needed our support, for example, when there were elections, all kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">ER: When did you leave Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">MR: I left Poland in 1933 anyways, and I don't remember the date.</span> <span id="s64">The first day it was about, I would say November, no it was not November, it was September 10, because I remember I arrived there September 16, it was on a Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">ER: Did your family also go or did you go alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">MR: I went alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">ER: You went alone.</span> <span id="s68">When you arrived in Italy in 1933, what was it like to live in a fascist country?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">MR: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">ER: Wonderful?</span> <span id="s71">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">MR: In what way?</span> <span id="s73">For example they would not control you whether you worked, whether you did not work.</span> <span id="s74">Practically, I went there to study medicine, because Mussolini said, whoever wants to come to study from abroad, no fee.</span> <span id="s75">We did not pay a penny.</span> <span id="s76">Tuition was gratis.</span> <span id="s77">We had all privileges, for example, only 50% we paid for going to a movie, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s78">And when I came after a month a man came from the university and he advised me to register.</span> <span id="s79">They had, how would you say, an organization for students from abroad who belonged to the fascist organization.</span> <span id="s80">Of course, I refused, I said I came to study and I don't have time, I cannot afford to belong to any party.</span> <span id="s81">Incidentally, I did not register for medicine because I went with very little money and medicine you have to attend university.</span> <span id="s82">While, for example, you are a student of philosophy or literature you didn't have to go there to attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">ER: Now, where was this in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">MR: In Rome.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">ER: Were you treated any differently as a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">MR: Yah, better.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">ER: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">MR: Because I was a foreigner and in Italy her industry was tourism from other countries.</span> <span id="s89">For example, I came on a Friday.</span> <span id="s90">I didn't sleep for several days and I had to go to sleep, I had to provide a place, so they told me there is a casa tedesca which means a house of the German people, German students and tourists and boys and scouts.</span> <span id="s91">They gave me the address and I didn't know a word.</span> <span id="s92">So a Jewish lady she gave me the address and I took a bus.</span> <span id="s93">It was not the right bus, but the man who sold the tickets, the ticket man, he did not even make me pay and he showed me to go to another bus and from that bus I showed this and there was an officer in the bus, he talked German and I talked a little German, and he said, come, I will show you where it is.</span> <span id="s94">And he went to bring me into that place.</span> <span id="s95">Such cases I had several times.</span> <span id="s96">I asked an officer for a letter box, mailbox, instead of telling me how to go, he would go to it and bring me there to the mail box.</span> <span id="s97">This is what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ER: When you were in school in Italy, did the teachers praise Mussolini?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">MR: Well, I'll tell you, I registered not right away, not in 1933.</span> <span id="s100">I registered there in 1935.</span> <span id="s101">I started in the Rabbinical College.</span> <span id="s102">The Rabbinical College was something else.</span> <span id="s103">There practically, we had not antisemitism, but we had boys, the students who were from other countries, special from Poland, we had hatred.</span> <span id="s104">The Italian-Jewish students who studied with us they did not like us.</span> <span id="s105">They would sit on other benches, and this is understandable because they said, "Why did those people come to study, what do they want here?</span> <span id="s106">They are bringing antisemitism to Italy.</span> <span id="s107">Tomorrow when they are through, they will be competitors," and we had the same coolness from our professors.</span> <span id="s108">There was for example, a professor, a great scholar, one of the greatest, Casuto, Umberto Casuto, a great scholar.</span> <span id="s109">Besides that he wrote books both in Italian and in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s110">He died in Israel.</span> <span id="s111">He cordially hated students who were not Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">ER: Cordially hated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">MR: Cordially.</span> <span id="s114">How did he show his hatred?</span> <span id="s115">He just ignored us.</span> <span id="s116">We were ignored.</span> <span id="s117">I remember a boy told me we are ignored like unclean people.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">ER: How did the other Italians treat you.</span> <span id="s119">Not the Italian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">MR: They were wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">ER: No antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">MR: I did not encounter antisemitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">ER: What made you decide to become a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">MR: Well, after the war I came back from Italy, and I had a good name, you know, and the president of all the congregations, of all the Jewish congregations, his name was Contoni, Rafaeli Contoni.</span> <span id="s125">He knew me from Switzerland.</span> <span id="s126">He wrote me a letter once and he said I opened a new page in your history that you become rabbi in Ancona.</span> <span id="s127">He knew I had my, how you say my diploma from Poland and in Ancona they need a rabbi and the rabbi is coming to Venice, in other words the rabbi from Ancona would come to Venice, and I would go to Ancona.</span> <span id="s128">I was not a rabbi, I was like an assistant-rabbi.</span> <span id="s129">They had no rabbi.</span> <span id="s130">Anyway, and I said no.</span> <span id="s131">I didn't like the rabbinate.</span> <span id="s132">I liked my profession, Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s133">A few weeks later, he came, on a Friday and he said to me, "Relles, if you don't accept the job in Ancona, you will have a hard life, because we are after the war.</span> <span id="s134">As a teacher, you will not be able to make a living.</span> <span id="s135">And this I knew he was right, because they would give me in Italy, at that time, ten dollars a month.</span> <span id="s136">Yes, I would have the children get soup at noon, the American Jewish soldiers would give all the ingredients and this would go to the Jewish restaurant, and the restaurant would give every day a portion to the children, the few children who were there.</span> <span id="s137">And so I used to get there a bowl of soup and bread and so on.</span> <span id="s138">So I was forced into it.</span> <span id="s139">So I accepted the job in Ancona and there I stayed from Oct. 1946 to July, I believe, 1949, almost 3 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">ER: So, how old were you when you made this decision that you had to go to Ancona?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">MR: To Ancona?</span> <span id="s142">Tell you right away, it was 1946, 1946, I was born in '08, which means--you know math--so it means 36 years.</span> <span id="s143">I would be 36 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">ER: What did the Italian Jews feel about Hitler in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">MR: In 1933, Mussolini was against Hitler.</span> <span id="s146">In fact, when the Jews in Palestine organized a fair in Bari, which is in south Italy, he wanted to go into that pavilion and say, he said at that occasion: "Where were the Germans when these Jews had a great civilization, a culture.</span> <span id="s147">They still were half naked roaming in the woods."</span> <span id="s148">This was I believe in 1934.</span> <span id="s149">Why?</span> <span id="s150">Because, you're too young, you can't remember that, Hitler, tried to occupy Austria and a detachment of German Nazis, S.S. soldiers, they entered Germany, I mean, Austria.</span> <span id="s151">In Austria they had Nazis too and they killed Dollfuss, the President of Austria.</span> <span id="s152">Of course, Mussolini did not like Hitler, to have Hitler as a neighbor, so Mussolini wanted Austria to remain independent.</span> <span id="s153">Right?</span> <span id="s154">So he right away sent in an entire army to the Austrian border, so that Hitler should know not to occupy Austria.</span> <span id="s155">At that time the short romance between Mussolini and Hitler was like, I would say marred and I remember there was almost a war between them, which means that at that time Mussolini was very close to the Jews.</span> <span id="s156">But even before Mussolini asked Hitler not to be so harsh with the Jews and well, that's it, many Jews who came from Germany and from Austria, some of them were very well settled in Italy.</span> <span id="s157">I remember a man came, Brenner was his name.</span> <span id="s158">He had a few cameras, Zeiss and Ikon, after two or three years, he became very rich and in every corner you saw "Photo Brenner".</span></p> <p><span id="s159">ER: Why do you think Mussolini changed his stand about Hitler and became his ally?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">MR: Well, I believe he was thrown into the arms of Hitler, because both Hitler and Mussolini was a dictator.</span> <span id="s161">He was megalomaniac.</span> <span id="s162">I don't know whether he was bad maybe, they say he was.</span> <span id="s163">He was megalomaniac, he needed glory.</span> <span id="s164">In 1945, he embarked on occupying Abyssinia, Ethiopia.</span> <span id="s165">Well, England had colonies, why shouldn't Italy have colonies.</span> <span id="s166">This is what he thought.</span> <span id="s167">England made a very dirty joke.</span> <span id="s168">When he started to send troops and mules and arms and ammunitions to Ethiopia, he had to cross the Suez Canal going to England.</span> <span id="s169">England would not say a word.</span> <span id="s170">When he was already to attack Ethiopia, England said no, you're not going to do it.</span> <span id="s171">We will make sanctions against you.</span> <span id="s172">You know what sanctions means, the nations would not give Italy anything, they would not have to do any business with Italy and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s173">There was a moment Mussolini would have made an agreement, something just to save face, and England said: "As long as you have one soldier in Erithrea [Erithrea was a colony close to Ethiopia] we are not going to deal with you."</span> <span id="s174">In other words, England wanted to humiliate Mussolini, and at the same time he got everything from Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">ER: So, okay.</span> <span id="s176">How do you think the other fascists interpreted Hitler?</span> <span id="s177">The other fascists of Italy, not just Mussolini.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">MR: I heard always bad things.</span> <span id="s179">They always hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s180">I can't say that all the fascists were against Hitler, because, I was in Rome, after I went to Venice I did not deal in politics, how could I express an opinion?</span> <span id="s181">I had no opinions.</span> <span id="s182">But those people whom I knew, and I had many friends in Italy.</span> <span id="s183">I remember a man came, he was the lieutenant and he was a very good friend of mine and he said to me, "Woe unto us if we win the war.</span> <span id="s184">If we lose the war people will say, okay, it's the Italians' fault, some people will say we fought well, some people will say we were cowards, but we will end with independence.</span> <span id="s185">But if we win the war we will polish Hitler's boots."</span> <span id="s186">This is the way he said to me and this was not at the end it was in 1939, before even Hitler entered the war.</span> <span id="s187">You remember it was Mrs. Sol's nephew.</span> <span id="s188">He had an aunt who was Jewish, who was a teacher in our school, but he was a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">ER: You mentioned that you were aware of Germans and Austrians coming to Italy between 1933-38.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">MR: Yes, ma'am.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">ER: How were they treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">MR: The Jewish people?</span> <span id="s193">Well, as I say, before Mussolini embarked on antisemitism, on the racial laws, they came.</span> <span id="s194">If they had money, they could open stores, they could do business.</span> <span id="s195">If they did not have money they could still go around and some, they took canvassing.</span> <span id="s196">I knew many of them because I used to eat in the Jewish restaurant, [unclear] on the Via Campomarcia and there they would come.</span> <span id="s197">Whoever came from Germany, from Italy ate, not because he wanted to eat kosher, but he wanted the Jewish milieu.</span> <span id="s198">But, even after he became antisemitic, one day he made a speech, I don't remember whether it was in Genoa or in Trieste and he said, "Now we will have racial laws and so on--but the world will marvel how humane we will treat the Jews."</span> <span id="s199">And the fact is that until Italy entered the war, Jews would come from Austria and from Germany and they would get help.</span> <span id="s200">In other words, there was the UIJC [Union of Italian Jewish Communities] like here the Joint.</span> <span id="s201">It was a French organization, with American money and it was recognized by the government.</span> <span id="s202">I know facts, and this you will read in my manuscript.</span> <span id="s203">The police, they did their best to help us.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">ER: What effect did the anti-Jewish laws of 1938 have on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">MR: On me?</span> <span id="s206">Well, at that time, you will see it here, I was a student in Rome, and I had my papers in Rome.</span> <span id="s207">But I was in Venice, I did not study.</span> <span id="s208">In Italy once you register, you are registered, even if you are away for a hundred years they keep you.</span> <span id="s209">I did not pay but my documents were in Rome with the University in Rome.</span> <span id="s210">When the laws came and the law said that within six months all Jews, the foreigners, had to leave Italy unless they want to be arrested and deported and so on and so on, so I went to Rome from Venice and I wanted my papers back and I got them back.</span> <span id="s211">My birth certificate and, what was more important to me, my diploma, my high school diploma.</span> <span id="s212">I took all the documents out.</span> <span id="s213">They left something, I don't know what they left, probably the translations, because I said both the translations and the original.</span> <span id="s214">Two weeks later the law came.</span> <span id="s215">Whoever was already registered, at the universities, Jewish people, Poland, Czechoslovakia, from all other countries, they could stay in the country and continue, and they had to pay half not entire, rent, how would you say, tuition--half tuition.</span> <span id="s216">This was a savior for me.</span> <span id="s217">So I went to Rome, I arrived there and I said, "Take my documents back I want to continue."</span> <span id="s218">He said, "Sir, you cannot do that because this is only for those who were registered but you are not registered anymore."</span> <span id="s219">Here I have to make a parenthesis.</span> <span id="s220">It was in, was in September or October so you know at that time there were thousands of students there in a big line and there the Italians you know they are so slow, slow and I said to them, I didn't sleep all night, I traveled from Venice to Rome, you have to travel 10 hours, and I said, "Boys, I am a Jew, and I came from Venice and I have to go fast back.</span> <span id="s221">Let me go ahead and just like by a charm, I was first.</span> <span id="s222">Otherwise, I have to stay there three days three or four days.</span> <span id="s223">This is the way they treated.</span> <span id="s224">Well, when I came there what do I do?</span> <span id="s225">But I knew a man who used to teach, a professor, Amadasi, he used to teach Arabic.</span> <span id="s226">When I knew him he was still in the office there so I looked around for Professor Amadasi, and I talked to him.</span> <span id="s227">And I said, "Look what's--?"</span> <span id="s228">He said, "Well, I will go to see what's what.</span> <span id="s229">And he went there to the office, he left all his work, he went to the office, it was again on a Friday, all things happened on a Friday, and he came back and said, "The situation is very bad, anyway leave the documents to me.</span> <span id="s230">I will see what I can do."</span> <span id="s231">I stayed there over Shabbos you know, and Monday I came there and he took the documents again and said, "Well I have tried hard to help you, but I cannot, I'll try only once more."</span> <span id="s232">He went there and, illegally he put them back, the documents in their place, and he said, "Now all you have to do is--this is what I did."</span> <span id="s233">He also mentioned that if this came out, he would lose his job and he would go to jail.</span> <span id="s234">And, he didn't say it so, but and he said, "Now," he said, "you have to go to pay half your tuition, it's in the bank, the Spirit of Santus, the holy spirit."</span> <span id="s235">He said, "I am going, I will take you."</span> <span id="s236">And he took me in that little Topolino, that little car, you know, I don't know how many miles because Rome is not a village, so to do it faster, and I paid and I was registered, I was registered back.</span> <span id="s237">Now what happened, her brother used to be a secretary at the congregation.</span> <span id="s238">I was a teacher there.</span> <span id="s239">At that time, probably he was told to ask the ministery, the police in Rome, for a permission for me...</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s241">MR: And, what happened, when I got my documents back in Rome, I said, well, appetite comes when you eat, by eating.</span> <span id="s242">Why can't I start to study?</span> <span id="s243">But I was in Venice, I don't remember, probably there are 500 kilometers, or maybe miles, between Rome and Venice, and I could not commute.</span> <span id="s244">But, Padua is very close to Venice, only 37 kilometers.</span> <span id="s245">You would travel half an hour by train.</span> <span id="s246">So I just asked the University from Rome to send my documents to Venice, not to Venice, to Padua.</span> <span id="s247">This is what they do in Italy.</span> <span id="s248">You don't have limitations, you don't need to be an A student to go to the best universities, no.</span> <span id="s249">But they did not, they had time.</span> <span id="s250">Meanwhile, when he made the application for me, her brother, the answer came the questura, the police, in Venice called me up, not that, they didn't call me, they wrote me to come, they wanted to tell me something.</span> <span id="s251">And there was an office for the foreigners, Offico Straniero, there was a man who was married to a Jewish girl from Germany--parenthetically, he was a good friend of mine--he said to me, "Well, you have to leave the Italian Kingdom within eight days.</span> <span id="s252">And you are not allowed to work here."</span> <span id="s253">I said, "What shall I do?</span> <span id="s254">Where should I go?</span> <span id="s255">I have nowhere to go because Poland took my citizenship away. "</span> <span id="s256">I was just stateless.</span> <span id="s257">So I said, "Well, besides," I say, "I am registered at the University of Rome, I can show you, here," I said, "here I have the receipts.</span> <span id="s258">I paid."</span> <span id="s259">He said, "Well," he said, "the receipts are not enough, because everybody accepts money.</span> <span id="s260">You have to bring a certificate or a document, or both, that you are registered at the University in Rome."</span> <span id="s261">"Now," he says, "you still have six days, or well, lets put the date," he says, "let's pretend that we called you after tomorrow, you know, so you have time to go there."</span> <span id="s262">I couldn't go, but I had a good friend.</span> <span id="s263">He was a student of medicine, he was from Germany, Marks, his name was Richard Marks.</span> <span id="s264">His father was Jewish, the mother was Christian, and he was a very good Catholic, and he could not study because Italy said, Mussolini said, that everybody, all students from all other countries, Jewish people, once registered in Italy, they can stay until they finish their studies, except German Jews.</span> <span id="s265">Finis, yes.</span> <span id="s266">We were very good friends.</span> <span id="s267">I used to be in Italy, in Rome, in '35 and '36.</span> <span id="s268">I used to be a guide in museums and old places, and I introduced him to, I made him work for me.</span> <span id="s269">I would go to Cook you know, these travel bureaus, and what I had, I always had more than I needed.</span> <span id="s270">So he used to make a little money.</span> <span id="s271">I wrote to him and I said, you go to Professor Amadasi and tell him the story.</span> <span id="s272">He went to Professor Amadasi, to the same Amadasi.</span> <span id="s273">What business did I have with Professor Amadasi?</span> <span id="s274">Nothing.</span> <span id="s275">He was not my relative, my friend, nothing.</span> <span id="s276">But the man, he just wanted to help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">ER: To help you.</span> <span id="s278">So you really didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">MR: So, right away, Sunday I received expresso, expressed, I received both a document and a certificate that I am registered at the University.</span> <span id="s280">You know, I left all my documents, all these in Archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">ER: In Yad Vashem?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">MR: No, no I have it here in Madison, in the Jewish Archives.</span> <span id="s283">If you are interested, all you have to do is to request it because they have to give them back to me if I want.</span> <span id="s284">They can make copies.</span> <span id="s285">But, anyway, so that was that.</span> <span id="s286">I came back, and I showed it to the man, to the--how you say...</span></p> <p><span id="s287">ER: The registrar?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">MR: Ya.</span> <span id="s289">He said, "Well you can stay."</span> <span id="s290">So he, they had a soggiorno, it's just a paper, a soggiorno that I am allowed to stay in Italy.</span> <span id="s291">So he wrote again that I am authorized to stay in Italy, but I am not allowed to work.</span> <span id="s292">He said, "Well, work, you can work.</span> <span id="s293">You have to make a living, don't you?</span> <span id="s294">We are not going to see what you do."</span> <span id="s295">And so I stayed in Venice.</span> <span id="s296">I went to the University, and this you will see in this...</span></p> <p><span id="s297">ER: Manuscript.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">MR: ...book that I am giving you, how they treated me.</span> <span id="s299">And I don't, I didn't try to lie, and I'm not telling you lies, cause what difference, what ties me to Mussolini or the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, what interest would I have to praise Mussolini, but, for the sake of truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">ER: So, you did not suffer any ill effects from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s302">MR: Yes, I was arrested in Italy, when Italy entered the war, they arrested me.</span> <span id="s303">They kept me in Venice for two weeks exactly, two weeks in the jail, which was terrible.</span> <span id="s304">I never, never experienced such misery.</span> <span id="s305">Terrible misery.</span> <span id="s306">And from there, they sent me to a concentration camp, which was one of the concentration camps...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">ER: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">MR: This was in July 2.</span> <span id="s309">I was arrested June 17 or 18, and July 2...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">ER: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">MR: 1940.</span> <span id="s312">Two in plain cloth, two policeman, in civil cloth.</span> <span id="s313">They accompanied me...</span></p> <p><span id="s314">ER: Plainclothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">MR: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">ER: Plainclothesmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">MR: Yes.</span> <span id="s318">They accompanied me and another one.</span> <span id="s319">They carried our baggage.</span> <span id="s320">They provided water for us.</span> <span id="s321">They were just friends.</span> <span id="s322">They did not treat us bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">ER: But from 1938 until 1940, you lived relatively easy, with no trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">MR: No trouble at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">ER: I would like to get back to 1939, in Poland, when the war, when Germany attacked Poland.</span> <span id="s326">Were you able to hear from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">MR: I wrote, in 1940, I wrote to my father, I wanted to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s328">He made me understand not to do it.</span> <span id="s329">This is what I say, I did everything to be destroyed, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">ER: Did you know what conditions they were living under?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">MR: My father worked for the Russians, so did my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s332">They did very well.</span> <span id="s333">They were not, my father was never in politics.</span> <span id="s334">Whereas others who were communists, you know what Russia did?</span> <span id="s335">The communists were the first to be deported to Siberia.</span> <span id="s336">Why?</span> <span id="s337">Because Stalin said, communists were not from Russia, they are Trotzkyists.</span> <span id="s338">You know, he was very much against Trotsky.</span> <span id="s339">They took all the communists, those who were communists right away to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">ER: But many of those communists survived the war because they were in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">MR: That's right.</span> <span id="s342">You have--that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">ER: Did you continue to hear from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">MR: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">ER: When did you lose contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">MR: In 1940.</span> <span id="s347">I wrote a few times, and after I was, you know, advised not to do it.</span> <span id="s348">My friends said don't... [voice in background] Oh, this was in 1937, my father was in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s349">No, it was '37 or '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">ER: So you no longer had any contact with any family members in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">MR: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">ER: Were you aware that they were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">MR: No, they were not, no, I knew it after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">ER: After the war.</span> <span id="s355">OK.</span> <span id="s356">What was the attitude of your immediate non-Jewish friends and neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">MR: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">ER: After 1938, when the anti-Jewish laws had taken effect.</span> <span id="s359">You were treated with decency at the university, you were allowed to continue but...</span></p> <p><span id="s360">MR: Not decency.</span> <span id="s361">They were just wonderful, most wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">ER: But your neighbor?</span> <span id="s363">And how did your neighbors treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">MR: Well, they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s365">For example, I was to go to buy fish.</span> <span id="s366">You know how it is, fish were not rationed.</span> <span id="s367">But when bread is rationed and butter and this and this, you have to wait.</span> <span id="s368">And I used to come there to buy fish.</span> <span id="s369">I used to eat in the Jewish restaurant, there in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s370">The woman would come to me, there was a woman and a man and boys, selling, who said, "Go home.</span> <span id="s371">We will leave fish for you."</span> <span id="s372">And when I came back, as much as I wanted.</span> <span id="s373">I went to buy cigarettes, so help me God, I swear to you, when I stayed in the line for cigarettes, because cigarettes were rationed too, the lady would say, "Come to get the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s374">I know you need them very badly.</span> <span id="s375">Go home, I will."</span> <span id="s376">And when I came back, instead of giving me one package of cigarettes, she would give me two, three packages.</span> <span id="s377">Why?</span> <span id="s378">Because there was always somebody who does not come, or who dies, so he leaves such, so she would give me more than I had a right to.</span> <span id="s379">This is the way the people in Venice.</span> <span id="s380">Do I say lies?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">ER: Do you think that all the people, all the Jews were treated that way, or were you an exception?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">MR: Why should I be an exception?</span> <span id="s383">No.</span> <span id="s384">This is the way Italians are.</span> <span id="s385">Of course, I am married to an Italian woman, which doesn't mean that I have an interest to say lies.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">ER: You mentioned that you were arrested in 1940, and then you were interned in a camp.</span> <span id="s387">Could you tell me where that camp was?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">MR: No, it was not in a camp the first time.</span> <span id="s389">In July 2, when we, it was July 3 probably, we were brought to Battipaglia and the train ended.</span> <span id="s390">There they took a taxi, the two policemen, and brought us to Campagna.</span> <span id="s391">Campagna used to be a resort place in peacetime, because it is beautiful, I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s392">Such beautiful--poverty, great poverty.</span> <span id="s393">But it was a sort of second or third degree.</span> <span id="s394">It's surrounded by hills, not mountains, so that we could not escape.</span> <span id="s395">They put us in barracks, there were some Bartholomeo [phonetic] and Concettione [phonetic].</span> <span id="s396">I'm telling you from there to look, it was on hills.</span> <span id="s397">To look down, it was the most beautiful thing.</span> <span id="s398">To watch a sundown or a sundawn, it was the most beautiful thing you can imagine.</span> <span id="s399">The population was very poor, very dirty, you know, but we were free all day, we were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">ER: What did you do all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">MR: What we do?</span> <span id="s402">We used to go into the cafeteria and stay there.</span> <span id="s403">Watch the girls, or give them trouble, not me...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">ER: You didn't work?</span> <span id="s405">There was no forced work or labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">MR: Work?</span> <span id="s407">Are you kidding?</span> <span id="s408">There was no work in no places.</span> <span id="s409">They had concentration camps.</span> <span id="s410">We did not want to be [unclear].</span> <span id="s411">Yes, there was the man who took care of the, would sweep the barrack, the hall, he would get paid.</span> <span id="s412">Not by us.</span> <span id="s413">We had a treatment like a prisoner, like a war prisoner.</span> <span id="s414">No, not like a war prisoner, sorry.</span> <span id="s415">Like an Italian soldier.</span> <span id="s416">The government would spend for each internee as much as they would spend for the military, for Italian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">ER: There was enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">MR: Food, we had more than we needed.</span> <span id="s419">Why, because the poverty was so great there, that they could not, the population could not buy the produces which they were entitled to.</span> <span id="s420">So we could, we had coffee and sugar and chocolate.</span> <span id="s421">Fruit oh, we used to get six lires a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">ER: They paid you for this?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">MR: No, we was [unclear], I mean, it was like, yes.</span> <span id="s424">Six lires a day, a good lunch would cost three lires.</span> <span id="s425">Food was just for nothing.</span> <span id="s426">You would get, for example, oil for nothing.</span> <span id="s427">Everything...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">ER: How long did you stay at this?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">MR: I stayed until August 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">ER: The same year, 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">MR: The same year, from July 2 to August 18.</span> <span id="s432">Then, a part of those people, a great part, were transferred to Ferramonti, which is in Calabria, more to the south.</span> <span id="s433">It's a deserted place.</span> <span id="s434">It's where, excuse me, the expression, "devil says good night."</span> <span id="s435">And there, of course, they, we were told that there is malaria and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s436">When we arrived there, we saw that was a desert, a real desert.</span> <span id="s437">But when we entered the barracks, we saw a great difference.</span> <span id="s438">And this you will read there, I have described it.</span> <span id="s439">We had a paradise, I wish before I die I still want to see that place.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">ER: And how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">MR: There I stayed until October 30.</span> <span id="s442">October 30, at that time, things weren't so good.</span> <span id="s443">It began to rain.</span> <span id="s444">We had good seep through, you know, we would have a little water, and when it rained, lots of mud, and it started to be bad.</span> <span id="s445">At that time, Mussolini sent me to take exams in Padua.</span> <span id="s446">I was a student at the university, a university student.</span> <span id="s447">So they gave me two policemen, two plaincloths, to accompany me from Calabria, from Ferramonti--the camp was there--Ferramonti, to Padua.</span> <span id="s448">You know, three days traveling.</span> <span id="s449">All the means Mussolini had for the policemen, for the army, for of course, transportation, he had nothing else to do, but to say, and I was not the only one, all the students, they were sent to the universities.</span> <span id="s450">And I was there, a month in Padua, and the professors they forced me onto the exams.</span> <span id="s451">For example, I was not prepared in Latin.</span> <span id="s452">I didn't even know the title of the book Professor Marchesi taught, and I said may I withdraw?</span> <span id="s453">No, you have to make the exam.</span> <span id="s454">He gave me 18 over 30, which means like a C.</span> <span id="s455">This is the way they treated us.</span> <span id="s456">And when I came back to Ferramonti, students, some students didn't come back.</span> <span id="s457">Well, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s458">ER: They just left?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">MR: And I was free too, I was free all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">ER: But you decided to come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">MR: I had to come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">ER: To Ferramonti?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">MR: To Ferramonti.</span> <span id="s464">And I came back at the end of December, and after three weeks, I received an order, not I, the secretary of the office, to send me back either to Venice or to Padua.</span> <span id="s465">It was my choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">ER: And where did you choose to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">MR: Venice.</span> <span id="s468">And I graduated, this was, as I said, it was December, no, wait, I don't know, November, no, it was December the 20th.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">ER: 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">MR: That's right, ma'am.</span> <span id="s471">And there, I stayed in Venice.</span> <span id="s472">I used to be there and do my teaching.</span> <span id="s473">I was a Hebrew teacher there, they had a parochial school, and to the University I would go very seldom.</span> <span id="s474">The only thing is, there, you have, they call it, an index, a book where it is written what you pay for your tuition and the lessons you attended.</span> <span id="s475">Everything.</span> <span id="s476">And the grades you had.</span> <span id="s477">There, you have to get the signature of the professor who taught you.</span> <span id="s478">I had, for example, I had to make 20 subjects, but every year, I had to make four or five, something like that.</span> <span id="s479">So I have four or five professors.</span> <span id="s480">And I needed these signatures.</span> <span id="s481">But there were, I don't know, 40 students, 50 students, and the professor would teach and teach, and teach, and after, he didn't have the time to give the signatures.</span> <span id="s482">So the custodian, how do call it, bidello, you know they call them bidello, the custodian there, he would take those booklets and the professor would give a signature, and after he would distribute among the students.</span> <span id="s483">Of course, you would give something to the bidello, give him a couple of lires.</span> <span id="s484">But they used to make a roll call.</span> <span id="s485">Very often the professor would say Relles, and present.</span> <span id="s486">Where, he wanted to see.</span> <span id="s487">I had a friend there, he was killed later, in the army, he would answer, "Present," how did the professor know?</span> <span id="s488">There was another thing, as many of the students who were at the front, they were called to the army, it was a tacit recommendation not to be so harsh with the students.</span> <span id="s489">So, if a student came, he wasn't prepared, he was in the army, he was in Russia, I don't know where he was, in Greece or in Africa, he came to the exams, a lieutenant, a captain, or even a sergeant, he had to be present.</span> <span id="s490">And I profited too, cause I was not prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">ER: What happened after 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">MR: After 1940, 1941 came, and on December 6, I graduated, not with honor, almost with honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">ER: You graduated the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">MR: The university.</span> <span id="s495">The way they treated me, the professor asked me, "How can you make a living?</span> <span id="s496">If you need money, you just tell me."</span></p> <p><span id="s497">ER: And did you get a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">MR: I didn't need a job.</span> <span id="s499">I had a job in Venice.</span> <span id="s500">I was a teacher there.</span> <span id="s501">I kept my job all the time.</span> <span id="s502">I was free.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">ER: And you continued to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">MR: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">ER: And how long did that last?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">MR: That lasted until December 5, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">ER: And what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">MR: At that time, a few days before, the government announced that all the Jews will be interned, and their properties sequestered, I don't know [unclear].</span> <span id="s509">And the police began to go among the Jews telling, "You better take care that you disappear, or we will have to arrest you."</span> <span id="s510">It was very easy.</span> <span id="s511">Why?</span> <span id="s512">Because a Jew who lived in Venice, he went 20 kilometers from Venice, to Mestre, and he said that he was bombed, or he was afraid to be bombed, and he wanted, so he was a refugee.</span> <span id="s513">But there, no one asked him whether he was Jewish or was not Jewish, you don't recognize there between Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s514">There is nothing whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">ER: So were you arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">MR: No.</span> <span id="s517">The rabbi, who happened to be blind and deaf, his wife, the director of the Jewish restaurant and his wife and a niece and the niece's boyfriend, we were seven, seven people in hiding.</span> <span id="s518">We left for Switzerland and we went to Milan.</span> <span id="s519">From Milan we went to Fermo, not Fermo, [voice in background] no, it's on top of Como, well, we went there in the mountains, you know, a few kilometers, you know, and there we began to look for guides.</span> <span id="s520">We found a guide, and this was, we arrived on a Friday night, terrible rain, oh, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s521">And Saturday, we were there all day.</span> <span id="s522">Sunday morning, the guide came, the guide was not good.</span> <span id="s523">He was a swindler, but anyways, we went to another place, and there he saw a, from the custom police, in plaincloth, he right away disappeared, and there we were arrested by the custom police, the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">ER: Of Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">MR: Of Italy.</span> <span id="s526">We were four kilometers from the border, the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s527">And if you, I was not there, it's a long story.</span> <span id="s528">I was not there because a lady said to me, "You want a guide?</span> <span id="s529">Come with me, I will show you a guide. "</span> <span id="s530">And she took me.</span> <span id="s531">She had a small like a buggy with a horse, a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s532">And she took me to a man who was, who happened to be, I don't know what, a carpenter or shoemaker, I don't remember, and said, "Yes, but I cannot do it today.</span> <span id="s533">I can do it tomorrow, after tomorrow."</span> <span id="s534">And so, we made it up.</span> <span id="s535">When I came back, she brought me back on that buggy, a young woman.</span> <span id="s536">And so she says, "Oh, escape, escape, escape because I see your people are arrested."</span> <span id="s537">She saw what happened.</span> <span id="s538">I said, escape, how could I leave those people, they were all over the line, except that girl and her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s539">And I went there, and I was arrested too.</span> <span id="s540">Not by that man, by that thing, you know, but by the Fascists, about eight or ten Fascists, you know.</span> <span id="s541">They said, "Oh, don't be afraid, nothing will happen to you.</span> <span id="s542">Mussolini is good."</span> <span id="s543">This is what they told us.</span> <span id="s544">And they took us to their commander.</span> <span id="s545">And there was the marshal, you know.</span> <span id="s546">He said, "Why didn't you go before?</span> <span id="s547">A few days before no one would have said a word.</span> <span id="s548">Why didn't you go?"</span> <span id="s549">He cried more than we.</span> <span id="s550">And after the man came back and the man who arrested them said, "They are my people, I have to, they are at my disposal."</span> <span id="s551">He says, "Thank God, that's good.</span> <span id="s552">I am very happy."</span> <span id="s553">And they began to take us from one place to another, you know.</span> <span id="s554">Well, how was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">ER: Where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">MR: They took us to the custom police.</span> <span id="s557">They gave us blankets and sheets and pillows, and we all slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s558">Next day, they gave us to eat something, we didn't have too much.</span> <span id="s559">After they took us to Como.</span> <span id="s560">They were so kind, you have no idea, of how kind they were to us.</span> <span id="s561">In Como, well, we arrived there in Como to the police, the questura, about 12:00 o'clock and we were there from 12:00 to 6:00 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s562">And there too we saw a man coming in and crying.</span> <span id="s563">Looking at us and crying.</span> <span id="s564">He was one of the, an employee.</span> <span id="s565">At 6:00 o'clock a man came, he was a pig.</span> <span id="s566">That one was a pig.</span> <span id="s567">I don't know what he was, but he was in plainclothes.</span> <span id="s568">He was shouting at us, not the police.</span> <span id="s569">And they took us to jail in Como.</span> <span id="s570">We arrived to jail, I don't know who there, the head there, the director, said, "I cannot take them.</span> <span id="s571">We have a place for 160 people, and we are keeping 800."</span> <span id="s572">Why, because there were too many people who were, they escaped from the army, they were close to the border, there were many people, smugglers and robbers and killers, so they cannot take us.</span> <span id="s573">So they took us back to the questura.</span> <span id="s574">The questura has a place for seven, eight people.</span> <span id="s575">If a man is caught drinking, they are arrested there.</span> <span id="s576">It's not the jail.</span> <span id="s577">We were about 35 people sleeping in a place for seven people.</span> <span id="s578">We slept one on the other.</span> <span id="s579">We did not have place where to stay.</span> <span id="s580">And there we were for three days.</span> <span id="s581">Wait a minute, it was Sunday before, Monday, we were there until Friday.</span> <span id="s582">The food, the only food they gave us was a piece of chocolate like this, you know, and they told us, we are giving it from our rations, the policemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">ER: Was that once a day, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s584">MR: Once a day.</span> <span id="s585">They didn't have themselves.</span> <span id="s586">And Friday, they brought us to another place not in Como.</span> <span id="s587">There it was a place for the custom police, another custom police.</span> <span id="s588">We arrived there, and how many people we--were there?</span> <span id="s589">About 35, 40 people, and a captain came in with a lieutenant, and "Ladies and gentlemen," they said, "you know you are our guests.</span> <span id="s590">We did not arrest you.</span> <span id="s591">And so, we will try to do what we can.</span> <span id="s592">We will give you a few crusts of bread, just that you can eat something.</span> <span id="s593">We will lend you things to sleep, blankets, we will do our best.</span> <span id="s594">But, you have to say nothing what we did for you."</span> <span id="s595">At that moment, I knew that we are in trouble.</span> <span id="s596">Because they were afraid of the Germans.</span> <span id="s597">And at the same moment, the soldiers, not soldiers, the police, the custom police, brought in pasta with cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s599">MR: I imagine you want me to show, eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">ER: No, that's alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">[Voice in background.]</span></p> <p><span id="s602">MR: Well, the facts are that we slept very well, of course, men and women apart, and in the morning, one of our people said, "Well, we actually should be in jail, shouldn't we?</span> <span id="s603">They have no place, but the rations we should get, we are entitled to get the rations."</span> <span id="s604">Now, we were watched, not by those custom police, from the questura men watched us.</span> <span id="s605">His wife brought us to eat; they didn't have themselves.</span> <span id="s606">Such wonderful people, you have no idea.</span> <span id="s607">And, so we talked to that man, and said why can't we get the rations.</span> <span id="s608">He said this was a good idea.</span> <span id="s609">He went to jail, or called, I don't know, and he came back and said, "I have good news for you.</span> <span id="s610">Tomorrow you will get the jail portions."</span> <span id="s611">And in fact, Sunday morning, he took two people, I was one of them, and brought us to jail, and they gave us a kettle, you know, with food, with soup.</span> <span id="s612">I'm telling you, this was soup.</span> <span id="s613">Of course, there was pork, but who cared.</span> <span id="s614">You know, the week before, somebody gave me a sandwich, a pork sandwich, and I said no.</span> <span id="s615">I didn't eat, you know, while we were there.</span> <span id="s616">But after they brought this, and I began, "Well, well," a boy says, "Stupid," he says, "it's meat."</span> <span id="s617">And I tasted it, and it was meat.</span> <span id="s618">It was so good, and some bread.</span> <span id="s619">You know, in the country, you could get such good bread.</span> <span id="s620">So, there we were, and we used to get that rations, a pound of bread, which means a pound and two ounces, and soup as much as you wanted.</span> <span id="s621">I really began to eat, we all began to eat, and what did I do?</span> <span id="s622">I asked them--it was very dirty and neglected--I asked for a pail and something, you know a rag and a broom, and I cleaned the steps, and they had to be all like me with them, all around, swept, and so they gave me cigarettes and bread, I had some more bread, I kept it under my pillow.</span> <span id="s623">Well, a few days later, there was a colonel too who was arrested because he would not adhere to Mussolini.</span> <span id="s624">We were three inside, a few days later, a German pullman arrived, a bus, and we were taken to another place--Camerlata.</span> <span id="s625">We were brought there, the place was called Camerlata, and there we were brought into a place which used to be a barracks for the carabinière, after it became a tobacco factory, a huge, huge hall, everything cement.</span> <span id="s626">Lots of garbage, garbage, and they make the men come in and they swept and made a big heap of garbage.</span> <span id="s627">And there we were about 200 people, because every once in a while, another group was brought in, people from Venice, too , you know, in Venice there was a colonel, you know, a Jewish colonel.</span> <span id="s628">He and his wife, a boy and a girl, none of them came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">ER: Who was in charge at this "Camelot"?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">MR: In Camerlata, the police, the questura.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">ER: Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">MR: Yes, and the carabinière.</span> <span id="s633">Because the carabinière, I don't know the difference.</span> <span id="s634">But there were two different kinds of police.</span> <span id="s635">The questura is not the town municipal.</span> <span id="s636">It's police, but they are not so harsh like the carabinière.</span> <span id="s637">The carabinière have to do more with criminals.</span> <span id="s638">When the carabinière takes you, he handcuffs, not the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">ER: And there were no Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">MR: No.</span> <span id="s641">No Germans at all.</span> <span id="s642">One German soldier came because he was looking for a body.</span> <span id="s643">And they said, well, we were left there at noon, he said, the police came and said, "Well, you have to be very careful.</span> <span id="s644">You will not be mistreated, but remember outside we have machine guns.</span> <span id="s645">It was a three story house.</span> <span id="s646">And food, we want food, right away.</span> <span id="s647">All day, we have nothing to eat, all night, we have nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s648">Then one of those, yes, there were both carabinière and police, as I say, and to warm up a little bit, because this was in December...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">ER: Was this in Northern Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">MR: North Italy, yes, ma'am, it was not far from Como, Milan, not far from the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s651">And he took some, something like coal, it's not coal, I don't know what it was, and made a fire so we had lots of smoke.</span> <span id="s652">But the next day, the food came from jail, a pound of bread, a very good soup, and towards the evening, the Italians were brought in.</span> <span id="s653">People because one did something, or another did something, or because they did not do something, they were arrested and brought in there.</span> <span id="s654">And those people, they brought tobacco, they were from the same town, so they would have what to eat, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">ER: Did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">MR: What work?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">ER: During the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">MR: Are you kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">ER: No forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">MR: No, nothing.</span> <span id="s661">It was very cold there, but they brought straw, they gave us, and the nuns brought things.</span> <span id="s662">I cannot tell you, we had so much.</span> <span id="s663">Meanwhile, I think, we had Christmas.</span> <span id="s664">They brought in ham and ducks and geese, you know, fried, and money, and brought the nuns.</span> <span id="s665">A man, whose name was Bianchi, he had a garage, he was in jail too.</span> <span id="s666">He took us, I don't know, he had sympathy for me, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s667">And before he left, before Christmas, the prefect, the head of the town, he let the Italians home.</span> <span id="s668">So he came to me and said...</span></p> <p><span id="s669">ER: Italian Jews home?</span> <span id="s670">Or just the...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">MR: No, no...</span></p> <p><span id="s672">ER: Just the other Italians?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">MR: Yes, the Italians [unclear].</span> <span id="s674">He said to me, Bianchi, Mr. Bianchi, "Now I leave this sheets and blankets," and he had other things, "I leave for you because you may need it."</span> <span id="s675">And the next day, a man came, where is Relles?</span> <span id="s676">He brought me to eat, rice and meat, and even wine.</span> <span id="s677">Well, to make a short story long, a day later, a day or two days later, they came from the questura and they said, well, we have a list here for people who are going to leave this place which is so bad.</span> <span id="s678">You are going to Fossoli di Corp not far from Modena.</span> <span id="s679">There is a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s680">There you will have places where to live different, apartments for married people, for bachelors, and you will live like human beings.</span> <span id="s681">So he makes, he reads the list, but I am not on the list.</span> <span id="s682">There were a few more people who were not on the list.</span> <span id="s683">A Jew from Tripoli.</span> <span id="s684">A Jew from Turkey.</span> <span id="s685">A Spanish Jew.</span> <span id="s686">We say, "Why aren't we?"</span> <span id="s687">You are at the disposal, we cannot, we don't know.</span> <span id="s688">It was clear that the Spanish Jew, you know that Franco, although he was a Fascist, he protected his Jews.</span> <span id="s689">They would, the Jew from Spain would be sent to Spain, and the Jew from Poland to Poland, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s690">But was said there was, that the Germans, when they caught Jews in Milan or around, they would not deport them because they did not have transportation.</span> <span id="s691">They would either kill them throw them in their, in the lake.</span> <span id="s692">So I had, I knew that I had to escape.</span> <span id="s693">Now, what happened, there too.</span> <span id="s694">The first floor were the carabinière and the second floor were the women, and the third floor were the men.</span> <span id="s695">And, I was on the third floor.</span> <span id="s696">But, because I asked the carabinière, I would like to make a little order, they gave me a pail and a rag and a broom, and I washed the--outside, not far away, there was like a depot, a place where the peasants, they would bring their tobacco, you know, to the government.</span> <span id="s697">And so you have there straw and all kinds of garbage, and I worked there, so I could go out and look around.</span> <span id="s698">But I said, "I'm not going to escape."</span> <span id="s699">Why?</span> <span id="s700">For the simple reason because to escape and after to be caught and to be brought back would be worse.</span> <span id="s701">So, OK.</span> <span id="s702">On the third floor, we did not have the water.</span> <span id="s703">It was too high.</span> <span id="s704">So I would go to have--because it was barracks, so they had bathrooms and the water.</span> <span id="s705">So I would go to the women.</span> <span id="s706">I had to wash.</span> <span id="s707">I had to keep myself clean.</span> <span id="s708">So I would go and percentage-wise I would wash.</span> <span id="s709">I washed, I had rags, you know, and I go out from there from the wash place, and I see a lady talks to the women who were arrested, a lady in her 70s, for sure, beautiful, tall, elegant, and she says, "What does this man do here?"</span> <span id="s710">And they said, "He is arrested too.</span> <span id="s711">And she says, "So, why didn't you go with other people?"</span> <span id="s712">Because they had people remain, people who could not see, blind people, there were a few invalids, but she saw I was not an invalid, people who were mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s713">There was a lady who had a son, a Jewish lady, but the boy was not Jewish and he was killed in the war, thus he would be free.</span> <span id="s714">These people were there.</span> <span id="s715">She said, "What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s716">Why didn't you go to Fossoli di Carpi?"</span> <span id="s717">I said, "Because I am going to the deportation."</span> <span id="s718">She says, the deportation, why?</span> <span id="s719">Why don't you escape?</span> <span id="s720">I said, "I have no money.</span> <span id="s721">They took all the money away."</span></p> <p><span id="s722">ER: Were you aware at this time what deportation meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">MR: No.</span> <span id="s724">No.</span> <span id="s725">We were aware that means work, beating, why, because we heard what they did in Dachau, what they did before the war broke out, we had refugees, and we knew what...</span></p> <p><span id="s726">ER: And you didn't know that they were gassing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">MR: No.</span> <span id="s728">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">ER: This was 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">MR: No.</span> <span id="s731">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">ER: They weren't gassing people in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">MR: No.</span> <span id="s734">No.</span> <span id="s735">We didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s736">And, when people came, for example, in 1944 in Switzerland, the man came, and he told these stories.</span> <span id="s737">He saw how they would make, how they would kill Jews en masse.</span> <span id="s738">He was from Maidanek and he told all these stories.</span> <span id="s739">Nobody believed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">ER: So did you believe him?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">MR: No.</span> <span id="s742">But going back, she says I give you thousand lire, and that time a thousand lire was still money.</span> <span id="s743">So I said, "What should I do with the money?"</span> <span id="s744">She said, "Well, first of all, you can buy a bike.</span> <span id="s745">If you are caught, you can give it to the policeman so he lets you go."</span></p> <p><span id="s746">ER: You could bribe him.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">MR: Bribe him.</span> <span id="s748">With money you can do.</span> <span id="s749">I said, "No thank you.</span> <span id="s750">I'd rather not.</span> <span id="s751">I am dead.</span> <span id="s752">I am a dead man," I say.</span> <span id="s753">"I don't need.</span> <span id="s754">You give money somebody else might need it better."</span> <span id="s755">I thanked her of course in a nice way.</span> <span id="s756">But I caught her interest.</span> <span id="s757">Next day, while I was cleaning outside, sweeping, she came back, she brought me Grossini [phonetic].</span> <span id="s758">How do you call Grossini?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">[Voice in background.]</span></p> <p><span id="s760">MR: [unclear] No, a bunch, and she says, "This coat for you is not good, because I want you to escape, but this coat is very dirty."</span> <span id="s761">Of course, you know I slept in it at that time, and its untergesunter [not healthy].</span> <span id="s762">This is what she says, which means it's--</span></p> <p><span id="s763">[Voice in background]</span></p> <p><span id="s764">MR: Yah.</span> <span id="s765">And she gave me a new coat.</span> <span id="s766">"I want to save you," she said.</span> <span id="s767">OK.</span> <span id="s768">I thanked her, and a day later, I don't remember, or that same day, a girl came, a girl, 18, 19 year old, her name was Colombo, which is a Jewish name, but she was not Jewish, and she said that she was from the Red Cross, because we needed certain things like soap and writing paper and all kinds of things, so she would take, they didn't have a casino there, for the refugees, for their prisoners.</span> <span id="s769">So she would take the people whatever they wanted, and they would buy it, and they would pay her, and that's all.</span> <span id="s770">So she came, and we knew her, she would come and go, come and go.</span> <span id="s771">Did I ever tell you the story...</span></p> <p><span id="s772">ER: Where did they get the money to pay her?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">MR: Well, the nuns brought in money.</span> <span id="s774">Yes ma'am.</span> <span id="s775">I had 300 lires.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">ER: From the nuns?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">MR: From the nuns.</span> <span id="s778">No, they gave to that Colonel Basami, and he divided, and he gave me more because he said rabbis would need more.</span> <span id="s779">Now he protected me.</span> <span id="s780">He gave me preference.</span> <span id="s781">So anyways, and there were people, they had money.</span> <span id="s782">As a matter of fact, where was I, yes.</span> <span id="s783">And she comes and she says, "Listen," she says, "I'm in love with you, and I want a picture of you."</span> <span id="s784">I said, "Why would you want a picture?"</span> <span id="s785">"Because now we are going, Mrs. Monte, that lady," was not her name, Mrs. Monte, her name was Carmelli, "Mrs. Monte wants to make a false document for you, and if you escape and we will help you to escape, you will need it."</span> <span id="s786">Now, there were three floors on top.</span> <span id="s787">You know, the Italian roofs are made like, terraza they called it, terrace, made of cement, and all you had to do is open a window, and we would be allowed to go there for fresh air.</span> <span id="s788">You could stay all day there, because the carabinière, they were downstairs, they were our best friends.</span> <span id="s789">They would help us.</span> <span id="s790">They didn't know what to do to help us.</span> <span id="s791">And she says, "Why don't we go upstairs there and make the pictures."</span> <span id="s792">And she made pictures, I don't know how many positions she made, about 20.</span> <span id="s793">Next day, she came back with the pictures.</span> <span id="s794">I even remember the name of the photographer --Bernasconi.</span> <span id="s795">It's the foolishness you remember.</span> <span id="s796">"Mr. Bernasconi made this picture," she says.</span> <span id="s797">And I looked and I looked so bad in it, I said, "Ma'am, you cannot put such a picture on the passport because I look like a murderer, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">UP: You put it on the identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">MR: Identity card.</span> <span id="s800">"No," I said, "this is not, doesn't make it.</span> <span id="s801">I thank you very much."</span> <span id="s802">So now, next day she came and she said, "Listen, I have here the next house is a place where there is furniture of a firm which was bankrupt.</span> <span id="s803">But when you cross that road from this place," that she showed me, "there is another place.</span> <span id="s804">There is a lady, Mrs. Gatto," which means cat.</span> <span id="s805">"Mrs. Gatto is willing to let you in when you escape, and keep you in her place.</span> <span id="s806">The only thing is," she says, "the trouble is, there is in the same house, there are SS men.</span> <span id="s807">So we have to see what's what.</span> <span id="s808">OK?"</span></p> <p><span id="s809">ER: Were these people trying to help anybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">MR: Oh yes, of course.</span> <span id="s811">It was a committee.</span> <span id="s812">I never knew the name of the committee, but they were all caught later.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">ER: Were they caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">MR: That lady who saved me, she was in the country, I don't remember where, and she came back.</span> <span id="s815">She was so in bad shape, in such bad shape, they didn't know whether she was a man or a woman.</span> <span id="s816">Anyways, okay, there was another man with me, Nochmeas [phonetic] was his name, he was a spy, this is what he said, from Yugoslavia, a Jew who was baptized, and he was caught for espionage, not for being a Jew.</span> <span id="s817">But they had nothing against him.</span> <span id="s818">So they put him there, he had lots of money his wife would bring him.</span> <span id="s819">And they were interested in him too.</span> <span id="s820">And so, we were there one evening, she comes, I was downstairs with the police there, cause there it was warm, you know, and I warmed up the soup, you know, they had little things for making, and she comes and she says to me, "Come upstairs, I have the paper which I bought for you.</span> <span id="s821">Come upstairs, because I have to take it out, I have many things."</span> <span id="s822">And I came, and she says, "In 10 minutes you must be out.</span> <span id="s823">There you will go," and she showed me all--I have to make here a parenthesis, the day before we took, you know, she invited the carabinière and that man Nochmeas and me to drink wine, a--how do you call it--the saloon, there every second house is one, so that we could spy out, look around, what's out there.</span> <span id="s824">She says, "In 10 minutes you will have to be there.</span> <span id="s825">You cross that road, and there at the end of the extremity of that road, it brings you to the house of that Mrs. Gatto.</span> <span id="s826">There is a little balcony, you have to go to that balcony.</span> <span id="s827">The lady will put a ladder."</span> <span id="s828">OK, it was on the third floor.</span> <span id="s829">I took, I had mountain shoes, and I put, I went up, you know, and the mountain shoes I put on my feet, and I began to go on that road, it makes a jingles, you know, and I came there to very end, and down there are streetcars, they had curfew at that time.</span> <span id="s830">But it was before the curfew, this is what she said, "You have to run fast, because it was 6:00, because at 7:00, its curfew, they catch you."</span> <span id="s831">And, she took me, I mean, I myself went through, you know, creeping, creeping, and I arrive there.</span> <span id="s832">And I remember all my life, I came and I kept my hands, you know, at the roof, and looked for the ladder.</span> <span id="s833">I didn't look for the ladder, just, you know, moving my legs, no ladder.</span> <span id="s834">Finally, the lady came out and she put my feet on the ladder, and I came in.</span> <span id="s835">She says, "You will tell the lady that you are a cousin of mine."</span> <span id="s836">She gave me right away tea, I don't remember, tea or coffee, yeah, tea.</span> <span id="s837">She gave me sardines, you know, and a few minutes later, that girl came, Columbo, and says, "Now you come with me."</span> <span id="s838">And we walked and walked, maybe, I don't know, a half a mile, one mile, two miles.</span> <span id="s839">How can I remember?</span> <span id="s840">And there we met a lady with two young daughters.</span> <span id="s841">And they took us, took me in a home, I tell you, it was a palace.</span> <span id="s842">And there a bed, I didn't sleep in a bed for months.</span> <span id="s843">I didn't go to sleep on the bed.</span> <span id="s844">Why?</span> <span id="s845">Because I was stupid.</span> <span id="s846">I didn't have, you know, bedbugs or lice, they were everywhere.</span> <span id="s847">I kept myself clean, and we didn't have it, but I still was afraid.</span> <span id="s848">And I slept all night.</span> <span id="s849">Yes, when I arrived there, there was good soup, chicken soup, you know, and pasta and meat.</span> <span id="s850">I ate everything.</span> <span id="s851">And cigarettes, they were in good condition.</span> <span id="s852">Their son was a prisoner in Poland, a German prisoner.</span> <span id="s853">The Germans deported him to Poland.</span> <span id="s854">So she says, "What I do for you, I hope people will do for my son."</span></p> <p><span id="s855">ER: How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">MR: Next day, we get coffee and bread and a good breakfast, and that girl came, and she gave me 100 lires, that lady, and I cannot forget this, and I feel so--unconsciously I feel so guilty.</span> <span id="s857">I did not, I couldn't afford it after the war, I wasn't there at the end, you understand.</span> <span id="s858">I should have gone there to thank them, or at least to make it known, I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s859">And I really, my conscience is so guilty.</span> <span id="s860">So, and that girl came, Colombo, she says, "Well, now we are going to Milan."</span> <span id="s861">I said, "You are not coming with me, because if I am caught, you are caught."</span> <span id="s862">"Don't worry," she says.</span> <span id="s863">So I sent her ahead, because she had to take me to the train, the commuting train, people who worked, people who lived out of Milan, they would go to Milan to work everyday, and finally we arrived there at the station, and we took the tickets, and OK, and we were on the train.</span> <span id="s864">I said to her to stay far away from me, and this is what she did.</span> <span id="s865">She gave me an address before, when I arrived in Milan, where I have to go, everything was organized.</span> <span id="s866">Well, we stop for a while, all is stopped, the militia comes, the Facist militia, for documents.</span> <span id="s867">You can imagine in a train, full of people, they cannot call them all.</span> <span id="s868">So they just made, they call, they said, those two, come to me with your documents.</span> <span id="s869">And I didn't have any documents, and I begin to look, and the other one says, "Oh, let him go.</span> <span id="s870">Can't you see he's just a poor devil."</span></p> <p><span id="s871">ER: Lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">MR: I arrived there.</span> <span id="s873">They called, "No station," because in Milan, you have many stations, many depots, no station.</span> <span id="s874">There weren't two bricks together.</span> <span id="s875">All bombed.</span> <span id="s876">And I look and I have to go to Via Amoretto, do you know where Via Amoretto is?</span> <span id="s877">Via Amoretto [unclear]?</span> <span id="s878">Nor did I. And I knew that there every second man is a spy to catch the English spies, because England, the English people, with their English Air Force, they knew everything so well, I said, "How can I go out to save myself."</span> <span id="s879">So, I go out, there was a German soldier, in his 50s, you know, an old man, directing the traffic.</span> <span id="s880">They didn't have the--you know, I precipitated myself to him.</span> <span id="s881">I didn't think strong.</span> <span id="s882">And I began to talk Italian.</span> <span id="s883">"I want to go to Via Amoretto, ok, you tell me?"</span> <span id="s884">And I talked in Italian dialect, you know, I was five or six years in Italy.</span> <span id="s885">So he talks to me in German, I don't understand anything.</span> <span id="s886">He says, there is a policeman, because he was directing the traffic, and there was a policeman, so if somebody violated the traffic, to arrest him.</span> <span id="s887">So I go to that policeman and I said, could you show me where, how I go to?</span> <span id="s888">He says, "Well, in about a half an hour, I end my service."</span> <span id="s889">It was about 11:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s890">"And I go to Piazza Suza, and Piazza Suza is across the Via Amoretto.</span> <span id="s891">You understand?"</span> <span id="s892">Now, when a man stays with a policeman and talks to him, who is going to think that he is a Polish Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">ER: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">MR: I had cigarettes, the best cigarettes.</span> <span id="s895">I couldn't smoke them because they were too light for me, Ceralio cigarettes.</span> <span id="s896">[laughing] Small things, you know.</span> <span id="s897">I gave him a cigarette, offer him, it was something, he didn't smoke such cigarettes all his life.</span> <span id="s898">And I said, "I have another two here, keep it."</span> <span id="s899">And after we started walking, I know that until Via Amoretto I am safe.</span> <span id="s900">If you go with the policeman, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">ER: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">MR: And I walked with him, and he brought me there.</span> <span id="s903">But, in Italy, at 12:00, there is the siesta, or the fiesta, what is it?</span> <span id="s904">The siesta.</span> <span id="s905">They close up, and they have to stay open but this way, eh, it was dumb.</span> <span id="s906">I say, what shall I do?</span> <span id="s907">I go to have a shave.</span> <span id="s908">Usually I shave myself, but I go there.</span> <span id="s909">First, I went for a coffee, I took a card, you know, to write to my friends who were deported to show them that I was free, which meant I would do something for them.</span> <span id="s910">And after I went to the barber, and you know, he didn't have too many people, there, because there were underground fighters, partisans, there were spies, there were all kinds of people, there were deserters, the Fascists, they used to close up a square or a street.</span> <span id="s911">No one could go in, no one could go out, and they would ask people, you know, this is what they did there.</span> <span id="s912">He was shaving me, you know, or cutting my hair, I don't remember, and they closed up the street.</span> <span id="s913">They did not come into, I finished, I go there to...</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s915">MR: I came there, and there was one girl, who said, "Oh, we were so worried about you, because Mrs. so and so, Mrs. Monte, called us up asking us, telling us, no asking us, whether her gloves are ready, which meant that you were supposed to arrive, and you did not."</span> <span id="s916">So I explained what happened.</span> <span id="s917">There, every store has a room behind, how do they call it?</span> <span id="s918">She says, here, she says, will be your place.</span> <span id="s919">To eat, we have nothing.</span> <span id="s920">I said, "You have nothing, but I do have."</span> <span id="s921">And I took my servings out, and we split it.</span> <span id="s922">There was a boy, also a boy, 17 or 18 years old, he had to go to the army, and he did not go.</span> <span id="s923">So he was there.</span> <span id="s924">And we began to talk, and this and that, and she says, "Well, you will sleep, you will sleep in a place which is, the people left, it's empty.</span> <span id="s925">They left on account of the bombing.</span> <span id="s926">You will sleep there, OK?"</span> <span id="s927">This was at noon or 2:00, you know, it was the last day of December, maybe December 27, 28, it was the end days, the last day.</span> <span id="s928">And nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s929">She made a soup, it was water, just water and a little vegetables.</span> <span id="s930">Night, all night I slept there.</span> <span id="s931">Cold, terribly cold, without heat, terribly cold.</span> <span id="s932">In the morning, her sister came.</span> <span id="s933">Her sister went to that camp, to that jail, where I was.</span> <span id="s934">Oh, the carabinièries they were so angry...</span></p> <p><span id="s935">ER: Yeah, that you were gone, that you had escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">MR: Oh, one says, "If I catch him!"</span> <span id="s937">And they make signals, but one young soldier said to her, and I knew the name, Jachito was his name, I know, so she described him to me, a blond, he says, "Oy," he says, "I couldn't tell you how much I enjoyed that he will be saved.</span> <span id="s938">He is out.</span> <span id="s939">He will be saved."</span> <span id="s940">And all day I stayed there, and when I said, "Well, you promised me a document."</span> <span id="s941">"No, we cannot give you a document because if you are caught and beaten, you will say who saved you, and this we cannot afford."</span> <span id="s942">And so, nothing doing, about 5:00 in the evening, the boy who was there, hidden, he brought me to a lawyer, oh, he was a man in his 70s, maybe late 60s, Garatski, a lawyer, and he said, "Well, now I will put you in a nice place.</span> <span id="s943">Do you have any money?"</span> <span id="s944">I said, "Yes, I have about 400 lires."</span> <span id="s945">And he put me in a streetcar, and we traveled, traveled, traveled, to there, the address was Via Aldini, which means Aldini Street, 12, Number 12, it's the Tutio Palazzio [phonetic], I don't know more.</span> <span id="s946">I show the man, another man, and one says, "Why, I live there.</span> <span id="s947">You come with me."</span> <span id="s948">And we arrived there, maybe about 8:00.</span> <span id="s949">There was a rest home, and for people, for cripples, you know, there were about 1,000 people, men and women, beautiful place.</span> <span id="s950">You know, I wasn't used anymore, warm and light, and there was a nun, a young nun, she took my name.</span> <span id="s951">She says, well, your name is not Mayer Relles.</span> <span id="s952">Your name is Giovanni Piorolla.</span> <span id="s953">I still have the document, oh, maybe I gave, I gave it to her?</span> <span id="s954">Giovanni Piorolla.</span> <span id="s955">You are from Passia [phonetic], which is Italy, South Italy, under the occupation, American and British occupation, which was very foolish because when I talk one sentence in Italian they know that I am not from the south, and that I am not Italian.</span> <span id="s956">You know, the accent.</span> <span id="s957">You don't get rid of your accent.</span> <span id="s958">Anyways, she says, you have, you are sick, and what sickness, how call that sickness, when a person goes and falls...</span></p> <p><span id="s959">ER: Fainting?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">MR: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">ER: Seizures?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">MR: Something like that.</span> <span id="s963">Well, anyways, and that's it.</span> <span id="s964">And she brought me upstairs to the second floor.</span> <span id="s965">There was another nun, and she says something to her, and she gave me a bowl of rice with milk, and she gave me bread, they have new bread, fresh, and she gave me a piece of cigar, and I cut it and wrapped it in paper, and I felt the happiest person, and after she brought me in a room, other people slept there.</span> <span id="s966">A room, and a bed, and a mattress, and blankets.</span> <span id="s967">Well, I had there, but, at 4:00 I woke up, no fear anymore the Germans would come to take me.</span> <span id="s968">And I was in my bed at 7:00, they called to church.</span> <span id="s969">It was the first day of January, 1944.</span> <span id="s970">The bells, they have bells, ringing.</span> <span id="s971">But it wasn't real bells, it was something made with a phonograph.</span> <span id="s972">And where I am, everybody had to go to church, and I went down to church, and I saw Jesus, in that little thing, you know, and the man, the priest, made a beautiful speech telling them don't expect me to tell Jesus, the Bambino, to give you cigars, those funny cigars, and so on, and so on, and after I came back they gave me a uniform, special for those people, and they gave me a glass of milk and they gave me bread like that which you bake, and said now, that bread is for all day.</span> <span id="s973">And there for three weeks I learned what hunger means.</span> <span id="s974">Why?</span> <span id="s975">Because they would give you bread, they would give you a glass of milk, but for lunch they would give you a spoon or so of potatoes, a piece of meat you needed binoculars to see it, and in the evening they would give you all nothing.</span> <span id="s976">And this is what they gave.</span> <span id="s977">Of course, the eldest sister, she ordered to give me a double portion of bread, and I used to go and to wash the windows and to wash the floor, so she would give me another piece of bread.</span> <span id="s978">But there, everybody wanted to wash the floor.</span> <span id="s979">When I said, do you have some wood?</span> <span id="s980">"Piorolla, where can I get wood for you?</span> <span id="s981">Everybody wants wood."</span> <span id="s982">And I knew real hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">ER: How many people were at this house, this store?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">MR: At this place?</span> <span id="s985">About 1,000 people, and about 50 people would die everyday of starvation.</span> <span id="s986">Of course, many of them were from Milan, because this was in Milan, a suburb of Milan.</span> <span id="s987">There were many people, saw the children would bring them, relatives would bring them, they knew that one who has no, nothing from outside cannot survive there.</span> <span id="s988">They would eat grass, if there was any.</span> <span id="s989">They would swallow paper, and we had funerals, funerals, funerals.</span> <span id="s990">One day, on a Friday, a man is brought, and I don't remember, yeah, his name was Ochsong [phonetic].</span> <span id="s991">A man of 75 years old, a Jewish man from Poland.</span> <span id="s992">He was in France, and this man in France, he managed, he was a month, oh, never mind, he came, and I said, he was there, put there by a committee, and I said to him, "Oy, it's bad here, hunger."</span> <span id="s993">And he said, "Young man, don't worry.</span> <span id="s994">I have money.</span> <span id="s995">You won't starve."</span> <span id="s996">In fact, next day, with money you could buy everything there.</span> <span id="s997">You could buy, of course, there was bread made of bran.</span> <span id="s998">No one would eat the bread of bran.</span> <span id="s999">I ate bread of bran, because in Italy, only the pigs are given bran.</span> <span id="s1000">And this was not tragic.</span> <span id="s1001">And there were all kinds of things, you know, he would help me every once in a while.</span> <span id="s1002">Not often, after all, an old man, and I was not the kind, I would die 20 times better than to take advantage.</span> <span id="s1003">One day, Mother Clara, her name was, Mother Clara comes and says, "Piorolla, are you, could you be a barber."</span> <span id="s1004">I said, "What a question you ask!</span> <span id="s1005">My father was a barber, my grandfather was a barber, and I am a barber!"</span> <span id="s1006">She said, "Because one of our barbers died, and we will, we need a barber, and your advantage will be, because as a barber, you have your room where it's warm, and you shave, you get nothing for shaving, but everybody gives you, one gives you lire, one gives you half a lire, you make a little money."</span> <span id="s1007">And she brings me the razors and everything, and soap, but the soap was "otarkik" what does "otarkik" mean--you had everything in that soap, besides soap.</span> <span id="s1008">You had sand and stone, everything.</span> <span id="s1009">I needed good soap.</span> <span id="s1010">But there was another nun, old, and I said to her, "Do you have a little soap, good soap?"</span> <span id="s1011">So she brought me soap, and you know, on the paper was written it was made 20 years ago.</span> <span id="s1012">This was good soap because soap, the older--and I began to be the barber.</span> <span id="s1013">Most of my work was on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1014">And, of course, the first few beards I cut, I would cut every beard, they said, "Leave me alone," and they wanted to beat me.</span> <span id="s1015">But after I learned, you know, I used to shave about 100 beards a day, you believe me or not.</span> <span id="s1016">Yes, I would begin at 7:00 in the morning, and this meant money, I make money.</span> <span id="s1017">Of course, we have people who didn't give me anything, but with money, I could buy, how would buy.</span> <span id="s1018">They had funerals.</span> <span id="s1019">So whenever there was a funeral, I would go with the funeral, and opposite, there was a bakery, and for money, instead of two lires for a piece of bread I would give them 20 or instead of 20 cents, I would give them two lires.</span> <span id="s1020">After, I used to make with that nun who gave me the soap, I was to do business.</span> <span id="s1021">I went to there, they had Tuscany cigars, they were rationed.</span> <span id="s1022">But people would die, so they would not smoke.</span> <span id="s1023">So she would take the rations.</span> <span id="s1024">So she had cigars.</span> <span id="s1025">I would, for every few cigars, I would give her money to buy candles for the Madonna, but as I knew later, she bought wine, she liked the wine for herself to drink.</span> <span id="s1026">But I had cigars, Tuscany cigars, I had cigars.</span> <span id="s1027">So I went there to the baker and I said, he used not only to smoke cigars, but to chew them too.</span> <span id="s1028">In Italy they chew them, in Milan.</span> <span id="s1029">So I said, this is rationed.</span> <span id="s1030">You give me bread, I give you cigars.</span> <span id="s1031">So I had so much bread, I couldn't, I would never be able to finish it.</span> <span id="s1032">After, about, oh, I don't remember, exactly when, after two months, a boy came, his name was Klinger, his mother was divorced from his father.</span> <span id="s1033">He was Jewish, he talked Jewish.</span> <span id="s1034">She baptized the boy, she lived with a policeman, and that boy was put there to be hidden.</span> <span id="s1035">But, what was his job?</span> <span id="s1036">He was a young infermièra, a young nurse.</span> <span id="s1037">He didn't know too much, but he had--they gave him to eat.</span> <span id="s1038">And every day he would bring me bread with jam, bread with butter.</span> <span id="s1039">I tell you, he would put it under my pillow.</span> <span id="s1040">I said, "Listen," I don't remember his name, "I cannot accept this.</span> <span id="s1041">If you don't accept it," I told him, "I don't need that much."</span> <span id="s1042">This I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s1043">Those nuns who preach paradise and all these things, I saw people at that time, you know, all this starvation, I saw people eating like in a restaurant, having the menu, with money.</span> <span id="s1044">With money you have everything.</span> <span id="s1045">And he was treated well, his mother paid.</span> <span id="s1046">And that little boy, he was lucky, he did for me more than a child for his father.</span> <span id="s1047">OK?</span> <span id="s1048">Now, in that place, she would come, not Mrs. Monte, but another girl, oh, she was about in her 40s, Miss Commelli, she would come, she would bring me pastry, cigarettes, that I needed like a hole in my head.</span> <span id="s1049">I didn't need it.</span> <span id="s1050">And I tell you, they were so fine, so nice to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">ER: How long did you stay here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">MR: I stayed there from January 31st in the evening until April 15.</span> <span id="s1053">And there, that lady made it out that we were brought to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1054">There was another lady, that man Ochsong, that old man, died.</span> <span id="s1055">He had a wife, he married her because Hitler said if an old man needs a wife, his wife can survive too.</span> <span id="s1056">She had two girls, one was 12 years old, they are both in Israel, and one is 18, she was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s1057">They were in another, not in a church, in a monastery.</span> <span id="s1058">One was in Contello [phonetic], and one was in Tradate.</span> <span id="s1059">You see, I remember the names.</span> <span id="s1060">But, it so happened that there was a church, not a church, but an institution for poor people for them to eat and sleep, Cardinal Ferrari, and there one day, there were about 100 Jews hidden.</span> <span id="s1061">And there the SS came in, they didn't even ask are you Jewish, they, by themselves, they recognized who was a Jew, and who wasn't a Jew.</span> <span id="s1062">With the dogs.</span> <span id="s1063">So, she was afraid to keep these girls, so she brought them to [unclear].</span> <span id="s1064">And we, on April 15...</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">ER: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">MR: 1944.</span> <span id="s1067">Yes, it was--there is a story, you know, I really believed in kindness and gentleness.</span> <span id="s1068">I promised that woman, because she was not under my committee, you understand, she was under another committee, Cardinal Ferrari.</span> <span id="s1069">But Cardinal Ferrari did not exist anymore.</span> <span id="s1070">So she said, "Relles, do something for me."</span> <span id="s1071">I said, "When the time will come, when you will have to go, I will go with you."</span> <span id="s1072">Because the girl, 12 years old, she had, here was a neuritis.</span> <span id="s1073">You know such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">ER: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">MR: So, one day, that Mrs. Comelli comes and says, Piorolla, she called me Piorolla too, Piorolla, in 10 minutes you are going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1076">She used to call us together with that Mrs. Ochsong.</span> <span id="s1077">You are going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1078">You have three guides.</span> <span id="s1079">And you are four people, five people.</span> <span id="s1080">When she heard, she says, "Herr Relles, you promised me that you would help, so how do you leave me, how will you help me and my daughter."</span> <span id="s1081">So I begin to tell and I said, Mrs. Comelli, look, I would like to go with her.</span> <span id="s1082">She said, Relles, no Piorolla, do not put the stick among the wheels, something like that, don't give me a hard time.</span> <span id="s1083">You know everything is organized.</span> <span id="s1084">You have to go.</span> <span id="s1085">And I said, "You are right, but whatever you do for me, am I not obligated to do for other people?</span> <span id="s1086">How is she going with that girl?"</span> <span id="s1087">I can take her on my shoulders.</span> <span id="s1088">So she says, "Yes, you are right.</span> <span id="s1089">Well, I will ask another one, you know, a man who also was caught and escaped, he was from Nizza Savoya [phonetic], I will ask him to go."</span> <span id="s1090">And I stayed other weeks.</span> <span id="s1091">And this is what happened.</span> <span id="s1092">After two or three weeks, she came the old lady, Monte, and in the afternoon, on a Wednesday, she took us from Milan to Como on the embarcadaro [phonetic], which is like for people, you know, on the lake, a big, big barge, holds about 500 people, she took us there, and from there she took us to Como, from Como, a Fascist officer waited for us with a small, a car like, they used to call it a Topolino, which is a mouse, as big as a mouse, and there we were like ferried and he brought us to the frontier, where at the moment, well, we were tired.</span> <span id="s1093">And he brought us, there where people arrived, and there were the custom police.</span> <span id="s1094">They did not say a word to us.</span> <span id="s1095">And with this car, we went, about a half an hour, we arrived to a mountain, you know, to a shack.</span> <span id="s1096">And there was about, I would say about 8:00, 9:00, I don't remember, and we have to wait until midnight.</span> <span id="s1097">Midnight that man would take us through.</span> <span id="s1098">We had three guides, and the passage was so wonderful and marvelous.</span> <span id="s1099">It took us two hours.</span> <span id="s1100">An hour away, we saw English planes coming through Switzerland, and throwing down these lights, so that it was like daytime.</span> <span id="s1101">And next day, we arrived there at 2:00, at the Swiss border, you know, in the Swiss border, the woods, the man showed us, "You see here there is Switzerland," and he left us there.</span> <span id="s1102">We had to write back that the Topolino is very interesting, we want more Topolino, which was, how would you say, a convenience writing, so that the lady would know that we arrived.</span> <span id="s1103">And we arrived in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">ER: And you stayed there until the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">MR: Yes.</span> <span id="s1106">Of course, Switzerland was very nice.</span> <span id="s1107">Very nice.</span> <span id="s1108">But we had, actually I had the experience that omo, omini, lupus [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1109">You know what it means?</span> <span id="s1110">One man is a wolf to the other man.</span> <span id="s1111">Now, people who were saved, we used to give those Swiss people such a hard time.</span> <span id="s1112">They are pigs, the Swiss people.</span> <span id="s1113">They sent so many Jewish people back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">ER: I know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">MR: But, we were saved.</span> <span id="s1116">And then when they saw that Germany lost, they tried their best to please us.</span> <span id="s1117">But this is another chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">ER: Were you aware that the Germans were persecuting the Jews in the camps of Northern Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">MR: Now, we know, they were not persecuted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">ER: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">MR: One day, they were under the Italians.</span> <span id="s1122">As long as they were under the Italians, from December to February, it was no paradise, but they lived, for example, in a house, and they had a kitchen.</span> <span id="s1123">They had a stove, they had common bathrooms.</span> <span id="s1124">It was not like a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1125">They could even go to town and buy something.</span> <span id="s1126">But one day, the Germans, they needed this place for prisoners they would make, for partisans, for underground fighters.</span> <span id="s1127">So they took all those people and deported them to Germany.</span> <span id="s1128">And I received a card from the director of the Jewish Rest Home, my name he knew, but he, had another name too, Pietro Benbak, and he wrote that he thought that they were going to the deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">ER: When did you become aware of what deportation to the East really meant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">MR: After the war.</span> <span id="s1131">Because we never believed it.</span> <span id="s1132">In Switzerland we were in an Arbeitslager [work camp], and men came, a very fine man, and he told the story, not in the camps, how they would make the Aktionen, they called it, they would begin to shoot, shoot, and have to go from one place to another one.</span> <span id="s1133">Pick up the Jews, put them together, and have them, dig the graves, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s1134">We did not believe it.</span> <span id="s1135">We just did not believe it.</span> <span id="s1136">That's all.</span> <span id="s1137">And we had, on Saturday, we would have parties and we would sing the Hava Nagilla, and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">ER: What was your feeling on the Pope's action, or his lack of action, concerning the condemnation of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">MR: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">ER: After 38?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">MR: What I feel now, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">ER: Then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">MR: Then, of course we knew that Hitler did not come to power by revolution.</span> <span id="s1144">He was elected, legally elected by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1145">[Speaker in background.]</span> <span id="s1146">The Pope, what could the Pope have done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">ER: He could have spoken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">MR: Hitler did not, Hitler was not, Hitler persecuted the Catholic Church too.</span> <span id="s1149">How many thousands of Catholic priests died in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">ER: So you don't think he could have done anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">MR: He could only, he could have worsened it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">ER: If he had spoken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">MR: Yes.</span> <span id="s1154">He could have worsened it.</span> <span id="s1155">And, my dear friend, may I call you so, we, the Jews, and the free Jews in England and in America, by making riots against Hitler, by writing against Hitler, didn't do any good to those who were his pawns.</span> <span id="s1156">And if you are not convinced, read Goebbel's Diary, where he says, the Rabbi, the Chief Rabbi in London, made another demonstration against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1157">We will know how to handle it.</span> <span id="s1158">And those actions were always, they called it Vergeltung, which means...</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">ER: Revenge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">MR: And this is what we are doing today in Russia.</span> <span id="s1161">Russia has 2,000,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1162">What makes us believe that the Russians are so humane as not to take advantage and to hurt those Jews who are there.</span> <span id="s1163">What makes you believe that they are humane?</span> <span id="s1164">[unclear] And whenever I hear that Jews go to the embassy and call names, I know it doesn't do any good.</span> <span id="s1165">You might ask, what is there to do?</span> <span id="s1166">What else can we do?</span> <span id="s1167">I cannot find the answer, I am no politician, but this is simply not the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">ER: I just want to ask you a few more questions.</span> <span id="s1169">You were in Switzerland when the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">MR: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">ER: OK.</span> <span id="s1172">And when did you arrive in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">[Voice in background.]</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">MR: November 8.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">ER: 1951.</span> <span id="s1176">And what members of your family survived the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">MR: One niece, she was a genius.</span> <span id="s1178">After the war, she was, I don't know what she was, but she was a genius, I can tell you this.</span> <span id="s1179">She died of a heart attack in 1964.</span> <span id="s1180">In 1964 she died of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1181">She was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">ER: But she's the only other one other than yourself that survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">MR: Yes.</span> <span id="s1184">We were in correspondence.</span> <span id="s1185">Oh, she gave me so much.</span> <span id="s1186">This is another wound in my heart I didn't go to see her.</span> <span id="s1187">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1188">[Voice in background.]</span> <span id="s1189">They left Austria ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">ER: Is there anything else you might like to add before we finish the interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">MR: Well, what can I, you know, all these things, well, we lived in an ocean of evil, but of course, we still hope, and we still see that there people, there are nice people, people who through their own sacrifice would help other people, and that's it.</span> <span id="s1192">In other words, one could not say absolutely evil is growing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">ER: I want to thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">MR: You are so welcome.</span> <span id="s1195">If you
