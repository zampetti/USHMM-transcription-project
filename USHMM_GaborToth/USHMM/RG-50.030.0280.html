<span id="s12">Previous name: Moses Hirshkowitz</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Question: When and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: I was born in ?</span> <span id="s15">Bukovina (Romania) on the 10th of the 4th month, 1921.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Could you be so kind to tell us a few words about the background of your family?</span> <span id="s17">What was the occupation of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I am the third generation born in this city.</span> <span id="s19">My mother was born in that city.</span> <span id="s20">She married my father from a neighboring village.</span> <span id="s21">And my father was a businessman.</span> <span id="s22">He made flour for the bakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Could you tell us something about your school years, about your country atmosphere in which you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: As I was young, we didn't feel too much about anything.</span> <span id="s25">There was a tranquil life, a nice, beautiful life.</span> <span id="s26">Nice community life, togetherness, friendly.</span> <span id="s27">I went to school with non-Jews, Romanians and Germans, and I had friends, Romanian friends.</span> <span id="s28">But then the atmosphere was changed and the Hitler period came on and everything start to change, by law, and also between the population.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Could you elaborate a little bit on this?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I remember I went to school.</span> <span id="s31">First, public school, and then came the law and Jews couldn't study anymore.</span> <span id="s32">My father told me "You cannot go around not studying something.</span> <span id="s33">You have to learn a trade."</span> <span id="s34">And at that time, I went for an apprentice to learn jewelry and watchmaking.</span> <span id="s35">He paid, I remember at that time, 1,000 lei for the apprenticeship.</span> <span id="s36">After a little while, no Jew could learn a trade either because he was Jew.</span> <span id="s37">Why do I know that?</span> <span id="s38">Because all the Jew boys wanted to learn the trade, and we had to hide them in our back room and I and my boss used to teach them little by little the trade.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Could you tell me, please, what happened to you and your family once the war began, once Romania and Germany started to lead their operations against the Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: At that time, there used to be the youth, used to be paramilitary.</span> <span id="s41">Jews were in the army, but as the laws changed, Jews could not be anymore in the army.</span> <span id="s42">And the paramilitary youth was dismissed.</span> <span id="s43">They used to take them to certain odd jobs.</span> <span id="s44">For instance, this region is a very cold region.</span> <span id="s45">Falls a lot of snow.</span> <span id="s46">Meters of snow.</span> <span id="s47">And I remember one episode, they woke us during the night, and they took us to the police station.</span> <span id="s48">And they gathered about 15 Jewish young boys.</span> <span id="s49">They kept them until in the morning.</span> <span id="s50">And that night and the previous day it was snowing, the whole night and day.</span> <span id="s51">They kept us in the morning, and they gave us shovels and we went out of the city to clear out the highway.</span> <span id="s52">But there wasn't -- you couldn't clear.</span> <span id="s53">Here, you clear with a shovel, and the storm brought back the snow in the same day.</span> <span id="s54">And we were there on that road about 10, 12 days.</span> <span id="s55">You can't imagine how cold it was, that guard that watched us, his ear was frozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Which was before the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s58">Not much before.</span> <span id="s59">I figure it was about a year and a half, maybe two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s61">So what happened to you and your family once the military operation started on the border between Romania and Soviet Union?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: During that -- the city is located on a pass, and the soldiers -- the fighter was already at the pass.</span> <span id="s63">Despite there was the Ribbentrop Pact, Germany prepared for war.</span> <span id="s64">Thousands of troops passed by the city day and night next to the border.</span> <span id="s65">Previous to that they improved the highways to the pass.</span> <span id="s66">They came bulldozers and people, German people, and fixed the highways.</span> <span id="s67">And we didn't know what could happen, but we anticipated something drastic will happen.</span> <span id="s68">During that period when the troops came, I remember they used to come, the Italian troops, all the nationality troops passing by.</span> <span id="s69">What happened one time, a group of Italian soldiers came and rested in our city and not far from our home.</span> <span id="s70">We wore at the time already the star, a yellow star.</span> <span id="s71">And they used -- they were young people, they came to the house to the gate to lend certain things to help them out.</span> <span id="s72">Like oil and other things, and we told them "Look, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s73">We are not allowed to talk to you."</span> <span id="s74">And they used to say "What is Jews?"</span> <span id="s75">The Romanian language is a latin language.</span> <span id="s76">It's almost similar to Italian.</span> <span id="s77">We couldn't talk perfectly, but we could we could understand each other.</span> <span id="s78">After a while, the soldiers were ordered to go to the front.</span> <span id="s79">Before they went to the front, they left little letters we shall send to their parents' home.</span> <span id="s80">A lot we knew that in a few days we would also be evacuated from that region to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So what happened to you and your family once it was decided that you will be deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: We didn't know anything, but we knew there was a lot of soldiers, German soldiers, in the city, and they used to take the old people, they took into streets like ghettos.</span> <span id="s83">They couldn't go to the business; they couldn't walk on the streets; they couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s84">They were concentrated in two streets.</span> <span id="s85">The young people, because the Romanian population was in the army and the Jews were not taken, they were put to certain types of work.</span> <span id="s86">Like "pompieri" or fire department, sanitation, medical department.</span> <span id="s87">I happened to be by a doctor in the medical department.</span> <span id="s88">Other people were on the sanitation and fire department.</span> <span id="s89">And there was the group, and we had to stay there a whole day.</span> <span id="s90">They divided our group in three sections in order we should be able to sleep.</span> <span id="s91">And because of that, we got a permit; we could walk on the street.</span> <span id="s92">One day walking from home to that so-called service, a friend of mine from my class, a Romanian who wore an iron cross approached me and said to me, "You know you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s93">You're not allowed to walk on the streets."</span> <span id="s94">I said, "I'm not walking on the street, I'm going to my service."</span> <span id="s95">And he asked me "Who gave you permission?"</span> <span id="s96">I said, "I have here a document that they give me the permission."</span> <span id="s97">He took me to the police station.</span> <span id="s98">In the police station, the police -- he took me to the police chief, and the police chief said, "You go home where you have to go.</span> <span id="s99">I gave him the permission."</span> <span id="s100">And after four weeks, they took us out to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Can you describe this operation?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Who took you, how, by what . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Being at night in that service, he was the city doctor.</span> <span id="s105">His name was Kibbitsch.</span> <span id="s106">He was also a mayor for the city.</span> <span id="s107">He was also a captain in the army, in the Romanian army.</span> <span id="s108">And the war broke out, it wasn't any war between Russian and Germany, he was taken to the army.</span> <span id="s109">He was the first sacrifice which came back.</span> <span id="s110">It was a few days just.</span> <span id="s111">And we overheard saying that something will happen, but we didn't know what will happen.</span> <span id="s112">And this was before Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s113">Before Yom Kippur, they let the old people out from that ghetto.</span> <span id="s114">And everyone went to Shul to Kol Nidrei.</span> <span id="s115">And, believe me, in that Shul was people who never went to Shul in their life.</span> <span id="s116">This was Yom Kippur, and Succoth.</span> <span id="s117">Succoth is a holiday for the tabernacles, and between Succoth on Simkhat Torah also a holiday, there was a reprieve for the holidays for poor people to be able to make existence, because the holidays is eight days altogether.</span> <span id="s118">In that time, there wasn't TVs or very few radios or telephones.</span> <span id="s119">The announcement came to Drôme (ph), a Seargent(?)</span> <span id="s120">came to the center of square or square street or neighborhood in Drôme.</span> <span id="s121">And people gathered and hear them read the decree that in 24 hours, we had to leave.</span> <span id="s122">And we cannot take anything, just what we're able to carry.</span> <span id="s123">What do you carry after three generations?</span> <span id="s124">We had some live animals.</span> <span id="s125">We gave them to some neighbors, non-Jewish neighbors.</span> <span id="s126">I remember my father, may he rest in peace, had some jewelry took to mairia (ph) . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Mayor?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: . . . to the mayor.</span> <span id="s129">The house of the mayor, and mother prepared for the evacuation.</span> <span id="s130">She baked, slaughtered kosher chickens from the backyard, and cooked the chickens and packed them, just the meat.</span> <span id="s131">The soup left there on the stove, and whatever we could carry, and at that time we were just three children because one sister was married and my parents.</span> <span id="s132">And we went to the station, train station.</span> <span id="s133">Once we arrived at the train station, we saw that other people took a lot of luggage, burlap sacks with pillows and blankets.</span> <span id="s134">I had a brother which was younger than I was, and he said to me "You know something?</span> <span id="s135">Let's go home and try to bring whatever we can carry again."</span> <span id="s136">And we went home and in the yard, he had a little wagon, and we loaded up what we could load on that little wagon and locked the door.</span> <span id="s137">As we locked the door, soldiers patrolled the streets.</span> <span id="s138">They addressed us "Lock the door, lock it good" with a grin on their faces.</span> <span id="s139">And we left for the train station, and then we left there the carriage, the little wagon and came on the train.</span> <span id="s140">Many cars, cattle cars, most of them.</span> <span id="s141">I don't know how many, but long.</span> <span id="s142">And every family kept together, and we went into a cattle car.</span> <span id="s143">It was about 53 people, children, old people, with their luggage with the belongings what everyone had.</span> <span id="s144">Then they locked from outside the door, and the train start to move.</span> <span id="s145">Start to move -- this was, I think it was in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s146">And we traveled like that a night, a day, and we stopped in Czernowitz, I know we stopped in Czernowitz.</span> <span id="s147">It was dark, and then the train started again, and nobody knew where we are going.</span> <span id="s148">People asked for water, and the soldiers sold water for a watch, for money, for a chain.</span> <span id="s149">And we came to a city called Attaki or Potek, and they told us we shall jump the cars.</span> <span id="s150">There was the embankment from the car to the ground, was maybe six feet.</span> <span id="s151">And in that time, in that period, there is a lot of raining in that region, and the ground was so wet and so muddy.</span> <span id="s152">But if you pushed then out a foot, the shoe remained there.</span> <span id="s153">Whoever had a little money, it was also little buggies, horse and buggies.</span> <span id="s154">Families gathered together and put on the buggies their belongings and paid that peasant whatever he asked.</span> <span id="s155">For me money at that time, did mean nothing.</span> <span id="s156">I didn't know anything what money is.</span> <span id="s157">And we traveled from embarkment to the Dnestr.</span> <span id="s158">This is Pataki.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Yes, this was a crossing point?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: This was the crossing.</span> <span id="s161">And in that time, I remember the second day there was Simkhas Torah in Jewish tradition, it is a holiday, but it's also say prayer for the dead.</span> <span id="s162">And there was a man in our cattle car who tried to make it as possible, tolerable.</span> <span id="s163">And he used to come in and try to sing, but who had the mind to sing?</span> <span id="s164">Everyone was in hysterics in that car.</span> <span id="s165">And in the car, a little baby infant died, but everyone was so -- his thoughts and their thoughts that nobody took actually care for each other.</span> <span id="s166">But there was -- nobody knew where we went, where we go, how long we will be there.</span> <span id="s167">And once we came there, I remember a friend of mine, they had a lot of cheese.</span> <span id="s168">Cheeses, their business was cheese and smoked herring fish, and the easiest thing what they thought was to take cheese and honey, 25 barrels, kilograms of honey, unless they came there they saw that it is not possible to carry that.</span> <span id="s169">And they asked whoever wants honey or cheese, to come to take it.</span> <span id="s170">And people came to take as much they could.</span> <span id="s171">We stayed there a few days, and then the bridges over the Dnestr was destroyed, but the Germans built a railroad bridge over the Dnestr.</span> <span id="s172">The Russian railroad is a little bit wider than the German -- the European railroads.</span> <span id="s173">Now, they had to make it smaller in order to fit the rails to Romanian railroads.</span> <span id="s174">But we were -- there was a pontoon like a bridge, and they put on that pontoon about 100 people, and they were pulled over on the other side to the Dnestr.</span> <span id="s175">And the other side of the Dnestr was a big city; in Russian, it's called Mogilev Podolskiy.</span> <span id="s176">And there on the -- not far from that river, there was a big house.</span> <span id="s177">I imagine during the Russian time, there was something, a gathering, a big, big building, and there they dumped us.</span> <span id="s178">Then there was just unbearable, unbearable; people lost control of everything.</span> <span id="s179">Wherever they had to do human things, they took -- they did it in front of each other.</span> <span id="s180">Because we met other people there from Bessarabia, it was about two months earlier.</span> <span id="s181">And they were hungry.</span> <span id="s182">Starving, not hungry.</span> <span id="s183">I remember my father, he should rest in peace, went out to the temple.</span> <span id="s184">There was a temple not far, and he saw the people in that backyard of the temple hungry, starving.</span> <span id="s185">He went outside and he bought a cereal.</span> <span id="s186">Let's see, I don't know, I don't see it here, but it's called hirsich (ph), a little cereal and he cooked it on an open fire and gave that to the people to eat.</span> <span id="s187">But during that time, our family was together.</span> <span id="s188">This means my mother, brother -- two brothers, and all the family lived in one room, and they used to come -- the soldiers used to come, break in the doors, take all the people and send them further to other camps.</span> <span id="s189">And in the meanwhile, the winter was very severe winter.</span> <span id="s190">Strong winter, cold.</span> <span id="s191">During that short period, four people of our family died.</span> <span id="s192">An aunt, an uncle and two cousins of my aunt.</span> <span id="s193">And I remember we caught -- they were the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s194">There were some young people to take care, to bury them, because whoever didn't have somebody to take care was thrown on a carriage and sent to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s195">And coming up on the cemetery, my uncle -- we thought that a Rabbi of ours who taught children, young children, kindergarten children, he died before, and everyone knew that he was dead.</span> <span id="s196">We came up on that cemetery, looked around cadavers, thousands of them, thousands.</span> <span id="s197">We found that Rabbi there, and we buried the uncle, and we buried that teacher, that Rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What happened next?</span> <span id="s199">How long did you stay in Mogilev?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: In Mogilev, every day was worse, got worse.</span> <span id="s201">My father and mother lost all their energy, all everything left them.</span> <span id="s202">They were like children.</span> <span id="s203">I had a sister, the same thing.</span> <span id="s204">The only thing what I decided was my brother and I, we decided that we have to leave Mogilev.</span> <span id="s205">During that period we were caught by the soldiers and brought again to that building.</span> <span id="s206">And we bribed the soldier, gave them a watch.</span> <span id="s207">And during the night, he said, "Look, I will be till 12 o'clock here.</span> <span id="s208">Then comes another soldier.</span> <span id="s209">During that period you have to leave that building.</span> <span id="s210">After what happened, I will not be responsible."</span> <span id="s211">And we left the building, and the second day I talked to my parents.</span> <span id="s212">"We have to leave."</span> <span id="s213">And it happened that a German truck and soldiers went to that direction, Mogilev.</span> <span id="s214">Now, where -- we didn't know where this is, but they told us there is another camp, and it's little bit tolerable.</span> <span id="s215">And we paid them, took my parents and their little belongings and the soldiers took us to the crossroad of that city.</span> <span id="s216">It's called Jewe(?)</span> <span id="s217">.</span> <span id="s218">It was a very bitter storm, snow, and they let us out at the crossroad in Jewe(?)</span> <span id="s219">.</span> <span id="s220">As we stood there, strangers, we saw approaching a lady, and she sees my mother and they knew each other.</span> <span id="s221">They were school children in the same class in our city.</span> <span id="s222">They start to cry and lament what happened to our history, and she said, "Look," -- my mother's name was Sarah -- "Sarah, look, I don't have anything, but we live here in this building with others.</span> <span id="s223">We have seven people together in one room.</span> <span id="s224">If you want to come to our room to be with us, you're welcome."</span> <span id="s225">We were five.</span> <span id="s226">We came in in that room, there was two windows, no glass panels.</span> <span id="s227">It was boarded up with wood boards.</span> <span id="s228">Between one board to the other board, you could put in a fist.</span> <span id="s229">And naturally, the first night we said it's Slat(?)</span> <span id="s230">City.</span> <span id="s231">The second day, my father said, "This is not the way.</span> <span id="s232">We have to make certain that . . ." He went outside in the snow and their snow is not like here.</span> <span id="s233">There's meters of snow.</span> <span id="s234">He gathered together straw, dry straw, and he made from that a bed.</span> <span id="s235">And with whatever we had, we covered ourselves.</span> <span id="s236">Cold, you had one blanket.</span> <span id="s237">The coats, we covered, and this is the way we slept.</span> <span id="s238">After a while, I got very sick and I don't remember too much of it.</span> <span id="s239">I was sick from that period till late in spring.</span> <span id="s240">And there wasn't any medication; there wasn't -- I had a friend of mine, he was a lawyer's son.</span> <span id="s241">He wanted to become a doctor, but because of the laws, he couldn't study.</span> <span id="s242">But he had a friend, a doctor.</span> <span id="s243">This he tells me already, my mother after the fact, she met him once, and she told him what happened to me.</span> <span id="s244">He said, "Mrs. Hirshkowitz, I have a friend, a doctor.</span> <span id="s245">He will visit you.</span> <span id="s246">If he can help you, he will try to help you."</span> <span id="s247">He came to us, and no medication, no injections, no pills.</span> <span id="s248">He said, "Do you have coffee beans?</span> <span id="s249">Cocoa?"</span> <span id="s250">It happened my mother said, "Yes, I have a package of coffee beans and a little bit cocoa."</span> <span id="s251">He said, "Let's try that and God will have to help.</span> <span id="s252">Cook the coffee beans as strong you can make it, and try to give him to drink.</span> <span id="s253">This will maybe invigorate his heart."</span> <span id="s254">When I go t up in the spring, I couldn't walk, and -- but I was alive.</span> <span id="s255">It came an order that Jews from that Jewe(?)</span> <span id="s256">had to be gathered in a smaller place, confined.</span> <span id="s257">There was like a river, and where we lived now there was a factory, a sugar factory.</span> <span id="s258">When the Russians retreated, they destroyed the sugar factory and the buildings where the workers used to live.</span> <span id="s259">And that buildings, the remainder of that buildings, we lived.</span> <span id="s260">And when it came the order that we shall leave that building and go in the real city, we didn't have where to go, but we had to go.</span> <span id="s261">Finally, we found there, we were 18 people in our room.</span> <span id="s262">All slept on the ground, on the floor.</span> <span id="s263">Women, young people, men, so on.</span> <span id="s264">My brother, they took working people -- young people for work.</span> <span id="s265">I wasn't -- I couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s266">They took my brother; he was younger, two years younger than I was.</span> <span id="s267">And they took him to work, and they released him.</span> <span id="s268">After they released, they made action, you know.</span> <span id="s269">An action, a gathering for work.</span> <span id="s270">They needed so many, so many people to work, and they took my brother, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Who took your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: The soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: What kind of soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: It was Romanian and Germans.</span> <span id="s275">Mostly Romanian because the gendarmery there was Romanian.</span> <span id="s276">There was a section there, gendarmery, but they were Romanian.</span> <span id="s277">They took my brother and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s278">He was there about two years.</span> <span id="s279">They built a bridge 1,100 meters.</span> <span id="s280">I don't remember the name, the Barovka (ph), I don't remember the name of the region, but it was not far from Odessa somewhere.</span> <span id="s281">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s282">But when the Russians advanced and the Germans retreated, they took the few little Romanian Jews, because a lot had died, there to Jassy.</span> <span id="s283">Jassy was a Romanian city, a big city, beautiful city.</span> <span id="s284">And he was with a friend, a neighborhood child which was older than my brother.</span> <span id="s285">And he said to my brother "Look, we are so near to our city, I long to be in the city.</span> <span id="s286">I like to be home."</span> <span id="s287">And my brother and that friend went to that city.</span> <span id="s288">They didn't know that it did not exist a Jewish soul in that city.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Which was the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: _________, where he was born.</span> <span id="s291">And my brother went to a peasant which lived a little bit above our home, and the men of the peasants were in the war.</span> <span id="s292">And the woman needed help; she hired my brother.</span> <span id="s293">Under what condition, I don't know.</span> <span id="s294">But I know that the other friend of his was on the other side of the city on an order pass.</span> <span id="s295">And it was Easter, and that lady, the peasant woman, gave my brother two socks -- two pair of socks.</span> <span id="s296">And my brother said, "And, look, I have two pair.</span> <span id="s297">My friend doesn't have any.</span> <span id="s298">Let me go and give him one pair."</span> <span id="s299">And she said, "Don't go through the city.</span> <span id="s300">There's a lot of Germans there."</span> <span id="s301">He said, "No, I will go through the woods and I will reach there."</span> <span id="s302">And he went, but once he reached his home, his friend's home, he was denounced and -- and his friend said -- my brother said, "Look, I was born here.</span> <span id="s303">I went to school.</span> <span id="s304">I lived here.</span> <span id="s305">My whole family, grandparents lived here.</span> <span id="s306">My parents lived here.</span> <span id="s307">Ask the police -- chief of the police and you will see, because, the chief of police, lived -- was a neighbor of ours.</span> <span id="s308">They took him to the station, and the chief of the police said to him "I don't know him.</span> <span id="s309">I never met him.</span> <span id="s310">I don't know that boy."</span> <span id="s311">And they took him back to that peasant and all three dug a grave, and they were all shot in the back and filled in the grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Including the peasant?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Including the peasant.</span> <span id="s314">The peasant was a little bit(?)</span> <span id="s315">, I heard, but I didn't know him before the war.</span> <span id="s316">He was communist, the peasant.</span> <span id="s317">This is what I found out afterwards.</span> <span id="s318">In the meanwhile, we were in Jewe(?)</span> <span id="s319">.</span> <span id="s320">In 1944, Passover, the German troops start to retreat, and they make a battle line in our camp.</span> <span id="s321">And because we knew German, they used to say this is the first time they talk to somebody in German.</span> <span id="s322">And we used to ask them why are you taking strangers.</span> <span id="s323">They said, "We try to hold off the Russians."</span> <span id="s324">But in the morning, they retreated and the second and third evening, they were prisoners, taken prisoners.</span> <span id="s325">But in the meanwhile, the battle was still raging in Jassy and Romania, and a group of Jews from camp, once it was cleared the region, went in to their homes.</span> <span id="s326">Like Siret, Rogoznica, _________.</span> <span id="s327">Well, because we were under Russian occupation already, the Russian didn't give us permission, and we went from Jewe(?)</span> <span id="s328">to Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s329">There we were approximate a few weeks before Purim came up.</span> <span id="s330">There was a law at that time, which Churchill made it, that every foreigner in the Russian territory has to be left to go home.</span> <span id="s331">And we were included.</span> <span id="s332">And they gave us a train, and we were two kilometer from Belcy(?)</span> <span id="s333">, and from Belcy(?)</span> <span id="s334">, we came towards Jassy.</span> <span id="s335">Let me . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Let's go back, with your permission, for one second, back to Jewe.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Jewe?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yeah, Jewe.</span> <span id="s339">I would like you to tell us how was your daily life there.</span> <span id="s340">What was your routine?</span> <span id="s341">What was happening every day to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: The routine was that if I will describe you misery, there was no such a thing.</span> <span id="s343">You cannot describe.</span> <span id="s344">People were starving for hunger.</span> <span id="s345">People -- we didn't see meat for four and a half years.</span> <span id="s346">We didn't see bread for four and a half years.</span> <span id="s347">We ate pea flour baked.</span> <span id="s348">We used to eat frozen sugar beets, and this was a luxury.</span> <span id="s349">Because there was a region of sugar, and the Germans used to transport the sugar beets inland.</span> <span id="s350">And the beets that fell off the wagons or the trucks, this was our nourishment.</span> <span id="s351">A part of our nourishment.</span> <span id="s352">But most of them, I'm ashamed to say, the infestation of lice was so horrible, I had it -- everyone had it.</span> <span id="s353">If he was a lawyer or a doctor or whatever.</span> <span id="s354">People were starving, dying.</span> <span id="s355">I remember children two, three years old, children were independent, grown up.</span> <span id="s356">They grew up by themselves, no supervision, nothing.</span> <span id="s357">In spite of that, there was a little shimmer of hope that maybe -- the hope was in the past.</span> <span id="s358">How beautiful it was in the home, how nice it was the family, how nice it was in the city, how nice was -- this was.</span> <span id="s359">If we talked about it, this was a certain thing of hope.</span> <span id="s360">But people died.</span> <span id="s361">I had a friend, a lawyer, and I remember I talked to him.</span> <span id="s362">He used to live on the hill above the cemetery, he used to look over some of the cemetery.</span> <span id="s363">And I said to him "Doctor, what are you looking?"</span> <span id="s364">And he said, "I'm looking that this will remain my home."</span> <span id="s365">And I was a young man, and he was at that time, he had already three children.</span> <span id="s366">The children were my age.</span> <span id="s367">He said -- I said to him "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s368">He said, "This is my last stop."</span> <span id="s369">And a few weeks later, he passed away.</span> <span id="s370">This was -- the misery was so great that you cannot describe it.</span> <span id="s371">You cannot describe it.</span> <span id="s372">I don't -- I didn't tell my children for years.</span> <span id="s373">They grew up and they didn't know what lays in my heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Can you describe any encounters that you had in Jewe with local authorities, with gendarmery, the army, with soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: We were -- yes, we were -- I have a good experience.</span> <span id="s376">I was a jeweler.</span> <span id="s377">And naturally when you learn jewelry, you try to buy some tools.</span> <span id="s378">I didn't take anything worthwhile from my home, but I took the tools.</span> <span id="s379">Little tools, hand tools.</span> <span id="s380">And my parents sold almost everything from them, but they didn't touch the tools.</span> <span id="s381">And my -- I had my clothing and they didn't touch my clothing during the period I was sick.</span> <span id="s382">And when I got well, we had to do some -- we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s383">We had to do something to survive, and I tried to fix something.</span> <span id="s384">A watch, to make a soldering; very primitive, but I did it.</span> <span id="s385">And with that, not for money, but for exchange and food.</span> <span id="s386">I remember I made once a pair of earrings from brass, and we exchanged it for a little pea flour in order to survive.</span> <span id="s387">There was a captain that -- a German captain.</span> <span id="s388">He was what do you call it?</span> <span id="s389">A messenger from Nimerov(?)</span> <span id="s390">to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s391">And after the Germans retreated, they killed the Jewish population in Russia, and he saved a few Jews.</span> <span id="s392">I remember a Jewish family and a girl.</span> <span id="s393">And brought them, that people in our camp, and he supported them.</span> <span id="s394">Every month he used to go to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s395">Coming back, he brought provisions for them.</span> <span id="s396">And after a while, he didn't come anymore.</span> <span id="s397">Then we found out that they send him to Berlin.</span> <span id="s398">This is one incident.</span> <span id="s399">The other incident, I remember a gendarme found out that I am a jeweler.</span> <span id="s400">They came to me and asked me if I can make him a cross.</span> <span id="s401">I made him a cross_, and for that he gave me a half a loaf of bread and a little bit salt.</span> <span id="s402">And the other incident I remember, a truck with German soldiers stopped in front where we were living, and you can't imagine the panic what was.</span> <span id="s403">And they came in and a young soldier said, "Somebody told me you're a jeweler.</span> <span id="s404">You can solder."</span> <span id="s405">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s406">And he takes out a pair of glasses.</span> <span id="s407">They had metal glasses, metal frames.</span> <span id="s408">They were broken.</span> <span id="s409">He said, "Please, fix me the glasses."</span> <span id="s410">And I fixed them and he gave me a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s411">This was the experience what I had, the good experience.</span> <span id="s412">From the bad experience, we are not talking.</span> <span id="s413">It is too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: I understand it's too much, but if you -- it's not too painful for you to tell us a few, we would be very grateful.</span> <span id="s415">If it's too difficult, we can skip them.</span> <span id="s416">Whatever you will decide.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: There was an incident when we were ferried over the Dnestr.</span> <span id="s418">A family -- nobody knew really what happened and what will happen, and a father was very protective of the children.</span> <span id="s419">A soldier butt them with the butt from the gun and that -- and killed them.</span> <span id="s420">This is incident which is not pleasant to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I understand.</span> <span id="s422">So we can go back Belcy.</span> <span id="s423">We left, we interrupted your stories a moment when you were in Belcy on your way back to ?</span> <span id="s424">-------.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: In Belcy, I met a friend from my home town, and this was in Russian control.</span> <span id="s426">And he was a watchmaker, so naturally when you meet a person who returns from dead, it was a jubilant.</span> <span id="s427">He was really happy, and he said, "Look, can I help you?"</span> <span id="s428">I said, "What can you help me?"</span> <span id="s429">At that time, he worked in a kolkhoz as watchmaker.</span> <span id="s430">He had -- they gave him a little store in the center of Belcy.</span> <span id="s431">And he worked there for that, probably he got brass which was really scarce in that time.</span> <span id="s432">And he gave them the profit what he had and he took a certain percentage.</span> <span id="s433">He said, "If you want to come to my store, come to my store.</span> <span id="s434">And maybe you will make us a little living."</span> <span id="s435">At that time, you didn't measure money a living.</span> <span id="s436">A living was a piece of bread, a little milk, a piece of cheese.</span> <span id="s437">That was the living.</span> <span id="s438">I remember there came Russian soldiers and they said, "You have good grades.</span> <span id="s439">Come to us to Russia and you will see you will be very happy.</span> <span id="s440">Where are you going now?"</span> <span id="s441">I say, "We are going home."</span> <span id="s442">We tried to go home, and there is still battles.</span> <span id="s443">And they said, "Come, come to us.</span> <span id="s444">You will see how happy you will be."</span> <span id="s445">This was incident.</span> <span id="s446">And then came the order we should leave, and we left.</span> <span id="s447">We came home.</span> <span id="s448">We came through Jassy.</span> <span id="s449">In Jassy we were -- there was a college, used to be.</span> <span id="s450">I don't know if it is now, but it was bombed out during the war, but there they put us up(?)</span> <span id="s451">from the Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s452">And we were there about a little while, I don't remember exactly the time.</span> <span id="s453">In that city, I knew there was a friend of mine, also, a watchmaker with his family there.</span> <span id="s454">He had a brother there, and because the brother was married, he came -- after the apprenticeship, he came to his brother.</span> <span id="s455">And his brother gave him existence.</span> <span id="s456">But, as you know, what happened in Jassy, the Progrom and the brother was killed there in that period.</span> <span id="s457">And after the war, he had a business in the center of Jassy, and I found out where it is and I came there.</span> <span id="s458">And naturally, he invited me home for lunch.</span> <span id="s459">There, it's dinner.</span> <span id="s460">Lunch is the biggest meal there in Europe, and he said, "Look, we have a little tools.</span> <span id="s461">Come to my store, and whatever I will be able to give you to work, you'll have some work."</span> <span id="s462">And it was so -- we were there a very short time.</span> <span id="s463">And then we went home by train to ________.</span> <span id="s464">Came to _________, we didn't know yet my brother was dead.</span> <span id="s465">We had still hope that he's still alive somewhere.</span> <span id="s466">It was two weeks before Purim we came home.</span> <span id="s467">And the first news was that he was dead.</span> <span id="s468">And previous -- a few months previous, came a small group of young Jewish people and also the family of my brother's friend, who were killed together.</span> <span id="s469">They dug them out from where they were, and they buried them both in the Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s470">And naturally, when they left -- my parents left ________, they put a stone there.</span> <span id="s471">And I know I hope to go visit him, to visit the grave of my brother.</span> <span id="s472">And meanwhile, friends from Israel went to visit the cemetery, and they told me that the grave was desecrated, the stone.</span> <span id="s473">Did I want to fix it?</span> <span id="s474">And I naturally I said yes, and I send the money, and they fix -- they send me pictures how the stone looks.</span> <span id="s475">After they fix it, they send me a picture how they fixed the stone.</span> <span id="s476">But it's repeated again, and they found out that that brother has relatives, a brother in America.</span> <span id="s477">And if they will break the stone, somebody will fix it.</span> <span id="s478">And they made a -- want to make a business.</span> <span id="s479">And people gave me advice I shouldn't fix it anymore this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How long did you stay in __________?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: I came back -- Purim is approximate early in spring, and the war was still raging in Berlin.</span> <span id="s484">And in May -- I think on the 5th of May was cease fire, and I stayed there till '47.</span> <span id="s485">During that period, I tried -- our home was destroyed from the -- our home was destroyed from the projectiles from the battles.</span> <span id="s486">We had a home, five rooms, a veranda.</span> <span id="s487">Everything was ripped out, doors, windows, everything was shattered.</span> <span id="s488">But once we came back, my father and I fixed two rooms, and the varanda where an other be able to sleep.</span> <span id="s489">We didn't have any furniture, nothing.</span> <span id="s490">A neighbor of ours, non-Jew, gave us some furniture, a bed, and other things.</span> <span id="s491">And we fixed up as much we could, and I tried to work my trade in order to survive.</span> <span id="s492">Walking in the city, I met that same non-Jew who went with me to school, who took me to the police station.</span> <span id="s493">He was very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s494">"Do you remember me?"</span> <span id="s495">"Yes."</span> <span id="s496">"Do you know who I am?"</span> <span id="s497">"Yes."</span> <span id="s498">And I asked him "Do you know what you did to me?"</span> <span id="s499">"Yes."</span> <span id="s500">He got very red in the face, and I let it go.</span> <span id="s501">And I went home and said to my father "Father, this is not a future for us, for young people.</span> <span id="s502">I like to go away from here."</span> <span id="s503">And he said to me "You are young.</span> <span id="s504">You can go, but I am an old man.</span> <span id="s505">And I didn't sleep on a bed for almost four and a half years, and I have now a bed I like to sleep on."</span> <span id="s506">And a few friends of mine and a cousin make up our mind to leave the city, to leave the country.</span> <span id="s507">And we went from there to Arad(?)</span> <span id="s508">, to Brakho(?)</span> <span id="s509">Tel Kotchek (ph) and meanwhile I had a friend who was in Bucharest and he went to Vienna.</span> <span id="s510">He was a mechanic, dentist mechanic.</span> <span id="s511">He went to Vienna and I got letter from him that he's in Vienna.</span> <span id="s512">And once I said goodbye to my parents, my father, my mother; I will never forget the train passed by in the center of the city and when we looked from our home a little bit further, we could see the train passing.</span> <span id="s513">I will never forget my mother said to me "When you pass the train that particular place, please wave goodbye to me.</span> <span id="s514">I will stay there."</span> <span id="s515">And I saw her standing there.</span> <span id="s516">And I'll never forget that picture.</span> <span id="s517">And from there we went to Arad.</span> <span id="s518">In Arad, we had a guide, a Hungarian man, and we paid him some money, but it's not the money.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: That goodness of that person I will never forget.</span> <span id="s520">He took us to the border, and took us to his town.</span> <span id="s521">It was a little village, and when we came from no man's land between Romania and Hungary.</span> <span id="s522">He knew so good the destination that coming to pick us up, he left little signs, and going back he picked them up.</span> <span id="s523">There he took us to his home, divide us in two groups.</span> <span id="s524">And we asked him "Why do you divide us?"</span> <span id="s525">And he said, "If somebody will be caught, at least the other group will be able to be saved."</span> <span id="s526">He kept us during the night.</span> <span id="s527">He gave us food, and he said, "You cannot go out from the house.</span> <span id="s528">Everything you have to do, you do it in the house, in the room."</span> <span id="s529">The following day -- he had a daughter.</span> <span id="s530">Nice, nice family.</span> <span id="s531">And they baked and cooked and we asked "For whom do you bake?"</span> <span id="s532">He said, "We have to buy tickets for that, for you people.</span> <span id="s533">In order to get it easier, we have to bake in order to get tickets."</span> <span id="s534">And finally, she came back with the tickets, and a woman with a baby and the luggage went in a carriage -- horse and carriage -- and we walked towards the station, train station.</span> <span id="s535">There was an electric train (station?)</span> <span id="s536">going towards Budapest, and he said, "Look, you don't know the language.</span> <span id="s537">Keep all together.</span> <span id="s538">Stay in the trenches till the train comes.</span> <span id="s539">Once the train arrives, go on the train in the last car, and keep together, and I will take care of the rest.</span> <span id="s540">If somebody will approach you to talk, I will come to help you out.</span> <span id="s541">I will hold the tickets."</span> <span id="s542">And he took us, he was fantastic, that man.</span> <span id="s543">The bridges were broken, destroyed from the war.</span> <span id="s544">He took us to a point, where it is I don't know.</span> <span id="s545">From there we had to take a bus, and he took us to Budapest to the Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s546">Coming to Budapest, he said goodbye, and then we found that second time(?)</span> <span id="s547">, he was
