terrible.</span> <span id="s430">Almost water.</span> <span id="s431">Almost water.</span> <span id="s432">Only what was, maybe for drink was the coffee what you get in the morning -- and the bread.</span> <span id="s433">The bread was sour.</span> <span id="s434">And this was heavy work.</span> <span id="s435">This was a terrible, terrible camp.</span> <span id="s436">This was the worse camp in Romania, the Doaga.</span> <span id="s437">Was famous.</span> <span id="s438">Famous.</span> <span id="s439">In all Romania, was this famous camp.</span> <span id="s440">And we were very, we very close to the -- it was in the summertime, okay?</span> <span id="s441">In July, August, In 23 August 1944, the Romanian changed their mind, okay?</span> <span id="s442">They don't want to be, changed everything, okay?</span> <span id="s443">They don't want to fight near the Germans.</span> <span id="s444">They changed, they turn everything over and they told they want to, to start -- not to start.</span> <span id="s445">The war, to continue the war against the Germans.</span> <span id="s446">And they start to be allied to the Russian.</span> <span id="s447">And we were in Doaga when the Russian approaching, approaching, and approaching.</span> <span id="s448">We heard the guns.</span> <span id="s449">We heard all the time, "Boom!</span> <span id="s450">Boom!</span> <span id="s451">Boom!</span> <span id="s452">Boom!"</span> <span id="s453">This approaching.</span> <span id="s454">We are happy this; maybe one day we'll be,one day we'll be liberated.</span> <span id="s455">Because we heard very close.</span> <span id="s456">Every day was closer and closer the, the noise from the tanks and the guns and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">And we saw how the Russian Army push back the Germans.</span> <span id="s458">Push back the Germans.</span> <span id="s459">And we were so happy.</span> <span id="s460">You can't believe, it was so happy.</span> <span id="s461">We saw with our eyes how the Russian tanks come, and go over the German tanks and over the German soldiers, and over the Germans everybody.</span> <span id="s462">They killed them.</span> <span id="s463">And near our fence was the Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s464">This was Russian prisoners, was -- were captured from the Germans.</span> <span id="s465">And sure this was first what liberated by the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s466">And we were liberated.</span> <span id="s467">I mean, Romania was liberated in 23 August 1944.</span> <span id="s468">And they not let to go from the camp.</span> <span id="s469">Was already 24, 25 August.</span> <span id="s470">We stay in the camp.</span> <span id="s471">We don't do nothing.</span> <span id="s472">We cannot go anymore to work.</span> <span id="s473">Nothing.</span> <span id="s474">And they not let go to home,go home.</span> <span id="s475">And because I was working as a professional electrician, I have

Jewish old families.</span> <span id="s497">And they -- we asking where we find this Jewish family there, and they told, "Here, they're there."</span> <span id="s498">And they take care about us.</span> <span id="s499">They take over us, and they give us food and clothe us and everything.</span> <span id="s500">And we stayed there about two, three days in Focsani.</span> <span id="s501">And the Russian Army entered already in Romania, was entering already in Focsani.</span> <span id="s502">And they stopped there all the time, they stop with trucks.</span> <span id="s503">Everything was stopping there.</span> <span id="s504">And we don't know any Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Absolutely not.</span> <span id="s506">And we go to the Russian

my father to go, maybe that it is the protection.</span> <span id="s615">If my father is in Israel, perhaps I will get faster then the passport because my father is there.</span> <span id="s616">Or to not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Maybe I will get the passport, and he will not get the passport.</span> <span id="s618">What will happen now?</span> <span id="s619">And my father was a very, very smart man, and he was a very good Zionist.</span> <span id="s620">He decided he want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s621">He decided that he want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s622">I told

Romanians had liberated your town.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Okay, when after was liberated, I come home in September.</span> <span id="s683">After I arrive home in September in my hometown, in Arad, in one night the Hungarian Army enter in Arad.</span> <span id="s684">And they stay about one weeks in our hometown -- I mean, in Arad.</span> <span id="s685">And they start to do, start to finished, maybe, in the fortress a gas chamber for the local Jewish people.</span> <span id="s686">Then from Arad Jewish people, we are 30,000 people in Arad.</span> <span id="s687">And we heard this from some Christian people, that they're doing this.</span> <span id="s688">This was not confirmed by nobody, okay?</span> <span id="s689">Because nobody see this, because nobody can enter in the fortress.</span> <span id="s690">And we know, and all the Jewish people know that; we are very, very afraid and scary that will take us in this gas chamber and exterminate us.</span> <span id="s691">Because it's not take too long time to exterminate the people; it go very fast.</span> <span id="s692">And I heard this, and I told to my parents, "I escape for four years from the camp, and then I home.</span> <span id="s693">I don't want in the last days," because the Russian was approaching very close to our hometown.</span> <span id="s694">Very close.</span> <span id="s695">They was

going to some Christian people that knowed us, was very good friend for me.</span> <span id="s705">And I can hide from there, I can stay that it's happen something.</span> <span id="s706">Until the Russian Army will enter maybe, and occupy this territory.</span> <span id="s707">And I was going, going, going in my way until the river, okay?</span> <span id="s708">I was meet there Hungarian soldiers.</span> <span id="s709">They put cable down near the river, because they want to, to blast the bridges between the city and between the fortress.</span> <span id="s710">Was one railway bridge, and two regular bridge for the cars and people, okay?</span> <span id="s711">Passed there.</span> <span id="s712">And I asked this Hungarian soldier, "What you are doing?"</span> <span id="s713">And he told me, "We put now down this cable to blow up the bridges."</span> <span id="s714">He not ask me that I am a Jew, or "What you are doing?"</span> <span id="s715">Nothing.</span> <span id="s716">This was my luck.</span> <span id="s717">I was scary, and I was trembling maybe they ask me something.</span> <span id="s718">They not ask me anything, because that already, they told me they are very busy because the Russian Army is very close.</span> <span id="s719">Very close to Arad.</span> <span id="s720">And I am asking, "Where is the Russian Army now?"</span> <span id="s721">You know?</span> <span id="s722">"Because you tell that you are very busy, and rush, rush, rush."</span> <span id="s723">And he saw me on his hand, his hand, that "We are -- around the city
