id="s12">02:09:58</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Question: Aron, can you tell me your full name, and when and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: My name was Aron Dereczynski and now we change to Aron Derman D-E-R-M-A-N.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Slonim, Poland.</span> <span id="s16">That's a small town in White Russia, part of Poland in White Russia, not far from the Russian border.</span> <span id="s17">I was born in 1922, and since I spent there almost until, till the War.</span> <span id="s18">Now, my family was a middle class family.</span> <span id="s19">My parents had a business.</span> <span id="s20">The business was a clothing store, and I had three sisters: An oldest sister of mine was the name Libby, Libby.</span> <span id="s21">Then I came, Aron, and after me was a younger sister, Fagel, and then a younger sister after by the name Edcia.</span> <span id="s22">Fagel was born three years after me in 1924, and Edcia was born in 1932.</span> <span id="s23">Life was pretty normal for us.</span> <span id="s24">The city was not a large town.</span> <span id="s25">It was approximately about 12,000 and out of the 12,000 we had almost 10,000 Jews, so the majority were Jewish.</span> <span id="s26">The city was rich with all different kinds of Jewish institutions.</span> <span id="s27">We had quite a few, I could count eight or 10 different kind of synagogues, little synagogues, and it was a learning center for – we had famous rabbis, famous yeshiva, and the town was, for me, it was a very happy town, a very happy place to live because the majority were Jews and Antisemitism was quite prominent in Poland.</span> <span id="s28">And, so we did not feel that much because the city was the majority of Jews and the neighborhood where we lived was Jewish, so we had hardly any problems until in the later years when it came to the 30s when Hitler got into power and the Nazis started getting into power.</span> <span id="s29">Antisemitism spread much more in Poland, and then we started feeling from Antisemitism even being the majority of Jews.</span> <span id="s30">We still start feeling Antisemitism in two different channels.</span> <span id="s31">For example, we had a river in our city, and the river near that to enlarge it so they brought in the – brought in the Polish workers from the different cities, from Poznan, and Poznan was known as a city of lots of Antisemitism.</span> <span id="s32">So, approximately at that time, they brought in maybe about 500 to 700 Polish workers.</span> <span id="s33">And then on a weekend when they used to get drunk and come in and do quite a bit of damage, the Antisemitic – all different kinds of Antisemitic acts.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">02:14:49 So, we used to feel partially already Antisemitism and then through other channels.</span> <span id="s35">The church used to order some old men to preach on Sunday, all different kind of acts against the Jews, that they were taking over the business, because it was mostly – the business was in Jewish hands and for many reasons, because the majority 90 percent were Jews.</span> <span id="s36">So, even in my town you could find a lawyer, the doctor, the engineer, but at the same time the carpenter, the shoemaker, and any type of work.</span> <span id="s37">The professionals were Jews, and so were the hard working and the daily workers were Jews.</span> <span id="s38">So, actually it was no different because the Jews took over the bigger jobs, or the better jobs.</span> <span id="s39">But in the same time some of the priests were preaching in church and telling that the Jews are running the business, which was completely untrue, for the reason that I was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: When the Antisemitism started increasing, this was roughly when?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: It was about 1935, 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Tell me about your involvement with the youth movements.</span> <span id="s44">Tell me when you first got involved in it and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s46">I got involved in the youth movement, was approximately when approximately I was about 10 years old.</span> <span id="s47">I belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir.</span> <span id="s48">It was an organization, a Zionist organization, and mostly in my home town, the youth belonged to different kind of Zionist organization, but it happened that the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir was one of the larger ones, and it was a very – a social outlet, and at the same time we learned a lot, at that time we learned a lot about Palestine, in hoping that some way in some time I will all be able to emigrate to Palestine.</span> <span id="s49">And this way was going on for quite a few years, from 1932, 1933, 1934, in the years to come, in the summers we used to go to different – for vacations.</span> <span id="s50">We used to go to camps for about a month, or six week camps.</span> <span id="s51">And in the camps we used to have 50, 75 kids my age from different small towns, from different towns from different areas, and that's where we spent almost every summer.</span> <span id="s52">In the same way as my two other sisters belonged to.</span> <span id="s53">They were not together in the same – they were a different age, so they belonged to different groups.</span> <span id="s54">We had a reason partially for that because we thought we have no future.</span> <span id="s55">We, already, by that time we were thinking that we had no future to live in Poland.</span> <span id="s56">So, our dream was that some day that we were going to move to Palestine, especially for me.</span> <span id="s57">In the later years, in 1937, I applied to go to agriculture school in Palestine.</span> <span id="s58">So, I applied to be accepted with Youth Aliyah.</span> <span id="s59">And by that time it was impossible, almost impossible to get a special visa to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s60">The only way you could was a small window of opportunity was it being a youngster with Youth Aliyah and going to agriculture school.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">02:19:27 So, some of my friends already went there.</span> <span id="s62">So, I had some friends in Palestine, and I was waiting the time will come, and I will get my visa, and I will move to Palestine.</span> <span id="s63">And then the war broke out, and I never was able to get the visa and emigrate to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: In the time before the war broke out, what did your parents think about everything that was going on; do you remember their talking about the Antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s66">I remember talking about it because we did not have any stores which were not Jewish, and all of a sudden, they – some way, they got organized and they opened up stores, supported, I don't know by whom.</span> <span id="s67">It was partially maybe by the government.</span> <span id="s68">I don't know from whom.</span> <span id="s69">I was too young to understand probably, or to know.</span> <span id="s70">And they opened up stores with special competition to our stores, not only to clothing stores, but in all different kinds of business.</span> <span id="s71">If it would be a food store or anything else and to cut down the prices and even already some places they stood, or they hired special young people to stay by the store, and most of our customers were farmers or coming in from small towns, and they used to stand in the store by telling them, “Don't go in, that's a Jewish store.”</span> <span id="s72">And don't let him go in.</span> <span id="s73">They stood in front of the store and didn't let customer or farmers walk in.</span> <span id="s74">We couldn't do much hardly about it, because you couldn't go to the police.</span> <span id="s75">The police wouldn't help you or do you, because we hardly had, even with a city like this, I don't remember, maybe we had one.</span> <span id="s76">We didn't even have a Jewish policeman in the city.</span> <span id="s77">So, everything, I mean like the government, the city jobs were held by Gentiles, but not Jews.</span> <span id="s78">And so life was getting little by little it was getting rougher.</span> <span id="s79">And the question is “Why didn't they move out, why didn't they go to America, why didn't they go to a different part of the country?”</span> <span id="s80">It wasn't so easy when your parents, or my parents, we lived in a house, but maybe the house was 100 years.</span> <span id="s81">My father lived there, my grandfather lived there, who knows who before, and we lived in the place and for us it was settled.</span> <span id="s82">Plus the family, all the family that we had, and we had quite a large family, we had I believe over 80 people, members in the family.</span> <span id="s83">They all lived in the same area, not too far.</span> <span id="s84">So life was almost a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s85">It wasn't a rich life.</span> <span id="s86">It wasn't luxury, but for us, we felt that we had all the luxury that we wanted, so life was almost, we could say, special like normal, until the last years when they started Antisemitism.</span> <span id="s87">So, that too, we had in our city and protection.</span> <span id="s88">We had the strong men.</span> <span id="s89">Who were the strong men?</span> <span id="s90">Slonim had all the – how would you call them, the “draggers.”</span> <span id="s91">It means the people who would load from the trucks – from the trains, load the merchandise, put them on trucks, at that time it was more horse and buggy, to deliver to the other cities.</span> <span id="s92">It was the strong guys.</span> <span id="s93">And in our city two strong guys, quite a few other ones, but two of them were the main two strong guys.</span> <span id="s94">In fact, I remember the name of them.</span> <span id="s95">One of them was Haskel and one of them was Note.</span> <span id="s96">So, by that time, arms was not available.</span> <span id="s97">Nobody used arms, but he could find out if somebody, Polish kids, or Polish young men come and did something, hid or did some damage to some of the Jewish people, he could come up to him and break his arm or break his leg.</span> <span id="s98">And that was the punishment, and they were afraid.</span> <span id="s99">So, we had that.</span> <span id="s100">That was in our favor.</span> <span id="s101">We had this strong man were with us.</span> <span id="s102">So, usually it was like a good protection.</span> <span id="s103">And that's the way it was going on almost until the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Tell me about the war breaking out and those first few weeks after.</span> <span id="s105">Tell me what you remember of the moments and what you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: We had two accidents of war, as far as I'm remembering.</span> <span id="s107">The first one was when the pact was made up between Russia and Germany – Ribbentrop and Molotov – when they decided they were going to split up Poland, and they split up our part of the country where I lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">02:26:02 So, at that time when it happened, that transfer was the expectation was very – was almost, I mean, we didn't know it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s109">We didn't know what the deal was.</span> <span id="s110">So, we thought, we didn't know who was going to occupy our part of the land Slonim, until we realized that all of sudden the Russians are the ones to occupy our Slonim.</span> <span id="s111">It was a tremendous, tremendous excitement, and we were very happy, because we didn't know what the Russians were going to do us, but we knew that between the two evils, we called them at that time, the Russians were much better.</span> <span id="s112">Because the Germans, we knew, if they are going to come, they are going to be much worse.</span> <span id="s113">We did not know about any killings.</span> <span id="s114">We did not know about anything they were going to do, but so, but we heard – in the 30s Hitler was already in power – what he did to some refugees that came to our town when they were thrown out from Germany, and they came to Slonim, and they told us what's happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s115">And here, the Russians came, so we were very, very happy.</span> <span id="s116">And me being a kid, I jumped on the tanks when the tanks moved in, and they were very friendly, so we jumped – kids – on top of the tank coming into the city.</span> <span id="s117">We were very, very happy, but only thing a little accident happened.</span> <span id="s118">I was wearing a nice watch, that I had got for my bar mitzvah, and here I am on the tank, and the Russian officer comes in, and he says, “I like your watch.</span> <span id="s119">How much do you want?”</span> <span id="s120">I remember I paid like something a small amount of money 10 dollars, 10 zlotys whatever it is.</span> <span id="s121">He gives me 20, 25 zlotys, so I figure, “Oh-ho!</span> <span id="s122">It's a big deal.</span> <span id="s123">I'm going to give him the watch, and I'm going to go out to the store and buy another one.’</span> <span id="s124">Sure enough, I couldn't get another watch anymore.</span> <span id="s125">So, but this was indeed to every place they came in like hungry.</span> <span id="s126">I mean, they were hungry for merchandise, for things.</span> <span id="s127">So, they were grabbing and running in the stores, and taking away, buying out – they didn’t take away – buy out– but they give us piece of paper, rubles, but we didn't realize that we wouldn't be able to replace like in our store.</span> <span id="s128">They come in and they bought out the whole store.</span> <span id="s129">The whole shelves in couple days, one day almost.</span> <span id="s130">But my little experience with the watch, and then I found out it had happened with everybody else.</span> <span id="s131">They were buying out, but mainly we were terrible happy.</span> <span id="s132">The material things didn't bother us, because the question was of life and death and what war was going to bring in.</span> <span id="s133">So this material things was just past and didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s134">We were very happy by being occupied that time by Russia.</span> <span id="s135">Then, I had another experience.</span> <span id="s136">Years – I'm coming back to the same – belonging to the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s137">So our togetherness, or our organization, still didn't disband, but we went secretly.</span> <span id="s138">So, we were part in this Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">02:30:35 And here I got an order, two of us, for me and another friend of mine, to go to Wilno, from Slonim to Wilno, which is approximately, I don’t know, maybe 200 kilometers.</span> <span id="s140">So, we went for train, and they said in Wilno we have the Zionist organization is active and we should take a ride over there and see what kind of connections we can make and maybe I can find the connections to move to – go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s141">So, I left my family and I went with my friend and I went to Wilno.</span> <span id="s142">And it turns out, I find out later, that being in Wilno, staying over there, they gave us, we were all in a couple large rooms, a couple long halls, and we didn't know yet, if you could go to – some way to emigrate to Palestine.</span> <span id="s143">Now, Wilno was – that time was Litwa.</span> <span id="s144">It wasn't Poland, it was part of Litwa.</span> <span id="s145">And the Russians didn't fully occupy it.</span> <span id="s146">So, there was a lot of freedom there.</span> <span id="s147">What we didn't have here in Slonim.</span> <span id="s148">And being over there I met some other young people that belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir.</span> <span id="s149">That's the only way the secret could go on was is knowing with the same organization.</span> <span id="s150">That's illegal, so you were afraid to be – I mean to reveal to other people to other places.</span> <span id="s151">So, I was there and I got in touch with the leadership from the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, and to my disappointment, they send me back home.</span> <span id="s152">They said, “We need leaders in the organization not to leave now, but we need them still in the occupied territory, back in Slonim.”</span> <span id="s153">So, fortunately for me, at that time, I went back home.</span> <span id="s154">I went back to Slonim.</span> <span id="s155">I was arrested by the way by the Russians on the border, and they took me as a spy, but I came back to Slonim.</span> <span id="s156">In Slonim, I was back with my family until the real war broke out between – under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s157">I wanted to follow my education, so I went to a technical school, a Russian technical school.</span> <span id="s158">And, what I learned there is to be mainly partly of engineering in movie projectors.</span> <span id="s159">The whole movie contents of the system, how the projector works, how the film works.</span> <span id="s160">By that time it was a novelty.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">02:33:58 The course took us almost a year, and then after a year to pay him off, everything was free in Russia.</span> <span id="s162">So, they sent me away in a small town to show movies on farms in small cities and small towns.</span> <span id="s163">That's the same thing, it was maybe 70, 80 kilometers from my home town.</span> <span id="s164">In there I got a job.</span> <span id="s165">I used to go out and show movies in schools.</span> <span id="s166">Collect a few farms or small villages and show the movies in the school, show Russian movies.</span> <span id="s167">And that was Russian propaganda.</span> <span id="s168">And being over there, one night on a Saturday night, I was out on a date, late in the evening, I could hear the bombardments and the war started, the Russian-German war.</span> <span id="s169">And here it caught me away from the house, away from home, nobody around, a young fellow, and I had to make up a decision, should – it was immediately panic with the Russians coming in – should I run with the Russians, away from the front, because the front wasn't that far away, or should I go back to my home, my hometown?</span> <span id="s170">And I decided I’m was going, going on – to go on the way home, and then I'll go away, run away in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">[Technical conversation] Going on the way home, already I could feel the war.</span> <span id="s172">What did I see on the road?</span> <span id="s173">What did I see on the way?</span> <span id="s174">The Germans were shooting other people and the refugees running away.</span> <span id="s175">It was soldiers, it was plain people.</span> <span id="s176">It was people like me, and we were trying to stay a little bit off the road, and here the Germans used to came in with planes and dive down and shoot at us.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">02: 37:10 Shoot people, innocent people running and just shooting at them.</span> <span id="s178">The same thing like it would be animals or cows.</span> <span id="s179">They were shooting on cows and people in the same way.</span> <span id="s180">Until the middle of the day, so all of sudden I saw a dog fight and I was real– because we didn't see any more Russians.</span> <span id="s181">The Russians were running away.</span> <span id="s182">They were bombed.</span> <span id="s183">They left their vehicles.</span> <span id="s184">They didn't have enough gas probably.</span> <span id="s185">They blocked up the roads.</span> <span id="s186">It was a real panic on the road going on, and we thought the Russians lost the war already.</span> <span id="s187">I mean what we could see.</span> <span id="s188">I'm sure they were just running from the front line.</span> <span id="s189">And we met pilots who didn't have a chance to even to get in their planes.</span> <span id="s190">The Germans bombed the airports, the air runs.</span> <span id="s191">And they were all running back to Russian – closer to the Russian border, deeper in Russia.</span> <span id="s192">And here I see a dog fight, and I was very happy because it gave me some encouragement that maybe the Russians are still alive, but there were plenty alive.</span> <span id="s193">Observing, so we lied down observing the dog fight.</span> <span id="s194">They knocked down the German plane and the German parachuted right in the place where we were there.</span> <span id="s195">So, I took part right with the Germans, being part of the groups that were running away.</span> <span id="s196">So some of the Russians, they had the arms, so they went right to the pilot where he parachuted in and they didn't wait too long.</span> <span id="s197">They killed him right on place, but they didn't take away his arm.</span> <span id="s198">After they left, I was there and I took away his gun.</span> <span id="s199">So, that's the first time I already had a gun by myself, and I thought, “Maybe, I don't know I will have to use it or not.”</span> <span id="s200">And that's the way it was burning, the roads, the homes in these little towns around were all on fire, all burning, and that took me about one night, and at – probably we got a little bit of transportation on the way, too.</span> <span id="s201">And the next day, I came to my hometown back to Slonim, and that was on a Friday.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">02:40:21 I'd say it took us quite a few days between leaving the town where we almost – for a while I thought it’s only a few days –that’s quite a few days before we came home.</span> <span id="s203">Friday morning, I came back home.</span> <span id="s204">I don't have to tell you, I mean the joy was real great that here their only son – they had three girls, I was the only one son.</span> <span id="s205">In Europe being one boy between four, between three sisters, so it was a big – a son was different than the woman.</span> <span id="s206">I would be the one to Kaddish, I would be the one to carry the torch, to be the head of the family was the Kaddish after my father.</span> <span id="s207">So, I finally arrived home and sitting over there and Friday evening before they make Shabbat, the shutters were closed.</span> <span id="s208">I can remember just like it’s yesterday.</span> <span id="s209">And we are sitting home reminiscing the stories, telling them again how much I went through the road coming into my home to Slonim, and it was later around nine, 10 o’clock we were ready to go to sleep.</span> <span id="s210">It didn't take too long before I had the chance to fall asleep, we hear like crackles on the roof.</span> <span id="s211">The first thing we hear is shooting, shooting in our yard.</span> <span id="s212">I lived in a small courtyard and there's shooting going on, and one after the other is getting stronger.</span> <span id="s213">The shots are getting more often, and here I hear crackles on the roof.</span> <span id="s214">So, I was thinking, “Thank God it's raining.”</span> <span id="s215">But it wasn't raining, the house was on fire.</span> <span id="s216">It was a wooden house and the house caught on fire.</span> <span id="s217">So, we were forced to get out.</span> <span id="s218">Now that's about one or two o'clock in the midnight, and the only thing you could see was from the moonlight, you could see everything what’s happening.</span> <span id="s219">So, some way we ducked out from the house and we are in the yard, and here in the middle of the fight is going in between the Germans and the Russians.</span> <span id="s220">What happened is, a group of Russians – they were left over, the front was already far, far away but they didn't know – the Russians didn't know that there was no more front in here and someway a fight was going on.</span> <span id="s221">So, we are coming out in the middle of the night, and we are immediately arrested by the Germans, and they put us in one place, maybe approximately about 15 or 18 men and women.</span> <span id="s222">The women they pushed aside while the men they took and they made everybody, if anybody had a cap on, they made everybody to take off their caps.</span> <span id="s223">And anybody who did not have hair, they put them in one place and they shoot them.</span> <span id="s224">They shoot them in our back yard.</span> <span id="s225">So here I'm a young fellow, I lost my home, and now I am witnessing a terrible massacre of eight or 10 men.</span> <span id="s226">My luck they didn't take me because I had hair.</span> <span id="s227">I wasn't in the Army.</span> <span id="s228">The reason why they looked at our hair is that they thought that maybe it's Russians, changed their clothes.</span> <span id="s229">So, they took the people – and my father didn't have much hair, but he probably looked older, so by chance they didn't take him either.</span> <span id="s230">But I know the reason why they didn't take me.</span> <span id="s231">So, they killed them, and we had to dig a big graveyard, a big hole in our yard, and we buried the people there.</span> <span id="s232">Eight or 10 Jews, 12 Jews, they killed them and here left over a young man with no home – coming back, no food, no home, and by luck by the same thing, we had another home.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">02:45:49 What my parents bought a duplex that someday when my two sisters will have to get married, they’ll have a dowry for them.</span> <span id="s234">And that was the custom in Poland, and it was the custom in the old country is when a woman gets married she'll need a dowry.</span> <span id="s235">So, they bought the duplex.</span> <span id="s236">So, we went from our house, we went to the duplex, we rented it before.</span> <span id="s237">And some day they will give it to my sisters.</span> <span id="s238">So, we went to the place where we lived, at that time it was quite a few families lived in the house, because the Russians in Slonim – originally, we had something like about 10,000 Jews before the war.</span> <span id="s239">But when the Russians occupied, lots of refugees from Germany were not allowed to live in different parts of the country, so they pushed them to our area.</span> <span id="s240">In Slonim population grew from 8,000 to maybe 18 to 20,000, and that was Jews from the other places, from Poland.</span> <span id="s241">So, it means the house already housed many more people in the same apartment.</span> <span id="s242">So, they made – they gave us one room and after a while this room was split up too.</span> <span id="s243">So, they give us one room and we slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s244">The family – there was not enough beds, to sleep in beds and a new life was started out for us to live under the German occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">02:48:05</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: How long before the ghetto was set up?</span> <span id="s247">Tell me how that whole thing worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: All right.</span> <span id="s249">Now, this when we lived in our house, Jews still lived in different parts of the city.</span> <span id="s250">And it didn't take too long approximately, that was in June, end of June, about two weeks later they started.</span> <span id="s251">An order came out that all the Jews have to move in, in one area, in one part of the city.</span> <span id="s252">In our city we had a river so it – there wasn't enough room for the 20,000 Jews to move them in one section, so they made four sections, four small ghettos.</span> <span id="s253">One larger ghetto and three other ghettos, and that was maybe about I would say, between two weeks or a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: This was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: This was in 1941, June of 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Were Jews—?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes, Jews – then Jews – when they put them in the ghetto they ordered us to put on the patch, the yellow patch.</span> <span id="s258">In our places it was patches, instead mogen David– the yellow patch in the front of the garment and in back of the garment.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">02:50:10 You were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk, on the street only.</span> <span id="s260">The ghetto was put up with barbed wire, and the main thing is the order that they put out signs and orders that any Jew that will be caught outside of the ghetto without – I mean outside the ghetto will be killed.</span> <span id="s261">There was no other punishment.</span> <span id="s262">The punishment was, if you do not fill the order or get the command, your punishment was by death.</span> <span id="s263">And lots of time the question comes up is, “Why did you go in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s264">Why didn't you stay outside?”</span> <span id="s265">It was immediately impossible to stay outside, because if you were caught, it's death.</span> <span id="s266">And by that time, we had no idea that punishment is death.</span> <span id="s267">Who kills anybody, for what?</span> <span id="s268">And so, everybody went – it was no big problem to go into the ghetto because nobody knew what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s269">So, it was no big, not a big threat not to go in.</span> <span id="s270">Plus, I mean, the population was very unfriendly and by some way the Germans would not recognize, especially for me, I had a problem.</span> <span id="s271">I look Jewish, Semitic.</span> <span id="s272">For me, I would be recognized because the poles, most of them blonde and the way – with my look, it would be almost impossible to walk on the street and not be recognized that I'm Jewish.</span> <span id="s273">So, I went with my family.</span> <span id="s274">We went – were in the ghetto together and the ghetto where they made, where the ghetto was, is where I lived, so I didn't have to move from one place to another.</span> <span id="s275">But next to us was three other small ghettos and that's the way our bad life started out.</span> <span id="s276">But the question to going into the ghetto was no question for me or my family or for anybody else.</span> <span id="s277">Like I said, the main reason is nobody knew what it was going to be gas chambers or anything else what could happen, the killing in the pits.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">02:53:19 It was unknown.</span> <span id="s279">But it didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s280">On July 17, I had another experience.</span> <span id="s281">The Germans walked in, in the Jewish homes and they took out only male, young males.</span> <span id="s282">[Technical conversation] And then it came on July 17, 1941, a special commander group came in, in the city, we didn't know they were and they walked from house to house, and they took out young male only.</span> <span id="s283">How did they do it?</span> <span id="s284">They organized like a chain.</span> <span id="s285">They told each one to come out from their homes and stand on the street.</span> <span id="s286">And from the street, they had guards organized almost every half block.</span> <span id="s287">They made you run to a certain destination.</span> <span id="s288">It was easy for them.</span> <span id="s289">They didn't have to arrest him and take him from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s290">Once you were out of the house, you came right to the place, the appointed place.</span> <span id="s291">They made you run.</span> <span id="s292">“Raus, raus, raus!</span> <span id="s293">“ and hitting you, and they didn't shoot us at that time, but hitting us and pushing us until we came to the destination.</span> <span id="s294">The destination was on the market place.</span> <span id="s295">Near the big market place and it was near the Jewish Theater, bordering with the Jewish Theater.</span> <span id="s296">So, they made their – they crowded us all in one place, and we were approximately 1,500 young people, and here I am caught in the middle of there.</span> <span id="s297">And staying there, it was a real hot day.</span> <span id="s298">What were they telling us?</span> <span id="s299">They were taking us out to work.</span> <span id="s300">We have some special arranged some work for us to do, some slave labor.</span> <span id="s301">And trucks were coming up to the place, loading them up, 30, 40 people on the truck and taking them away.</span> <span id="s302">I was there with my father, and being young, and being a little restless, so I say to my father – he says, “I'm very terrible thirsty.</span> <span id="s303">I see its a spigot with water, right there in the back.</span> <span id="s304">I'm going to go right there in the back to get a drink of water.”</span> <span id="s305">So, I was kind of hard to push through to go to the back and get to the spigot of water.</span> <span id="s306">But that time the line came closer and in a few minutes I was trying to run back to be back with my father, and my father was loaded on the truck, and I couldn't already get in on the same truck.</span> <span id="s307">And my father was taken away and by that time I was left over behind.</span> <span id="s308">And exactly – the punctuality of the Germans exactly at three o’clock the high German officer came in and he said the people the ones that are left could go home.</span> <span id="s309">So, I was left over.</span> <span id="s310">There were left over 300 out of the 1,500, and I was left over with the 300.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">02:57:49 They made an exit where we could run out, and they beat us.</span> <span id="s312">They were standing with the rifles, they hit everybody on the head and the foot and any place where they just go through.</span> <span id="s313">I wasn't hit.</span> <span id="s314">I jumped over the rifle.</span> <span id="s315">He wanted to hit me in the legs, I jumped it over.</span> <span id="s316">I came and I went back home, and that is the first time I came home and here I am the head of the household.</span> <span id="s317">I am the young man with three sisters and a mother, and my father was taken out.</span> <span id="s318">Where did they take him?</span> <span id="s319">They took him only about three or four kilometers away, and they killed them in pits, in fact a very shallow pit.</span> <span id="s320">How do we know?</span> <span id="s321">The Germans even tried, they made some of the people to write notes to the ghetto that they are fine, they are alive, and they are working.</span> <span id="s322">And then they killed them right in the place.</span> <span id="s323">But, some of the mothers, women, mothers, sisters, they didn't believe so they went down in a day or two.</span> <span id="s324">At that time the ghetto wasn't so hard to get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s325">It was right from the beginning July 17, it was only a few short while after we were occupied.</span> <span id="s326">So, they went out and they found the pla– the farmers were telling them where it happened and the name was Szpakowo.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">02:59:41 They went to the place and they found the clothes from their loved ones.</span> <span id="s328">And then it was known in the ghetto that they killed them all just only a few miles away from the city.</span> <span id="s329">That was the first time we found out actually that people were being killed in the pits.</span> <span id="s330">So, the whole, for me it was – it changed my whole way of thinking.</span> <span id="s331">It changed my whole – I accepted immediately and I started thinking that, “I don't think we will be able to survive.”</span> <span id="s332">So, we started working underground with the same people, with our friends and for us thinking to find a road maybe some day we'll be able to go out through the underground.</span> <span id="s333">So, immediately already the roots was developing.</span> <span id="s334">It was forming for the underground.</span> <span id="s335">And my history is a lot of survival through the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: You said when they rounded everybody up, they rounded up the young men mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: But your father must have been old, wasn't he?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: He was born in 1890.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So, he would have been 50?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: 50 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: So, you don't think they were rounding up the leadership of the ghetto young, strong men?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Yes, younger men, too – when we read the history of the Holocaust, what's happening in other places and other towns, it's almost happening the same way in every other – the other places.</span> <span id="s344">It's to take out the strong men.</span> <span id="s345">The able men.</span> <span id="s346">Break up the family, and that was done in every town around me.</span> <span id="s347">When I talked to some people that survived in different cities, and it almost happened like a copy of what happened in Slonim, happened in different cities.</span> <span id="s348">They did the same thing.</span> <span id="s349">They called the it chapones.</span> <span id="s350">There's a name even for it.</span> <span id="s351">They came in, they grabbed – a one day Aktion and out.</span> <span id="s352">And tomorrow they went in a different city and did the same thing.</span> <span id="s353">So, it was like a plan that was all planned out, how they're going to follow, how they're going to do.</span> <span id="s354">But, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s355">We were little, little people between a big machine.</span> <span id="s356">We had no idea how they worked.</span> <span id="s357">They had their psychiatry, they had their monies, they had their government, they had their plans, and we were just small little people in the ghetto and not knowing anything what’s planned for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: So, now, getting involved with the underground at this point, men – what?</span> <span id="s359">Smuggling?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Ok, now, I got involved – we were involved in the underground.</span> <span id="s361">The underground was a very secretive organization.</span> <span id="s362">They had a reason why it has to be secretive.</span> <span id="s363">A lot of times questions come up, “Why does it have it to be secretive in the ghetto between Jews?”</span> <span id="s364">It’s a reason for it.</span> <span id="s365">You have to be secretive is – I am planning to go out.</span> <span id="s366">I am planning to save my life.</span> <span id="s367">I have around me a thousand other young people, not young people.</span> <span id="s368">We're not talking about young people.</span> <span id="s369">We have another 20,000 Jews inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s370">We are a group of 10, 50, 100 or 1,000.</span> <span id="s371">We want to go out to the underground, or if not, we want to fight the Nazis in open revolt.</span> <span id="s372">So, the question is, "Why don't you take in more people or why do you have to be secretive?”</span> <span id="s373">Yes, if a group of 10 people or five people or one person goes out from the ghetto, let's say he is caught.</span> <span id="s374">The Nazis catch him they get the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">03:05:16 You tell them you belong to an organization or group, it's not important.</span> <span id="s376">The fact is, is that you're going out through the underground.</span> <span id="s377">Someway they have their way to know.</span> <span id="s378">They go in the ghetto and they take in 1,000 hostages.</span> <span id="s379">I'm saying 1,000, it could be 100, 500, 1,000.</span> <span id="s380">Different areas, it happened different amount.</span> <span id="s381">Now, I am going out.</span> <span id="s382">My friend, my neighbor is not going out.</span> <span id="s383">He is left over there.</span> <span id="s384">He could be part of the hostages.</span> <span id="s385">He could be part of the next Aktion, what we called what would happen in Poland.</span> <span id="s386">You take out 5,000 people and you kill, you precipitate an Aktion what's supposed to happen two months later.</span> <span id="s387">You do it, it happens tomorrow.</span> <span id="s388">And that's what happened in different parts.</span> <span id="s389">In Slonim, I was in Grodno, I was in Wilno, and that's why it's secret was so much.</span> <span id="s390">It was – you could not afford the other people to find out, but we'll talk a little bit in a different part.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: You knew that from the outset.</span> <span id="s392">You knew that there would be a reprisal because they said there would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s394">Yes, by that time this in a little bit longer, they brought in Slonim, they brought in two or three farmers and they were hanging in the middle of the market with saying that, “This will happen to anybody who goes to the partisans or goes to the underground or goes to the woods.”</span> <span id="s395">Now, that way you could see by the clothes that they were wearing, it was innocent farmers.</span> <span id="s396">You could see they weren't even partisans.</span> <span id="s397">But the main thing is the message that they were passing is, “That's what will happen if anyone is caught going to the underground.”</span> <span id="s398">And in return is they did many times, is by catching one they will take out a – punish other Jews.</span> <span id="s399">Now, the next thing that happens – how does a ghetto operate?</span> <span id="s400">How does a ghetto work?</span> <span id="s401">How do you live in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s402">You're not working, you're not earning any money.</span> <span id="s403">How does that work.</span> <span id="s404">Well, we were pushed into the ghetto, and here were 20,000 people, Jews, in one small little area.</span> <span id="s405">We have no food, and we cannot earn any money to buy food.</span> <span id="s406">So, it was formed a Judenrat.</span> <span id="s407">Who is the Judenrat?</span> <span id="s408">In our town, the Judenrat, they took a committee, what they were before elders in the city.</span> <span id="s409">Their job before the war was like federation, we have it in America.</span> <span id="s410">They used to collect money to help the poor in different kinds of special and Jewish city in the Jewish town, there's even lawsuits were going on, were settled not in court but settled between the committees.</span> <span id="s411">So, they were the first ones when the German occupied.</span> <span id="s412">They asked to form a Jewish Judenrat, and that's the committee.</span> <span id="s413">So it was the easiest thing to take these people to take over the management of the government of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s414">So, the first time we had approximately six or eight people that belonged to the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s415">Now, what was their function?</span> <span id="s416">Their function was – the first thing is to register the Jews.</span> <span id="s417">How many Jews are in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s418">It had a double purpose.</span> <span id="s419">Number one, the Germans wanted to know how many Jews we have there.</span> <span id="s420">And the next thing is they used to give rations.</span> <span id="s421">So, they gave us – you went to register, because if you wouldn't go to register, you had no way how to get a ration.</span> <span id="s422">So, this was a double purpose for the Germans.</span> <span id="s423">They knew exactly how many Jews are in the ghetto, because everybody wants to get food, and the rations were very small.</span> <span id="s424">Something like 200, 250 gram of bread and maybe something else once in a while.</span> <span id="s425">And that was the purpose of the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s426">And then at the same time, is the Judenrat formed for Arbeitsamt.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">03:11:02 Arbeitsamt means – is when the Germans came in and by that time it was even the Wehrmacht, the occupied.</span> <span id="s428">We had two different kinds of Germans.</span> <span id="s429">One was the Nazis and one was the Army.</span> <span id="s430">So, the army was just passing by, but in this same time already they learned how to rob, too.</span> <span id="s431">It didn't take long.</span> <span id="s432">So, they got orders to the Judenrat for slave labor.</span> <span id="s433">How do you get the best way slave labor, is you go into the Judenrat and you ask for 500 men.</span> <span id="s434">How do you get the 500 men?</span> <span id="s435">So the Judenrat formed a police, the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s436">The Jewish police got the order to go and get the slave laborers, so that was one part what was what the Jewish police did.</span> <span id="s437">And the other, the next day the Germans came in and they asked for furniture to fix their homes.</span> <span id="s438">The Jewish police went with wagons and pulled out the furniture from the homes.</span> <span id="s439">The next minute they came in and they want 10 kilo of gold.</span> <span id="s440">They want 10 kilo of gold – how do you get 10 kilo of gold?</span> <span id="s441">It's not what a Jew had gold in their pocket and in the vault, and he gives them the gold.</span> <span id="s442">He had to collect the gold.</span> <span id="s443">How do you collect the gold.</span> <span id="s444">You get the golden watches that they had from hundreds or thousands of years whom one passed to each other.</span> <span id="s445">They had rings.</span> <span id="s446">They had bracelets, even golden teeth.</span> <span id="s447">In Europe, they had a lot of golden teeth.</span> <span id="s448">The dentist used to pull out some teeth or some people died and they hold – holding teeth from them – or whatever.</span> <span id="s449">All and all they accumulate, they had to accumulate 10 kilo of gold.</span> <span id="s450">That's a lot of gold.</span> <span id="s451">The next week somebody else came and they asked for another amount.</span> <span id="s452">I don't know if it was 10 or five.</span> <span id="s453">The next time they come in they want to have another amount of gold.</span> <span id="s454">So, they collect it again.</span> <span id="s455">By that time it was much harder to collect, so the police had to go to the homes and beg and ask and plead with the richer ones to save our lives – and we thought so too.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">03:14:20 But maybe the passing time you'll buy off yourself with the order of the gold.</span> <span id="s457">And the third time, was no more people, was no more gold to give them so they took them out and killed the Judenrat.</span> <span id="s458">And what did they say?</span> <span id="s459">That the Judenrat collected the gold and they kept it for themselves, and that's the reason they killed him.</span> <span id="s460">That was no reason for that.</span> <span id="s461">They killed them because it wasn't any more gold to give it to them.</span> <span id="s462">So, life – that too, put a panic in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s463">They have to select another Judenrat.</span> <span id="s464">It was harder to get another Judenrat.</span> <span id="s465">So Slonim had a history, they had three Judenrats, and they were all killed.</span> <span id="s466">By the end they had only a Judenrat of only one man.</span> <span id="s467">That was by the end.</span> <span id="s468">So, life was getting, every day, tighter and tighter, and coming back to the Aktion of the 1,500 men, till was quiet in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s469">We called it quiet in comparison to the other times.</span> <span id="s470">So we called it normal, quiet, tranquil.</span> <span id="s471">But it wasn't.</span> <span id="s472">It was going on every single day.</span> <span id="s473">By that time, I went out on slave labor.</span> <span id="s474">I got a job working in a place they called it the Beutelager.</span> <span id="s475">It was the place where they collected arms, the Russian arms and put them in one or two buildings.</span> <span id="s476">So, I found a job at this particular place, and I had inclination that I was a mechanic and being a mechanic, they let me work in this particular place.</span> <span id="s477">Over there, in the Beutelager, I worked for a few months, and the head – a foreman of our group who was named Choraszansky the, the father of one of my friends, the one nucleus that was in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">03:17:11 So, we tried to smuggle in arms to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s479">How do you smuggle in arms to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s480">Every time you came into the ghetto you were searched, and if you are caught with a piece of bread – not only a piece of arm – you were killed.</span> <span id="s481">So, we found a way.</span> <span id="s482">The foreman, the one I worked with, was very, very friendly with the two Germans around the shop.</span> <span id="s483">And it was two German officers.</span> <span id="s484">Now, they were not Nazis, they were part of the Wehrmacht and one's name was Mutz and one was Brown.</span> <span id="s485">So, he got very friendly with them.</span> <span id="s486">What was the friendship?</span> <span id="s487">He could bring out – the foreman – was bringing out different kinds of clothes and valuables whatever they wanted from the ghetto and they exchanged with him for articles like soap.</span> <span id="s488">And they had a lot of soap.</span> <span id="s489">I don't know for what reason, but they had lots in their warehouse, they had a lot of soap too.</span> <span id="s490">Because they had this warehouse, other warehouse with food, too, some of it.</span> <span id="s491">So, bartering with them, he made a deal with them that whatever he pays him sometime, he'll help him to bring inside the ghetto, because what good is it if he gets it outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s492">How does he bring it inside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s493">So, what he did is, he gave him a boxes of soap.</span> <span id="s494">It's a wooden boxes and soap was large pieces like this not like we have it here, and we got an idea is to take out the soap under it and put hand grenades and put part of guns underneath and Mutz and Brown would take it into the ghetto with us, and delivering us the ammunition for us inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s495">And we did it quite a few times until we had well in comparison to any fighting force it was not enough arms.</span> <span id="s496">But meanwhile, we brought in, we start bringing in arms, and we had already, cache of arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">03:20:18 So, this way, our organization got bigger, then we got in a radio which we took out from a tank, a broken tank, and we put it together and we got a radio inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s498">And the ghetto was cut off from any type of news.</span> <span id="s499">We had no news, we had no radios.</span> <span id="s500">I didn't mention before that going into the ghetto you couldn't have a bicycle.</span> <span id="s501">They took away everything from you if you had something, no radios, no bicycles, no telephones.</span> <span id="s502">No nothing, anything like it.</span> <span id="s503">At the same time we had no information.</span> <span id="s504">No newspapers and no radios.</span> <span id="s505">Television wasn’t yet in any place.</span> <span id="s506">So, we got – start getting news, our own news.</span> <span id="s507">We could listen to BBC so we passed the news.</span> <span id="s508">The main thing it was the news for us is how successful are the Germans with the front line.</span> <span id="s509">That was our main news.</span> <span id="s510">We didn't need—</span></p> <p><span id="s511">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s512">03:21:49 End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s514">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s515">03:26:53</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Why don't you tell me about how that Aktion was?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: It was tranquil, and then it came -- the big Aktion November 14.</span> <span id="s518">Maybe, that's the way I’ll start.</span> <span id="s519">In the ghetto it was tranquil.</span> <span id="s520">It was almost quiet, but not that quiet.</span> <span id="s521">Once in a while the head of the Gestapo used to come in and punish somebody by finding for different reasons and maybe he didn't take off his hat against him.</span> <span id="s522">And from them he could take out his gun and just kill him for it because he didn't give respect to him.</span> <span id="s523">That means, the head of the Gestapo coming in the inside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s524">We called it, it was pretty quiet and tranquil because no Aktion was coming on since the taking out the 1,500 men.</span> <span id="s525">Until we came to a big massacre and we called it Aktion.</span> <span id="s526">So the German words called it Aktion, and from there on we called it also too an Aktion is coming.</span> <span id="s527">And then here on November 13, I lived right next door to us with a photographer – lived there photographer and some Germans used to come in and take pictures, photographs in his house to be able to send back to their families.</span> <span id="s528">So, they took pictures.</span> <span id="s529">And this particular German came in that day and he says, “Something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s530">I don't know, but lots of special groups, and whatever the name he called them, Nazis or Kommandos or – came in the city, and looks like something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s531">I would suggest, if you have a way, hide or get out of the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s532">And other signs was in the ghetto that they gave special scheins.</span> <span id="s533">The scheins is a special little piece of paper.</span> <span id="s534">The tradesmen, important tradesmen, where they worked for the Germans and they called them the special Nützliche Juden.</span> <span id="s535">And in fact some of them they even moved to a different part the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">03:30:04 So, we knew it was kind of happening, a distinction between our working Jews and non.</span> <span id="s537">So something we started worrying about it.</span> <span id="s538">This is the same time when the German came in and he told my neighbor that something is going to happen.</span> <span id="s539">So, I decided that I am going to go and hide someplace outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s540">Now, it wasn't hard to get out.</span> <span id="s541">It wasn't hard to move out, some empty homes were outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s542">So we went out during the night and we were hiding.</span> <span id="s543">It means me and my family.</span> <span id="s544">My family is now my mother and three sisters.</span> <span id="s545">We were hiding in a house outside of the ghetto, and the next day on November 14, 1941, that Aktion started.</span> <span id="s546">At eight o’clock they – a group, a big force of Nazis came in inside the ghetto and they pulled out 10,000 men, women and children, in the same thing the talk was, they were going to take them out to slave labor.</span> <span id="s547">And the same thing.</span> <span id="s548">People had no idea, because at that time, if you would hide in any parts of the house, under the bed – some people were hiding under the bed – they could survive this particular place.</span> <span id="s549">So, you know the people were so unprepared, so not having any kind of idea that they are going to take out 10,000 people to kill.</span> <span id="s550">They were almost ready to be taken, to go away.</span> <span id="s551">It was no resistance.</span> <span id="s552">And I can understand why the resistance wasn't there, because it was unprecedented to know that they were going to take out people to kill.</span> <span id="s553">So, people went and from eight o’clock the same thing until four o’clock or three o’clock, they killed 10,000 people, in not too far away, I forgot the name of the little village of the place – Chepelevo, they took out 10,000 people, Jews.</span> <span id="s554">They killed them right there.</span> <span id="s555">In fact, the night before they took 100 people, the same thing on slave labor, to dig the pits, and these people never returned.</span> <span id="s556">They killed them right in the place, and they never returned back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s557">So, nobody had any idea.</span> <span id="s558">It was pretty secretive, pretty known, you know, and this way they killed this tremendous amount almost half of our population.</span> <span id="s559">So, we started working, we got much more involved—</span></p> <p><span id="s560">03:30:49</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Wait, before we leave this – you – your mother and sisters were all hiding outside the ghetto, did you hear, you couldn't hear anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: How long did you stay out?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Only one night.</span> <span id="s565">We stayed only one night, and after the Aktion was over, the next day we returned back to the ghetto, and by that time we lost everything, a lot of my friends, a lot of my family.</span> <span id="s566">Then a few days later, it was known they were taking out, not too far from the city, and they killed them.</span> <span id="s567">Because some of them survived the massacre in the pits, so they came, wounded, they came back to the ghetto and they were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s568">We had a hospital in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s569">So, the Germans, after they found out that some people survived, they came in with a truck and took all the people from the hospital, and they killed them.</span> <span id="s570">So, it was already known in the ghetto, when they took out the 10,000 people and they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">03:35:34 So, I returned back a day later and by that time we didn't have the experience to know yet, but we figured the Aktion is over.</span> <span id="s572">There's no place, we couldn't hide.</span> <span id="s573">We couldn't stay much too longer, any place anyway, because the Poles would give us out.</span> <span id="s574">So, we returned.</span> <span id="s575">We felt safer to go back inside the ghetto than staying outside.</span> <span id="s576">And we returned, the next day we returned back to the ghetto, and here we found half of our friends, family were killed.</span> <span id="s577">I got much more interested in our bringing the underground organization, but at the same time I’m unfortunate, I already lost already some of our friends, some of my friends were taken out.</span> <span id="s578">But we were still left over, a nice group.</span> <span id="s579">So, we started meeting more often, and planning and see how we can bring in arms to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s580">So, I found a job in, I found a job in slave labor outside of the ghetto where they collected arms, Russian arms, which were left over when they were running away.</span> <span id="s581">So, the Germans were collecting it in three buildings and they called it a Beutelager.</span> <span id="s582">For me being, knowing a little bit mechanical work, so I got the job to be able to work in this warehouse.</span> <span id="s583">And some of my friends, the ones from the underground and the foreman was the father of my friend Choraszansky.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">03:37:59 He was in charge of that section, and he working for there quite a while, he established a good relationship with the two Germans, the ones who were in charge of it.</span> <span id="s585">They were German officers.</span> <span id="s586">One was his name was Brown, and Mutz, Mutz and Brown.</span> <span id="s587">And what was the bartering, what was the business that we could handle, we could do with them is, he used to take out some clothing or some valuables, it could be watches or something else, and in return he used to get from Mutz or Brown, he used to trade him for soap.</span> <span id="s588">Now, this soap used to come in wooden boxes, small wooden boxes stacked up with soap.</span> <span id="s589">So, what we did is we took out the layers, right on the bottom layers, we put in some hand grenades, all different parts of arms, on top we put back the soap, nailed back the box.</span> <span id="s590">Now, how do you take them inside the box of soap?</span> <span id="s591">So what we, what Mutz, mainly Mutz was doing it, so Mutz with his truck used to deliver back to slaves, us the Jews, back to slaves to the gate in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s592">In fact with this he used to drive inside the ghetto because everybody knew him.</span> <span id="s593">He was there every single day picking up the laborers back and forth, and they knew him, so it was nothing a German coming in with this truck.</span> <span id="s594">They didn't check his truck.</span> <span id="s595">They didn't look in anybody.</span> <span id="s596">So, this way we could come in together with him and they didn't check us.</span> <span id="s597">And this way we had a good chance to bring in – actually, what the Germans did the job for us.</span> <span id="s598">They brought in the arms for us there inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s599">And it didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s600">We had a few rifles, we had handguns, because a rifle takes a little more, it was a cut off rifle, we put it in the sack of flour.</span> <span id="s601">We did it not only with soap, but we had flour when they brought in.</span> <span id="s602">And we even had a radio.</span> <span id="s603">The radio, what kind of radio is we took out from a tank, a broken tank.</span> <span id="s604">We took out the radio and put it someway together and we could get news.</span> <span id="s605">Now, the ghetto had no communication with the outside world, or even with no place.</span> <span id="s606">We had no newspapers.</span> <span id="s607">We had no radios, and before you went into the ghetto they took away from you everything.</span> <span id="s608">You were not allowed to have no bicycles, cars, we didn't have any cars to start with.</span> <span id="s609">No telephones, no radios.</span> <span id="s610">So, actually we are in a vacuum.</span> <span id="s611">We didn't know anything of what's happening any place in the world, any place even our neighboring cities.</span> <span id="s612">If Aktions of killings were happening in different towns, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s613">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s614">We didn't know.</span> <span id="s615">It was just like a jail.</span> <span id="s616">It was a jail.</span> <span id="s617">We had no idea what's happening from one place to another.</span> <span id="s618">Not talking from farther away like Warsaw and Berlin, but even in the small towns next to us, we had no idea what's happening unless, unless once in a while somebody ran away from the massacre and they came in the town and they tell, is the only news you could find out.</span> <span id="s619">And that's the way our organization was developing, but we had less members.</span> <span id="s620">How many members we had, we don't know.</span> <span id="s621">Our immediate membership was, well we usually probably had 10 or 12 and then we lost a few, so we had about nine, 10 members put together.</span> <span id="s622">And right after the massacre, life turned back to normal.</span> <span id="s623">We call it normal.</span> <span id="s624">Now, we have a different way of what normal life means, but being the ghetto, we call that for us, it's quiet and I lost that job.</span> <span id="s625">They didn't let any more people, and I remember the night him and I worked in the Beutelager.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">03:43:28 I remember the night of Pearl Harbor.</span> <span id="s627">It happened.</span> <span id="s628">We heard it by the Germans that the war started in America and so the hopes kind of helped us that maybe some help would come from America.</span> <span id="s629">And at the same time we were talking between each other, maybe the world will find out, help will come, but it never came.</span> <span id="s630">How could Russia, America, England, how could they let to take people, take people and just kill them out, or destroy a people, but help never came.</span> <span id="s631">So, the underground was going on, but I had to still make a living to support – I am now the head provide of my household.</span> <span id="s632">So, I found another job.</span> <span id="s633">My job was in Verpflegungsamt.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">03:44:52 It means a big warehouse where they're giving out food to – we'd call it to older Germans.</span> <span id="s635">It could be Wehrmacht it could be Nazis, it could be rations to anybody who was German.</span> <span id="s636">So, one day they came and they picked 300 people from the street to unload a big transport of food, because that's when they opened up at that time, this particular warehouse.</span> <span id="s637">So, they picked up 300 men, because they needed it real fast unloaded.</span> <span id="s638">And the warehouse was almost a block long right on the railroad tracks.</span> <span id="s639">And I was one of them.</span> <span id="s640">So unloading it, I could see its a good job.</span> <span id="s641">It's nice, it was food, it was only with food, all different kinds of food, even big like a tire of swiss cheese and wines and everything were there.</span> <span id="s642">So, something was going on they were talking that they might pick some of the people to have a steady job.</span> <span id="s643">So, I tried to be young and strong and not hungry completely yet, so I worked like a slave that particular two days, and I was probably one of the best workers, and they picked me by the end.</span> <span id="s644">I was one of eight people where they picked on this particular job.</span> <span id="s645">And after the third day, I had a steady job.</span> <span id="s646">It was a very good job.</span> <span id="s647">I could support my family.</span> <span id="s648">I could bring food.</span> <span id="s649">They gave me food.</span> <span id="s650">It was a well paid job.</span> <span id="s651">I worked there in this particular place until I got an order to go out to the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">03:47:24 It didn't take long, in a short while I got an order to go to come to a special place to go to the underground.</span> <span id="s653">In this same time, I remember probably it's in this same time when it happened is – a one of the men when they took out the first time the 1,200 men and killed them, was a friend of mine, and he lived about a couple doors away from us.</span> <span id="s654">So, I went to visit his – no, no they took out his father, mistake not – he was still there.</span> <span id="s655">His father was taken out on this particular day.</span> <span id="s656">So, I came to visit my friend, and next door I saw a nice beautiful girl, so I asked him, “Who is the girl?”</span> <span id="s657">And he said, “She lives right here next door to me, if you want it I'll introduce you to her.”</span> <span id="s658">That was the same girl, the one I still know up until now.</span> <span id="s659">It was Lisa Nussbaum that was her name, and I got acquainted with her and saw her and start coming in every single day.</span> <span id="s660">The only thing I had a little bit problem because she was very young.</span> <span id="s661">She was not quite 15, and her father didn't like it so much.</span> <span id="s662">By that time, Lisa was – her mother was killed in that big Aktion, so her father didn't like it that I was such an often visitor coming to the house, but I had a very good job, and I had food with me, and I had cigarettes with me and I had dry food what I used to bring from the Verpflegungsamt.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">03:50:18 It gave me a chance to bribe him off, with the food, with the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s664">And so, every time I used to come in, I used to bring in my pockets some dry foods, a package of cigarettes, before, it didn't take too long, I was a nice, friendly visitor.</span> <span id="s665">This way I was coming in more often, and I got to know Lisa, and she was a very beautiful girl.</span> <span id="s666">She had longer hair with – curly hair with a longer face and I almost fell love in with her, but not quite yet because right from the beginning here I am getting an order that I have to go to the partisans.</span> <span id="s667">I have to go.</span> <span id="s668">That was my dream all the time to go to the underground.</span> <span id="s669">But it was just the beginning when I started knowing Lisa.</span> <span id="s670">So, it wasn't such a big – I mean objection for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: How did the order come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: The order came to me in very simple words.</span> <span id="s673">Somebody came and told me “Aron, tomorrow at six-thirty, seven o’clock you come to this particular home.”</span> <span id="s674">And the house was inside the ghetto, but almost by the end next to the wires.</span> <span id="s675">So it came the order that, “tomorrow six-thirty, seven o’clock you're supposed to be there.”</span> <span id="s676">No questions asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">03:52:02 I went home.</span> <span id="s678">I took my little knapsack and I put it in something over there, I don't know next to a shirt, pants, if I had anything, and I go to my place where I was supposed to meet.</span> <span id="s679">My mother and my sisters notice that I'm going away.</span> <span id="s680">I'm packing up and I’m going someplace.</span> <span id="s681">They weren't so excited with that.</span> <span id="s682">Here I am the head of the household.</span> <span id="s683">They need me so badly in the house, bringing in food, helping them with the rations, and the only man in the house.</span> <span id="s684">I'm leaving.</span> <span id="s685">So, my mother followed me and she came to the same house.</span> <span id="s686">And being over there I am meeting some of my friends and some other new people that I didn't know, other people, and the door opens up and my mother comes in and she falls on her knees and she starts crying and she starts begging, “How could you do it and leave us by ourselves?</span> <span id="s687">You're going away.”</span> <span id="s688">Now, that was not typical of the other people.</span> <span id="s689">Other families were just the opposite.</span> <span id="s690">The mothers would take the kids and throw them out on the street, “Go ahead, maybe you'll survive.”</span> <span id="s691">My incident was different.</span> <span id="s692">It took me a long, long time back until now, how much, if I did the right thing or not, and many times I could never forgive when I didn't take this opportunity to go to the underground because some of my – anyway I turned back and I went back with my mother.</span> <span id="s693">I went back home.</span> <span id="s694">Until the other things happened, but I could never forgive myself, my mother, I don't know, I could never come to terms with that.</span> <span id="s695">Did I do the right thing?</span> <span id="s696">I didn't, for saving my life I didn't do the right thing.</span> <span id="s697">The way my life turned out, it was all right, but that was one of my worst – anytime when I talk about that, it's a very, very hard decision to come up and decide.</span> <span id="s698">But being the head of the household – so being the head of the household worked very, very hard on me.</span> <span id="s699">Maybe if she wouldn't have mentioned that word, maybe it would be different, but saying that the father was taken away and you're the only one, so I turned back and I went back.</span> <span id="s700">– Slonim.</span> <span id="s701">I never had another opportunity, never had a chance to go.</span> <span id="s702">Some of my friends, they did go.</span> <span id="s703">They run away, they survived the war.</span> <span id="s704">Some of them were killed in the underground, but here I had a chance, yet I went too much, much more after that, but here I had the chance to be in a fighting unit and go out of the ghetto, and I didn't take it.</span> <span id="s705">It took me many, many years to rationalize if I did the right thing or not.</span> <span id="s706">I went back in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s707">My relationship with Lisa – well in this way Lisa helped me a lot, because by that time I developed a relationship with a girlfriend and I lost some friends, but I gained, in that time, I gained with Lisa, and our relationship developed much closer and the visits were often, and that was going on until the terrible day of June 29, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">03:57:31 That's a new chapter where it starts there.</span> <span id="s709">About that time our organization was almost – we lost more people and some people went away and I was kind of like almost like rejected because not going to the underground, so I was left over almost like not faithful or not being part of the underground, and until the day of June 29, 1942.</span> <span id="s710">It was only six months later from the first massacre.</span> <span id="s711">Here was lots of luck with me, lots, lots of what happened with me in this particular time.</span> <span id="s712">Being a worker, a good place to work for the Verpflegungsamt, I too had developed a relationship with the – well, I can't call them Nazis because this was the Verpflegungsamt, so I developed a good relationship with the two officers, the two captains of the – there were five Germans there.</span> <span id="s713">There was man by the name of Captain Miller, Captain Brauer, and then one was a Fritz, I don't remember exactly the three other plain soldiers, the ones that we were working with.</span> <span id="s714">So, we were working, the eight of us inside filling the orders and the Germans were in charge.</span> <span id="s715">So, we took it over – it was – we took over the old warehouse and we did our job.</span> <span id="s716">We did a good work because we wanted to save our job.</span> <span id="s717">It wasn't so much the dedication of being dedicated to do their slave labor, but that was our only source of our good source of bringing in healthy families and having enough food.</span> <span id="s718">Until that particular day, a special Einsatzgruppen group came into the city with many, many Nazis with trucks came in the day before in the city and mainly they all need their rations, their food.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">04:00:30 So, where do they come?</span> <span id="s720">They came into that Captain Miller, and that was on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s721">So, they came into him to get some rations.</span> <span id="s722">Meanwhile, from the time from the first massacre to the second massacre, everybody in the ghetto realizing what happened the first time, if you could hide under the bed, if you could hide in the hiding place, maybe they didn't find you.</span> <span id="s723">So, what happened was each house tried to make malines.</span> <span id="s724">The name of maline they called it, it's a hiding place.</span> <span id="s725">Now, a hiding place could take any different kind of ways.</span> <span id="s726">It could be a tunnel in the backyard – if you had a backyard – with a covered entrance where they couldn't find.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">04:02:14 In my house, in my house, we had 32 people living.</span> <span id="s728">And we made a hiding place for the 32 people.</span> <span id="s729">Where was the hiding place?</span> <span id="s730">Under the floor – was a wooden floor – we pulled out some dirt and luckily we had a small yard, and put it out in the yard, and we made in the floor a special entrance which was hard to recognize.</span> <span id="s731">That would be the place to hide in case another Aktion would come.</span> <span id="s732">We knew it was going to come.</span> <span id="s733">Now, every other house had their different ways how to make where to hide.</span> <span id="s734">So, I was when the news came in the ghetto the day before, that something was going to happen.</span> <span id="s735">How did the news come in?</span> <span id="s736">The traffic outside you could see.</span> <span id="s737">All of a sudden some new faces, some new trucks because we were on the watch-out.</span> <span id="s738">Everything we were looking for any signs and all of a sudden you could see the atmosphere was different outside than everyday.</span> <span id="s739">So, the trucks are passing by, and by the way, our ghetto was divided, the main thoroughfare, all the trucks had to pass by.</span> <span id="s740">Was one ghetto on one side, the other side you can walk on the street, but you could see if they could go around in different places, but some Aktion was coming through.</span> <span id="s741">So, we were getting ready to – if something happens during the night or the next day – we were getting ready to hide in this particular hiding place.</span> <span id="s742">So, here, they came to Miller with the order for food.</span> <span id="s743">And especially they wanted the whiskey.</span> <span id="s744">They always did it with the whiskey to get them drunk.</span> <span id="s745">They could do the job without being drunk, but it helped when you gave them the schnapps, the whiskey.</span> <span id="s746">So, they came in for the order, and Miller said, “I cannot do it unless you give me my eight Jews.”</span></p> <p><span id="s747">04:05:12 So, now we are his eight Jews, because they work over there in this.</span> <span id="s748">The head of the commander had to get a special permit to be able to go inside the ghetto, I mean to get out that Miller should be able to come into the ghetto and take out the Jews.</span> <span id="s749">I don't know they were negotiating that what they told us later on.</span> <span id="s750">They were negotiating almost all part of the evening and the next day, on Monday morning about six-thirty, Miller and the other four Germans were living right across the street from the entrance of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s751">It was a nice rich – before the war, it was a nice Jewish home, so they took it over when they threw the Jews inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s752">So, Miller comes in to the entrance of the ghetto and he gives the order, shows the order to the guard and to the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s753">The Jewish police were inside the ghetto, to get Dereczynski – that's me – and the other people, get them together as fast as they can -- 10 minutes, 15 minutes -- to come everybody by the exit from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s754">And the ghetto was small, it wasn't that far.</span> <span id="s755">I get a call in my house when the Jewish policeman knocks on the door.</span> <span id="s756">We were already ready to hide, and he runs and he knocks on the door when he calls, “Miller is waiting for you outside of the ghetto,” otherwise I would never go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">04:07:09 He knocks a few times.</span> <span id="s758">He said, “Dereczynski, Dereczynski, Miller wants you.”</span> <span id="s759">And he mentioned Miller, otherwise I would never come out.</span> <span id="s760">So, I went out and here he tells me that Miller was giving me the order to get the people.</span> <span id="s761">So, we got the people together and we went in the house and it was very hard leaving everybody there.</span> <span id="s762">Here I am going out, but this time, I didn't have no hesitation.</span> <span id="s763">It was very hard to part that you are going away.</span> <span id="s764">I don't know if you'll ever get back together.</span> <span id="s765">But I did go out, and five minutes to seven we were there and Miller takes us out and walking out from the ghetto, not going even maybe one block we could see that the destruction of the ghetto is coming, because we saw like a front line.</span> <span id="s766">Germans with machine guns all surrounded the area that we are passing, all pointed to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s767">Like you see a regular front line.</span> <span id="s768">Now, what is that for?</span> <span id="s769">Then we walked out another short while, a few minutes later, we hear a shot and the Aktion started exactly at seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s770">By that time, the Judenrat was a man of one.</span> <span id="s771">His name was Kwint, and the minute they started coming into the ghetto, he asked them, “Where are you taking my Jews?”</span> <span id="s772">So, he was killed right there by the entrance.</span> <span id="s773">Kwint was killed right there by the entrance.</span> <span id="s774">I found it out later, I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s775">But I could hear the shooting and then small little tanks immediately you could see because we saw little tanks and trucks filled with all different kinds of auxiliary forces was standing in the trucks, and you could see they're getting ready.</span> <span id="s776">In fact, one comes out on the way when we were walking.</span> <span id="s777">One high German officer comes out from a jeep and he stops us and he says “Where are you taking the Jews?”</span> <span id="s778">In fact he if I’m not remember, he may have even called him “Miller.”</span> <span id="s779">He said “Where are you taking the Jews?”</span> <span id="s780">He said, "If you're not giving me the Jews, you won't have any food.”</span> <span id="s781">And, “Heil Hitler” and he let us go.</span> <span id="s782">And they took us to the Verpflegungsamt, which was approximately one mile away and we came back to the Verpflegungsamt and in the Verpflegungsamt you could already see the fire, you could hear the shooting and the killing was going on, and before the evening came they put the ghetto on fire, because they couldn't find anybody.</span> <span id="s783">Most of the Jews were in the hiding places, so they put the ghetto on fire.</span> <span id="s784">So, you could see the flames of the fire and we are sitting inside the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s785">Not be able to do anything, not be able to help and not sure with our own lives.</span> <span id="s786">“What are they going to do to us?</span> <span id="s787">When they get through with them, they're not going to let us witness, sure the next thing will be they'll probably kill us.”</span> <span id="s788">So, we tried to figure out maybe a way that we'll be able to run away.</span> <span id="s789">But, in that time, they gave us special scheins.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">04:12:14 The schein was a small little card with a stamp from the Gebietskommissar – it means the governor.</span> <span id="s791">There was only eight legally taken out from the ghetto, and I was one of the eight.</span> <span id="s792">And here we are sitting there and Miller comes out and everyday we used to go to the main street where the ghetto is to the bakery to pick up bread for the rations.</span> <span id="s793">This particular time, Miller said, I wouldn't suggest anybody should go, you could be caught right on this.</span> <span id="s794">So, I did with another two fellow workers we decided we were going to go anyway in the truck.</span> <span id="s795">We'll go to the Bakery.</span> <span id="s796">Now, passing by the bakery is like I say, you pass by two ghettos.</span> <span id="s797">Another two ghettos a little inside that you couldn't see.</span> <span id="s798">I wanted to see what was happening inside the ghetto, so I took the chance.</span> <span id="s799">I went with the truck, and I passed by the ghetto and I could see what's happening inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s800">The ghetto was already on fire.</span> <span id="s801">People were running out from the hiding places.</span> <span id="s802">Some people were running out from the hiding places.</span> <span id="s803">Some people I saw where they were hiding in the toilets.</span> <span id="s804">We had toilets, outside toilets, so they were hiding inside and they were all with the dirt, and they were caught there and they were out walking past by where it is running to the river.</span> <span id="s805">The river was right there, maybe to wash off and they were killed right on the way.</span> <span id="s806">And other killings, you could see some dead people on the street in the ghetto, because the truck was going slow.</span> <span id="s807">We asked the driver, Fritz, when he passes by the ghetto to go slowly so we could witness this.</span> <span id="s808">And it was happening like people were running and the old Jewish saying “fun fayer tzu vaser”, “from fire to water” Running from the fire to get drowned in the water or killed in the water, and that's the view what I witnessed it, what I could see.</span> <span id="s809">And I came back to the Verpflegungsamt, tremendous thinking of what are we going to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">04:15:40 “How are we going to survive or what can we do?”</span> <span id="s811">That was going on – but the same night he gave us a place to sleep in the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s812">We didn't go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s813">That was going on for two or three days, and then Miller told us that they are going to let a certain amount of Jews live.</span> <span id="s814">They are not going to kill out the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s815">And later on we found out they did the same thing all over.</span> <span id="s816">They never killed out in the first or second time until the end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s817">Our experience showed later too, they did the same thing.</span> <span id="s818">Mainly the ones, the people that are hiding, is you let some other people live.</span> <span id="s819">So, the people, the ones that are hiding would come out and then you make it from a ghetto of 10 blocks, you make the five blocks, from five blocks to 10 homes.</span> <span id="s820">Then you keep them in the two homes.</span> <span id="s821">Then when the Germans want to find you, they only have two homes to look for it.</span> <span id="s822">They don't have the 10 blocks, what they had, or 20 blocks.</span> <span id="s823">I found it out later that that was what was done in every type of place.</span> <span id="s824">So, they left.</span> <span id="s825">They left, the word was coming out they were going to let some Jews live.</span> <span id="s826">It's not going to be completely liquidated.</span> <span id="s827">So, what do I do?</span> <span id="s828">I'm outside.</span> <span id="s829">My family is still inside.</span> <span id="s830">Lisa is still inside.</span> <span id="s831">I have no idea what happened with them.</span> <span id="s832">And I'm being there on the third day and I came to Miller, and I say, “I have a good idea for you.”</span> <span id="s833">And he, during the time with Miller, I bartered before too.</span> <span id="s834">And he always used to ask me if I could get him certain different kinds of items to bring from the ghetto and he'll pay me to send, probably send it back to Germany.</span> <span id="s835">Meanwhile, the night when this was happening, I noticed that Brauer, the other officer, he was kind of completely disturbed with the happenings.</span> <span id="s836">It was only one German what I ever met, what I could see that he was disturbed with it.</span> <span id="s837">And I see him staying on the, on the – we had a lot of sacks and he is staying over there leaned on the sack with hands like this [interviewee gestures with both hands on head] and he said “I can't believe it that my people can kill and burn this.”</span> <span id="s838">And he was talking to himself.</span> <span id="s839">And I just make it like I wasn't there around.</span> <span id="s840">So, the next time, when a couple days later when Miller gave me the permit, I told him, I said, “You get me a permit to go inside the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s841">The Aktion was still going on in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">[Technical conversation}</span></p> <p><span id="s843">04:20:11 End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s845">04:59:56</span></p> <p><span id="s846">05:00:08</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: After the second and third day, people were hiding inside the ghetto, and they could not find anybody, and they put the ghetto on fire.</span> <span id="s848">And then, a day later or two, they started announcing with the loud speakers that the Aktion is over and that anybody who comes out will get scheins, and they're not going to take them away.</span> <span id="s849">By that time, some people were start already, coming out, so when they came out they immediately arrested them and they took them over in the jail yard outside of the city.</span> <span id="s850">When I was working on my place and I found out that some people are going to be allowed to live, so I went to Miller when I offered him a proposition that if he would someway get me transportation to the ghetto, I would go inside the ghetto and find for him anything what he would like.</span> <span id="s851">For example, he wanted all the time, he wanted – at that time there wasn't too much valuables you could find.</span> <span id="s852">I mean if people had small stuff they took with them whatever, but the bigger items, crystals, all different kinds of dishes, maybe some furs, this kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s853">So he fell for the idea and he says, “All right.</span> <span id="s854">I'm going to get you a special permission to get inside the ghetto.”</span></p> <p><span id="s855">05:02:15 In the afternoon, I asked him in the morning, a short while after, maybe an hour or two hours later, he came back with a piece of paper, with a permit to go inside the ghetto and he said “Fritz will take you to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s856">He'll drop you off right inside the ghetto and whatever you accumulate all different valuable stuff that you can find, you'll come to the front of the ghetto” – what's the entrance and the exit, it's only one gate – “you'll come right by the exit of the ghetto and you'll take it over to my house.”</span> <span id="s857">He lived right across the street.</span> <span id="s858">So, I was very happy to do it, and my intention was mainly was if I could go ahead inside and maybe I'll be able to find my family inside the ghetto, and Lisa, whatever I can do and help and see – “I'll decide what I can do later.”</span> <span id="s859">He dropped us off, four of us.</span> <span id="s860">He dropped the four of us in the ghetto, and it was still going on some of the Germans were still walking around inside the ghetto to rob, to look for something to take it home, to rob, to take away.</span> <span id="s861">And but in the same time we are afraid that we shouldn't be arrested in taking like some of the survivors, so we all stayed together in one group with the document what we had.</span> <span id="s862">So, we came, we walked through part of the ghetto and we split up.</span> <span id="s863">Each one went to see if he could find anybody from their family.</span> <span id="s864">I immediately went to my house where I lived and I knew exactly the entrance or the hidden entrance.</span> <span id="s865">I knocked a few times until I got an answer and sure enough everybody was still there, and it was the people that were there.</span> <span id="s866">I found out it was 32 people were hiding.</span> <span id="s867">They opened up the door and it was three, we found three dead people.</span> <span id="s868">The three dead people they committed suicide.</span> <span id="s869">It was a druggist, and he was fortunate to have some poison, so his family took the poison.</span> <span id="s870">And the stench it was!</span> <span id="s871">I couldn't walk in, inside but some way I went underneath and here the people were laying over there for three or four days under the floor with no lights and they couldn't even move.</span> <span id="s872">They couldn't stay on their feet, if they would come out in the open.</span> <span id="s873">By some way I got inside and I had a chance to see my mother and my three sisters.</span> <span id="s874">I couldn't help them with doing the taking out.</span> <span id="s875">Whom would you take out?</span> <span id="s876">If I could take maybe one, I would have a terrible decision even to take one.</span> <span id="s877">Whom to take?</span> <span id="s878">Whom to take?</span> <span id="s879">And but I gave them, I found some food.</span> <span id="s880">I brought in some bread and water.</span> <span id="s881">The food that I found is because there was some food in the empty homes where they took out the people.</span> <span id="s882">I could still find some bread and what mainly was the water.</span> <span id="s883">So, I gave them the water and the bread and I gave them, and I said, “We'll see what we can do the next chance I'll have.”</span> <span id="s884">I figured to myself “that's what I'll do.’</span> <span id="s885">And I left them.</span> <span id="s886">And from there walking outside, I met my other friends, the ones that worked with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">05:07:00 Nobody had anybody of their families.</span> <span id="s888">Their families were discovered and they didn't have found anybody.</span> <span id="s889">So on the way walking out, I had to pass by the place where Lisa lives, the house.</span> <span id="s890">And here, I tell my people, and they were carrying the dishes, whatever we found we put them in the pillow cases.</span> <span id="s891">We didn't have any boxes.</span> <span id="s892">We put them in pillowcases.</span> <span id="s893">So, I was standing over there and they're waiting and I say, “Give me a chance, let me take a look if my friend is there.”</span> <span id="s894">I came into the house, and she wasn't there.</span> <span id="s895">The place next to them was a hiding place.</span> <span id="s896">It looked like the hiding place was discovered.</span> <span id="s897">And, you could see a hand grenade blew up the hiding place.</span> <span id="s898">I still didn't give up.</span> <span id="s899">I went to the back and I think, “Maybe they went in the back to hide.”</span> <span id="s900">So, I go in the back and I start calling out “Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.”</span> <span id="s901">And sure enough it, didn't take too long and an answer came out, and Lisa was there.</span> <span id="s902">She was hiding in a small little shack, a wooden shack, very easy to discover, very easy to burn, but somebody was behind them upstairs and they kept the place intact.</span> <span id="s903">It was not on fire.</span> <span id="s904">And she came down, and I made immediately my decision I made up, that I'm going to take her with me.</span> <span id="s905">But how did I take her out?</span> <span id="s906">Women were not allowed to leave yet, because the people, the ones they left was only men around them when they saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">05:09:05 It was no women.</span> <span id="s908">So, what I did is I went right next door, in fact in the house where I met my friend, the one who introduced me to Lisa.</span> <span id="s909">I went upstairs in their little attic.</span> <span id="s910">I found men's clothes, a pair of pants and a jacket and a cap.</span> <span id="s911">I took her in there.</span> <span id="s912">I cut her hair, and I put on a pair of pants and a jacket on top of her old clothes which she had, and the cap, and she cried.</span> <span id="s913">I mean, her hair she never cut since she was born probably, but she was happy and excited, and at the same time she's leaving her brother and her father in the hiding place, but she took the chance that she went with me.</span> <span id="s914">Now, what I did was I gave her my schein, the passport to leave the little piece of paper and hoping in case if I'm caught Miller will some way take me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">05:10:08 So, we're all getting ready to walk out, and we find a couple chandeliers, old broken things with wires.</span> <span id="s916">I figure it's a good thing to keep it how to mask her up, she wouldn't be recognized.</span> <span id="s917">So I put on the one fellow, I put a chandelier with wires, we didn’t have much BX with, with all different kinds of wires.</span> <span id="s918">The same thing I did with Lisa, and here we're walking.</span> <span id="s919">There are five of us now with the bags and carrying the bags.</span> <span id="s920">We're coming out to the exit and here the Germans are watching.</span> <span id="s921">I take the piece of paper and say “Here's my four men.”</span> <span id="s922">And they took a look at us – they didn't even check – look on the paper, four or five, they didn't pay any attention, and they let us out and we walked right across the street, across the street where the Germans live.</span> <span id="s923">We're coming in over there and Miller in the house, it's the middle, or late in the day, and Miller was in the house, so I walk up to Miller, excited to join him with the bags of the goods that I brought him in, and I tell him I found my sister – can he help me to save my sister?</span> <span id="s924">He gets enraged and he hits his hands on the table and says “This is no place to hide Jews.</span> <span id="s925">Get her out immediately.”</span> <span id="s926">I had no choice.</span> <span id="s927">I put her down in the basement over there and I let her in the basement and I figured maybe I'll be able to see if I can talk to Bauer.</span> <span id="s928">So, I wait for a while there, being over there and Miller took off.</span> <span id="s929">He went back to work and Bauer was there.</span> <span id="s930">So, I walk up to Bauer and I say, “Captain Bauer,” I say, “I found my sister, can you help me?”</span> <span id="s931">He says, “Where is she?”</span> <span id="s932">I said, “She's in the basement.”</span> <span id="s933">He says, “Don't worry, I'll help you.”</span> <span id="s934">And he goes down with me in the basement and Lisa sits in the basement.</span> <span id="s935">It was filled up with old furniture, and she's laying like a little cat all rolled up scared to death and she was small.</span> <span id="s936">She wasn't a big girl.</span> <span id="s937">And Bauer walks over and tells her, “Stand up.”</span> <span id="s938">And she's scared and she stands up and he says, “You're not a boy.”</span> <span id="s939">And he looks at her and so she just says, “No.”</span> <span id="s940">And he says, “Do you have your girl's clothes?”</span> <span id="s941">And she says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s942">He said, “Take off the boy's clothes.</span> <span id="s943">Take off everything that you have, and be back in your old clothes.</span> <span id="s944">The only thing is don't have your the latte, the Jewish sign, yellow star, the yellow square, round piece.”</span></p> <p><span id="s945">05:14:16 Anyway, and he told her “come up upstairs” and there were Jewish – one of our eight that worked like steady.</span> <span id="s946">He was cleaning the house the – for them and helping them inside like a slave labor.</span> <span id="s947">And he came down and they brought her down a babushka with her hair in a babushka and he took her out from there and he told her he says, “I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt.”</span> <span id="s948">We left with Fritz.</span> <span id="s949">Fritz took us over with the truck he took us back to the Verpflegungsamt and Lisa was left over there and Bauer took her to the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s950">He walked with her and he told her to walk on the sidewalk – no more like on the street – and “just walk like you're a Polish girl.”</span> <span id="s951">And in case – that was his words, “in case the Black Guard is going to stop you” – the Black Guard was the police from the Ukrainians or somebody with the forces when they come in – he said, “I'm going to kill him right on the way.”</span> <span id="s952">And he walked with her to the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s953">I was over there already with my other helpers, but I was expecting her to come, so I made a hiding place in the Verpflegungsamt.</span> <span id="s954">I only had the problem; how do we bring her in?</span> <span id="s955">We smuggled her in someway, inside, the other Jews that are our friends helped me to find a place here in the Verpflegungsamt and the Verpflegungsamt was hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of sacks of all different of flours and sugar, all different kinds of foods, and it was packed in five or six, stacked like an army of soldiers.</span> <span id="s956">So, I found a place where to – I took out a few sacks, and I made a place to hide and that was where she was hidden there for a few days.</span> <span id="s957">And then later on I got a schein for Lisa, the same little passport.</span> <span id="s958">I was transferred to a different Verpflegungsamt to the other building to the Beutelager where I worked before.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">05:17:15 We left that place where we could now live.</span> <span id="s960">And Lisa was left over the night, for the night by herself.</span> <span id="s961">And the place with food with rats and everything right over there, and she stayed there during the night.</span> <span id="s962">I came a couple times during the day to visit her until she got the schein and then after I took her over to the Beutelager.</span> <span id="s963">Two days later she went to the Beutelager.</span> <span id="s964">I went back to help my family.</span> <span id="s965">I paid off Miller.</span> <span id="s966">He came in with a truck, Miller now, I came in with him, and we came to the place where my family and the rest of them were hidden.</span> <span id="s967">By that time we found only approximately about 14 or 15 people.</span> <span id="s968">The young men, the young people, walked – went out from there.</span> <span id="s969">I don't know if they survived or didn't survive, but they left the place.</span> <span id="s970">We were in a covered truck with canvas, a canvas covered truck.</span> <span id="s971">I took out my family and the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s972">The rest of the people had money to pay him off.</span> <span id="s973">They had valuables.</span> <span id="s974">They were pretty rich from before.</span> <span id="s975">When we're talking rich, we're talking maybe they had a couple coins.</span> <span id="s976">But that kind of richness that we talk, we're not talking here for diamonds and big, big, big items, but it was enough because I promised Miller that, “They are going to pay you off.</span> <span id="s977">They are going to give it to you.”</span> <span id="s978">So, I had to stand with my word, otherwise he could kill me too, if he would take him out and not get paid, he would take me out and shot, because that same Miller was a killer before.</span> <span id="s979">He took part in Aktions in different cities.</span> <span id="s980">We found it out.</span> <span id="s981">We knew it.</span> <span id="s982">So, being good to me this particular time, helping me, it was me – it wasn't – the next Jew he would kill him cold in blood.</span> <span id="s983">So, I was trying to make it sure they will have money to pay him.</span> <span id="s984">So, I took them over to the same place where Lisa was, but she couldn't be in the same building but next to it was another building, and they were hiding over there, staying there for a while.</span> <span id="s985">The next day Miller gave them all scheins.</span> <span id="s986">By that time everybody could get a schein.</span> <span id="s987">They could go out in the open at that time and get a schein.</span> <span id="s988">By that time there was no more killing.</span> <span id="s989">As far as I think and I'm concerned there were no favors.</span> <span id="s990">But that time was a time, like I said before, they decided they were going to let some of the Jews live.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">05:20:55 So, it was done almost only to enrich his pocket.</span> <span id="s992">He knew it was no big deal what he did, but he did it anyway.</span> <span id="s993">And we stayed over there – by that time there was left over approximately 900, 1,000 Jews out of 20,000.</span> <span id="s994">In a short time, we had every night to get up in the middle of the night to be counted, but I made my way out from there to go to a different city.</span> <span id="s995">I did the same thing and Lisa did the same way in two different times.</span> <span id="s996">We were separated for a short time.</span> <span id="s997">I went with my mother and three sisters.</span> <span id="s998">In fact, Lisa, with her father and brother, left a couple days before.</span> <span id="s999">Where did we go when I left a couple days later?</span> <span id="s1000">A friend of mine knew a farm lady.</span> <span id="s1001">And the farm lady would take us in a horse and buggy to a different city with the name of a Pruzhany name, Pruzhene and from there we were going to go to the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s1002">We heard that in some places in the Third Reich – we didn't even know much about what the Third Reich meant – that in this Pruzhana, Volkovysk, Bialystok, Grodno, this part of the country that there is no killing over there and that the Jews are still alive.</span> <span id="s1003">So, we went with this farm lady.</span> <span id="s1004">They found her.</span> <span id="s1005">She took us in a horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s1006">She couldn't take us to Pruzhana she took us to Rozhinoy.</span> <span id="s1007">From Rozhinoy, they robbed us and took away everything, whatever we had, and we went to Volkovysk.</span> <span id="s1008">In Rozhinoy, the woman is supposed to take us to Pruzhana, so from Rozhinoy we got in touch with the Judenrat in Rozhinoy and they arranged for us to go from this town to Volkovysk.</span> <span id="s1009">In Volkovysk we supposed to go to Bialystok or Grodno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">05:23:44 So, we're in Volkovysk in a place where some more refugees were there.</span> <span id="s1011">I asked the people in the Judenrat if you saw a girl with a young brother, with a young kid – her brother was 11 years old, 12 years old, 12 years old not quite 13, because 13, it was a year later, bar mitzvah – and the father, the father was an older man.</span> <span id="s1012">At that time, older was 50, he wasn't 50, but in the 40s was an old man.</span> <span id="s1013">And they told us, “Yes, a girl with them and they went from Volkovysk and they went to Grodno.”</span> <span id="s1014">Here I am with my family, with my mother and the rest of family in Volkovysk, and I have to make up my most important decision in my life.</span> <span id="s1015">I had to make the – and it flashed through my thinking, a backflash, “Did I do right in not going to the underground, going back to my family?</span> <span id="s1016">And here I'm at the crossroads, should I go with my family to Bialystok or should I go single, young and single go to Grodno?”</span> <span id="s1017">And I made my decision that I'm going to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1018">It partly was my mind to break away from the family, because if the only chance I have is to survive is not to stay together.</span> <span id="s1019">When you stay together you only perish together.</span> <span id="s1020">There is no way that a family would be able to survive, so I made the decision that I'm going to go to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1021">And that's the last time I saw my family anymore.</span> <span id="s1022">I left them, and they went to Bialystok, and I went to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1023">From Volkovysk, was the place where we split up, the Judenrat helped me in transportation to Grodno.</span> <span id="s1024">How did I go?</span> <span id="s1025">They put me with a truck, a beer truck it was empty with empty kegs, barrels of beer that they were going to Grodno probably to, whatever, deliver or pick it up.</span> <span id="s1026">So, I was hidden between on the truck until I arrived in Grodno.</span> <span id="s1027">And that too, the Judenrat helped me to have gotten transportation.</span> <span id="s1028">I came in Grodno.</span> <span id="s1029">By that time I think it was in August of 19— it was June, no probably in August of 1942, I came into Grodno.</span> <span id="s1030">Grodno was completely relaxed like hardly – it was a ghetto, but a very relaxed ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">05:28:08 You could go in and out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1032">It was no killing.</span> <span id="s1033">It was no transportation.</span> <span id="s1034">For me, it was almost like coming in like a paradise.</span> <span id="s1035">I'm sure Aktions happened to the time but I wasn't aware, because I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1036">So, I can't say that nothing happened there anything before, but the way it looked to me – coming in from the massacres and coming in a place where it’s quiet and people are moving around and in the little ghetto you could see business going on, on the street, what was the business?</span> <span id="s1037">Selling old clothes, selling a pair of pants, buying a pair of shoes, you couldn't even buy food on the street in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1038">So, for us, for me it was – I couldn't even believe that things could happen not only what was it, 70, 100 kilometers from my home town.</span> <span id="s1039">I thought to myself, “I wish everybody else would know about it.</span> <span id="s1040">Maybe a lot of people would try from before.”</span> <span id="s1041">Well, it was going on like this.</span> <span id="s1042">I found Lisa.</span> <span id="s1043">Lisa was there with her father.</span> <span id="s1044">They lived in an apartment, and they took me in.</span> <span id="s1045">I lived with them.</span> <span id="s1046">I made my own friends in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1047">And my main purpose was only one thing is, “How do I get in touch with the underground?”</span> <span id="s1048">I'm single, I'm by myself.</span> <span id="s1049">Single, I mean I'm not married.</span> <span id="s1050">I'm not attached, and that was a tremendous plus.</span> <span id="s1051">And how can I find a way with the underground.</span> <span id="s1052">The first thing I start looking to a Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, the Zionist organization, nothing helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">05:30:18 Being over there I couldn't get in touch with anybody.</span> <span id="s1054">After the war I found out it was an underground organization there.</span> <span id="s1055">But it was so secretive and being a stranger in town, it was impossible to get in touch.</span> <span id="s1056">So, here I am looking around, walking on the street to talk to different kinds of friends and people had jobs and this, and I could in no, no way I could get in touch with the underground.</span> <span id="s1057">So, in being there, by November first there came in an order from the Gestapo to close the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1058">Ghetto one and ghetto two, they decided to close the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1059">That means from now on the Gestapo took over the ghettos.</span> <span id="s1060">If you had to go in or out, you had to have orders from the Gestapo, and it was getting on the same order that Slonim was from before.</span> <span id="s1061">So, we are caught now with a population only one difference was, I'm an experienced person in people would have no idea what killing means or destruction means.</span> <span id="s1062">I'm here, I felt myself, "I'm experienced – young and experienced, maybe I'll have a chance, find some other ways."</span> <span id="s1063">When they blocked up the ghettos it was hard to go out for work.</span> <span id="s1064">You had special permissions.</span> <span id="s1065">People went out to work and it didn't take too long they're asking for two transportation, resettlement started.</span> <span id="s1066">And the name was – they are taking them out to work, and the places would be much better, because here already, hunger started.</span> <span id="s1067">A lot of people ran out of anything to sell or any valuables to be able to barter to change out.</span> <span id="s1068">You had to live only on the rations what you were getting, and that wasn't much.</span> <span id="s1069">Rations weren't too great, too big, too much.</span> <span id="s1070">And they were the order to get 2,000 Jews for resettlement.</span> <span id="s1071">So, they put out officially signs, I don't remember, with names or no names, but they said, "Take your best clothes, take your warm clothes, it might be cold.</span> <span id="s1072">Take your toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s1073">Take you food for two days.</span> <span id="s1074">Take as much as you can carry in the suitcase or whatever it is."</span> <span id="s1075">They made us believe that they are taking you to a resettlement, but with my experience, I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">05:33:52 So, here I thought, "We are going to be the first ones on the list, because we are the outsiders."</span> <span id="s1077">And sure enough they came to the house.</span> <span id="s1078">We were first on the list.</span> <span id="s1079">I was first on the list, Lisa was the first, the whole family is.</span> <span id="s1080">But that's all I had to do was I was hiding in the basement.</span> <span id="s1081">When they came and looked for me, I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s1082">So, they took other people.</span> <span id="s1083">They filled the quota with some other people.</span> <span id="s1084">But I survived this first time.</span> <span id="s1085">And that way it was going on, day after day, quiet and then another Aktion, and then another Aktion.</span> <span id="s1086">And meanwhile, we start building malines, hiding places, the same thing as this and here I became an expert.</span> <span id="s1087">People started knowing of me, what I went through, and now all of sudden they were getting interested, "How did you survive in Slonim?"</span> <span id="s1088">Before, people didn't want to hear it.</span> <span id="s1089">"How did you survive?"</span> <span id="s1090">So I told them this.</span> <span id="s1091">So, they called me in different places how to build places to hide.</span> <span id="s1092">So, the one benefit that I got is I knew the places.</span> <span id="s1093">Helping them, I knew the places.</span> <span id="s1094">So, when it came up a big Aktion when they took only four or five days, I was hiding, they took out I don't know maybe 10,000.</span> <span id="s1095">Now, Grodno had 29,000 Jews at this time.</span> <span id="s1096">The vicinity around had another 10,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s1097">So, now I'm part of the 29,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">05:35:54 So they took out one, one time, they took out in four or five days, another 10,000 and we were hiding in five different places.</span> <span id="s1099">We were there, stayed there for 10 or 15 minutes, "I don't like it.</span> <span id="s1100">Too many kids, it's not enough air, its maybe it's…," someway I had the feeling they were going to discover it.</span> <span id="s1101">And sure enough we went through five days.</span> <span id="s1102">I don't know how we survived, but we did survive.</span> <span id="s1103">How we survived the last time?</span> <span id="s1104">The last time we survived after we went out from different hiding places and it turns out they discovered, I don't know, not all of them, but most of them were discovered, but the last time is, we were hiding in a place in a house under a bed, a broken bed, what the place was checked and looked maybe a 100 times and that we figured that is a good place to hide.</span> <span id="s1105">Because by now they are not going to look under the bed.</span> <span id="s1106">The doors were open.</span> <span id="s1107">The pillows and everything was all thrown out on the floors.</span> <span id="s1108">We figured anybody walked in it only took a second to walk out, because they all realized that, "Hey, somebody was here already.</span> <span id="s1109">Somebody before, they took out the people."</span> <span id="s1110">And we survived under the bed.</span> <span id="s1111">After that it was – I do not know exactly how many people were left over – but it was in December, I found a job to work outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1112">In the meanwhile, being inside the ghetto where I lived, I befriended with a very dear friend.</span> <span id="s1113">He became a dear friend after, and his name was Herschel Lipszyc.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">05:38:11 And very nice person, very nice young man and he probably treated me like a brother.</span> <span id="s1115">And I was so involved with him, and every place where he was going to work, he was asking me, "Why don't you join me to work?"</span> <span id="s1116">And here, it came out in December, he tells me, “Aron you're very handy.</span> <span id="s1117">Why don't you be an electrician.</span> <span id="s1118">We need an electrician.”</span> <span id="s1119">I was a carpenter, an electrician, a shoemaker, anything what we need.</span> <span id="s1120">When you're handy, it's not hard to become anything.</span> <span id="s1121">I mean, you're not an expert at that, but at least you know how to do it.</span> <span id="s1122">And he tells me that, "We need an electrician so maybe I can arrange that you can go out and they will hire you."</span> <span id="s1123">You can not just go with him and be an electrician.</span> <span id="s1124">You have a foreman, the foreman has to accept you to take you out over there to work.</span> <span id="s1125">So, he went to the foreman and he told him, “I have for you a friend.</span> <span id="s1126">He's an electrician, and he'll go out with you.</span> <span id="s1127">Let him come to work.”</span> <span id="s1128">So, on that wintry day I went out to work with Herschel, and we were working with about five people, and what we are doing we were remodeling a house for a Gestapo, a private home.</span> <span id="s1129">So, we were remodeling the house, so I was supposed to be an electrician.</span> <span id="s1130">Before when in Russia when I went to school knowing about electricity, so I knew a little bit how to work with electricity, and being over there we got acquainted with a Polish young fellow and his name was Tadeusz Soroka.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">05:40:26 He used to come and the same thing, to barter.</span> <span id="s1132">He used to bring us food, and we in turn would bring him clothes from the ghetto and change and this way we could bring in some food.</span> <span id="s1133">Herschel, my friend, knew him very much better.</span> <span id="s1134">He knew him before the time.</span> <span id="s1135">So, he got real friendly with him.</span> <span id="s1136">My friend Herschel Lipszyc didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1137">He was a little blondish looking, so Tadek, this Polish fellow tells him, "I have a connections in Wilno and over there I will be able to get you papers, Aryan papers so you'll be able to live as a non-Jew outside."</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">05:41:39 Herschel agreed to it with another friend of his Lutek, and they made their arrangements with Tadek – that Tadek is going to take them from Grodno to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1139">It's 180 kilometers, he's going to take him over there.</span> <span id="s1140">They made up a certain time, and Hershel is supposed to send me a note if they come to the place, if they came safe to the place.</span> <span id="s1141">Because a lot times it was going on, somebody could take away from you – we didn't have any money, I didn't have much money– but to give out to the Nazis you would get a pound of sugar for it, or you would get some other food stuff for it, rewards for it.</span> <span id="s1142">So, I wasn't sure.</span> <span id="s1143">"Why would a Polish fellow just be so nice and do it for them?"</span> <span id="s1144">So we were kind of suspicious, I mean, whatever behind is or is it not, so we asked him for a note.</span> <span id="s1145">And Hershel left.</span> <span id="s1146">I helped Hershel get out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1147">I cut the wires for him.</span> <span id="s1148">I was the last one to say goodbye to him.</span> <span id="s1149">And we kissed and hugged and, "We'll see you someday in Wilno."</span> <span id="s1150">And he left.</span> <span id="s1151">A few days later, Tadek comes to me and he says, "I don't have a note."</span> <span id="s1152">He says, "It happened, he couldn't stay outside, he went inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1153">It started raining, and I couldn't stay long enough and I have no note."</span> <span id="s1154">I worried about it and I didn't know if I should ever take a chance with him or not.</span> <span id="s1155">We went through another day or two, a few days later and Tadek cames – comes again to me, the place where I was working, and he says, “Aron, the ghetto is surrounded with heavy guards and the ghetto, it looks like, is being liquidated.”</span> <span id="s1156">Here I have, I'm outside, Lisa is inside, my family is in Bialystok, I have to make up my decision.</span> <span id="s1157">Where do I go?</span> <span id="s1158">Do I go – do I believe Tadek or go back to the ghetto, live or there or go with Tadek to the unknown?</span> <span id="s1159">I didn't know where I was going to go.</span> <span id="s1160">I didn't hear from Hershel.</span> <span id="s1161">I didn't hear from – what should I do.</span> <span id="s1162">So, I have an agonizing decision to make.</span> <span id="s1163">What do you do?</span> <span id="s1164">Do you go back to Lisa?</span> <span id="s1165">All kind of thoughts come to you, and you say to yourself, “ Aron, where are you running?</span> <span id="s1166">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1167">What's the big deal about surviving?</span> <span id="s1168">So you leave everybody.</span> <span id="s1169">And you almost give up inside."</span> <span id="s1170">And I'm not easy to give up, but your thought comes: "It's enough.</span> <span id="s1171">What is the purpose of surviving?"</span> <span id="s1172">You think and you think and meanwhile Tadek comes back and forth and he keeps asking me, “Are you going?"</span> <span id="s1173">And he says, "I'm going to take you to Wilno tonight.</span> <span id="s1174">Don't go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1175">I'm going to take you to Wilno tonight."</span> <span id="s1176">And I say, “Tadek, I have no money.”</span> <span id="s1177">He says, “I didn't ask you for any money."</span> <span id="s1178">He says, “I'll take you to Wilno tonight.”</span> <span id="s1179">Meanwhile there develops another situation: The other people that are working with me are getting suspicious – maybe I want to go away with Tadek.</span> <span id="s1180">We are five or six, whatever the figure was, we are going back to the ghetto, one missing, that's death.</span> <span id="s1181">If you come in with a piece of paper with six, and five are returning, that means death for the other ones.</span> <span id="s1182">They start worrying, the people, and all of a sudden I see like they're guarding me.</span> <span id="s1183">They are staying behind me, but later on I don't blame them.</span> <span id="s1184">I would probably feel the same thing.</span> <span id="s1185">And I made my decision, 'I'm going back to the ghetto."</span> <span id="s1186">And this fellow, Tadek, stayed all day with me.</span> <span id="s1187">He spent the whole day back and forth coming, begging me, and finally when I told him I made the decision, I said, "Tadek, give me your address and maybe I'll have another opportunity, I will come to me."</span> <span id="s1188">So, he gave me the address, what I marked down on my body, on different parts of my body, I didn't want in case I'm caught to give out Tadek, and we walked back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1189">By that time it was seven, six o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s1190">It was dark, and I'm walking with the rest of them, with a German guard, the one that took us in and out for work.</span> <span id="s1191">He was not a Nazi, but he was just a guard to take back and forth.</span> <span id="s1192">And I noticed Tadek is on the other side of the sidewalk, the other side of the street, and he told me before he left, he said, "Anytime you decided to run away, follow me."</span> <span id="s1193">And he was on the other side of the street walking up until I walked.</span> <span id="s1194">But I made up my mind that I'm not going to change my mind and I came to the entrance of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1195">By that time, I thought to myself, "Goodbye Tadek" – I couldn't say it, but I thought to myself – "goodbye Tadek, I hope I'll see you again."</span> <span id="s1196">The minute I came in, I was arrested, like with everybody else.</span> <span id="s1197">A small little street.</span> <span id="s1198">We walked down a small street right under the gun.</span> <span id="s1199">Your freedom is all completely taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">05:49:21 When here I was half free, outside half free, maybe 10, 20 percent free outside, maybe I could still do something.</span> <span id="s1201">Here I am back inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1202">They take me into the big synagogue.</span> <span id="s1203">I'm pushed in the big synagogue, packed with people who they found during the day and the people returning from work like me.</span> <span id="s1204">Everybody packed in the big synagogue.</span> <span id="s1205">I even had a hard time to move around.</span> <span id="s1206">I was looking for Lisa.</span> <span id="s1207">I looked around, moved around asked some people what I knew.</span> <span id="s1208">I couldn't find Lisa.</span> <span id="s1209">And as sure as I stood there, "Why did you go back?"</span> <span id="s1210">I mean, now I'm caught right in the Aktion.</span> <span id="s1211">I stayed there all night and I tried to find a place to hide in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1212">I found a couple places and I didn't accept it myself.</span> <span id="s1213">I thought, "They are going to discover it."</span> <span id="s1214">It was bookshelves – a lot of bookshelves.</span> <span id="s1215">I was behind, I pushed out the books in hiding in the shelves, in the back of it.</span> <span id="s1216">I kind of didn't like it, "I'll be discovered and be shot right in the place."</span> <span id="s1217">The next morning, about five o'clock in the morning, the Gestapo comes in with the doors open, and we get an order.</span> <span id="s1218">Meanwhile already inside the synagogue they already killed a few by shooting, by – they were shooting on the chandeliers.</span> <span id="s1219">They synagogue would have the big lights and some little children you could hear already, no mercy, killings and I'm outside the other was in four, two walked to the transport and I'm sure this that's, now we see it, the way people are walking innocent to the transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">05:51:37 Now, here I'm a young fellow without a family, strong, looking from all sides where to run away.</span> <span id="s1221">No way could I run away.</span> <span id="s1222">Any move you would be shot immediately.</span> <span id="s1223">They keep postponing the time.</span> <span id="s1224">Maybe it will be another opportunity.</span> <span id="s1225">They're burning inside, "Why didn't I go with Tadek."</span> <span id="s1226">And it didn't take too long, I'm at the railroad station, packed with some other people.</span> <span id="s1227">They put me in a boxcar, filled up with the boxcars, maybe 60, 70 people packed in the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1228">The doors are shut.</span> <span id="s1229">I'm inside, you can't even move around.</span> <span id="s1230">People can't relieve themselves.</span> <span id="s1231">Hungry from the few days they were laying in the different places and here I'm between.</span> <span id="s1232">I still have a ray of hope when I see a small little window in the boxcar.</span> <span id="s1233">And with my other two friends, we were all together, the ones we were working together, and I say, “Let's see if we can jump out from the boxcar.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">05:53:31 So some way we had a hard time to push through, that's how packed it was, to push through in the boxcar and come to that window.</span> <span id="s1235">We came to the part where the end of the boxcar, where the window is, and we stood on top of each shoulders and we started with all our strength to pull the bars, metal bars.</span> <span id="s1236">Sure enough, we pulled the metal bars out, because the strength that we had at that time was like Samson with the pillars.</span> <span id="s1237">We could probably break a piece of iron.</span> <span id="s1238">We pulled out the bars and started jumping out.</span> <span id="s1239">I wasn't the first one to jump.</span> <span id="s1240">I jumped, the second or the third one.</span> <span id="s1241">By that time I thought, “I'm a good athlete.</span> <span id="s1242">I know how to jump out.”</span> <span id="s1243">The train is going.</span> <span id="s1244">I'm already figuring out what I'm going to do.</span> <span id="s1245">“I'm going to jump out with the train the way it's running.</span> <span id="s1246">I jump out I won't get hurt.”</span> <span id="s1247">Sure enough it didn't happen this way.</span> <span id="s1248">I jumped out and I fell down, probably on the head or whatever.</span> <span id="s1249">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1250">I was unconscious and the only thing I remember is being awakened by a guard, the ones who were watching the railroads.</span> <span id="s1251">The German guard picked me up, put me back on the truck, took me back inside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1252">Inside the ghetto they put me right in a small little room, and they left me there in the small room, because they didn't know what to make the decision, to wait for the Nazis to come and make the decision.</span> <span id="s1253">It didn't take too long.</span> <span id="s1254">They took me right to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">05:56:02 They put me back in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1257">I'm back where I was the day before.</span> <span id="s1258">I'm pushed back in the same synagogue where I was the day before.</span> <span id="s1259">But the only difference was it was empty.</span> <span id="s1260">It was about ten in the morning, the synagogue was empty, and every hour the synagogue started being filled up.</span> <span id="s1261">During the day, they found some more people.</span> <span id="s1262">And here I'm looking if Lisa is caught.</span> <span id="s1263">Yesterday I didn't see her and today it's almost evening she is still not there.</span> <span id="s1264">The synagogue is packed up and they couldn't – I was looking a place where to hide.</span> <span id="s1265">I still have to find a place.</span> <span id="s1266">Maybe I can still survive.</span> <span id="s1267">And the only thing why I tried real hard this time is knowing that Lisa must be still alive.</span> <span id="s1268">She's not in the first transport and she's not in the second transport or she's killed in the place or she's out.</span> <span id="s1269">So, I was waiting all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">End of Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">05:57:33</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">[Technical conversation}</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">06:00:01</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Let's back up into the synagogue, you knew Lisa wasn't there and you're still looking for a place to hide, and it's filling up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: In the synagogue, during the day, I'm still looking around to see if I can find Lisa, and I was looking at other places, maybe I can find a place to hide.</span> <span id="s1277">It's late in the day, the synagogue was already packed again, and Lisa was still not there.</span> <span id="s1278">I looked around for a place, maybe I can still find a place where to hide.</span> <span id="s1279">And in the synagogue I was looking and I see a small little room that used to be the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1280">I jump in this little room, and I see a young man is making a hiding place under a pile of coal.</span> <span id="s1281">There was a pile of coal, blocks of coal.</span> <span id="s1282">He was making – trying to build a way how to hide under the coal.</span> <span id="s1283">I walked up to him and started begging him and asking him to let me make a place, together maybe we can make a place together.</span> <span id="s1284">After a hard bargaining with him and asking him and pleading with him, I told him that I am a survivor from Slonim, I have some luck with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">06:01:45 “Plus, if you survive here, I have a Polish fellow that will take us to Wilno.”</span> <span id="s1286">I don't know which words worked on him, but he decided he's going to let me make the place.</span> <span id="s1287">So, we together, we made a hiding place.</span> <span id="s1288">Like we had two walls, an L shape and a pile of coal.</span> <span id="s1289">So, we used the two walls.</span> <span id="s1290">We used like blocks, and with our luck we found a piece of plywood to make a roof.</span> <span id="s1291">We made a roof on top of the blocks, two walls of coal blocks and we made a hiding place underneath and covered the roof with coal again, and we found a couple of bodies, two bodies, dead bodies that we put on top of the coal.</span> <span id="s1292">The bodies we found is a place where I wanted to hide the night before.</span> <span id="s1293">It was the same room with a large urn where they kept water.</span> <span id="s1294">So, I thought, “I'm going to go in the inside and hide.”</span> <span id="s1295">And sure enough I walked out of it.</span> <span id="s1296">I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1297">I thought, “The Nazis, that’s all they have to do is shoot with the urn.</span> <span id="s1298">He doesn't have to go and look and check the urn.”</span> <span id="s1299">So, I went out from over there and that's where the next day somebody else took that place and they were killed over there.</span> <span id="s1300">So, we found a couple bodies in.</span> <span id="s1301">We were hiding there inside, all of us, and during the night and the next morning, we hear the same thing what's happening the day before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">06:03:39 The Nazis came in.</span> <span id="s1303">They took out the people from the synagogue, the same orders.</span> <span id="s1304">The only thing is, is being inside the synagogue is empty and the echo in the synagogue you could hear real well.</span> <span id="s1305">You could hear only a few shots whether somebody I don't know for many reasons, but they left small babies.</span> <span id="s1306">And you hear the cry of the babies being still by the shots of the guns.</span> <span id="s1307">And we are laying inside.</span> <span id="s1308">And after so much noise a few minutes before, all of a sudden the noise and the cries of the little babies are being all being quiet by the shots of a Nazi gun.</span> <span id="s1309">And we laid there the rest of the morning.</span> <span id="s1310">And the next morning we heard some noise, because there was a room right next to a window.</span> <span id="s1311">And we heard some noise outside and the Nazis did the same thing.</span> <span id="s1312">The order was out.</span> <span id="s1313">They're going to let a certain amount of Jews to leave.</span> <span id="s1314">That time approximately 1,000 Jews were left.</span> <span id="s1315">We jumped out from the hiding places and they gave us three buildings where to live – where the place where we were going to stay.</span> <span id="s1316">The three buildings were in the same place where I lived before and I came back to the place and there I was with this friend.</span> <span id="s1317">His name is Ruby Loren the one who survived with me.</span> <span id="s1318">So, we – all three of us came back to the place in the room to live and half an hour, an hour later, who shows up?</span> <span id="s1319">Lisa shows up.</span> <span id="s1320">She came out from the hiding place and she came to the same room with her father and little brother.</span> <span id="s1321">You can imagine the joy that we found each other and here we are back together and we started our planning how to reach Tadek, get connected to Tadek and go to Wilno.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">06:06:41 I sent out, Lisa was the one to go out to meet Tadek because she was blonde looking.</span> <span id="s1323">She didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1324">She went out, it was not too easy to go out from the ghetto, you go in and out.</span> <span id="s1325">It was plenty hard guarded, but some way she made it.</span> <span id="s1326">She went out and she met Tadek.</span> <span id="s1327">And Lisa's brother, he went out and made a contact with Tadek all account of my address that I had and they made a first arrangement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">06:07:18 Lisa's brother and father went first.</span> <span id="s1329">He took them to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1330">And the same thing on the train, loaded with tanks and ammunition.</span> <span id="s1331">And then came to the time for us and we made arrangements with Tadek to go out, a certain time.</span> <span id="s1332">Lisa made the arrangements.</span> <span id="s1333">She went to him one time and then she went to him a second time and she met him at church, and he told Lisa that, “We are going to meet you on a Tuesday night at seven o’clock at a public washroom.</span> <span id="s1334">Meet me there.”</span> <span id="s1335">We followed his directions.</span> <span id="s1336">We came out on a Tuesday night, but I want to turn back to one thing.</span> <span id="s1337">It's very important.</span> <span id="s1338">We came out Sunday before, and we stayed in a janitor house.</span> <span id="s1339">We were a total of us eight or nine.</span> <span id="s1340">The janitor didn't keep us, so he took us to bombed out house.</span> <span id="s1341">And we stayed – he didn't keep us.</span> <span id="s1342">The idea was to stay in the janitor's house, and from the janitors house we'll make a contact with Tadek and Tadek will take us out one by one to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1343">That didn't work.</span> <span id="s1344">The janitor changed his mind and he forced us to get out of the house.</span> <span id="s1345">They wanted to let us out at 12 o’clock at night.</span> <span id="s1346">He begged us and probably he wasn't safe either.</span> <span id="s1347">So, he kept us until five o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1348">He took us to a bombed out house and there we will stay.</span> <span id="s1349">Lisa, he kept her over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">06:09:25 That's the whole story with Lisa.</span> <span id="s1351">He kept Lisa.</span> <span id="s1352">For me, and the rest of us, we stayed in the bombed out house, and then Lisa came in the evening.</span> <span id="s1353">But that day Lisa made a contact with Tadek, and she came back to the place where we were hiding.</span> <span id="s1354">She knew where it was because when we went to the bombed out house, Lisa went with all of us, with the janitor so in case she'll need us, she'll know where we're hiding.</span> <span id="s1355">But the point that I want to make here is Tadek came and said he cannot take us tonight.</span> <span id="s1356">He may take us a day or two nights later.</span> <span id="s1357">We could not stay one night outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1358">It was more safer for us to go through the wires to go back in the ghetto and the next day to go back out of the ghetto and walk again, then to stay one day hiding in the outside.</span> <span id="s1359">Because the population was so unfriendly and so Antisemitic that if a small little child was throwing a ball fall into the place into the basement and then come home and tell him that Jews are hiding there we would immediately be given out.</span> <span id="s1360">It was safer for us to go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1361">That's what was so impossible for us to survive.</span> <span id="s1362">One day in the ghetto together was much safer than to stay an hour on the outside.</span> <span id="s1363">And we got in touch with Tadek, Lisa got in touch with Tadek.</span> <span id="s1364">The arrangements were made that Tuesday at seven o’clock we're going to meet Tadek in a public washroom.</span> <span id="s1365">For that particular – it was very hard to get out of the ghetto that night.</span> <span id="s1366">We went out, five of us, knowing that he is not going to take the five anyway, but we wanted to make the contact that if we leave maybe the other ones will go.</span> <span id="s1367">So, Ruby Loren and me and Lisa and the other two.</span> <span id="s1368">We all went out and we were waiting at the public washroom.</span> <span id="s1369">Lisa was waiting outside and the arrangement was he was going to come with a certain signal.</span> <span id="s1370">He's going to come and meet us at the washroom and then take us to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1371">Lisa talked to him.</span> <span id="s1372">She told him we are five.</span> <span id="s1373">He said, “It's impossible.</span> <span id="s1374">I cannot take five.</span> <span id="s1375">I can take two.”</span> <span id="s1376">After a real good talk, I walked out after two, he agreed to take three.</span> <span id="s1377">The third one was Ruby.</span> <span id="s1378">And I had a hard time to talk Ruby to go with me because he did not want to go with the two us because a girl is involved too.</span> <span id="s1379">And it's not safe to spend the rest of the time to go anyplace with a woman.</span> <span id="s1380">It's safer to be with two young people, plus he had a cousin over there that if he felt it was safer to go with his cousin.</span> <span id="s1381">I talked him in, and I dragged him at the last minute to go with me.</span> <span id="s1382">Tadek agreed and he took us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1383">The other people they made arrangements to come out two days later.</span> <span id="s1384">Two days later never came, because the ghetto was liquidated.</span> <span id="s1385">They could never make it.</span> <span id="s1386">So, Ruby could never – he would never meet his cousin and his friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">06:13:44 How did Tadek take us?</span> <span id="s1388">We followed Tadek, so Lisa was walking with Tadek, and now we're talking about seven, seven-thirty in the evening.</span> <span id="s1389">We're walking at night, and I look Jewish and Ruby looked Jewish, and every Pole would recognize us, but we kept our caps down.</span> <span id="s1390">It was cold.</span> <span id="s1391">The cold, covered up with a jacket, and we followed to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1392">We came to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1393">He showed us, “Here, one of these trains is going to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1394">Over there is a ditch.</span> <span id="s1395">Lie down in the ditch and I'll go find out with train is going to take us.”</span> <span id="s1396">He came a short while later and was telling us this train is going to go.</span> <span id="s1397">“When this train starts moving, jump on the train.”</span> <span id="s1398">He said, “You jump on the couplers between the two trains and some of them you'll find a small leather where you can climb up on top of the roof, otherwise you'll have to make it on top of the roof.”</span> <span id="s1399">And we followed his directions.</span> <span id="s1400">The train started moving, I jumped out.</span> <span id="s1401">I found the coupler.</span> <span id="s1402">I found the leather, on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1403">Ruby happened to do the same thing.</span> <span id="s1404">Lisa did not do the same way.</span> <span id="s1405">What did she do?</span> <span id="s1406">She panicked.</span> <span id="s1407">She was still sitting by the end in the ditch and waiting for the right boxcar which was going to take her to jumping on top.</span> <span id="s1408">So, apparently she ran out, and there was not too many boxcars left, so she grabbed for the handle where the door in the middle of the boxcar and that little step.</span> <span id="s1409">So she jumped on the step with the handle and the train started moving and she's holding on.</span> <span id="s1410">We don't know anything what happened with her.</span> <span id="s1411">We're on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1412">We are doing our own.</span> <span id="s1413">And the train is already going 15, 20 maybe 30 miles an hour and Tadek comes to us.</span> <span id="s1414">He found us on top of the train and he said, “Where's the girl?”</span> <span id="s1415">I said, “She's probably on the train too.</span> <span id="s1416">She probably comes someplace, somewhere.”</span> <span id="s1417">He left us laying there.</span> <span id="s1418">He went all over the train.</span> <span id="s1419">He jumped one place to another.</span> <span id="s1420">Now, this is March, I think the third or fourth, cold winter day, frost, real cold.</span> <span id="s1421">In Poland, it's a cold winter.</span> <span id="s1422">He is right there, and we are laying on top of the roof.</span> <span id="s1423">He's left us there and he jumped all the way on the train to look for her.</span> <span id="s1424">He found her.</span> <span id="s1425">He came back to us and he told us we have to come to one of the last cars.</span> <span id="s1426">We like him, youth was with us.</span> <span id="s1427">We jumped like he jumped and we came to the roof where Lisa was hanging.</span> <span id="s1428">We made a human chain.</span> <span id="s1429">Tadek bent down.</span> <span id="s1430">He was skinny and light.</span> <span id="s1431">He bent down to be able to reach her.</span> <span id="s1432">I was holding his legs – his feet.</span> <span id="s1433">Ruby was holding me, because it was slippery.</span> <span id="s1434">And we pulled Lisa up on top of the roof, and he gave us, after he gave us a little vodka, he had a little briefcase, he had vodka and bread.</span> <span id="s1435">And that's the way we traveled for 180 kilometers until we came to Wilno.</span> <span id="s1436">We arrived in Wilno.</span> <span id="s1437">He told us before we come to the city to jump before the station.</span> <span id="s1438">We jumped out and we followed him – Tadek – he was going ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">06:18:41 He jumped out before.</span> <span id="s1440">He told us, “You follow me and I'll take you to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1441">You'll see people returning from the night, going to the ghetto, you'll some way get together with them and go into the ghetto.”</span> <span id="s1442">We did the same way.</span> <span id="s1443">The only thing is we put, on our faces, we put on coal.</span> <span id="s1444">Darkened our faces from the heavy day and night shift and walking on the street we saw a group of Jews going to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1445">We joined them together and we were inside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1446">We were in Wilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1447">Wilno ghetto we found the same thing.</span> <span id="s1448">We found the quiet time and we were arrested by the Jewish Judenrat, the Jewish police, and they took us over to their office and they warned us.</span> <span id="s1449">That was Gens and Dessler – Dessler was the one I had a session with him.</span> <span id="s1450">So he warned me.</span> <span id="s1451">He said, “We'll let you stay here in the ghetto, we'll accept you.</span> <span id="s1452">We'll let you keep over there, but we don't you should spread the rumors whatever happened to you.</span> <span id="s1453">We don't want you to panic the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1454">If you panic the ghetto, you'll be punished.”</span> <span id="s1455">Punished could be death.</span> <span id="s1456">He doesn't have to send me to death -- he can send me to death, he doesn't have to kill me, but I knew – we knew what the message was, not to spread the rumor.</span> <span id="s1457">Now, comes a different psychology what in the city was going on.</span> <span id="s1458">Just make little observations what I felt is the ghetto was being in a way being organized by the underground.</span> <span id="s1459">Quite a few youths who were part of the underground in the Wilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1460">The war was going on and the Russians started losing the war already by that time and Gens, the head of the ghetto, had a feeling, a conviction that he might save the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">06:21:33 People approve of that, that's a different case, but that was his thought.</span> <span id="s1462">The front is coming closer and if you don't provoke the Germans to liquidate the ghetto he has a chance to save the Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1463">But at the same time the F.P.O., it means the Fareynegte Partizaner Organisatsye, it means under one umbrella, all the underground, got organized and was two sections in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1464">One was the youth in the underground and one the people want to survive.</span> <span id="s1465">And you have to be one part of them.</span> <span id="s1466">We were interested that time in survival – I mean in going to the underground.</span> <span id="s1467">And now our survival can only go through the underground.</span> <span id="s1468">After a long, long time, I felt it long in our times, ghetto time, is finally we made a contact with the underground in the ghetto through Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, too, and I was working in the ghetto with someone from Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir and in this same time another friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1469">In Wilno we were a group of ten, what they called the Grodno Gruppe, from Grodno, survivors from Grodno.</span> <span id="s1470">So, we were a group of ten.</span> <span id="s1471">We lived together, most of us in one room, and we belonged to the same nucleus of underground.</span> <span id="s1472">So, we got in touch and here we were part of the underground.</span> <span id="s1473">So, that was the first time since Slonim to Grodno being by myself I got another chance.</span> <span id="s1474">I got another opportunity to join the underground.</span> <span id="s1475">And here I joined with the underground and a lot of things were going on in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1476">A lot of people were pro, a lot of people were against it, for the same reason the underground provokes something with the Germans would come and liquidate the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">06:24:19 So, we were very, very secretive and in fact we begged them, we insisted that we want any chance we have to be able to send us to the woods, to the woods.</span> <span id="s1478">And we went to different affairs in the Wilno ghetto.</span> <span id="s1479">There were tremendous – many happenings in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1480">We had the Wittenberg affair, where the Nazis caught the head of the underground organization.</span> <span id="s1481">How they caught him is actually, they didn't catch him, they caught a Polish leader, and he gave out Wittenberg, and then the Nazis came to the ghetto and were demanding to get Wittenberg.</span> <span id="s1482">And Wittenberg was the head of the underground, so it was going on the whole fight, should they give out Wittenberg or not and one night we got an order to meet in a certain spot, in the middle of the night, 12 o’clock, we got an order to meet to defend Wittenberg.</span> <span id="s1483">And here we discovered that the underground is not eight Grodner or 10 Grodner, but the underground is hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s1484">By that time we had three guns.</span> <span id="s1485">Our group was actually 10 so we had three guns.</span> <span id="s1486">How did we get the guns?</span> <span id="s1487">We bought them through somebody and somebody smuggled them in.</span> <span id="s1488">Was very expensive – we had to give up food to be able to buy, to buy the guns, but without the guns we probably wouldn't be accepted to go to the underground.</span> <span id="s1489">Every group had to have a certain amount of spe— guns to be able to go to the underground.</span> <span id="s1490">So, we lived through in the ghetto and going through and finally we convinced them or they were convinced by themselves, because it was going on.</span> <span id="s1491">Should we send men to the woods or should we keep all the people, all the fighters in the ghetto and to defend the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">06:27:32 We were the ones that didn't believe in defending the ghetto, because we thought the most it would do is kill a few Germans, but otherwise we'll all be killed out and nobody will survive.</span> <span id="s1493">Our idea was to go to the woods and fight in the woods.</span> <span id="s1494">They came to the conclusion too, that we couldn't do anything without their conclusion.</span> <span id="s1495">And they decided they are going to send out groups to the woods.</span> <span id="s1496">It was no easy thing to go out to the woods because it was 250, 170 kilometers away and to go to the woods you had to know where to do and this we're proud of our Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s1497">We had two Jewish young fellows where they were in the woods, they were partisans.</span> <span id="s1498">They risked their lives to go back to the ghetto and take out 28 Jews.</span> <span id="s1499">Twenty-eight Jews like me and take them to the underground.</span> <span id="s1500">It took us eight nights, seven nights.</span> <span id="s1501">It took us seven nights to go from Wilno to the woods with two scouts who they knew the way.</span> <span id="s1502">We got lost on the way until we found the road for a whole night instead of going 10, 15 kilometers, we only went a few kilometers.</span> <span id="s1503">We stopped back on the same way, but we made it all the way to the underground and we came there and the leader of our group was Glazman and he by the way, one of the people that I lived together with in Wilno, he left for the underground a couple weeks before and we didn't know.</span> <span id="s1504">But when we came there, he was a Russian young man by the name of Bumky Bojarski and he was a leader in the underground already, in the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">06:30:17 We met him over there on the base not knowing.</span> <span id="s1506">We was surprised to find him and he was surprised to see us, but that's how secretive it was.</span> <span id="s1507">He didn't know anything about us.</span> <span id="s1508">Now, how was life in the underground?</span> <span id="s1509">Well, the minute we came in were very happy days.</span> <span id="s1510">It was quite a few Jews and the idea was to form a Jewish special unit, not be together with all the other nationalities.</span> <span id="s1511">We wanted to be a fighting, strong fighting Jewish unit.</span> <span id="s1512">At the beginning they accepted it when we came, and we thought we had other – we were right with that.</span> <span id="s1513">We thought we had other things in our mind because all of us lost all of our families.</span> <span id="s1514">The only thing, we all had one thing in common, is not survival, I mean survival was secondary, but revenge was – fighting the revenge was our main purpose.</span> <span id="s1515">Because everybody feel the same way.</span> <span id="s1516">If you'll survive, what's the big deal?</span> <span id="s1517">Nobody's around.</span> <span id="s1518">Everybody's gone.</span> <span id="s1519">So, anytime when the commanders used to come in and ask for volunteers to do all kinds of missions, we were the first ones, and we were good at it because like the rest of them in the underground with us, were Russian prisoners, some Poles and some farmers.</span> <span id="s1520">The farmers were forced to join the underground.</span> <span id="s1521">The Russian prisoners was part of their life to survive.</span> <span id="s1522">They went to fight a war that families left, so for them I don't say they wasn't good fighters.</span> <span id="s1523">They didn't have the motives what we had.</span> <span id="s1524">For us, we were young men and women and we had the gall.</span> <span id="s1525">For us to be in the underground was to fight and do as much damage, to kill Germans do damage the most we can.</span> <span id="s1526">But Antisemitism was just there.</span> <span id="s1527">They learned as fast from the Nazis or from the Poles before, or it was there inside for them it was natural to be Antisemitic, so they started making fun of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">06:33:56 And the women they thought belonged only in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1529">“They don't belong over there.</span> <span id="s1530">They don't belong fighting.</span> <span id="s1531">What does women fighters have to do?”</span> <span id="s1532">And the man was the same thing.</span> <span id="s1533">“What is a Jew?</span> <span id="s1534">A Jew doesn't even know how to keep a rifle – how to fight with a rifle.”</span> <span id="s1535">So, we had Antisemitism was pretty strong and we had incidents where Antisemitism was almost like in the ghetto because in the certain time….</span> <span id="s1536">Now what was our work to be done?</span> <span id="s1537">Our mission was, the first thing was to blockade the roads coming to our base.</span> <span id="s1538">That's where you want security.</span> <span id="s1539">So, we blocked all the roads coming to us.</span> <span id="s1540">We cut down the trees because we were in the woods.</span> <span id="s1541">We cut down the trees on the roads and we dynamite them so they could not come into our base.</span> <span id="s1542">Now, the underground was already developing pretty strong.</span> <span id="s1543">It was numbers, bigger numbers.</span> <span id="s1544">And I'm talking all underground, not only the Jewish underground, as in general.</span> <span id="s1545">I'll come back to the Jewish underground.</span> <span id="s1546">So, the area became already quite a few partisans, were in the whole area and we cut down the telephone lines.</span> <span id="s1547">We cut down the bridges.</span> <span id="s1548">We cut down – wherever we could do is blow up their railroads.</span> <span id="s1549">In many instances we blew up trains.</span> <span id="s1550">Now, if I took part in it, I took part in it directly and indirectly.</span> <span id="s1551">But I wasn't a hero but I was part of the underground.</span> <span id="s1552">I was active as anybody could be.</span> <span id="s1553">Now, with the Jewish underground, the Jewish otriad, more groups were coming in from Wilno.</span> <span id="s1554">One after the others, and then they decided to disband the Jewish separate unit.</span> <span id="s1555">So, they left only a smaller amount of Jews to be together, take them in their units and then a larger group, maybe half, they put them in a different camp.</span> <span id="s1556">They made a camp for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">06:37:16 They called it proizvodstvennaya gruppa.</span> <span id="s1558">That means a camp productive.</span> <span id="s1559">They are going to produce.</span> <span id="s1560">They are going to work for the other partisans.</span> <span id="s1561">So, they took all different kinds of – they were – or they made tradesmen out of them.</span> <span id="s1562">It was shoemakers, tailors, mainly bakers, a bakery to bake food.</span> <span id="s1563">They used to bring in the flour and bake food for the partisans.</span> <span id="s1564">So, they made them lower, on the same level or they would put him back on the same system, “You are lower class you're not good enough.”</span> <span id="s1565">And this was one of the best cream of our youth and they put him down to that kind of level.</span> <span id="s1566">But some of them, but in fact most of them didn't stay there too long.</span> <span id="s1567">They some way went out and they found in different otriad – in different companies special groups where they joined so they were still able to go in and fight.</span> <span id="s1568">And they didn't take him in, in our group.</span> <span id="s1569">And this way was happening up until a couple months later we had an oblava.</span> <span id="s1570">It means the Germans came to comb the woods.</span> <span id="s1571">Before they send the Germans to the front line, they gave him the test to comb the woods.</span> <span id="s1572">And that was a time when we lost a lot of people because there was no place you could survive or hide.</span> <span id="s1573">They came in with the force so the only thing you had to run away and hide in some places.</span> <span id="s1574">So, this particular time I was chosen with Lisa, I was chosen to be guards to the staff.</span> <span id="s1575">The staff for our otriad.</span> <span id="s1576">Otriad, is what do you call them, a big company.</span> <span id="s1577">The name, by the way, where we were was Kalininsky Otriad.</span> <span id="s1578">That was the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">06:40:03 And the staff decided, they found out the night before that oblava, is going to comb the woods.</span> <span id="s1580">But this incident I have to mention it, it was the same thing like in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1581">The night before, the staff, we lived in bunkers, so they opened up one bunker and every Jew had to come in the bunker and they searched us.</span> <span id="s1582">If anything that we had which we brought from the ghetto, somebody had a watch, a golden watch, somebody had other things, I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1583">Somebody had good shoes or good boots, they took away a good pair of boots, from me, I didn't have a good pair of boots, but they would take a good pair of boots from me and give it to theirs, and leave maybe an old pair of torn boots or no boots.</span> <span id="s1584">And the same thing is take away everything from you and send you out.</span> <span id="s1585">And that reminds me of the same selection that I went through in the ghettos before.</span> <span id="s1586">And the next morning they took the staff went and they took about 10 people with them, and I and Lisa were part of the 10.</span> <span id="s1587">Our job was to protect them during the night when they go to sleep.</span> <span id="s1588">They put guards all the way around.</span> <span id="s1589">But this way we had opportunity to go with them.</span> <span id="s1590">We went with them through the night, and then they felt danger.</span> <span id="s1591">They released us.</span> <span id="s1592">They went on the farm.</span> <span id="s1593">They changed their clothes like farmers and we were left alone.</span> <span id="s1594">And we went on a small little island.</span> <span id="s1595">By luck we survived there.</span> <span id="s1596">It was not anything special, but we survived on this particular place, on an island.</span> <span id="s1597">And then after that, we came back on the base, this oblava search was going on five, six days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">06:42:54 We came back on the base.</span> <span id="s1599">We lost another 20 percent of our good people and they took not everybody back in, being an active fighter, they took me back.</span> <span id="s1600">They took Lisa back and Lisa was very well accepted, so she had less problems than somebody else.</span> <span id="s1601">This way we were in the underground.</span> <span id="s1602">What we did, we had to fight, we had to attack some garrisons with other partisans, with other groups.</span> <span id="s1603">But that was our life in the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: So, you had arms?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: So, you went out and fought?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yes, we had arms.</span> <span id="s1608">Even in the beginning we had very little arms, but then in months later, we had an aerodrome, what we made.</span> <span id="s1609">We cut out a big field where the Russians used to come in the middle of the night, and we used to put up four fires in different parts and they used to drop ammunition.</span> <span id="s1610">And it didn't take too long that we had enough arms.</span> <span id="s1611">So, they had known from the beginning their excuse for the Jews not to take them in because we didn't have any arms.</span> <span id="s1612">Later on, there was no excuse.</span> <span id="s1613">We had plenty of arms.</span> <span id="s1614">There was no shortage of arms.</span> <span id="s1615">It was already so organized that we had planes landed and take out wounded and take them to Moscow.</span> <span id="s1616">So, it was real, real organized.</span> <span id="s1617">It helped to break the back of the German army, because not only with us, but then it was going on for maybe I think the figures are, there was more than 1,000,000 partisans, right?</span> <span id="s1618">I'm not talking about our area, I'm talking as a whole Russia and all over.</span> <span id="s1619">It was tremendous, big power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">06:45:34</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: What about food?</span> <span id="s1622">How did you get food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Food was no big problem.</span> <span id="s1624">When we were in the woods with the partisans we were almost like the king of the woods.</span> <span id="s1625">The king of the area.</span> <span id="s1626">We used to go in the farm come in with a gun at night and if they had food, we got their food.</span> <span id="s1627">So, food was no problem.</span> <span id="s1628">But it was friendly farmers and unfriendly farmers, so we had to go farther away where it was unfriendly farmers.</span> <span id="s1629">One more thing that I want to mention is our job what we did.</span> <span id="s1630">I think it was very important in our vicinity, we had Jews, singles and even some of them were families.</span> <span id="s1631">But they run away from massacres and they were on the periphery of the woods.</span> <span id="s1632">Some of them hiding in farms, some of them living in the woods.</span> <span id="s1633">When we discovered them, we took some of them, we took out from the woods and we put them in the farms and the farmer knew, “You have to keep him, you have to protect him.</span> <span id="s1634">If not, if we come and…,” he knew, that was a language he understood.</span> <span id="s1635">You didn't have to tell him that.</span> <span id="s1636">“You have to keep him safe.</span> <span id="s1637">If we come to your farm and we don't find the people, your farm is going to be burned, all your cow and your horse” – that was his main possession – “would be killed or taken away.”</span> <span id="s1638">The message was clear.</span> <span id="s1639">“You have to protect them.</span> <span id="s1640">You have to hold them.”</span> <span id="s1641">They all survived.</span> <span id="s1642">Anybody when we got in touch with them, and we felt very good about it that we could help.</span> <span id="s1643">We had families living that we helped to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: And the other partisans, non-Jewish partisans didn't prevent you from doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: They didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: What about some of the leaders of your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Some of the leaders, we had leaders from the beginning we had leaders that they dropped them by air, by parachutes.</span> <span id="s1648">So, they were Russians.</span> <span id="s1649">Some of our leader was Glazman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">06:49:05 He was the leader from the F.P.O.</span> <span id="s1651">He was killed for only one reason.</span> <span id="s1652">He didn't like what the Russians are doing with the Jews in our partisans.</span> <span id="s1653">He was the head of our Jewish otriad, and after they took away all the power from us, he was terrible disgusted.</span> <span id="s1654">So, he decided he's not going to stay here.</span> <span id="s1655">He is from Wilno ghetto to send Rudnisky, that's another wooden area where they send some of the partisans went to Naroch, that's where we were, and some went to Rudnisky forest, they called it pushcha.</span> <span id="s1656">So, he decided he's going to take a group and he's going to leave us.</span> <span id="s1657">We were part already of the Russians anyway.</span> <span id="s1658">There was no Jewish leadership.</span> <span id="s1659">They took away the Jewish leadership.</span> <span id="s1660">So, he felt he wanted to go to the other side, to the other group and on the way, he was killed with the group.</span> <span id="s1661">Only one young girl survived and she came back and told us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: What did you think about the Russian partisans?</span> <span id="s1663">I mean, how do you feel in the end about the whole – ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: We were very, very disappointed for not having our own unit we were blocked with many things to do.</span> <span id="s1665">So, in kind of a way you lost your quest to fight your own way, but we did it in the same way because our purpose was to fill out what we were going for it, but it took away the – how do you explain it, the morale.</span> <span id="s1666">It didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s1667">But in the same way, I would have to say that not every Russian was the same.</span> <span id="s1668">We had friends in the Russian who were just as us and we were friendly and brotherly the same way like anybody else.</span> <span id="s1669">So, it's not a question – we had bad experience with different type of groups, but we had good people, we had nice people with them all over like the same thing like we met at Polish Tadek.</span> <span id="s1670">The same thing we had Russians that were – in fact by myself the Russian people are a nice people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">06:52:23</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Why did Tadek do what he did, do you think?</span> <span id="s1673">Or did you ever find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Well, why he did is that's what he told us a few times.</span> <span id="s1675">You know Tadek?</span> <span id="s1676">We brought Tadek to America and we are still in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1677">He went to schools and talked to schools and he belonged to a Catholic school, the Nuns of Nazareth.</span> <span id="s1678">And he kind of believed he says – and they asked him the question, and he says “What else could I do?</span> <span id="s1679">If I see a person I can save especially I had friends that I played with them before the war,” it wasn't particularly us.</span> <span id="s1680">He said, “They were nice people and if I can help him why shouldn't I?”</span> <span id="s1681">He feels “I'm not a hero.</span> <span id="s1682">I didn't do anything special.</span> <span id="s1683">I did what I felt a person should do,” and what he does he blames, “If I could only point my finger it’s to the people the ones that did not help.”</span> <span id="s1684">In Yad Vashem he was speaking he say, “I accuse the people the ones who could help and did not help.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: We have a little tiny bit of time left.</span> <span id="s1686">After it all ended you went back and what did you find and were there any pogroms after – ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yes, after liberation came for us in 1944, the Russians liberated us in time of liberation we lost three of my best friends.</span> <span id="s1688">On the day of liberation we got an order to collect German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1689">We were caught out in the woods with a group of well trained army officers, because they were army officers and they – with them, too a couple plain soldiers, but the rest of them were well armed from the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">06:55:11 They were already home.</span> <span id="s1691">So, we got the order to catch them in the woods.</span> <span id="s1692">And we followed them and we put a couple ambushes under them, so we killed quite a few of them.</span> <span id="s1693">That's what we know where they were and was wounded.</span> <span id="s1694">By the end when it came evening, they were well trained, they put ambush on us in a house in the woods and they killed Lutek, Lazer and Benchke.</span> <span id="s1695">Three of my best friends were killed already we were liberated.</span> <span id="s1696">From there I made my business to go back to Slonim after liberation.</span> <span id="s1697">I went back to Slonim and in Slonim I found a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1698">Nobody was left out of the 20,000 I could only find two or three Jews were there.</span> <span id="s1699">For some reason they came to check, to find.</span> <span id="s1700">Nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1701">I had a woman, I mean a neighbor, a Tatar – Muslim and she was very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1702">My father helped her all his life.</span> <span id="s1703">In time of the war we helped her, too, I mean before the war.</span> <span id="s1704">And she's supposed to help us in time in the war.</span> <span id="s1705">She did not.</span> <span id="s1706">We left some clothes in her house.</span> <span id="s1707">We thought maybe it's the place if we need we'll come and take some clothes and then trade it for food.</span> <span id="s1708">She did not give us in time when now we needed it and now, when we came after the war, she was very unfriendly.</span> <span id="s1709">I'm talking here about a person what her father and her family lived with my family for one hundred years, probably for many, many years.</span> <span id="s1710">So, anyway, I could feel it's like a cemetery.</span> <span id="s1711">I didn't stay there long.</span> <span id="s1712">I stayed only one night and one day.</span> <span id="s1713">From there I went to Poland.</span> <span id="s1714">From Poland, well Poland, I mean that was White Russian, in Poland, it's in the same area but then it's an established part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">06:58:11 I went back to Bialystok, and in Bialystok I got connected to the B’richa.</span> <span id="s1716">B’richa it was organization which was sent out from Palestine, that time, it was not Israel yet, so they send out Jewish young men and women to save survivors.</span> <span id="s1717">So, we got in touch with them and from Bialystok we went to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1718">From Lublin we got directed to the B’richa to go try to go past, to the West.</span> <span id="s1719">So, they arranged for us papers from the Red Cross that we are Greeks and we are returning home and this way we could make the voyage from Lublin to Czechoslovakia, to the border of Poland and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1720">So, we followed an underground railroad to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1721">We went to Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, From Bratislava went to Budapest, all with the help of the B’richa, with the Jewish issue of Jewish organization from Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">06:59:59</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">07:00:21 End of Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Tape 5</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: In Slonim I was only for one day and then I went to Bialystok and in Bialystok I got connected to the B’richa and the B’richa was an organization they one they sent out young men and women to collect survivors and then help them to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1727">From there we got directed to go to Lublin.</span> <span id="s1728">In Lublin we got our Red Cross documents.</span> <span id="s1729">What they helped us to get it, that we are Greeks.</span> <span id="s1730">It means Greeks are returning back from the War.</span> <span id="s1731">They are returning back to Greece and this way was on the way we could go in the direction to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1732">In Czechoslovakia we came to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1733">From Bratislava we went to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1734">And Budapest we found right after the war what was going on they had fighting going on between Buda and Pest.</span> <span id="s1735">From Budapest with the help with the same thing the B’richa; we went to Graz, Austria.</span> <span id="s1736">From Graz, Austria we went across the border.</span> <span id="s1737">We had to cross the border to the west.</span> <span id="s1738">And that was the place we had to go to the Alps.</span> <span id="s1739">And with the help with the B’richa, the same way, we crossed the part of the Alps and we came to Tarvisio, Italy.</span> <span id="s1740">Tarvisio, Italy, we too, were immediately helped by the Jewish Brigade.</span> <span id="s1741">The Jewish Brigade was part of Jewish volunteers from Palestine in the English army.</span> <span id="s1742">So, the Jewish Brigade helped us in Italy, and they took us with trucks to Bologna, from Bologna to Florence, from Florence we stayed about six weeks.</span> <span id="s1743">We lived in Florence and with the help of UNRRA we were supporting ourselves.</span> <span id="s1744">With their help, we got food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">07:05:00 And there from Florence we went to Rome.</span> <span id="s1746">In Rome, Lisa got in touch with her she has a grandmother and uncles and I had aunts and uncles and we got in touch with America.</span> <span id="s1747">And our purpose at that time to go to Palestine, by that time the road to Palestine was blocked.</span> <span id="s1748">You couldn't break the blockade.</span> <span id="s1749">You could only go to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s1750">And we figured maybe we'll take a chance we'll go instead of staying in Cyprus, we'll go to America for a year and then go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1751">But that didn't materialize.</span> <span id="s1752">In Rome, I got married, I got married to Lisa in the big synagogue in Rome and we came to the shores of America in 1947.</span> <span id="s1753">March 27th, we got married, but I don't remember exactly a date in April we came to America, and we settled in the city of Chicago.</span> <span id="s1754">There we have three sons and one is Howard, Gordon and Daniel.</span> <span id="s1755">Now they are all three medical men.</span> <span id="s1756">They’re all doctors.</span> <span id="s1757">And one even married a doctor.</span> <span id="s1758">And they are all three married, and we are very proud, to Jewish women, and we have eight grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1759">I would like to mention their names fast of them.</span> <span id="s1760">One is Courtney, Lindsey, Ari, and Evan, Rachel, Benji, and Yelly.</span> <span id="s1761">Do I have all eight?</span> <span id="s1762">I don't know, I don't want to miss any one.</span> <span id="s1763">Maybe I didn't do it in order, but it’s close.</span> <span id="s1764">That's it.</span> <span id="s1765">So far, I'm retired and trying to spend as much time we have to talk about the Holocaust to tell our story to teach what we went through in the Holocaust and the main purpose it shouldn't happen again, to remember and it shouldn't happen again.</span> <span id="s1766">So, we are trying – the only thing through education these people will be more moral, these kinds of things won't happen again.</span> <span id="s1767">Not only to Jews, we hope it doesn't happen to any people in this world.</span> <span id="s1768">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Thank you</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">07:08:55</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Conclusion of interview A Zionist program
