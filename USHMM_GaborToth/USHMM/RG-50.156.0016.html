Goodman.</span> <span id="s5">Edith, do you want to tell me what your full name was when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Edith Fuhrmann Brandmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: And where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: I was born in a little town in Romania.</span> <span id="s9">It was called Krischatik and it was right on the border with Poland.</span> <span id="s10">The river Dnestr divided Krischatik from a bigger town in Poland, Zalischik.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: So then you were born in Romania.</span> <span id="s12">And how long did you live there?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: In that little town, I was born in 1931, and till 1941 I was in that little town.</span> <span id="s14">I stayed there until we were deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: What kind of business, or what was your father’s profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: My father was a landowner.</span> <span id="s17">They had a big ranch and they also had a grocery store.</span> <span id="s18">That was my mother’s hobby -- the grocery store.</span> <span id="s19">We had land.</span> <span id="s20">And right across the street from us was a big beet sugar factory.</span> <span id="s21">And we used to grow white sugar beets.</span> <span id="s22">Also we had lots of cattle, because they fed it what was left from the end (after the) sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Were your grandparents or your parents from Romania, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: And what about your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Well only my grandmother on my mother’s side lived about a mile away from us with her other daughter and her family.</span> <span id="s27">And my grandfather on my father’s side lived in a bigger city, in Chadnovig.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What were your grandparents’ names?</span> <span id="s29">On your mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: On my mother’s side was Rachel-Rocholeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And her last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Wolf.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: And what about your grandparents on your father’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My father’s was Ephraim Fuhrmann.</span> <span id="s35">And because he was not legally married to his wife -- was just with a Jewish ceremony --that’s why my father had the name of Brandmann.</span> <span id="s36">And so there were two names.</span> <span id="s37">And in school I was called Brandmann, but everybody knew us as Fuhrmann.</span> <span id="s38">The older people they didn’t get married in city hall --just with the rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: But you see, now that’s interesting, because next month, in December, they’re going to do a Jewish ceremony for the Russians because all they ever had was a civil ceremony.</span> <span id="s40">And I think that to be legally married, as a Jew, you have to have a Jewish wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: When you lived at home, what languages did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: We spoke Yiddish and German.</span> <span id="s44">And we had a Ukrainian maid, and I spoke Ukrainian with the maid.</span> <span id="s45">And Romanian I started to speak only when I started school.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s47">You know I said my mother came from Romania, and a lot of what I’ve learned about Europe came from her -- and how they lived.</span> <span id="s48">And she came over when she was just a young child, so she doesn’t remember all that much, but her mother used to tell her.</span> <span id="s49">Did you have a religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes, it was a traditional home, because everybody lived that way.</span> <span id="s51">Everybody kept kosher.</span> <span id="s52">Nobody rode on Shabbos because nobody had cars, but it was a traditional home.</span> <span id="s53">My father put on tallis and tefillin every morning .</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Was there a synagogue or a temple or a shul?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s56">We built a synagogue.</span> <span id="s57">As a small child -- I was just reminiscing this year -- we built a synagogue that my father donated the land for it.</span> <span id="s58">And it was right there in our back yard.</span> <span id="s59">There was no rabbi.</span> <span id="s60">They used to come a shochet from another little town, very nice synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Were there quite a few people who came in then for services, like on Shabbat?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A; Yes.</span> <span id="s63">There were about ten or fifteen Jewish families.</span> <span id="s64">Then there were also Jewish people that used to come occasionally to that sugar beet factory when it was in session, when it was working in the fall.</span> <span id="s65">In the summertime it was closed, but in the fall, when the sugar beets would come in…</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: You had to produce the sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">And then they used to bring in Jewish people that did not live there all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Was there any Zionist movement at that time there, or did your father feel anything about Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s71">I can remember that there was a doctor in our little town and it must have been before the Russians came, ’38, 39, and he decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s72">He kept on telling my father that he should give up everything -- things in the world are not good --and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s73">And my father said, “How can I leave everything!”</span> <span id="s74">I mean he built everything what we had up from his own two hands.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: When you were in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: When I was in Paris this last summer, my father was just remembering that when they came to Israel the first time, they met the wife of the doctor that left for Israel, on the beach in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s77">Her husband had died, but she was still in Israel, and that’s how we came to talk again about how he wanted to convince my father to go to Palestine that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Tell me, how many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I have a sister and a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Where are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: My sister lives in Israel -- in Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What is her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Martha Sternberg.</span> <span id="s84">And my brother Jacob lives in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: And his name is Jacob Fuhrmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Fuhrmann.</span> <span id="s87">He dropped the Brandmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Whereabouts in Paris does he live?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: They lived in the 19 Calendismound.</span> <span id="s90">It’s a middle class area.</span> <span id="s91">It’s not far from downtown.</span> <span id="s92">They have a beautiful park nearby and…</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Is that near the Rothschild synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No.</span> <span id="s95">It’s near the Rothschild hospital.</span> <span id="s96">They have a day school right nearby -- the Baron de Hirsch day school, and also the synagogue there where my niece attended.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You go to see them occasionally?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: I go twice a year since my mother has been sick.</span> <span id="s99">She had a stroke five years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Your father’s still living?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And they live in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: In Paris, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: When did they come to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: In 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s107">Let’s go back a little bit, because you mentioned that the doctor said that things weren’t good in the world, and your father should give up what he was doing and leave.</span> <span id="s108">When did your father or family first feel that there was something really wrong that was going to happen to the Jewish people in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Well, it started actually in 1940 when our area, the Bukovina, was occupied by the Russians.</span> <span id="s110">In 1939, I remember as a child, there were the first bombs that I ever heard, when there was the war between Russia and Poland and Germany.</span> <span id="s111">They wanted to bomb the bridges that the people were running away from Poland, and the bombs fell in our little town and about six or eight people got killed.</span> <span id="s112">That was my first recollection.</span> <span id="s113">And then the Russians occupied Zelishaket, the town across from where we lived.</span> <span id="s114">And then in 1940, one Friday morning, I remember waking up at my grandmother’s house to find out that we were occupied by the Russians.</span> <span id="s115">And that’s when it really started.</span> <span id="s116">They occupied Thursday night, and Friday, and on Saturday a group of officers and soldiers came to our house and my parents fed them, gave them challah and milk, served them food.</span> <span id="s117">And there was one Jewish officer that told my father, ‘You should leave this -- everything -- and go away to a bigger city.</span> <span id="s118">Don’t stay here, because things won’t be good.”</span> <span id="s119">And again my father said, how can he leave the material things?</span> <span id="s120">And it was so true, because later on they started to deport the people that had some possessions to Siberia.</span> <span id="s121">And the war broke out and that was the reason why we were not deported.</span> <span id="s122">My parents were really happy to see the Romanians come back, because the same officers, the same people came back in 1941 that they left when the Russians occupied us in ’40, and now they thought that life will go on as before.</span> <span id="s123">But when my mother told one officer -- one official -- that they were so happy to see them back, he said, “Yeah, but we are not the same.”</span> <span id="s124">And that’s when we really saw that things are not good.</span> <span id="s125">They started to gather up the Jewish families and…they really didn’t know what to do with us…</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: How did your father decide what he was going to do?</span> <span id="s127">What made him change?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: He didn’t!</span> <span id="s129">it was decided for us.</span> <span id="s130">They just came one morning and told us they are taking us away to work on a farm -- on a big farm.</span> <span id="s131">I think he used to be the owner also of the sugar beet factory.</span> <span id="s132">And they said we were going to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Was this in Romania that you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s135">In Romania.</span> <span id="s136">I don’t know how many miles away.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You all went as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A; We all went -- all the Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Could you take anything with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: We took along the necessary possessions -- no furniture, but the pillows and clothes, and some pots and pans.</span> <span id="s141">And we got there.</span> <span id="s142">I remember that day.</span> <span id="s143">I cried.</span> <span id="s144">(Starts to cry.)</span> <span id="s145">I was a child.</span> <span id="s146">I left home and never went back.</span> <span id="s147">We came there, and we thought we were going to be there.</span> <span id="s148">But Saturday they gathered us up and we have to leave.</span> <span id="s149">They gathered us together and we have to leave and, “Where are you taking us?”</span> <span id="s150">And they said, “We don’t know.”</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: The Romanians.</span> <span id="s153">The Romanian gendarme.</span> <span id="s154">And we were lucky because my father was nice once to the official, to that officer.</span> <span id="s155">When he first came to our district, (crying again), my father loaned him some money that he never returned.</span> <span id="s156">And that time, my mother walked up to this man, and she says, “You know?</span> <span id="s157">We were so nice to you and you promised you were going to help us.</span> <span id="s158">And look what you are doing to us.”</span> <span id="s159">He said, “Well, there’s nothing I can do.”</span> <span id="s160">And the whole community -- and there was another community of Jewish people -- was assembled there.</span> <span id="s161">Just without anything!</span> <span id="s162">Whatever we took already from home to that farmhouse, we couldn’t take along even that.</span> <span id="s163">So he said, “Well, there’s nothing I can do.”</span> <span id="s164">And as we were standing there, they were counting out names.</span> <span id="s165">All of a sudden he counted out our name and three other families’ name, my parents and the children, and he said, “You’re going to stay here and work.</span> <span id="s166">All the rest of them leave.”</span> <span id="s167">And naturally there was a big commotion.</span> <span id="s168">Everybody got really desperate.</span> <span id="s169">And the other people left, and then he said, “You leave here.”</span> <span id="s170">My father said, “Where shall I go?’</span> <span id="s171">He says, “I don’t care.</span> <span id="s172">You go.”</span> <span id="s173">Because my father was always a very generous person, because of that he was known, and he knew some peasant, and he got a horse and wagon and we loaded up all the families and went away to a bigger town where the Jews were still at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You remember the name of that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Sistagna.</span> <span id="s176">Yeah.</span> <span id="s177">I remember.</span> <span id="s178">And we got there, and the Jews were very nice to us, and they took us in, but then it wasn’t legal to take us in, and then they put us in a school, and they said, “Well, we’re going to do something so that you should remain here.”</span> <span id="s179">When we started to get settled in, that Romanian officer that told us that we can leave, came there and told us in a completely changed voice, he says, “You ran away!”</span> <span id="s180">And he gathered us all up and took us back and we didn’t know where!</span> <span id="s181">And we didn’t know what happened to the other people!</span> <span id="s182">And about a week must have gone by -- I remember the Sabbath -- and it happened to be again a Saturday night -- when he took us away from this big city and he took us to a border town with Poland, a small village.</span> <span id="s183">And we came there and they searched the family and the few possessions that we had -- the whole night!</span> <span id="s184">We still didn’t know what was going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s185">And in the morning they gathered us up and they said, “Come, you’re going to go across the border!”</span> <span id="s186">And when they were bringing us -- I was a child, ten years old, but I can still remember this -- they showed us.</span> <span id="s187">“See?</span> <span id="s188">You go there, but you can never turn back your head!</span> <span id="s189">Because if you turn back, we have to shoot!”</span> <span id="s190">And what happened, usually we found this out there -- usually there was the Polish militia on the other side, wouldn’t let the people come in, and they wouldn’t let the people come back, and they started to shoot, and this is how they killed the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s191">And this is how my mother’s sister and her family was killed.</span> <span id="s192">They showed us, “See?</span> <span id="s193">This is a fresh grave.</span> <span id="s194">If you’re going to as much as turn back the heads, this is what is going to happen.”</span> <span id="s195">That was a family of ten people, that my father happened to have known.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: You were saying that you couldn’t look back, so how did you proceed then?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Well, again, it was just luck.</span> <span id="s198">And God was good to us.</span> <span id="s199">Because it was a Saturday night -- the ones that were watching the borders, the guards -- they were drinking all night.</span> <span id="s200">And instead of taking us to the border like at two or three o’clock at night, they took us -- it was already daylight.</span> <span id="s201">The Polish militia was waiting a whole night.</span> <span id="s202">They saw nobody came, so they went home.</span> <span id="s203">So that was our luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: You got in without them being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: We got in a small town called Stetsova.</span> <span id="s206">My grandmother was with us.</span> <span id="s207">She had a brother-in-law there – her sister had died and she thought she’s going to go look for her brother-in-law -- but they were not there anymore.</span> <span id="s208">We came into the village and the militia got wind that we are there so they came and they wanted to take us back.</span> <span id="s209">And we knew if they were going to take us back to that border, we were not going to be alive.</span> <span id="s210">We ended up being about 27 people in our group, or thirty people, because another group from the one Saturday evening that we were separated from, they told that officer that let us go, they were threatening him, “Look, you let them go and we want to stay here too!”</span> <span id="s211">And that’s why he came after us.</span> <span id="s212">Because he was afraid that these people are going to tell on him.</span> <span id="s213">And when they brought us together with this group, my father told these militias, “If you have a right to shoot us, shoot us.</span> <span id="s214">Kill us here, but we’re not going back.”</span> <span id="s215">And I remember, I was being teased, all the years I was growing up, by one man, how I said to my father, “Give them everything.</span> <span id="s216">I want to live.’</span> <span id="s217">It was a very confused time.</span> <span id="s218">One town was occupied by Romanian, one town was occupied by Hungarian, one was by German.</span> <span id="s219">When we came in, the Polish militia wanted to take us back, but we were lucky.</span> <span id="s220">The next town was occupied by Hungarian soldiers, and there were two ladies in our group that spoke Hungarian and somehow that Hungarian patrol, they came and they saw us there, and they ordered the Polish militia to bring us to the town where they occupied.</span> <span id="s221">And we walked.</span> <span id="s222">Again, I don’t know the distances, but we walked a good day.</span> <span id="s223">It was a very hot July day, and we had little knapsacks of two dresses and something, and I remember my sister bending down.</span> <span id="s224">There was a little water on the road -- she was thirsty -- and she just bent down and she drank it, because there was nothing else.</span> <span id="s225">There was one nice man that saw what was happening -- Polish man -- and he saddled his horses and wagon and came after us, and he loaded up the kids and he drove us into town.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: He wasn’t part of the militia.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No.</span> <span id="s228">He was just a peasant.</span> <span id="s229">A citizen of that little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: So then you went to this town that was occupied by the Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: And the Jews were still at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: What was the name of that town?</span> <span id="s233">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Snitin.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Also in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Also in Poland.</span> <span id="s237">That was Galicia, and Galicia and Bukovina -- that was Austria once, and my father knew people from there.</span> <span id="s238">And the Jewish people there took us in and they fed us and they were really just wonderful to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Weren’t they worried about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Nothing was happening yet there.</span> <span id="s241">And we were pleading with the authorities to let us stay there, but the Hungarians said, “No.</span> <span id="s242">You have to go back to Romania.’</span> <span id="s243">And we were afraid what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s244">He said, ‘No.</span> <span id="s245">We’re going to send you back legally and nothing’s going to happen to you.”</span> <span id="s246">So we had no way out and we went back to Romania.</span> <span id="s247">Unfortunately there were very few survivors of that little town, Snitin -- they were deported to the extermination camps later on…if we would have stayed there…</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Who knows what would have happened.</span> <span id="s249">So you went back to Romania.</span> <span id="s250">How long did you stay in that little town, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s252">Must have been a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And then you went back to Romania.</span> <span id="s254">How did you go back?</span> <span id="s255">Who took you?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Also by horse and wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Did the militia go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span> <span id="s259">They gave us papers.</span> <span id="s260">They just took us to the border --the Hungarian patrol.</span> <span id="s261">And there were the Romanians, and they said this was very illegal.</span> <span id="s262">We were Romanian citizens.</span> <span id="s263">And then they sent us from one camp to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: They already had camps in Romania then.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s266">Not very well organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Were these just for Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Just Jewish people.</span> <span id="s269">They took us to a little town that also had a sugar beet factory, Luzah.</span> <span id="s270">And they put us in a school building there.</span> <span id="s271">And then from there they took us someplace else, and the whole summer, in 1941, we were driven from one place to another through Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s272">And when we were already coming through the villages, through the little towns in Bessarabia, the Jews were already gone.</span> <span id="s273">Many of them fled with the Russians -- when the Russians went back, when they went through --and many were killed.</span> <span id="s274">We ended up -- might have been August or the beginning of September --in a little town, Edintz, in Bessarabia.</span> <span id="s275">It was a very well known Jewish community, but we did not find any Jews at all.</span> <span id="s276">It must have still been warm, because they put 3,000 Jewish people in an empty field, just under the sky, just to sleep on the straw.</span> <span id="s277">And my mother and her cousin used to sneak out from the camp -- it wasn’t electrified wire, it was just barbed wire -- and steal a few potatoes and make a soup.</span> <span id="s278">That’s what we used to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: They didn’t provide any food for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did a lot of people die of starvation?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: A lot of people died.</span> <span id="s283">My father made acquaintance with a baker, and he used to take bread from him, and we used to sell it, and we used to earn a bread for us.</span> <span id="s284">Was very good bread!</span> <span id="s285">(laughter) I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: The baker was in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No.</span> <span id="s288">it must have been in the little town, because they used to sneak out from the barbed wire, my father and my mother and her cousin.</span> <span id="s289">And I remember then bringing the potatoes and cooking them on straw, whatever.</span> <span id="s290">And then, when it started getting colder, they let us go and occupy the Jewish homes that were empty.</span> <span id="s291">My mother got sick and my sister got swollen legs and we were really down and out, and (laughter) whenever we were down and out, some miracle happened.</span> <span id="s292">My father happened to be walking and saw somebody that he knew from before that was sort of friendly with the Romanian authorities.</span> <span id="s293">His name was Heisner, and I happen to know a nephew of his that lives in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s294">And my father said to him, “Could you give me some money?”</span> <span id="s295">And he gave my father 500 lei, because my father’s brother was still at home in Chernovitz and he said, “I’ll get the money from your brother.’</span> <span id="s296">And that really saved our life another time, because then right away we could buy food.</span> <span id="s297">Then he happened to come back, and my uncle had sent us money.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: You were in contact with your family, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: We were not, but this fellow just saw us, and he went back and he told them.</span> <span id="s300">And my father’s sisters and my father’s brother who lived in Chernovitz and was still at home -- they sent us money.</span> <span id="s301">We were there until Succoth.</span> <span id="s302">And Succoth they picked us up again and then they sent us to Transnistria on foot and there were some wagons.</span> <span id="s303">Transnistria was the part of the Ukraine between the Dnestr and the Bug, I think.</span> <span id="s304">And as Romania and Germany occupied that part of the Ukraine, they brought the Jews there.</span> <span id="s305">Again, they didn’t know what to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: I noticed that you mentioned that you were in a camp called Lipcon.</span> <span id="s307">Was that after then?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: We were in Lipcon before we got to Edintz.</span> <span id="s309">All through that summer, wherever we thought that we got settled already someplace, something happened and the soldiers came in and, “Okay.</span> <span id="s310">Get up and go!”</span> <span id="s311">And in Lipcon we left many of our family pictures, wedding pictures, and even to this day, I don’t think there are any pictures left of my mother’s sister and her family.</span> <span id="s312">And from Edintz, as I said, we were in Transnistria.</span> <span id="s313">Many died in Edintz, and then they sort of gathered up like 40, 50 people, and they had like an overseer -- they called them “delegates” -- that would be in charge of that group, and our group picked my father, and he tried to get wagons for ones that couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s314">My sister couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s315">Then one night, before we had to cross the Dnestr, they gathered up all the delegates.</span> <span id="s316">And when my mother saw that they are gathering all these men, she and other women started to run after them.</span> <span id="s317">They wanted to find out where they’re being taken.</span> <span id="s318">She saw that one soldier turned around and killed the wife of one of these men.</span> <span id="s319">So she ran back to us.</span> <span id="s320">With us, besides my grandmother, was also my grandmother’s brother Abraham, and he was very sick.</span> <span id="s321">He died that night.</span> <span id="s322">And my father always thought that if he would have been there, maybe he wouldn’t have died yet, because he used to cover him up, and so on.</span> <span id="s323">My father was gone a whole night.</span> <span id="s324">We didn’t know what had happened to them.</span> <span id="s325">Early morning, my father came back, and he said that they searched him and they searched him and they were questioning them and beating them, and then when it came to my father’s turn, my father said to him, “Look what you’re doing to us!</span> <span id="s326">I have a wife and a mother and three children and I left them all alone.</span> <span id="s327">Why did you take us away?”</span> <span id="s328">So the Romanian soldier looked at his hands and he said, “Oh, my hands are smeared with enough Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s329">Go back to your families!”</span> <span id="s330">Can you believe?</span> <span id="s331">These were the people that we lived among!</span> <span id="s332">They were our neighbors!</span> <span id="s333">We had two little knapsacks left with us, and two peasants came and grabbed them off our backs, took them away from us!</span> <span id="s334">We really came without nothing!</span> <span id="s335">My father had a warm coat, he used to cover us for the night in his warm coat, and he used to shiver.</span> <span id="s336">And when we came to Transnistria to a town, Mogilovedolsk, and there, too, the Jews were not there.</span> <span id="s337">The town happened to have been in a flood.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Was it in…</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: This was in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s340">That was like a dead town.</span> <span id="s341">The water was through, but the towns were empty.</span> <span id="s342">We went in and occupied a home -- us and a few more Jewish families.</span> <span id="s343">We made ourselves at home and we thought, “This is going to be it.”</span> <span id="s344">The one possession that my father had saved was a pair of good shoes of my mother’s.</span> <span id="s345">These shoes -- they were almost like brand new --were in the pockets of his warm storm coat, and as he came into that house, he took out the shoes from the storm coat and spread out that coat and we should lie down.</span> <span id="s346">He was very good to us.</span> <span id="s347">If not for him, we wouldn’t be here.</span> <span id="s348">(Starts to cry) And now later, the soldiers came.</span> <span id="s349">“Come on!</span> <span id="s350">It’s not for you to stay here!”</span> <span id="s351">And they took us to a Casernah, where these soldiers are housed, just one great big building.</span> <span id="s352">There were many, many Jewish people there, and my father saw there are already people from Chernovitz, and he kept on asking about his family, and they said, “No, we haven’t seen them.”</span> <span id="s353">There was no communication.</span> <span id="s354">You couldn’t call, you couldn’t write.</span> <span id="s355">Just by what people had seen, one another.</span> <span id="s356">And my father puts his hands in the pockets of his coat, and he forgot the shoes!</span> <span id="s357">The next morning I don’t remember seeing him leaving, but I remember waking up, and my father was gone to look for the shoes.</span> <span id="s358">My father told the guard that he lost a child, and would they please let him go look for the child.</span> <span id="s359">It was daylight, and it was more or less sunny and he walked back to that building and he found the shoes.</span> <span id="s360">And then he found out that some of the people from that building moved into the town.</span> <span id="s361">And he found out that every morning they count 400 people out of that place and they send them to other little villages in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s362">The next two days he got acquainted and he bribed a guard, and he got us out from that place and into the town.</span> <span id="s363">And again, a nice Jewish woman took us in.</span> <span id="s364">The house was practically destroyed from the flood, but she was there.</span> <span id="s365">I remember how she used to tell us day in and day out what her house used to look like.</span> <span id="s366">“And here were the end tables and here was the bed and here was this…” She had Kirmans, the carpets, and it was nice.</span> <span id="s367">And because, as I said, my father was very bright and alert, he started buying old clothes from people and sell them.</span> <span id="s368">So he right away organized some food for us.</span> <span id="s369">And then I got sick.</span> <span id="s370">I got rheumatic fever.</span> <span id="s371">I was so sick that if anybody walked by that bed, moved it, I was in pain.</span> <span id="s372">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s373">And he happened to meet a doctor that gave him some pills like aspirins and that sort of helped me.</span> <span id="s374">And also, because he was a very outgoing person, he happened to have been at the barber and started to tell where he’s from, and how we got there, there was a man there that didn’t look Jewish, but he said, “Did you say you’re from Krischatik?”</span> <span id="s375">And my father said, yes.</span> <span id="s376">He says, “You know, in our little town that is called Chernovtsy, which is 30 miles away from Ogelov, there are some people from Krischatik.”</span> <span id="s377">And my father sent them a note and this Jewish man came back and took us to that little town, and that was our salvation.</span> <span id="s378">That’s where we lived out the war.</span> <span id="s379">We were there for three and a half years, and until we were freed by the Russians in March, ’44.</span> <span id="s380">And again, the Jewish Russian people were very good to us!</span> <span id="s381">That’s why, when they started to come here, I tried to be nice to some of them.</span> <span id="s382">It was a very nice little town, clean, and I had Jewish girlfriends, and we lived with the Jewish families and we didn’t pay them a penny.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: You mentioned that it was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s384">Did you all have to live in one area?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: We all lived in one area.</span> <span id="s386">And the first winter there, my father used to leave the little town with this man who brought us there.</span> <span id="s387">And my father used to carry on his back a sack of flour, in cold weather -- just like in Minnesota -- he used to go on foot.</span> <span id="s388">The 30 miles and would sell it in Mogilof, and all he earned was bread for us for the week.</span> <span id="s389">And my grandmother used to bake bread on Friday, and we used to get just a little piece.</span> <span id="s390">We used to eat bread and sugar.</span> <span id="s391">And that was our nourishment.</span> <span id="s392">And then they kept on saying that no Jews should leave that little town, and my father still used to sneak out until we heard that they caught three Jews and they killed them, and then my mother wouldn’t let my father go anymore.</span> <span id="s393">It got to be spring, they had to clean.</span> <span id="s394">They don’t have bathrooms, just big trenches.</span> <span id="s395">And they used to take the Jews to clean these.</span> <span id="s396">Some of them that had money didn’t want to go, so my father used to.</span> <span id="s397">For a few mark, he used to go and do it for other people.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t remember exactly how my father’s sisters found out where we are, but they met somebody that was a Romanian official, he had a big job with the Romanian government, and they were governing that little town.</span> <span id="s399">My aunt was telling us that she practically kneeled in front of him, he should take money from us.</span> <span id="s400">And then there used to be Romanian officers that would go back and forth, and through him my father met others.</span> <span id="s401">So they helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Did your father’s sisters stay in Romania in their own towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: They stayed in their own town -- my father’s three sisters and my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s404">And my father’s brother was also a very smart man.</span> <span id="s405">Even though there was a big propaganda carried on that the Jews that will leave first will get the nicer homes, and they will get the good jobs, my father’s brother said, ”I want to be the last Jew on the train that will leave Chernovitz.</span> <span id="s406">I won’t leave any sooner.”</span> <span id="s407">And he stayed, and then my father’s sisters, somehow -- there was one good thing with the Romanians, you could bribe them --somehow they stayed to work there.</span> <span id="s408">They probably did tell us the stories how they managed, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: And they sent you money, so they must have been doing fairly well.</span> <span id="s410">Or still had money from before.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: You know what they did?</span> <span id="s412">My father’s sister -- one of the youngest -- was a dressmaker.</span> <span id="s413">She had a very well known salon in Chernovitz.</span> <span id="s414">And then two young men ran away from Poland when they started to deport the Jews, ran away to Chernovitz.</span> <span id="s415">They sneaked across the border, and they came and they didn’t have any papers, and they needed a place to stay, and they were willing to pay.</span> <span id="s416">So my father’s sisters took them in and they kept them for as long as they had money, and then they kept them without the money.</span> <span id="s417">My youngest aunt happened to marry one of these guys.</span> <span id="s418">He used to promise her, “Wait.</span> <span id="s419">When I’ll get out of here I’ll buy you furs and diamonds.”</span> <span id="s420">And he kept his promise.</span> <span id="s421">They live in Vienna and he did very well.</span> <span id="s422">They have two daughters.</span> <span id="s423">So they kept them on even when they didn’t have any more money to pay, just out of the goodness of their heart, even though it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s424">So, we were there and then the Russians freed us, and I really have a very good heart about the Russian people, as such, because -- besides the Jewish people --there were some very nice non-Jews that helped us.</span> <span id="s425">There was one woman that used to bring us potatoes and we used to sell her some little things, but she was very nice, and then the army was really nice to us, too, you know.</span> <span id="s426">They defended us.</span> <span id="s427">And then afterwards we came back home.</span> <span id="s428">We never went back to our little town.</span> <span id="s429">We went back to Chernovitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: You didn’t go back to the place where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: No.</span> <span id="s432">I’ve never been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: You don’t know whether that little synagogue is still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No.</span> <span id="s435">My parents went back.</span> <span id="s436">They want to see what they can salvage.</span> <span id="s437">So they brought back a sack of flour from some neighbors!</span> <span id="s438">We were really afraid to go, because it happened in other little towns that Jewish people went back and the neighbors just killed them.</span> <span id="s439">They didn’t want them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: It’s very hard to believe that the people you lived with when you were children would be so hostile!</span> <span id="s441">Even if they knew that this was wrong!</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: As a matter of fact, one lady that survived also from Transnistria -- I happen to have met her in St. Paul, Minnesota, she’s died since -- her brother and his family went back.</span> <span id="s443">Their name was Dorff.</span> <span id="s444">They went back to that city -- a village not far from where we were from -- and they were killed, after the war.</span> <span id="s445">And then after the Russians came and liberated you, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: We went back home -- on foot or, when there was the Russian army, they used to take us on the trucks.</span> <span id="s447">I wouldn’t remember the dates.</span> <span id="s448">We had accumulated a few possessions because, as you know, my auntie sent us the money, and we made it back home.</span> <span id="s449">And of course my father’s sisters were there, and my father’s brother, and they took us in.</span> <span id="s450">We stayed till ’45 or ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: The Jews weren’t too happy there?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No.</span> <span id="s453">Because it became really like Russia.</span> <span id="s454">The Jews were not happy and they started to leave.</span> <span id="s455">My father didn’t want to leave again.</span> <span id="s456">He says, “I’m tired.</span> <span id="s457">I have a home.</span> <span id="s458">We’re here, we have a roof over our head.”</span> <span id="s459">And then something happened at his job.</span> <span id="s460">Some horses died.</span> <span id="s461">And my father was the one who used to buy the feed for the horses and they blamed it on my father.</span> <span id="s462">It’s hard to imagine, but this is really what goes on.</span> <span id="s463">They arrested him during Passover to question him why these horses died, and what was that feed.</span> <span id="s464">Mainly why they kept him, they wanted, when he comes home, he should be an informer.</span> <span id="s465">And that he couldn’t swallow.</span> <span id="s466">For months he wouldn’t leave the house.</span> <span id="s467">And then my mother talked him into one day, “Let’s go to a movie.”</span> <span id="s468">And he came to the movie, and he saw that one of the ones that were questioning him was there, that had made him promise to become an informer.</span> <span id="s469">So that’s when he decided to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s470">The Jews were leaving.</span> <span id="s471">And we ended up in Romania -- in Radauti.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Did you have to get papers to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s474">We left legally.</span> <span id="s475">Again, they did not allow us to take anything, and they searched us.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: How long did you stay in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: We stayed in Romania until like ’58, I got married in Romania, in Radauti.</span> <span id="s478">And then I lived in another town with my husband.</span> <span id="s479">I just remember an incident with the Romanians.</span> <span id="s480">The Russians withdrew when the war broke out, and at first the Hungarians came and occupied that factory.</span> <span id="s481">They were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s482">Then the Romanians started to take over -- the people from before.</span> <span id="s483">We could see from our house right across the yard -- that sugar beet factory, and I remember my mother and my father staying and looking out the window the whole night.</span> <span id="s484">They didn’t go to sleep.</span> <span id="s485">They didn’t like the drinking that was going on.</span> <span id="s486">And, sure enough, in the morning towards dawn, my mother heard something, how the Hungarians were given an order, “Zhid,”…”all the Jews”…and that didn’t sound good to her.</span> <span id="s487">She understood here and there a word, and she gathered us up from the warm bed and we ran away in the fields and in the forest.</span> <span id="s488">And two minutes later she saw the soldiers marching up to the end of the little town and walking back the Jews there.</span> <span id="s489">They saw they were assembling these Jews, so they gathered us up, “Let’s run away from home!”</span> <span id="s490">and some soldiers ran after us.</span> <span id="s491">They wanted to bring us there too.</span> <span id="s492">My sister was a very pretty girl.</span> <span id="s493">She was thirteen.</span> <span id="s494">And she had a little ring, and she took the ring off and gave it to him.</span> <span id="s495">And he let us go back home.</span> <span id="s496">And then, that Romanian captain that was there -- some of these people from our little town knew that Romanian captain.</span> <span id="s497">They started to plead with him, because first the Hungarians said, “Shall we kill you?</span> <span id="s498">Shall we slash your throats?”</span> <span id="s499">My mother’s cousin started to plead with them and then they let them all go.</span> <span id="s500">And in the afternoon that Hungarian soldier came back and brought back that ring.</span> <span id="s501">He wanted a picture of my sister, that he should be able to show that he saved us, and he gave her back the ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: One of the things that I’m curious about, did you ever feel, before you had to leave your first town, that there was any anti-Semitism, or did you know many gentiles?</span> <span id="s503">Did you go to school with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s505">I think I grew up with it.</span> <span id="s506">I just don’t even remember when was the first time, but I remember.</span> <span id="s507">That little village, there were mostly Ukrainian people that lived there, and they always had derogatory remarks about “the Jews,” and I just grew up with it.</span> <span id="s508">It was a part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Did you ever fear them?</span> <span id="s510">Nothing ever happened in the community that would upset your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s512">Maybe my parents might have had, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s513">But we really didn’t associate very much.</span> <span id="s514">Just in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Did you go to any kind of Hebrew school or…</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: No.</span> <span id="s517">we had a man, a Jewish melamed was hired, and we had a cheder.</span> <span id="s518">I used to go there or he used to come home and teach my brother and me.</span> <span id="s519">Also, while we were in concentration camp --there in that last little town where we were freed -- when we were doing a little better, we hired a man to teach us Hebrew, my brother and me, mainly.</span> <span id="s520">Somehow my sister got out of it.</span> <span id="s521">And they gave him like four kilos, eight pounds of flour a week.</span> <span id="s522">And that amount meant more at that time than I don’t know how many thousands would mean now, because it meant he had bread!</span> <span id="s523">My father thought that we should get some kind of Hebrew education.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Was your brother ever Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: When we came back, he was Bar Mitzvah, but it wasn’t done the way it’s done here.</span> <span id="s526">My father went with him to shul and the bottle of schnapps and honey cake and he was Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s527">My brother used to get mad, because somehow, when he would get stuck with a Hebrew word with the Chumash, I knew that word better.</span> <span id="s528">(laughter) So we always had to have a little Yiddish knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: When you were living in that last camp, before you went into the town, were they all Jews there?</span> <span id="s530">Were there any gentiles wit h you?</span> <span id="s531">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I think they were all Jews.</span> <span id="s533">I don’t ever remember seeing non-Jews in the ghettos with us.</span> <span id="s534">Even when after was gentile neighbors, they were not part of the ghetto or whatever.</span> <span id="s535">They were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s537">In the camps, were there people like gypsies, or Jews that were baptized, or that really weren’t born Jewish, or that were just called Jews?</span> <span id="s538">These were really Jewish people, in other words, that were separated out.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: You mentioned that you were able to get money from your uncles and your aunts.</span> <span id="s541">Evidently then, the way in which your area was handled was different than where the Nazis were themselves.</span> <span id="s542">You never had any contact with Nazis as such?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: We did.</span> <span id="s544">I think mostly when they started to withdraw from Russia.</span> <span id="s545">That’s when we had contact with real German Nazis!</span> <span id="s546">But we were mostly under Hungarian and Romanian rule.</span> <span id="s547">And as I said, that was our luck, that you could bribe a Romanian.</span> <span id="s548">(Chuckle) We knew how to communicate with them.</span> <span id="s549">And we were Romanian citizens!</span> <span id="s550">There were many, many died!</span> <span id="s551">I don’t know exactly the statistics, how many.</span> <span id="s552">I remember when we were being driven through little villages, and there used to be like three, four families.</span> <span id="s553">They were not there anymore.</span> <span id="s554">They just did not have the same way of exterminating as the Nazis.</span> <span id="s555">They had the same orders -- they wanted to get rid of us!</span> <span id="s556">But they were not quite as sophisticated and brutal.</span> <span id="s557">My father walked out once -- you had to wear a Jewish star -- and a Romanian soldier came to the door to ask something -- just for information --and saw he didn’t have the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s558">He gave him a slap on his face.</span> <span id="s559">So they were pretty tough, too, but in a different way.</span> <span id="s560">We could still move around.</span> <span id="s561">There was still a market, the Ukrainian peasants used to bring things to the market things.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: When you went back to your home -- after you were liberated -- you were there until your parents decided they were going to leave after your father had that incident with the Russians.</span> <span id="s563">And you moved back into another town in Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: And you were there until you got married, you said.</span> <span id="s566">Now when you got married, did you live there for a while after you were married too?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We lived in Romania in a different town.</span> <span id="s568">We got married in 1950.</span> <span id="s569">And we lived in Romania until ’58.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: What made you decide to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Well, my parents had left in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: What made them decide to go to France rather than to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Because my father’s brother lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s575">The brother that was in…</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: …in Chernovitz.</span> <span id="s577">Everybody started to move away.</span> <span id="s578">My sister was in Israel.</span> <span id="s579">My brother was in Israel and my husband’s sister was in Israel.</span> <span id="s580">We wanted to leave when they left, but we just didn’t get the visa.</span> <span id="s581">And then later on, they started to let the Jews out again, so we got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And then you decided to come right to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: We stayed in Vienna, and really wanted to go to Israel -- till this day, I want to be together with my sister.</span> <span id="s584">But things were very tough in Israel then, and my aunties, my father’s sisters, live in Vienna and they wanted us to stay there, and my parents were in Paris, and they would have liked us to come there.</span> <span id="s585">But you couldn’t get a entrance visa to Paris.</span> <span id="s586">So Max, my husband, knew that he has family here so he just sent them a picture postcard --not even airmail!</span> <span id="s587">-- just a postcard that we left Romania, we are in Vienna, and we don’t know yet what we are going to do.</span> <span id="s588">And right away we got a letter from Carl Sharpe and he wanted us to come here.</span> <span id="s589">He didn’t know us.</span> <span id="s590">He just knew that Max was his cousin.</span> <span id="s591">He said, “You can work for me.</span> <span id="s592">And if you won’t like working for me, you can find something else.”</span> <span id="s593">And to us, that sentence that he wrote, “If you won’t like working for me,” seemed very strange.</span> <span id="s594">What does he mean he won’t like it!</span> <span id="s595">I mean there was no such thing whether you like a job or you don’t!</span> <span id="s596">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Well, he probably didn’t want you to feel obligated.</span> <span id="s598">And knowing Carl as I do, who I think is a very fine person, I can understand that he wanted you to be happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s600">But to a European, that seemed strange, because that’s what you have to do!</span> <span id="s601">You didn’t ask yourself if you like it or you don’t!</span> <span id="s602">So we came here and the family was really great to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: You came to the United States, then, to Minnesota.</span> <span id="s604">When?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: In June of 1959.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: June of 1959.</span> <span id="s607">Now your sister still lives in Israel?</span> <span id="s608">Is she well?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: She’s well.</span> <span id="s610">She likes it.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Is she married?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s613">And she has two married daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Where did she get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: She got married in Vienna.</span> <span id="s616">And then she left Vienna and she went to Israel, because my grandmother ended up in Israel.</span> <span id="s617">She was expecting her first baby, and she wanted to be with the grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Were there organizations that were Jewish that helped at all while you were in any of your camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: There might have been but we did not get.</span> <span id="s620">When we came back to Radauti we found out about the Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s621">And I think we got, once, clothes from them.</span> <span id="s622">They said that this is still a fee, but you know, it’s made out of paper.</span> <span id="s623">That was the only time.</span> <span id="s624">It must have been around ’46 or so.</span> <span id="s625">I did, in Radauti, join the Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s626">I belonged to the B’nai Akiva,which was the youth group of Mizrachi.</span> <span id="s627">And my brother belonged to Hashomer Hatzagair, which is just the opposite.</span> <span id="s628">(Laughter) My brother left for Israel in ’47.</span> <span id="s629">He went with the youth group.</span> <span id="s630">He was in Cyprus.</span> <span id="s631">He was a very young boy, and he really wanted me to go with him.</span> <span id="s632">And my father said he doesn’t think he could ever live without me.</span> <span id="s633">My sister had left for Vienna, and he says he would never let me from his side.</span> <span id="s634">As it turned out, we haven’t been together.</span> <span id="s635">But then when my brother was in Israel, my parents settled in Paris.</span> <span id="s636">They wanted to have one child near them, so he came back to Paris and made his home in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Your father and mother both sound as if they were not only very strong people, and very brave people, but very compassionate and yet very wiling to sacrifice if they had to for the lives of their loved ones.</span> <span id="s638">It reminds me of one of the speakers that we had for one of the Women’s Division functions of the United Jewish Fund, who was a survivor, who told when they left home in Germany, the father made her take the warmest, strongest pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s639">And she claimed that her survival had to do with those shoes and the fact that her father -- she was separated from her parents, but she always felt, that by his making her take those boots, she walked and walked and walked, and those boots lasted for most of the time.</span> <span id="s640">But I think the men in those days, first of all they worked very hard.</span> <span id="s641">And I think they were more cognizant of what stress was than we are today.</span> <span id="s642">Stress today is different, but hardship was very natural in those days.</span> <span id="s643">And I think they knew how to protect themselves more.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s645">I remember stories that my grandmother used to tell, and now I’m sorry I didn’t write them down, how they ran away during the First World War!</span> <span id="s646">and how my father was telling us how he had to fend for himself during the First World War!</span> <span id="s647">I think these things made people, like you say, more aware of how to survive.</span> <span id="s648">He really was very well known!</span> <span id="s649">.</span> <span id="s650">And it really saved our lives!</span> <span id="s651">He never told my mother that he gave that Romanian officer the 200 lei when he was new in the area, because my mother probably would have said, like.</span> <span id="s652">“Why did you have to give him the money?</span> <span id="s653">You’ll never see it again,” and so on.</span> <span id="s654">He was young, that officer, and he needed the money.</span> <span id="s655">And that, really, sort of saved our lives!</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Was he a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: I couldn’t say that my father has a lot of religious knowledge, because in First World War, his mother died.</span> <span id="s658">He was just observant.</span> <span id="s659">Later on when he settled, he used to like to study a bit.</span> <span id="s660">And of course the faith in God never left us.</span> <span id="s661">Even now, he still hopes that my mother will walk one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: What’s the matter with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: She had a stroke.</span> <span id="s664">She’s been bedridden.</span> <span id="s665">I think even the fact that she is alive for so many years is because my father is so good to her, and he tells her, whenever she’s down, “Oh, you’ll still dance with me!”</span> <span id="s666">One day she was very depressed, and she cried, and I told her, “Listen, don’t cry.</span> <span id="s667">We are good to you and we love you.</span> <span id="s668">And my sister comes and I come.</span> <span id="s669">And we have Daddy here.</span> <span id="s670">And he’s not senile!”</span> <span id="s671">And I said -- that was three years ago when I saw her -- “Some people that got sick at that time are already dead and look!</span> <span id="s672">You’re still with us and you’ll live to see the great grandchildren.”</span> <span id="s673">And my father said, “Yes!</span> <span id="s674">That the Russians occupied Afghanistan,and there they let the Shah go!</span> <span id="s675">And you’re still with us!”</span> <span id="s676">And he said, ‘These people that die, they’re already bored, they want to come back.”</span> <span id="s677">So this is his philosophy, and his sense of humor.</span> <span id="s678">He really fought to pull us through.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: I’m sure he did!</span> <span id="s680">Are you in contact with any of the people that you knew from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s682">There are some in Israel that I have seen and my sister had a wedding -- her daughter’s wedding -- that all of them were invited.</span> <span id="s683">Some of them were from our little town.</span> <span id="s684">They all came.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: It’s like an extended family.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s687">That’s part of the family.</span> <span id="s688">I have seen them when I was in Israel at my niece’s wedding.</span> <span id="s689">Of course they have all changed.</span> <span id="s690">And that one man -- I haven’t heard lately about him--the one that used to tease me, that I told my father, “Daddy, give them everything!</span> <span id="s691">I want to live!”</span> <span id="s692">-- he was at my niece’s wedding.</span> <span id="s693">As a matter of fact he has a son that my father wanted to fix up with my older daughter, Susan.</span> <span id="s694">They met in Paris, but he was a lot older.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: There was one other thing that I didn’t really ask you about.</span> <span id="s696">When did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: I met my husband, I think, in ’49.</span> <span id="s698">And we got married in ’50.</span> <span id="s699">In Romania.</span> <span id="s700">And he was from that town where we lived.</span> <span id="s701">And he worked in a different little town there, where we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Was he ever in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s704">He was about 30 miles from where I was.</span> <span id="s705">My father knew his father from way back before.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: You didn’t have a shidach?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Well, no.</span> <span id="s708">We met through Max’s uncle.</span> <span id="s709">Max’s cousin was my good girlfriend, and his uncle kept on telling him, “I have a girl for you, but I’m waiting her sister should get married first.”</span> <span id="s710">(Laughter) After my sister got married, he saw that we should meet.</span> <span id="s711">Max is eight years older than I am.</span> <span id="s712">So he came, and we met, and his uncle came to talk to my father, we should get married right away.</span> <span id="s713">And my mother said, “No, she doesn’t want to, because she doesn’t want that we should split up.</span> <span id="s714">One daughter is here.</span> <span id="s715">If it’s going to be b’shert, we’re all going to meet in Israel.”</span> <span id="s716">Then, when my parents had an occasion to leave -- Max used to come to Bucharest, at that time, we lived in Bucharest -- my parents saw that it will be better if they will leave and I will stay back.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: When did they leave for France then?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: They left in 1950 -- in June -- the day after Max and I got engaged.</span> <span id="s719">They were not at my wedding, not at my sister’s wedding, but they were at three granddaughters’ weddings.</span> <span id="s720">That sort of made it up.</span> <span id="s721">They came here to both weddings -- to my children and to my sister’s one daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: I have three.</span> <span id="s724">Lydia, and Susan is 31, and Steven is 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Are they all here?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Susan’s in Los Angeles and Steven is at home.</span> <span id="s727">Steven has a communication problem.</span> <span id="s728">.</span> <span id="s729">He has autistic characteristics.</span> <span id="s730">One more thing to contend with.</span> <span id="s731">But he’s done real well, and we are really proud of him.</span> <span id="s732">He’s working right now, where Max is.</span> <span id="s733">And he’s a good boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Have you ever talked to them about your past experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: At first the children were too little, were small.</span> <span id="s736">Then I used to, especially on a Friday night when Max would be sometimes in Shul, and we would wait for him to come home.</span> <span id="s737">I really never went into detail like this, and I thought, “I really should do it.”</span> <span id="s738">I was going to write it down with my hand, but then never did.</span> <span id="s739">And I thought I should put it on tape, that some day my grandchildren will hear my voice.</span> <span id="s740">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: It’s so important that we have, as we get older, particularly, a feeling for our roots, no matter what they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I remember being fascinated by the stories my grandmother used to tell me about her experiences.</span> <span id="s743">You know, First World War, I remember how she came back, and how she was telling me how she rebuilt that home where she lived.</span> <span id="s744">And I remember thinking at that time, it was such an interesting story.</span> <span id="s745">And now I’ll never know it again unless my father still remembers something.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: You mention that you lost all your family pictures.</span> <span id="s747">Did you have anything at all that you kept from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I really can’t think of one thing!</span> <span id="s749">We had one pillow and my father’s storm coat!</span> <span id="s750">That I know was guarded.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Is it in a museum anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: No.</span> <span id="s753">I really don’t even know what happened to that storm coat, because it really kept us warm!</span> <span id="s754">And I remember they made, when we were in that little town, two little dresses out of ticking!</span> <span id="s755">My sister and I lived through it and I don’t even know what we wore in the winter.</span> <span id="s756">My father, when he started dealing with the old clothes the people were selling, got the girl’s coat for my brother.</span> <span id="s757">My brother, when he was a little boy, while we were in the concentration camp, in that last ghetto, that first winter he just used to stay and warm himself, and we used to say, “Send him outside, go play with the children.”</span> <span id="s758">He used to say.”</span> <span id="s759">I’m afraid.”</span> <span id="s760">That I remember.</span> <span id="s761">He would just stay in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: How old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: He was two years younger than me.</span> <span id="s764">I was 10 when we were deported so he was eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: How do you feel today about relationships with non-Jews?</span> <span id="s766">Do you have any feelings at all that have carried over, or that are just part of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: I’m sure I do.</span> <span id="s768">I work in a store where I deal with people, and all kinds of people come in.</span> <span id="s769">And people will come with accents and I could tell they’re from the Ukraine and from Russia, and from that part where we were when the Germans started to withdraw.</span> <span id="s770">There was a detachment of Ukrainians and Russians that joined the Nazi army, and they were collaborators, were with the families running away with the Nazis, and they were killing Jews on their way.</span> <span id="s771">And whenever I see one and she tells me, “Oh, we went away, we were taken away by the Germans to camps.”</span> <span id="s772">I know that it’s not the truth!</span> <span id="s773">I have a suspicious feeling!</span> <span id="s774">I think.</span> <span id="s775">“Well, this is a young person.</span> <span id="s776">She must have been a small child or he must have been a small child when that happened.”</span> <span id="s777">They had nothing to do with it, but there is that suspicious nature.</span> <span id="s778">A human being is a human being, but deep down, I’m sure I have this.</span> <span id="s779">I didn’t forget!</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: There have been many books and many movies and things that have shown the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s781">Do you think they’ve been fairly accurate?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s783">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Do you think they depicted it in the right light?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A; Because ours was just a very small part, where I come from, not too much is being said.</span> <span id="s786">There might be some books written also about Transnistria but I think whatever happened.</span> <span id="s787">I’m sure it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: I know that in my experience with some of the people who came to the United States, people who came here from Germany or Poland who were survivors, when they first came to the United States, they were really very reluctant, some of them, even to say they were Jews, let alone to discuss what happened.</span> <span id="s789">But in the last few years, I find more and more of the survivors who are willing to share.</span> <span id="s790">How do you feel?</span> <span id="s791">Why do you think that is, Edith?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s793">I think maybe because people are more interested in listening.</span> <span id="s794">I don’t think they were reluctant to share, because I remember when we came here and we wanted to share some of our experiences with the family, and we just didn’t notice any interest.</span> <span id="s795">And then we just never talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Do you think that maybe because there has been nationally so much more emphasis on the Holocaust, too, that people are more willing to discuss it?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: And the fact that we want our children to remember, and that children of all races should understand what the Holocaust was.</span> <span id="s799">Maybe that is one of the reasons?</span> <span id="s800">Because I found it very interesting when I looked at the list of people who would like to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s801">There were names on there that I know they would never discuss it when they first came.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s803">As I said, when we came here, we tried to tell, and people did not…</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: You didn’t find the right people to listen.</span> <span id="s805">That was the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s807">So we just didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s808">And I know, to this day, whenever it’s raining outside and I am cozy in bed, I am grateful to have a roof over my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Yes, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s810">And all your family, thank God, were able to survive and get married and have families.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s812">Except my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s813">She died.</span> <span id="s814">And we were told later that her child that was three years old was thrown alive in the grave by somebody that miraculously survived.</span> <span id="s815">All these people from the town, they were like related.</span> <span id="s816">And there is one young man -- he’s not too young when I looked at him now, you see where the years have gone by -- there were three.</span> <span id="s817">One died of cancer, one went into the Russian army (I don’t know what happened) and there’s one in Israel, and he is just like family.</span> <span id="s818">He survived.</span> <span id="s819">He came back to Chernovitz, from Poland.</span> <span id="s820">He was the one that was separated from us that first Saturday evening, he’s the only one that survived out of three brothers and a sister and a father and a mother.</span> <span id="s821">He’s still very close with my sister, and his son is a doctor in Israel, and his daughter is a doctor in Israel.</span> <span id="s822">They were in Paris last summer and they came to my brother, and it’s just like family, close family, because we are the only ones that are left from that area that are more or less contemporary.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Do you think that the Jews that are left in Romania are fairly comfortable, or do you think that they would all -- or a lot of them would -- like to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: I think some of them would like to leave.</span> <span id="s825">They’re mainly older people left, and they have their pensions there and their homes, and their way of life.</span> <span id="s826">A new beginning is very hard.</span> <span id="s827">I remember when we came here.</span> <span id="s828">I didn’t speak a word English, I really didn’t.</span> <span id="s829">And it was so hard!</span> <span id="s830">I cried through nights.</span> <span id="s831">I told my husband, “Let’s go back to Europe, or to Israel.’</span> <span id="s832">So I can understand some of the people not wanting to.</span> <span id="s833">I think the ones that are left are just older people, and I don’t think that they would want to uproot.</span> <span id="s834">Life in Romania is very difficult now-a-days -- not only for the Jews, but for the non-Jews, too.</span> <span id="s835">They have no food there</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: What about your family in France.</span> <span id="s837">How do they feel with the last few years of all the episodes?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: They’re scared.</span> <span id="s839">My father’s only outlet now is to go on Shabbos to the synagogue, and when these things started to happen, he said he’s kind of scared to go to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Do they go with other people, so they’re in a group when they go, or do they go alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Well, there are people in the neighborhood that walk there.</span> <span id="s842">He would go, maybe meet somebody.</span> <span id="s843">My brother lives right around the corner.</span> <span id="s844">And the Jewish school there, the mothers have to stay in the street.</span> <span id="s845">My sister-in-law volunteers, I don’t know how often, to stay when the children are brought to school and when they’re being picked up.</span> <span id="s846">It’s frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Do they ever have feelings of leaving France to go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: The first time my sister-in-law wrote this summer, she went during vacation to Israel to a kibbutz, and she said she met some French people that left France two years ago, and she writes me, “If your mother wouldn’t be so sick, I think I would like to pack up and move to Israel, because I can’t take it.”</span> <span id="s849">She was in Israel when all these things had happened in Paris, and she said, “I can’t take this, to be afraid to show your face.”</span> <span id="s850">If they can hide that they are Jews, they do.</span> <span id="s851">They don’t go around advertising “I’m Jewish” there.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: It’s a very uncomfortable way to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Very, very.</span> <span id="s854">It’s very sad.</span> <span id="s855">And on Rosh Hashanah, when I walked to the synagogue here, I thought, “Thank God, I don’t have to be afraid here, to walk to synagogue.”</span> <span id="s856">Then Lydia came -- she comes to our synagogue on the High Holidays -- and she says, “You know, Mother, they had a bomb threat at Beth El.”</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: It’s gotten worse this year here, too, and all over the country.</span> <span id="s858">When you mention God, how do you feel about your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Oh, there’s no question about it.</span> <span id="s860">I have complete faith in God, even though sometimes I have a few questions to ask him.</span> <span id="s861">(cries)</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Well, last night, if you had been at the Temple, Rabbi Raskas says that if we doubt, then we have faith.</span> <span id="s863">That part of faith is the doubt -- to ask and to question.</span> <span id="s864">And I think that one other question maybe is something that you can share with me.</span> <span id="s865">How do you feel about being privileged to survive?</span> <span id="s866">I mean, do you feel there’s anything special that that means to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: No.</span> <span id="s868">No.</span> <span id="s869">I just feel that God wanted it that way, and it was b’shert, and I don’t feel guilty that I survived.</span> <span id="s870">I’ve heard that some do.</span> <span id="s871">I don’t, and I’m just happy to be alive.</span> <span id="s872">I’m real happy about it, that I survived, and I just wish everybody would have.</span> <span id="s873">And, of course, sometimes, when I have my “low” moments, I thought, “What’s the use,” but then, oh, I think life is beautiful!</span> <span id="s874">And it’s nice to get up in the morning.</span> <span id="s875">(Starts to cry).</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Well, I thank you for sharing all these sensitive things.</span> <span id="s877">It’s hard for you, I know, but I think that it will be important that others learn from your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Well, thanks.</span> <span id="s879">I hope I did okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: You did beautifully.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s882">PAGE 24</span></p> <p><span id="s883">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s884">PAGE 24</span></p></body></html>
