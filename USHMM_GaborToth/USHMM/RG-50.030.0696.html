sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: The oldest brother, my name--we have a picture here--was Avraham.</span> <span id="s137">He got killed, I don't know where, by the Germans.</span> <span id="s138">And we don't know where he is.</span> <span id="s139">Now, we Jews have every year to remind our death people.</span> <span id="s140">So my father died in that time -- it doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s141">So I asked the Rabbi, "What shall I do with my oldest brother?</span> <span id="s142">I don't know when he did die."</span> <span id="s143">So he told me to connect it with my father's death.</span> <span id="s144">So the day when I have--after my father—</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: --I am connecting him with the same

id="s150">A: Was Herman.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Herman Jonas?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Herman Jonas, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And when was he born and when did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: When he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: He died already here in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: This I don't remember.</span> <span id="s161">Dates I don't remember.</span> <span id="s162">But I want to tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s163">I finished gymnasium in Poland.</span> <span id="s164">I wanted always to be a doctor, but the year what I finished gymnasium -- you know what gymnasium is?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s167">So I finished gymnasium, the war started.</span> <span id="s168">The war started when I was in gymnasium.</span> <span id="s169">Officers from the Army came to us and they taught us how to use rifles and so forth, so on, how to be a soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Which army was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Which army was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: This was the Polish army in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: And you were how old at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I was about 20-something years, 21 or 22, something like that.</span> <span id="s176">Anyhow, the war started and they didn't call me to the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Why?</span> <span id="s179">Because I am Jewish and at the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s180">I should have been an officer in the Army and they didn't want to have Jewish officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Regular soldiers, yes, but not officers.</span> <span id="s183">In this way I got saved.</span> <span id="s184">Now--</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Tell me-- Before we go before, tell me about your life before the war, about your family, about your childhood.</span> <span id="s186">Tell me a lot about your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: My childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: We went through a lot of different times but I always -- I never was a young boy, a young child.</span> <span id="s190">You ask me why, because after me I had about three younger ones, so whenever they wanted, the younger ones, from me something, I didn't want to do it or to give in to them.</span> <span id="s191">So my parents always say: "Shulim, you are older.</span> <span id="s192">This is a child."</span> <span id="s193">I always was older, never was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Awww.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: So that I was never a child, never young.</span> <span id="s196">Then when I was seven years I had to start school.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Did you go to a Jewish school or a Polish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Polish school.</span> <span id="s199">After this elementary school I went to gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s201">Did you speak Polish at home or Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Poland.</span> <span id="s203">I went to gymnasium.</span> <span id="s204">And I told you before, after I finished gymnasium I wanted to be a doctor, but I didn't have the chance.</span> <span id="s205">Now the Germans came in to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: So I knew that this was our end, my end, in...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Because we are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: How did you know they were after the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: How I did know?</span> <span id="s212">Because the Polish people, the army, they start watching already that the Germans should come in to fight and beg.</span> <span id="s213">So I did know already this.</span> <span id="s214">But they even didn't fight when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s215">But they told us that in an hour or an hour-and-a-half the Germans will be in our town.</span> <span id="s216">So we did run to the woods.</span> <span id="s217">The woods Were -- in our town we had a hill, the woods were on the hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Who ran?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: We went to the woods, those in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Who was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Who -- the whole family.</span> <span id="s222">My parents and my brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: All of you together?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: All we were together up there.</span> <span id="s225">In the morning I saw by us the streets, they're full with dust, not like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: So I did see that the dust comes unto heaven.</span> <span id="s228">So I knew that the Germans are coming in motorcycles and trucks and cars.</span> <span id="s229">Then I can't tell you that.</span> <span id="s230">I saw it's my end, I got shaky and cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: I knew this is it.</span> <span id="s233">But, after that, a boy came in up to us and said that the German general said that he won't kill us.</span> <span id="s234">So we went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Tell me, what was your father's job?</span> <span id="s236">What did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: What was your father's job?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: My father's job that time, we had a bank.</span> <span id="s240">So he was in the bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: What town was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: What town?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: What town?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Sanok.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Sanok.</span> <span id="s248">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Sanok.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Now, when the war started he had to leave the whole bank like that.</span> <span id="s252">He couldn't take out nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: After a few days being home, the Germans said to us that one of every family should come to the City Hall.</span> <span id="s255">We boys were afraid to go.</span> <span id="s256">No men.</span> <span id="s257">Because the men they did kill.</span> <span id="s258">In that time the girls or woman they didn't kill.</span> <span id="s259">So we did send our sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: That just died maybe a month or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Esther.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Esther?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s266">So we did send her.</span> <span id="s267">The Germans asked everybody, "What are your parents' business?</span> <span id="s268">What do they do?"</span> <span id="s269">So she said, "We have a bank."</span> <span id="s270">"Go to this line."</span> <span id="s271">Somebody said, "They're working."</span> <span id="s272">"Go to this line."</span> <span id="s273">Usually when they made two lines, is one line they did kill and the other line, which they could use, they left alive.</span> <span id="s274">But this time they said to the line where my sister was -- business, all business -- tomorrow until 8.30 or 9.30 -- I don't remember exactly the time -- you shouldn't be any more in this town.</span> <span id="s275">You cross the river.</span> <span id="s276">The river by us was San.</span> <span id="s277">It did divide the city in two parts.</span> <span id="s278">We didn't know, but the Germans, with the Russians, did divide Poland.</span> <span id="s279">So our city was divided.</span> <span id="s280">Where we were, our house, the Germans took.</span> <span id="s281">The other side of the river, the Russian took.</span> <span id="s282">So next day we had to cross the river, go up there.</span> <span id="s283">Near the river were the Germans -- Germans, the Army stay there.</span> <span id="s284">We were -- and we were crying because the Germans by them pick, pick, pick, and they kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did you see people being shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s287">We had to go through them.</span> <span id="s288">So we went in crying.</span> <span id="s289">I'll never forget it.</span> <span id="s290">One guy of the officers said to us:"Lepsze, lepsze, lepsze."</span> <span id="s291">You know what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: It's "better, better, better."</span> <span id="s294">Like don't be afraid, it's better for us to go there than to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Was it a Russian officer or a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: The "lepsze" probably was from Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Because he knew -- it's like our Polish.</span> <span id="s299">So we crossed over.</span> <span id="s300">We crossed over.</span> <span id="s301">In a few days the Russian came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What did they look like?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: What did they look like, the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: What we did?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: No, what did the Russians look like, the soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: What the soldiers, the Russian did?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: They took us for a hearing.</span> <span id="s310">They asked us so and so and so, and they wanted us boys -- we were three boys that time, ready to go to the army -- to take Russian citizenship.</span> <span id="s311">We knew that if we would take Russian citizenship, tomorrow they will send us to the army without teaching us how to use a gun or a..</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">So this would be our death.</span> <span id="s314">So, okay.</span> <span id="s315">They say okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: So what did you say?</span> <span id="s317">You said no, you don't want Russian Citizenship?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: What they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s320">My question is did your family say yes to Russian Citizenship or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: We said no.</span> <span id="s322">We said to them, "If you will take the other half of the city where our house is, we will become your citizens."</span> <span id="s323">Everything was the right quiet.</span> <span id="s324">In a few days, in middle of the night, like one or two o'clock, the Russians came in to us.</span> <span id="s325">And what happened?</span> <span id="s326">They said, "Come with us.</span> <span id="s327">Get dressed and come with us."</span> <span id="s328">They had a system that if they wanted to catch you, they came in the middle of the night when you're sleeping.</span> <span id="s329">Because daytime you could run away.</span> <span id="s330">In the middle sleep, they could catch us.</span> <span id="s331">They took us to the train.</span> <span id="s332">The train was not for people but looked for animals.</span> <span id="s333">And a few family in one wagon.</span> <span id="s334">Now, they told us we are going to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: They told you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s337">We were crying.</span> <span id="s338">We knew this is our end.</span> <span id="s339">This is our end.</span> <span id="s340">But a few of our people got money.</span> <span id="s341">They paid the Russian officers.</span> <span id="s342">They did let them out.</span> <span id="s343">And they were laughing and dancing, and we were crying.</span> <span id="s344">But I want to bring out, you don't know in life which bad is for your good and which good is for your bad.</span> <span id="s345">We went to Siberia, we came back alive.</span> <span id="s346">A lot of them died there, but we came back alive.</span> <span id="s347">Those which paid and was dancing and laughing, the Germans came in and they got killed.</span> <span id="s348">So you never know which bad is for your good and which good is for your bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Was your whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: We were in Russia.</span> <span id="s351">They took us to Siberia to the woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: How long did it take to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: How long we did stay in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: No, how long were you on the train to – how long did it take for the train to go –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: How long it took us?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: About 22 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You know exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Twenty days to Siberia.</span> <span id="s360">They then took -- day and night.</span> <span id="s361">You know what, we took with us our bread and, after a few days, we threw out the bread which was already hard and threw them out through the window.</span> <span id="s362">The dogs did run and catch it.</span> <span id="s363">After a time the Russians men came and they start fighting the dogs in catching the bread.</span> <span id="s364">This we saw that is our end.</span> <span id="s365">If they are fighting the dogs for a piece of bread, that means we are come and we will be hungry.</span> <span id="s366">We won't have any bread.</span> <span id="s367">So we came to the woods.</span> <span id="s368">If they would take us like murderers or whatever, that means we would have to work in the woods and they would give us some eating.</span> <span id="s369">But they did a different thing.</span> <span id="s370">They paid us piecework.</span> <span id="s371">How many trees you did cut.</span> <span id="s372">And we were allowed for the workers just one piece of bread to buy a day.</span> <span id="s373">This was it.</span> <span id="s374">Now, for the bread we had to pay.</span> <span id="s375">It was a store, we had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s376">Happened so in the beginning we got pieces of bread, but we had to divide the bread between the not workers from our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: So we got always almost nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Who did not work in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: So what happened--</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s382">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s383">Who in your family worked, who did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: We children did work.</span> <span id="s385">The parents could not work because my father, by the first time he lifted up the --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: -- hatchet –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: -- to cut off the dead thing from the tree, the leaves, he did hit his leg.</span> <span id="s390">So he couldn't any more work.</span> <span id="s391">Couldn't go out.</span> <span id="s392">So we were working.</span> <span id="s393">Every month they paid us for the trees so we could buy.</span> <span id="s394">Then they got smart and paid us once in a few month.</span> <span id="s395">We didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s396">You couldn't buy any bread.</span> <span id="s397">So a lot of people worked, fell down, and this was their end.</span> <span id="s398">So even to die you have to have luck.</span> <span id="s399">So what happened?</span> <span id="s400">No cemetery.</span> <span id="s401">They covered them with dust.</span> <span id="s402">They had a lot of scent.</span> <span id="s403">They covered them as they were there.</span> <span id="s404">Came the wind, blew it off.</span> <span id="s405">The scent, they were good for the wolves and bears which were there in the woods.</span> <span id="s406">That's what it was.</span> <span id="s407">Now being there about two years, the second year they gave us pieces of potatoes to put in the earth to grow potatoes for us because bread was not enough.</span> <span id="s408">So we did it.</span> <span id="s409">Came (?</span> <span id="s410">ocean?)</span> <span id="s411">and everybody had to dig his part of potatoes up.</span> <span id="s412">And we didn't get nothing.</span> <span id="s413">Didn't grow.</span> <span id="s414">Just one small part of potatoes.</span> <span id="s415">We brought it in and my mother -- you see the picture here -- my mother was crying.</span> <span id="s416">She said, "This is our end."</span> <span id="s417">I said, "Mummy, don't cry.</span> <span id="s418">Until we will finish those potatoes the help from God will come to us."</span> <span id="s419">Know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: This night they made the potatoes and we finished them.</span> <span id="s422">The second day, before we went out to the woods, two or three -- I don't remember -- two or three trucks came in with Russian officers and they told us, "From today on you are free.</span> <span id="s423">You can go to any town of Russia.</span> <span id="s424">You don't have to be in the woods."</span> <span id="s425">Some people had money.</span> <span id="s426">They bought tickets and went to the warmer parts of...</span></p> <p><span id="s427">We didn't have any money.</span> <span id="s428">So what happened?</span> <span id="s429">So I said let us go to the wood.</span> <span id="s430">Let us cry -- let us cut a few more trees and they will pay us for it, and then we will see what we can do with it.</span> <span id="s431">One guy there, a boy, 20-something years, they live near us, he said, "I'm going to help you."</span> <span id="s432">And he did help us.</span> <span id="s433">And we did cut I don't know how many trees.</span> <span id="s434">And we did call the Russian and they note and they did pay us for it.</span> <span id="s435">Now our parents asked us what kind of a ticket we should buy for that.</span> <span id="s436">I said, "You know what, for every money what we have, buy a ticket, and we will see how far it will bring us."</span> <span id="s437">And you know what happened?</span> <span id="s438">Did you hear about three biggest rivers in Asia: Ob, Yenisei, Lena?</span> <span id="s439">Did you hear of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: They brought us out the other side of Ob, Kamen-na-Obi, a town on the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: On Ob?</span> <span id="s443">On the River Ob?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Not on top of the river, the river—</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Next to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s447">So we went there.</span> <span id="s448">We didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s449">They gave me a job to be over a group there.</span> <span id="s450">Whatever they are doing, me to take care of them.</span> <span id="s451">And I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s452">So I thought they want to give us a job -- me -- a job in the City Hall, a lot of money.</span> <span id="s453">But for the whole money I couldn't buy a potato.</span> <span id="s454">It was very expensive.</span> <span id="s455">You couldn't get it.</span> <span id="s456">So I said, "You know what, I'm going to be a bookkeeper in a cohouse(ph).</span> <span id="s457">You know what cohouse(ph) is?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: A farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s461">What kind of farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: A farm with animals, a farm with field, bread and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s463">So I thought that I will be their bookkeeper, I will have for my family what to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: When you were in Russia –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: When you were there in Russia, were you able to be religious?</span> <span id="s467">Could you practice your religion?</span> <span id="s468">Okay, I'll write it down.</span> <span id="s469">Tell me more of your story about your family, to eat.</span> <span id="s470">{Document handed}</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: You could not practice religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: No.</span> <span id="s474">If they would catch me, I wouldn't be here now.</span> <span id="s475">In matter of a fact is, cutting the trees -- you know we have high holidays?</span> <span id="s476">One holiday we have to fast the whole day, Yom Kippur, and the other is New Year.</span> <span id="s477">And we knew when it is.</span> <span id="s478">So every day came a Russian guy and took over how many trees we did cut today, and tomorrow I had to cut more trees.</span> <span id="s479">Doesn't matter.</span> <span id="s480">But when it was the day before those holidays, we are not allowed to work, not to do nothing.</span> <span id="s481">So when the guy came like suppose two, three o'clock and took how many, so after that I was staying longer and cut more trees for tomorrow, so when he will come tomorrow I will say that that what I cut today.</span> <span id="s482">Do you know what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: In the morning of the holiday a Russian guy came before we came and said, "Go to work," and we had to work.</span> <span id="s485">So they did treat us... What can we do?</span> <span id="s486">What?</span> <span id="s487">I went to the library.</span> <span id="s488">I took bookkeeping books.</span> <span id="s489">Because in gymnasium they didn't teach us bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s490">It's a special -- special other schools.</span> <span id="s491">And I didn't know Russian at that time.</span> <span id="s492">So I did read a few times one sentence until I did learn.</span> <span id="s493">And then I told him they did need me because they took all the men and the women, the girls, to the army.</span> <span id="s494">And they gave me a job.</span> <span id="s495">And they gave me a job in an office.</span> <span id="s496">"Oh, a Polish bookkeeper!"</span> <span id="s497">All right.</span> <span id="s498">I went there to the office.</span> <span id="s499">Was sitting a girl which just finished bookkeeping school.</span> <span id="s500">And I came in and she asked me a question, "What this document?"</span> <span id="s501">I did not answer.</span> <span id="s502">I did start hollering on her, "You are asking me such a stupid question?</span> <span id="s503">You look and until you find it."</span> <span id="s504">She was afraid of me already.</span> <span id="s505">And she looked and looked.</span> <span id="s506">And next day she said, "I found it."</span> <span id="s507">"I told you.</span> <span id="s508">How did you find it?"</span> <span id="s509">She told me.</span> <span id="s510">I learned something.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: {Laughter} That's good!</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Then I saw that she knows more than me.</span> <span id="s513">So I told the head of the farm "I don't need her.</span> <span id="s514">Take her to the other."</span> <span id="s515">He took her out.</span> <span id="s516">Then I did start looking on documents, and there those documents are in the books.</span> <span id="s517">In this way I did learn and I became the best bookkeeper there.</span> <span id="s518">They gave me a house and I had my family in the house.</span> <span id="s519">This was until the end.</span> <span id="s520">Now they telled us we can go home to Poland.</span> <span id="s521">So on the border of Poland our train did stop.</span> <span id="s522">Our train did stop.</span> <span id="s523">So some officers of -- Russia officers went with us with the guns with machines.</span> <span id="s524">Five Pollocks did stand outside and said, "All the Jews came out, we want to finish whatever was left."</span> <span id="s525">We were afraid already to look because they had rifles.</span> <span id="s526">So the officers, the Russian officers, told them to leave otherwise they will get killed.</span> <span id="s527">"No, we want to finish them up!"</span> <span id="s528">They went away.</span> <span id="s529">And do you know what?</span> <span id="s530">The train took us to Poland and we were afraid already because they wanted to kill us.</span> <span id="s531">They lost the war because the Germans took a part and this took a part, but they wanted to kill us, the Jews.</span> <span id="s532">Coming there we had some gold still left over.</span> <span id="s533">Yeah, I forgot to tell you how did we live in the woods.</span> <span id="s534">We had some golden vouchers, golden rings, diamonds.</span> <span id="s535">So we went 15 miles away from us, was a town there and we bought for this potatoes, a few potatoes.</span> <span id="s536">In this way we could live.</span> <span id="s537">Otherwise we would be out already.</span> <span id="s538">This way now, being in the farm, I had for my family whatever we did need to eat and end of the year I got like this room a lot of – how do you say this?</span> <span id="s539">-- white -- oh, you are making flour out of it and then we making bread.</span> <span id="s540">We had more than we did need, so we did help others which were dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s541">This was the end there, and then in Poland we did see what they want to do with us.</span> <span id="s542">So we paid a few people, special people, which take you over the border.</span> <span id="s543">They took us to Czechoslovakia, the whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: So you didn't want to stay in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: We couldn't stay in Poland, no.</span> <span id="s546">We left our house and everything.</span> <span id="s547">We went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s548">Czechoslovakia, they send us to Austria.</span> <span id="s549">One thing what I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s550">In Austria, the Germans -- and I could go where 20 or 50 Germans were together and they just said hello to me, and the Pollocks wanted to kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Germans are people.</span> <span id="s552">Like soldiers, if you tell them to kill, they will kill.</span> <span id="s553">After this, they are normal people.</span> <span id="s554">So we did live in Austria.</span> <span id="s555">In Austria I went Graz.</span> <span id="s556">Did you ever hear of Graz?</span> <span id="s557">In Graz I went two years to university to learn medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Because you wanted to be a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: In meantime, I got married.</span> <span id="s560">My wife, she was in Germany.</span> <span id="s561">I was in Austria, she was in Germany.</span> <span id="s562">And we got papers to America.</span> <span id="s563">I left Austria, I came to America, and I could not make here the _ for medicine.</span> <span id="s564">So I went into business.</span> <span id="s565">It's a hard thing to say, but doesn't matter, and I made my business all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: What was the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I made samples for ladies.</span> <span id="s568">And my samples you could see in the television.</span> <span id="s569">They did show my samples.</span> <span id="s570">Yes.</span> <span id="s571">And I made, thank God, a nice living.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Did you make clothes?</span> <span id="s573">Were they samples of clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: The samples, what kind of samples were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Skirts.</span> <span id="s577">This what I made.</span> <span id="s578">And after this, when this {video camera} won't work, I'll tell you something about my factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Okay, I think I finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: I have some questions.</span> <span id="s582">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s583">I will write them down.</span> <span id="s584">Okay, I will first read my question.</span> <span id="s585">When you and I were talking earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: What is--</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: When you and I spoke earlier—</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Let me read the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s590">– I said you had seen God throughout your life.</span> <span id="s591">I'd like to know where you saw him when you were in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Yes, I saw God everywhere.</span> <span id="s593">I could have get killed and He did help me.</span> <span id="s594">I went out and for every event I was the highest of them all.</span> <span id="s595">In the cohouse(ph), in there, the head of the cohouse(ph) didn't know how to write.</span> <span id="s596">Whoever came there, they came to me and I had to give him a thing.</span> <span id="s597">So there in the woods I was also one of the best cutters there and I was respected.</span> <span id="s598">So that what it was.</span> <span id="s599">Why?</span> <span id="s600">Because He help me.</span> <span id="s601">I'll tell you something, when God -- I don't know, but always I did believe in God.</span> <span id="s602">Especially when they say it was one God, one God.</span> <span id="s603">So I do believe this God, He did create the world and He did create our world.</span> <span id="s604">He did create us.</span> <span id="s605">Now you will ask me, "How did he create us?"</span> <span id="s606">I'll tell you how.</span> <span id="s607">Did you ever hear of Abraham and Sarah?</span> <span id="s608">Sarah, when she was young, she couldn't have any children.</span> <span id="s609">She was crying and begging.</span> <span id="s610">But when she was 90-years old, when she could not have children, then God gave her that she had one son, Yitzchok.</span> <span id="s611">So Yitzchok was the creation.</span> <span id="s612">Because by 90 years she couldn't have it.</span> <span id="s613">He was a creation.</span> <span id="s614">Now, what happened to Yitzchok?</span> <span id="s615">After being 37 years old God told Abraham to take Yitzchok and give to God as a qurban.</span> <span id="s616">You know what means a qurban?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Sacrifice.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: As a udhiyyah, what is an udhiyyah.</span> <span id="s619">Qurban you give for all different things, an udhiyyah is a special -- you're giving a gift to God.</span> <span id="s620">To give him as a gift.</span> <span id="s621">So how you have to do it?</span> <span id="s622">Kill him and give it to God.</span> <span id="s623">So what happened?</span> <span id="s624">Abraham did not believe that God wanted to kill him.</span> <span id="s625">So what then he saw that nothing around.</span> <span id="s626">He lift up this knife and said to God, "Now you have him."</span> <span id="s627">God stopped him and said, "No, I don't want him to be killed."</span> <span id="s628">He didn't say, "Don't touch your son," but "Don't touch this boy."</span> <span id="s629">Why?</span> <span id="s630">Because as a son you gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy.</span> <span id="s631">Do you understand?</span> <span id="s632">So what did God do?</span> <span id="s633">He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosher animal.</span> <span id="s634">There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it.</span> <span id="s635">And he took Avram and killed the animal.</span> <span id="s636">He gave it to God instead Yitzchok, and Yitzchok was already God's son.</span> <span id="s637">This way we are children of Yitzchok, and this is our God.</span> <span id="s638">That's why I believe in God.</span> <span id="s639">You understand what I'm talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Now, we had Arvam, Yitzchok and Jacob.</span> <span id="s641">They are our forefathers.</span> <span id="s642">And we have foremothers, and they did have their children and this way God did create our nation.</span> <span id="s643">Now, if you'll ask me why did God need us?</span> <span id="s644">You know how?</span> <span id="s645">Because did you ever hear of Noah?</span> <span id="s646">Noah was the only one believing in God.</span> <span id="s647">So Noah... {Document handed}</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: My question is, but many people who suffered ask where was God during the Shoah?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Just yesterday, that means the whole week, every Shabbat, every Saturday, we do read a part of our Torah, of our... Yesterday were two parts reading.</span> <span id="s650">In one part God says: You Jews, my children, you have to behave so and so and so and so and so and so, and He giving us an order how we should behave in order He should be with us.</span> <span id="s651">In the other part he says: If you won't do what I told you, if you won't be like that, I'll bury you, I'll kill you, and then all the nations will be stronger than you and they will kill you.</span> <span id="s652">And that's what did happen.</span> <span id="s653">So seems to be that the Jews did not behave right to God and that's why he did punish us with that thing.</span> <span id="s654">It was a punishment.</span> <span id="s655">And then he says: After this punishment I'll remember you will (?</span> <span id="s656">lend?)</span> <span id="s657">Israel.</span> <span id="s658">"I'll remember."</span> <span id="s659">Not "I'll give you back the whole of Israel," but a part of it.</span> <span id="s660">And that's what he did.</span> <span id="s661">He gave us a part of Israel.</span> <span id="s662">And that's what I believe.</span> <span id="s663">I see that everything what they did right went through.</span> <span id="s664">And do you know what?</span> <span id="s665">When I had my business -- maybe I shouldn't tell you that -- one girl, an Italian girl, older girl, said, "Jesus is God."</span> <span id="s666">I telled her, "How can this be?"</span> <span id="s667">"He is God.</span> <span id="s668">He is God."</span> <span id="s669">I said, "What happened to the God which was until him?"</span> <span id="s670">So he had probably to go to the unemployment!</span> <span id="s671">He lost his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">{Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: It's logical.</span> <span id="s674">Did she have an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: So that's why I believe in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: And now I want to tell you, I believe that every religion is good as long it doesn't say about killing other ones, to preach for that killing other nations or killing the Jews and so far and so on, or hate him.</span> <span id="s678">They are good religion.</span> <span id="s679">Matter of a fact is you have now here, in Italy, Italian people -- not Italy, what -- they believe in cows.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Oh, you mean Hindus.</span> <span id="s681">The Hindu religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: They believe--</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Cows are sacred.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: -- those are their gods.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: How can you understand it?</span> <span id="s687">I do understand it.</span> <span id="s688">People like to see things.</span> <span id="s689">They don't have enough of imagination to believe in God which you don't see.</span> <span id="s690">You see is acting.</span> <span id="s691">A matter of a fact is He said to -- Moses asked God, "I would like to see you."</span> <span id="s692">So God told him, "I'll take you up there.</span> <span id="s693">You can see me and to live, but you can see my back, not my face."</span> <span id="s694">What do that mean?</span> <span id="s695">You can see my background, what I did, and then you can see me in your imagination.</span> <span id="s696">That means don't believe in nobody's face.</span> <span id="s697">Some people are good acting and they will act nice, just believe what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s699">So I come back to the Shoah.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: I come back to my question about the Shoah, what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Let me read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s704">This one.</span> <span id="s705">The question that I gave Mr. Shulim to read is that many people would be very upset and hurt to hear that the Jews are somehow responsible for what happened to them during World War II and is this what he meant to say.</span> <span id="s706">This is what I want to ask him.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I told you already.</span> <span id="s708">Certain things we can't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: But I knew some people, they were very wrong in their acting, and in their thinking, and they did play as Jews but they were not.</span> <span id="s711">I mean they're Jews but they did not act like them.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Some of them do not believe in nothing.</span> <span id="s714">They say nothing exists.</span> <span id="s715">So, that what happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: So you see it--</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: We got punished this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I believe strongly in our God.</span> <span id="s720">And, as I told you before, every religion is good as long they don't preach hateness --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: -- or killing even.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s724">My next question and my finalquestion.</span> <span id="s725">Is there anything you would like to add to your story?</span> <span id="s726">Here {Document handed}</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: I will know it later!</span> <span id="s728">{Laughter}</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s730">Often times people forget during the interview and they think of what they would have liked to say after.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: I told whatever I had in my mind.</span> <span id="s732">Later there will come something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Call me!</span> <span id="s734">{Laughter} Okay.</span> <span id="s735">Well, thank you very much, Mr. Shulim Jonas.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s737">Let us be well, all, and to believe in good things.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A:
