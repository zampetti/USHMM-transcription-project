Relations Council, Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is Rhoda Lewin.</span> <span id="s5">I’ve just interviewed Sam Ackos and now I’m going to be talking with his sisters, Evelyn Ettinger and Mary Calof, about their memories of the period during World War II when first the Italians, and then the Germans, came into Greece, and what their experiences were.</span> <span id="s6">Who would like to begin?</span> <span id="s7">When were you born?</span> <span id="s8">Start with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">E: I was born February 21, ’37.</span> <span id="s10">So I was seven when my father was taken, 14 when we emigrated here.</span> <span id="s11">So I have definite memories, and they do differ from Sam’s.</span> <span id="s12">I remember during the war when my father was gone, the memory I have of this tall, good-looking man returning.</span> <span id="s13">I don’t remember the period at all, if we were in hiding with Mrs. Sayianou.</span> <span id="s14">I have no recollection of that at all.</span> <span id="s15">I only remember the day that my mother came from the synagogue and the word had gotten out that they were taking them, something terrible was taking place, and that my Aunt Tula and my Aunt Esther came and they took the children and they said they would go wherever her husband was going, she was going with them.</span> <span id="s16">And my mother had said – whether it was verbally later, or I remember it that day, I don’t know – she said that she went down to the synagogue and saw my dad being put on the trucks, and he said to her, “Go away.</span> <span id="s17">Don’t come with me.</span> <span id="s18">Take the children and go to Mrs. Sayianou.</span> <span id="s19">I don’t know what’s happening here.”</span> <span id="s20">And he made her go back.</span> <span id="s21">And I remember her coming that day and taking us, and literally leaving everything behind, and going to the suburb of Athens in which the woman had a beautiful villa.</span> <span id="s22">And she hid us in the room downstairs, and the only person that was there that knew we were Jewish was – I don’t know if she was a maid, or someone else that tended the gardens – I don’t know who she was.</span> <span id="s23">I remember her name.</span> <span id="s24">It was Agapi, which means love.</span> <span id="s25">And she liked all of us and gave us names.</span> <span id="s26">I remember that.</span> <span id="s27">And the recollection I have of those years there was, I don’t remember going to school.</span> <span id="s28">I remember eating the same thing for two years, which was green peas, the same food every day.</span> <span id="s29">I remember my father having visited the villa at some point in time before, and he had left a cigarette burn on the billiard table, and she told me that was my dad that had done it.</span> <span id="s30">She was a beautiful woman of very aristocratic background.</span> <span id="s31">Her children lived in Johannesburg, and her husband had been, I believe an ambassador to somewhere for Greece, one of the eastern countries.</span> <span id="s32">She was affluent, but the money, I don’t know where it came from.</span> <span id="s33">And I remember that I had to pretend to be a Christian, and the only thing I had to do was go to a church one Sunday, with my mom, and pretend to cross myself.</span> <span id="s34">I had to do it, my mother said, in order, I suppose, to prove to the neighbors that we were indeed Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: How did you know this woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">E: The relationship was what Sam accounted for.</span> <span id="s37">That is what I remember, and I think he’s correct, in that my aunt was a widow of the Albanian War, and so was Mrs. Sayianou.</span> <span id="s38">And she liked my Aunt Esther, and when things were becoming very evident that something was going to happen to us as Jews, and what was happening in the war, she had told Aunt Esther that if ever you need help, you and your sister and her children, or your family, will be protected by me.</span> <span id="s39">So she is the one, indeed, one of those Christians that put her life on the line, to save us.</span> <span id="s40">But I also remember that in that area of Nea Smirni where we were hiding in that villa with Mrs. Sayianou, I knew, because there must have been conversations at home, that there were many Jewish families that were being hidden at the same time within that area, even though we were two blocks away from a German camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: A camp?</span> <span id="s42">Or the S.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">E: I don’t know if they were S.S. or what they were, but it was the Germans that were two blocks away from us, within the vicinity, very close.</span> <span id="s44">I remember that.</span> <span id="s45">After five years of graduating high school, graduating business school, and working for the “Jewish World,” I saved my money and after I became a citizen I wanted to go back.</span> <span id="s46">The pull back to my native land was very strong, and it remains as strong today, but I have accepted it that I can’t be there.</span> <span id="s47">And I’m not my own person to say.</span> <span id="s48">“I’m going to do this.’</span> <span id="s49">I have other responsibilities to meet.</span> <span id="s50">So I went back in ’56 and one of the first things I did was go back and visit Mrs. Sayianou, who was at the time still alive, and I went back to the villa.</span> <span id="s51">I took the bus and I knew exactly where to get off to go to her home, and I had a nice visit with her.</span> <span id="s52">Then when I went back in 1970 with my husband, she was gone.</span> <span id="s53">But I was a 19-year-old at the time and not, of course, having the maturity, although I’d like to think some wisdom and understanding of what took place in Greece and in the world and in my life.</span> <span id="s54">I would like to have seen her in these years, these older, more mature years, and talked to her, because she must have been one of those special people.</span> <span id="s55">She had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Oh, yes, because you think, here she had brought into her house a woman and five small children, and she couldn’t conceal it all.</span> <span id="s57">I mean, everybody in the other villas around must have known.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">E: Not that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s59">It was a time of war.</span> <span id="s60">Everybody’s lives were…</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: There were a lot of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">E: That’s right.</span> <span id="s63">Nothing was really normal, in that sense.</span> <span id="s64">So people could accept the fact that we came from a northern village, and whatever story you could give them.</span> <span id="s65">Most people would take it for what it was that you were saying.</span> <span id="s66">But also, I think, like Sam, that the level of anti-Semitism was never to the height that it was in Poland or in Russia or in any of the eastern countries.</span> <span id="s67">I think anti-Semitism is everywhere, and it was in Greece, but not on the level of those countries.</span> <span id="s68">I think you found more humane people in the Greeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I know so many people said Polish people could “smell” a Jew.</span> <span id="s70">They always “knew” who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s71">And I don’t get that feeling here, although Sam said on the other tape that he didn’t “look” Jewish.</span> <span id="s72">When the Germans came to take the men from the synagogue, they kicked him out.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">E: Well, I didn’t look Jewish at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Okay, Mary.</span> <span id="s75">You would like to add something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">M: Yes.</span> <span id="s77">I want to add about the anti-Semitism part.</span> <span id="s78">I’ve always grown up with the opposite feeling, and that’s maybe because my memories are more after the war, and I think maybe the anti-Semitism in Greece came out much stronger after the war, because they both failed to tell you that when we went into hiding, that we put all our belongings in storage with neighbors.</span> <span id="s79">When we came back they would not give it back to us.</span> <span id="s80">That’s number one story.</span> <span id="s81">Just an example.</span> <span id="s82">I always had a very strong feeling of being scared that people knew I was Jewish in Greece after the war.</span> <span id="s83">And the other example which they forgot to tell you is – it’s like a Turkish-Israeli law – people don’t own homes that much in Greece, and especially at that time.</span> <span id="s84">But the longer you lived in an apartment, a house, the more it was as though you owned it.</span> <span id="s85">You had certain rights.</span> <span id="s86">When my mother came back after the war, and tried to claim back her home, the court people or the policeman or whoever she went to get her home back, said, “Why do you Jews make trouble?</span> <span id="s87">They should’ve killed you all.”</span> <span id="s88">Instead of feeling sorry for this woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">E: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">M: You hadn’t ever heard that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">E: No.</span> <span id="s92">This is the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Now, when were you born, Mary?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">M: ’39.</span> <span id="s95">And I do remember a lot of name-calling and a lot of feelings.</span> <span id="s96">Maybe by then we were becoming – what is the word – neurotic about it, paranoid.</span> <span id="s97">Maybe we were, and maybe I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">E: Oh, I remember the name-calling in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">M: So it wasn’t just kids.</span> <span id="s100">It was adults, and it was the feeling, so I have always grown up with the feeling – my favorite expression, which I told you today, “mixed blessing”—that there were very good Greek people, but Greeks are really, I feel, very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s101">I don’t know if they are or not, but I grew up with that feeling.</span> <span id="s102">Now I’m trying to change that, because when we got here the Greek community was very supportive of my mother.</span> <span id="s103">Yet we had no Greek friends.</span> <span id="s104">So I can’t account for why we don’t have Greek friends here, none.</span> <span id="s105">And it’s always because they don’t really accept us, because we’re not Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: They’re Greek Orthodox.</span> <span id="s107">And you’re Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">M: We are Jewish.</span> <span id="s109">So I did want to speak on that anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">E: Well, it’s a mixed thing.</span> <span id="s111">What I was saying, on the total scale, when you’re looking at the kind of anti-Semitism that took place in Poland and Russia and Germany, the Greek story is not the same.</span> <span id="s112">The Greek level of anti-Semitism never reached that kind.</span> <span id="s113">But anti-Semitism, yes.</span> <span id="s114">Anti-Semitism is everywhere.</span> <span id="s115">And will always be everywhere.</span> <span id="s116">It’s the level that we are able to control that makes the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: You say Aunt Tula and Aunt Esther took the children.</span> <span id="s118">They were your aunts?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">E: They were my mother’s sisters.</span> <span id="s120">They went to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: How old were the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">E: I have a picture of the young one.</span> <span id="s123">They’re beautiful babies.</span> <span id="s124">Less than a year old.</span> <span id="s125">Beautiful blonde little children.</span> <span id="s126">And then my mother came back and we went into hiding.</span> <span id="s127">And also, another memory I have that Sam doesn’t talk about, is that during the war, when my dad was back, he was doing so well that I remember the people on the corner across the street, because of the lack of food, they had become very blown up.</span> <span id="s128">It was edema.</span> <span id="s129">The lack of nutrition was causing that.</span> <span id="s130">And I remember going down to the basement – and to this day I can still see it, the staples, the food that was there, the potatoes, wheat, whatever.</span> <span id="s131">And I remember dad giving it to these people</span></p> <p><span id="s132">M: But at what point of the war are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">E: It had to be before he was taken.</span> <span id="s134">It had to be before ’44 between the time ’40 and ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">M: Maybe when the Italians were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">E: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s137">I don’t remember all that, but I remember the food.</span> <span id="s138">I can see it to this day, the buckets of food that were in the basement, and they were giving it to these people because we had so much, and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s139">But he was a very clever man, and I am convinced, to this day, as many Jews that survived the war, that came back, that there in the same kind of role making a living, that they became very successful.</span> <span id="s140">I’m convinced my dad would have been one of those people, because he was a go-getter.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, he had so many things going at once.</span> <span id="s142">He had the jewelry stand, which I remember.</span> <span id="s143">And to this day, we have some beautiful pieces jewelry because of the stand that he had.</span> <span id="s144">My mother was not a jewelry person, she only kept them for value, not because she liked them.</span> <span id="s145">And I remember the stand that my dad had.</span> <span id="s146">I had gone back to the square where the transactions took place in Athens, and I remember that little square.</span> <span id="s147">He had enough money to buy jewelry from people, and when he did, and he saw something, he would say to my mom, “Do you want this?”</span> <span id="s148">And that’s how we ended up with some nice pieces.</span> <span id="s149">I also remember going in my mother’s room and seeing on top of the dresser a stack of money that he would leave for her.</span> <span id="s150">So he did well.</span> <span id="s151">How he did it, I don’t know, but he did well.</span> <span id="s152">The difficult times came after he was taken.</span> <span id="s153">And I remember the holidays.</span> <span id="s154">I remember them opening the whole house and making a long table with white tablecloths for Passover.</span> <span id="s155">And then after the war, my mom would not celebrate Passover any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">M: She wouldn’t celebrate any holidays.</span> <span id="s157">We used to go to the synagogue without her and come home, and she’d be waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">E: She denied.</span> <span id="s159">I went to Temple on my own.</span> <span id="s160">I would take the bus and go to Temple on my own.</span> <span id="s161">We always had a feeling for our Judaism.</span> <span id="s162">We went to a parochial school, that’s what Sam meant, like a Talmud Torah, we had in Athens.</span> <span id="s163">All the Jewish kids went, and it was part of the public education.</span> <span id="s164">That was the grade school years.</span> <span id="s165">You got your Hebrew education along with your secular education.</span> <span id="s166">We had the Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s167">I remember him hitting my knuckles because I made fun of him.</span> <span id="s168">I was a devil.</span> <span id="s169">And I have pictures of doing Hanukah, and dressing up as Queen Esther.</span> <span id="s170">We had a wonderful Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s171">We had Hebrew, I think, one hour a day, classes every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Were the teachers Jewish in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">E: No, not all of them.</span> <span id="s174">I remember the teacher, she was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s175">But the Jewish teacher, the man, the one that taught us the Hebrew was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Do you remember, were all the children going to their own various parochial schools?</span> <span id="s177">Is that how the public school were set up?</span> <span id="s178">There were some schools for Jews, some schools for Greek Orthodox, some schools for Catholics?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">E&amp;M: No, everybody else was Greek Orthodox!</span></p> <p><span id="s180">E: The only minority would have been the Catholics.</span> <span id="s181">But the majority of the people were Greek Orthodox.</span> <span id="s182">Whether they were observant or not, that’s what they were</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Now, did all the Jews live in one part of town?</span> <span id="s184">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">E: Well, in the area that we lived in, it was predominately Jewish, like you would say the West Side, or Highland Park.</span> <span id="s186">Not everybody on our street was, but maybe ten families out of the whole block were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">M: I think the area was Jewish, because the synagogue was walking distance from our house.</span> <span id="s188">And it was the only synagogue in Athens, ever.</span> <span id="s189">And to this day it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you keep a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">M: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">E: I don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s193">The only thing I do remember distinctly is that Ma had kosher chickens for Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">M: How did she get them, if they were kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">E: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">M: I remember here that she got kosher chickens from the butcher, Rabbi Melzer on Broadway.</span> <span id="s197">She used to go to the market and get them and have them killed and feathered and the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">E: But she only did it on holidays.</span> <span id="s199">It was not a daily practice.</span> <span id="s200">And I don’t remember anyone in the neighborhood observing that.</span> <span id="s201">And when you ask about the Yiddish, what we speak, what the southern Europeans speak is Ladino.</span> <span id="s202">And that’s Spanish and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s203">But we, in our family, did not speak it.</span> <span id="s204">But if you went down to the synagogue, you would hear a lot of people speak Ladino.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">M: Do you know that for a fact?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">E: Yes.</span> <span id="s207">And I think today, if you go to Greece before me, you could check it out.</span> <span id="s208">Who knows when I’ll get there?</span> <span id="s209">Four years from now, when they all graduate!</span> <span id="s210">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: How many times have you traveled back to Greece?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">E: Just twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">M: Four.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Four times.</span> <span id="s215">Do you go together?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">M: No.</span> <span id="s217">I was the first one to return.</span> <span id="s218">I was the first one of the family to go.</span> <span id="s219">I think another point that I would like to make, that Sam made, the fact of marrying your daughters off without the dowry, that certainly was a big factor in her desire to emigrate.</span> <span id="s220">But the other factor was an education.</span> <span id="s221">She really believed and wanted us to be educated, and in Greece, secondary education is not free.</span> <span id="s222">So she considered that a big factor, and knew that within her means, even though we could sustain ourselves, it was not the kind of income that would allow her to educate five people.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Yes, because now, after the war, when you came back to your room in what had been your house, and your father was gone, what supported you was Sam’s cab.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">E: Sam didn’t drive the cab.</span> <span id="s225">It was my mother’s cab, and my mother hired it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Oh, I thought Sam was driving it part of the time.</span> <span id="s227">And your mother was still working as a seamstress?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">E: No.</span> <span id="s229">I don’t recall my mother ever working as a seamstress in Greece.</span> <span id="s230">I think she had the talent, and maybe she did it when she was young, but I don’t ever recall her…</span></p> <p><span id="s231">M: She worked as a seamstress here.</span> <span id="s232">She worked here, when we all had to go on our own, and because she had the talent for that, then she did that as her livelihood.</span> <span id="s233">But during the years of her marriage she never worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Then when you came here you were what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">E: I was fourteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">M: Twelve.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Had you learned any English?</span> <span id="s238">Had you been studying it?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">M&amp;E: No, none of us knew English at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: What happened when you came?</span> <span id="s241">Where did you go to school?</span> <span id="s242">How did you learn English?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">E: We came in March, and I don’t think they put us in school until the following September.</span> <span id="s244">I don’t remember going to school right away, but I do remember that the first summer I was sent to Herzl camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">M: And I hated it.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">E: She hated it, I loved it.</span> <span id="s247">I loved it and I stayed on.</span> <span id="s248">And that was a very good source of learning English.</span> <span id="s249">And then the following fall they put us in high school.</span> <span id="s250">There was no bilingual/ESL program then.</span> <span id="s251">They threw you into the sea, and made you swim!</span></p> <p><span id="s252">M: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s253">I remember now, I think between March and Herzl camp, we went to the International Institute and the American Jewish Service.</span> <span id="s254">I have pictures for you, if you want me to find them for you.</span> <span id="s255">They’re in the closet.</span> <span id="s256">The American Jewish Service also gave us English lessons, so I think that must have been the period that we were doing that.</span> <span id="s257">Before summer.</span> <span id="s258">And then, I was twelve, and I was put into the third grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">E: Third grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">M: Third Grade!</span> <span id="s261">Don’t think it wasn’t hard, Evy.</span> <span id="s262">I was the tallest, biggest person there was in third grade.</span> <span id="s263">And within a year – I didn’t belong in third grade, they put me in third grade to start somewhere – within a year I was up to my level, which was up to their level, ninth grade.</span> <span id="s264">So the first year I spent going from third to ninth.</span> <span id="s265">They kept shifting me every couple of months, and then the following year I went to Mechanic Arts as a ninth grader.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">E: And they put me in Mechanic Arts as a tenth grader, cold, because I had finished grade school in Athens, and had finished exams, and had entered the gymnasium in Athens.</span> <span id="s267">I had been there for three months when my mother came and asked us, each individually – I remember that – and I remember my answer was “No.”</span> <span id="s268">And my mom said I was the only one that said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">M: I don’t remember being asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">E: I want to back up and say…Are you through with the lower years, or are you going to go back?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Whatever you want to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">M: Okay.</span> <span id="s273">Emotionally, for me, now, the tears will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">E: Don’t say it if you can’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">M: It’s important.</span> <span id="s276">Evy said that I hated Herzl.</span> <span id="s277">Right after the war, my mother was left with the five kids, and also, what Sam did not touch upon, was my mother’s emotional state after the war on finding out that she was alone.</span> <span id="s278">And so she had to…I’ll get there…(much crying).</span> <span id="s279">They had set up an orphanage for people who had lost everybody, or people that needed help, and my mother had the five kids, so she put two of us in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s280">And that was me, and her.</span> <span id="s281">Evy’s a very feisty, knowing person, and so she wouldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s282">She would keep running away.</span> <span id="s283">And I grew up always trying to please everybody, so I was very accepting, but very miserable.</span> <span id="s284">And they brought Esther in there with me, and both Esther and I were very, very miserable.</span> <span id="s285">I think I was there for at least two years, and I think it’s one of the most affected times.</span> <span id="s286">And my mother was great.</span> <span id="s287">(Still crying).</span> <span id="s288">I think she probably had the guilt, very badly.</span> <span id="s289">She always used to come, all loaded down with food…Oh, I also had anemia.</span> <span id="s290">I forgot that I was very sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">E: We all did.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">M: You weren’t in the orphanage at that time.</span> <span id="s293">You didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s294">But I spent three months in the infirmary of the orphanage.</span> <span id="s295">So not only was I in an orphanage, but I was isolated from the kids, for three months.</span> <span id="s296">And they kept giving me B-12 shots, every day or twice a day, and my mother used to come, all loaded down.</span> <span id="s297">She used to bring me raw spleen, and raw eggs.</span> <span id="s298">But probably, in reviewing some of this, it hits you, after 45 years, and that that’s probably why I hated Herzl camp, because here I was being taken away from her again.</span> <span id="s299">It was a miserable, terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Was the orphanage near your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">E: It was like St. Louis Park, from here.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">M: But you have to remember the times too.</span> <span id="s303">The transportation was not good, so it was like going to the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Who supported this orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">E: It was the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">M: The United Jewish Appeal.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">E: I can’t see it being from the Jewish community of Athens, because nobody had anything.</span> <span id="s308">These were people who were trying to help themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">M: Does anybody want to hear a funny thing?</span> <span id="s310">Why it disbanded?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">M: Because the director was sexually abusing the girls!</span> <span id="s313">Can you believe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Right after World War II.</span> <span id="s315">How many children were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">M: I don’t know numbers, but I have a picture.</span> <span id="s317">You want a picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s319">I would like to see your pictures.</span> <span id="s320">And possibly borrow some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">M: It must have been 25-35 kids.</span> <span id="s322">There were quite a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: It was boys and girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">M: Yes, it was for both.</span> <span id="s325">And it was a place that was supposed to give parents a chance to put their homes and lives together, with not as much responsibility.</span> <span id="s326">But I didn’t stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Maybe instead of calling it an orphanage, you’d almost call it a boarding school?</span> <span id="s328">Did you go home on weekends?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">E: No.</span> <span id="s330">The parents came to visit.</span> <span id="s331">And I think some of those kids – I don’t remember, because I didn’t stay.</span> <span id="s332">I don’t know how long I lasted, but I kept on running away all the time.</span> <span id="s333">And I made such a ruckus that she had no choice but to take me home.</span> <span id="s334">They couldn’t handle me any more.</span> <span id="s335">I was not going to stay, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s336">And you know, in retrospect, when I think back about how we all handled the war, and what we did as children at the time, I see how we act today, and how we face life today.</span> <span id="s337">I tend to think that so much of what we are is genetic.</span> <span id="s338">Why was I that strong, and not her?</span> <span id="s339">Why was she so accepting?</span> <span id="s340">We went through the experiences of losing, and whatever, the same, right?</span> <span id="s341">And I find that fascinating.</span> <span id="s342">Today, we tend to deal with life the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: You got interrupted back there.</span> <span id="s344">You were talking about the orphanage, and how much you hated it.</span> <span id="s345">And you were there for two years.</span> <span id="s346">Then how did you happen to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">M: I told you, it was disbanded because of the scandal.</span> <span id="s348">It was a terrible scandal.</span> <span id="s349">You know when Sam told you why we didn’t go to Israel?</span> <span id="s350">The girls’ virginity was so protected and important at that time, and just the idea that this was going on, really, all the mothers, they never would…</span></p> <p><span id="s351">E: Also, mother heard a lot of feedback coming back from Israel.</span> <span id="s352">What she also heard was the difficulty, the Spartan life in Israel, which indeed it was, and she didn’t want that.</span> <span id="s353">She said, “I’m not going to subject my family to that.”</span> <span id="s354">America sounded more promising to her, and easier.</span> <span id="s355">She wasn’t a Zionist in the sense that she would choose Israel above America.</span> <span id="s356">She was looking for what was best for us.</span> <span id="s357">And for her, she never really made the transition.</span> <span id="s358">She was forever looking for Greece, I think, the climate, anyway.</span> <span id="s359">She was forever moving to Florida.</span> <span id="s360">We were forever leaving Minnesota and the cold weather of Minnesota.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">M: Well it was very hard on her.</span> <span id="s362">Do you know what her “welcome home” to America was?</span> <span id="s363">We came in April…</span></p> <p><span id="s364">E: March.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">M: March?</span> <span id="s366">Well, whatever, it was very near Pesach, and they had sent us to Mount Zion for the Seders.</span> <span id="s367">Well, we did not speak a word of English, and we had a good time, I remember, but I really found it odd; I don’t recall anyone taking us there, being our hostess.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">E: How did we get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">M: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s370">But that’s my point.</span> <span id="s371">Coming home from Mount Zion temple, she fell, and she broke all her teeth on the ice.</span> <span id="s372">I don’t know if she broke all of them, or being that we were on the Jewish Family Service help, it was cheaper for them to pull all her teeth, and that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s373">She had dentures from the time we came, which was too early for a young person.</span> <span id="s374">But that was her welcome to America.</span> <span id="s375">She was a real, real, real special lady.</span> <span id="s376">I think she put in her mourning and bitterness in the beginning of the war in Greece, but here, she never, ever complained.</span> <span id="s377">She knew her purpose in life, which was to make sure that we all (crying again).</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Married, did well, had homes and children.</span> <span id="s379">I think that’s what our mothers have always wanted for us, and what we want for our children.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">E: Well, I think she was special in the fact that I don’t ever recall complaining, and “Why did I come here?”</span> <span id="s381">and any of that stuff.</span> <span id="s382">Never!</span> <span id="s383">She never complained, and she was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">M: I don’t think she was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">E: Oh, yes, I think she was in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">M: Well, she was happy the day I got married!</span> <span id="s387">On those days she was very happy!</span> <span id="s388">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s389">E: She was, and I think the saddest of all, for her life, was – and I don’t know how these things work – that she would become ill, and die, before…(crying).</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Before she saw the grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">E: And some accomplishments in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Were you involved with the New Americans Club, or any organizations like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">E: No.</span> <span id="s394">We educated ourselves, we worked, we married, and raised our family, and made our place in the Jewish community, on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">M: She did make a couple of Greek-Jewish friends here, towards the end.</span> <span id="s396">But you know – is the word irony?</span> <span id="s397">– I don’t know very much about it, but we also missed any help in restitutions, because we were so young, and nobody informed us we had that coming.</span> <span id="s398">No one.</span> <span id="s399">To this day I can’t understand how people can be under a Jewish agency’s care and they neglect…</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Were there substantial reparations to the Greeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">M: I think there were.</span> <span id="s402">Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">E: I don’t think so, Mary.</span> <span id="s404">When I heard that the money was coming in, from those people like the Levys…</span></p> <p><span id="s405">M: Because they were Polish.</span> <span id="s406">First of all because they were survivors of the death camps.</span> <span id="s407">Now we are survivors, but not of the camps.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know why they didn’t, but they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">E: Because of the cab in Greece.</span> <span id="s410">My conclusion now is that it was not a lower profession, as it is here.</span> <span id="s411">And so it was an easy way to get a job.</span> <span id="s412">I remember Sam driving a cab very early on.</span> <span id="s413">And then, somehow, along the way, he got interested in being a waiter.</span> <span id="s414">And he became a very good maitre d’.</span> <span id="s415">He worked at the Leamington for a number of years, when the Leamington was at it’s height.</span> <span id="s416">He worked at Charlie’s for a number of years and he was maitre d’ at Coleman’s in the village, until it burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">M: He can’t work well with people.</span> <span id="s418">He had this difficulty.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">E: And then about ten years ago he made a move to New York, and whatever he did in New York, a lot of it was in the restaurant business.</span> <span id="s420">When he came back here, he no longer had the stamina to be in the restaurant business, so he went into the cab, which was the next thing he knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: I assume that in the European tradition, since he was the oldest.</span> <span id="s422">And he was the boy, and his father was gone, he felt that he was responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">E: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s424">And I think and I hope he never hears of this, but I think in his way, and now again, with teenage kids, it was a lot of pressure for him.</span> <span id="s425">And so instead of positive, I think he rebelled negatively.</span> <span id="s426">In other words…how do you say it…</span></p> <p><span id="s427">M: He didn’t deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">E: Yes.</span> <span id="s429">It became a negative part of his life.</span> <span id="s430">And I think all of us, we made the transition and found, quote-unquote, good lives here, and made good lives.</span> <span id="s431">For him, he’s the victim of the war, for our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">M: Oh, I don’t know about that, Evy.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">E: I think so.</span> <span id="s434">Well, emotionally, maybe, we all carry scars.</span> <span id="s435">But I think for him, I see him as the victim.</span> <span id="s436">Maybe because of his personality, maybe because a boy growing up without the father image, without the father, the responsibility became too heavy.</span> <span id="s437">Whatever the circumstances that played into his life, I see him as the victim, more so than the rest of us.</span> <span id="s438">We all carry scars and we all will, but we have made adjustments and we have made progress with our lives.</span> <span id="s439">We have homes, we educated ourselves, we have children, they’re educating themselves.</span> <span id="s440">There’s progress and continuity of what’s positive, where for him, it’s not.</span> <span id="s441">And so I do see him as a victim.</span> <span id="s442">Psychologically, the toll was heavier for him than for any of the rest of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">M: We’ve got to give her (the interviewer) a chance to lead us.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: No, I think you’re saying some things that give us an insight into what happened to people, things that don’t show on the surface.</span> <span id="s445">What happened inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">I was just going to say, “What do you remember of liberation day?”</span></p> <p><span id="s447">E: I don’t remember anything.</span> <span id="s448">The only thing that I remember as a “happening” in Athens is the day that Israel was declared a nation.</span> <span id="s449">I remember that day.</span> <span id="s450">I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">M: Where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">E: I don’t know where you were, but I was with mom in Constitution Square, and the vivid memory that I have is people everywhere, and happiness.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">M: The Greeks were glad we were a state?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">E: Maybe it was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s455">Maybe I have it mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">M: I can’t imagine Greece would have been so happy to have Israel a state.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: How many Jews were left in Athens?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">E: From what I have read and I have learned on my own, I thought that there were between 65 and 70,000 in Greece.</span> <span id="s459">That’s the figure that remains in my head.</span> <span id="s460">There were only 5,000 remaining in Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">M: I know the population.</span> <span id="s462">I read the book.</span> <span id="s463">I have information for you.</span> <span id="s464">It was 5,000 before the war, and it’s about 5,000 now.</span> <span id="s465">But right after the war.</span> <span id="s466">.</span> <span id="s467">,.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">E: (interrupts).</span> <span id="s469">They all came to Athens.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">M: No.</span> <span id="s471">they all died, Evy.</span> <span id="s472">It’s been built up top 5,000 again.</span> <span id="s473">I don’t know what was left after the war.</span> <span id="s474">Everybody left.</span> <span id="s475">Everybody went to Israel or America.</span> <span id="s476">There were very few families that stayed on.</span> <span id="s477">(Argument continues).</span> <span id="s478">But now this is 30 years later, and people have come back, and married, and had children.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">E: I only know that when I went back in 1970, we went to a wedding of Jewish friends that we lived with in the same courtyard.</span> <span id="s480">They became very successful in Athens.</span> <span id="s481">We were invited to the wedding and we went to the synagogue, where my father was taken from, where I grew up, and the same rabbi that taught me Sunday school was still alive, and was marrying that couple.</span> <span id="s482">He is well known, and people that know the history of the Jews in Athens know that was Rabbi Delazar.</span> <span id="s483">In 1970 he must have been 80 years old then, and he survived, and was dashing to the same synagogue that the Holocaust took place from.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: There’s one question here, I didn’t ask Sam, and I should ask you.</span> <span id="s485">Has your belief or practice in Judaism, or God, a Supreme Being, changed, do you think?</span> <span id="s486">Do you think you’re more observant than your parents were, perhaps, or less?</span> <span id="s487">Was there any question, “Do I want to be part of this Jewish community?”</span> <span id="s488">Do you belong to Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">M&amp;E: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">E: Mary’s still active.</span> <span id="s491">I was very active up until I started working again full-time, which was about five years ago.</span> <span id="s492">But we were always members of the Temple of Aaron from Day One, when they gave us free membership until we assumed it on our own.</span> <span id="s493">And I am still a member of the Temple of Aaron.</span> <span id="s494">So are my children.</span> <span id="s495">My son teaches Sunday School, and now my husband has become principal of the Religious School of the Temple of Aaron.</span> <span id="s496">I have always found comfort and I found my place, in a way, in the community through my temple.</span> <span id="s497">Being Jewish is very important.</span> <span id="s498">I’m very proud of being Jewish, and Greek.</span> <span id="s499">I think it’s a wonderful double heritage.</span> <span id="s500">And I don’t want to question, because there are no answers, “Why did this happen to me?”</span> <span id="s501">Maybe I’m a better person today because of what happened to me.</span> <span id="s502">I tend to think that I’m a more humane and caring person.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: You understand better, maybe, if you suffered?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">E: I tend to think that in order to grow you have to experience pain.</span> <span id="s505">It doesn’t necessarily have to be the pain of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s506">I could have done better without it, maybe (laughs), but the fact that I had to be taken away from my heritage, my home, had to start all over again, it was a difficult process not only learning and assimilating, but being accepted again as a Jew in a Jewish community, because you forever are different.</span> <span id="s507">And to this day I’m still different.</span> <span id="s508">When we came, it was not as “in vogue” or as acceptable to be an immigrant.</span> <span id="s509">Whether you’re in the Jewish community or the gentile community, today the assimilation of the different cultures is more acceptable than it was at the time we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: I think what we say is, “It’s ‘in’ to be ethnic.”</span></p> <p><span id="s511">E: It was not “in” to be ethnic 30 years ago, so consequently the acceptance of people was more difficult, and we had to prove ourselves, and we did it in the Jewish community, as my sister Esther did it in the Duluth community.</span> <span id="s512">And she has done a beautiful job making a place for herself, working through and for Jewish causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Where’s your fourth sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">E: She’s in Winnetka, Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: And she’s married too?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">E: We all married Jewish.</span> <span id="s517">She didn’t work as hard, but that’s for different reasons.</span> <span id="s518">She lived in different areas.</span> <span id="s519">She lived in Connecticut for a while.</span> <span id="s520">She tried, but the Jewish community’s more populous, it’s a different setting for us to work with, than what she had, as the same thing for Esther in Duluth.</span> <span id="s521">But we all made Jewish homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Mary, would you like to speak to the question I asked about has your belief changed?</span> <span id="s523">Has this made you a different person?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">M: My belief in God fluctuates very much.</span> <span id="s525">But I think I’ve always, I basically believe in God.</span> <span id="s526">Not necessarily in all the ritual that means Judaism.</span> <span id="s527">I’m very, very strong in my belief in the Jewish people, and I’m also very, very strong in my belief in the organizations, like the United Jewish Fund, and the Joint, and Hadassah, and all that, and I feel that without their help – not necessarily each one, for sure the United Jewish Fund, which I think is also the Joint – and I will never forget that it was Joint’s help that brought us over, so I always feel that I have to support Israel and anything associated with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s528">I feel a very strong pride in the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s529">I used to be almost arrogant in my belief not necessarily outwardly, but inside, in my belief that the Jewish people were better than the rest of the people.</span> <span id="s530">I’ve kind of become a little bit more open-minded about that (laughs) but I still think that I’m very strong in my belief in the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s531">That’s it.</span> <span id="s532">So I feel that I have to support all that I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Now, as I have asked Sam, is there anything I didn’t think to ask you that I should have, that you would like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">E: I probably will think of it after I leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s536">You can call me up and say, “Come back with the tape recorder!”</span> <span id="s537">I would really like to see your pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">E: I was searching for them, but I didn’t know where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">M: I have some.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s541">PAGE 9</span></p> <p><span id="s542">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s543">PAGE 9</span></p></body></html>
