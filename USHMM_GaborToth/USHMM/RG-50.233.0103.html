id="s4">Q: We are speaking with Mr. Jack Polak about his father, Fredrik Polak.</span> <span id="s5">The date is March 2, 1992.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Mr. Polak, what could you tell us about your father?</span> <span id="s7">Can you tell us first his date of birth and place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: He was born in Amsterdam in August 1883.</span> <span id="s9">He was part of a very religious family, was the smartest of five children.</span> <span id="s10">One died very early.</span> <span id="s11">He had three sisters and one brother.</span> <span id="s12">So, there were six children, one must have died early, and the other four, he had one blind brother and three sisters, all married.</span> <span id="s13">Two sisters without children, one sister without children.</span> <span id="s14">None came back.</span> <span id="s15">My father worked himself to become an accountant.</span> <span id="s16">He was a very respected member of the Jewish community, as well as of the general community he was a learned man.</span> <span id="s17">He was a fantastic friend for children.</span> <span id="s18">I do recall distinctively that in summer vacations when we went to the seashore in Holland, all the children of all nephews and even many friends always came to him telling stories and even today I have certain stories and certain songs my father was singing at those seashores which my grandchildren now treasure because they know it comes from their grandfather who they never knew.</span> <span id="s19">He worked himself as an accountant very hard, however never knew how to make money on it because he became an accountant of many charitable organizations and on which he always charged the minimum.</span> <span id="s20">As such his entire life he went through week by week also many members of his family depended on him.</span> <span id="s21">He had to pay for his blind brother, he had to support his sisters many times, and as such we know he had always a hard time.</span> <span id="s22">Still, he was always happy and my father and mother had a very happy marriage and he was also able to bring the joy of being part of the orthodox family to us.</span> <span id="s23">The Friday nights were wonderful testimony of how an orthodox family should live a Shabbat.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Do you know about how he met your mother and when, and when they got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I don’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s26">All I know is it was a very close relationship in all the sisters of my mother.</span> <span id="s27">I will talk to you about my mother in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s28">My mother came from a well- known family in Holland and every Thursday night all brothers and sisters of that family came together at one of the homes of one of the sisters of the family of my mother.</span> <span id="s29">And these wonderful, joyful occasions for all of them to come together.</span> <span id="s30">Almost none of them came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: So your parents met then and married probably in the early turn of the century.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: They must have married, because I was born in 1912.</span> <span id="s33">There was one son born to them who died very young, at one or two years old.</span> <span id="s34">So I would say that they must have gotten married maybe in 1907 or 1908.</span> <span id="s35">That is what I suspect.</span> <span id="s36">They lived in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s37">My mother was a teacher.</span> <span id="s38">She was a teacher in shorthand and she was a teacher in (asked his wife) how do you call that?</span> <span id="s39">Wife: Sewing, but its not sewing clothes, it’s like embroidery and fancy stitches.</span> <span id="s40">I don’t know how you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Crafts?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Something, anyway she was teaching in the Jewish elementary school.</span> <span id="s43">I know there was once a problem because, although they were orthodox, she never wear a wig and they wanted her to wear a wig.</span> <span id="s44">There was a big commotion in the Jewish community because how can a Jewish teacher in a Jewish community teach.</span> <span id="s45">But she got a certificate from the doctor that it would endanger her health to wear it and she got away with it.</span> <span id="s46">I remember there was a big discussion about it at that time.</span> <span id="s47">She was a very respected teacher in every way.</span> <span id="s48">Not only that she later became part of the federal examination procedures in which she was part, really, of federal (wife: What they did is when you did your final exams from high school which were really exams, not just a test, official, the government would send a delegate to sit in on the orals.</span> <span id="s49">First the written on all subjects and then the oral.</span> <span id="s50">And they would send always one person to sit there so the schoolteacher would ask the question and not add something, it was honor.)</span> <span id="s51">We lived in the first years of my life on the second floor of a house which was very cramped quarters.</span> <span id="s52">Certainly not rich living, to the contrary, it was very poor living.</span> <span id="s53">I recall my own Bar Mitzvah reception was done at our home and people had to crawl on steps which were very narrow.</span> <span id="s54">Even Bar Mitzvah parties were not comparable, still I remember my Bar Mitzvah having a dinner Friday night, which was a fantastic dinner, at our home pre-prepared themselves and the reception all prepared only at our own home.</span> <span id="s55">All our lives we were just making it.</span> <span id="s56">During the summer my parents always took in paying guests.</span> <span id="s57">That way they were able to give us a summer vacation on the seashore.</span> <span id="s58">We always had paying guests.</span> <span id="s59">In fact, one of the young paying guests we had is now living in Scarsdale.</span> <span id="s60">I always remember that little boy who came to us because his parents, at that time, paid us for him to stay with us at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: So, it seems your family life was very happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Can you tell us what you know about what happened to your mother during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: My father and mother, I would say after I joined the ___________ practice, maybe I’m more materialistic than my mother and father, I really showed him that he should charge more and somewhere they got a much nicer living after I joined them.</span> <span id="s65">We were able to make some money and save a little bit money and they were able to move to better quarters, and I would say the last years of their life was much happier.</span> <span id="s66">Of course, they had their daughters.</span> <span id="s67">They had my older sister who was married to a very successful businessman and a nice man, although he may have been a womanizer, he was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s68">I was very proud of the family.</span> <span id="s69">My younger sister, who married that young columnist, was the darling of my father and they always compare my daughter and me with my sister and my father.</span> <span id="s70">I think I am treating my daughter the same way as my father treated his favorite, my sister Betty, and even today I have to talk to my youngest sister always, that Betty was always the love of her father.</span> <span id="s71">She knows that and she knew how to handle him too.</span> <span id="s72">Betty had a very interesting life and she was a wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s73">Even my first wife, like I say, was crazy about my father.</span> <span id="s74">My father was a fantastic man.</span> <span id="s75">Even today when I talk to people, anybody I talk who knew my father always talks about him that he was such an unusual man.</span> <span id="s76">So, as such, I have the greatest memory.</span> <span id="s77">So we had a happy life and when the war started, yes, he saw they had no choice, they may have had a chance to go into hiding but it never dawned on them.</span> <span id="s78">It never dawned on all of us really how serious it was and what was going to happen to all of us.</span> <span id="s79">For the last year of his life he was able, because of his importance in the Jewish community, to stay longer than many other people.</span> <span id="s80">The deporting started in July 1942, he was taken away in June 1943, as such he was a little bit longer than the normal.</span> <span id="s81">He was taken last of all for another four weeks, but even then he was not important enough to be saved.</span> <span id="s82">So he was taken away on July 23, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Both of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Both, they were taken away.</span> <span id="s85">They went in a very prestigious train, there were several rabbis in that.</span> <span id="s86">I don’t know if you saw the movie.</span> <span id="s87">“Escape from Sobibor.”</span> <span id="s88">And you may recall how all these well-dressed people arrived in Sobibor.</span> <span id="s89">So my father and mother, the way they were dressed in their best clothes, arriving in Sobibor.</span> <span id="s90">And that was it.</span> <span id="s91">They died two days.</span> <span id="s92">Everybody who, I think the number is that 40,000 people went to Sobibor and I think about 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Fewer than 300 survived.</span> <span id="s94">Fifty people survived the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: You got the number from Engle, because he was one of the few survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Is there something about your mother’s personality that you could recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: My mother’s personality was also very outgoing, very friendly.</span> <span id="s98">A real mother.</span> <span id="s99">I don’t recall any fights my parents ever had.</span> <span id="s100">They were just a wonderful congenial gamily.</span> <span id="s101">My mother came from a quite a big family.</span> <span id="s102">Eight or nine brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s103">Her father had died at a very early age.</span> <span id="s104">He was in the diamond industry, and my grandmother lived for a long time died, I think in 1936 or 37.</span> <span id="s105">I knew my grandmother.</span> <span id="s106">My mother came from a very close-knit family.</span> <span id="s107">All the sisters came together almost, like I said, every Thursday night and from that family only three survived in hiding.</span> <span id="s108">A niece, interesting enough, other people were not orthodox people.</span> <span id="s109">From that family, the three people were not orthodox at all.</span> <span id="s110">One went with the Palestine transport to Palestine and they lost their only son and one other sister who went into hiding lost their only son and one sister and brother-in-law survived in hiding with their two children who are now living in Australia and the United States.</span> <span id="s111">She worked very hard.</span> <span id="s112">She made sure that we got a good upbringing, but in the meantime they were both working, they had to make a living and still I never had any idea of poverty.</span> <span id="s113">I knew there was no money, but I still never had no idea that we were poor at all.</span> <span id="s114">Although we were poor.</span> <span id="s115">As such we had a wonderful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Is there anything else about either of your parents that you can include?</span> <span id="s117">Do you know what they did in Westerbork?</span> <span id="s118">They were in Westerbork for a short time?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: They were in Westerbork from June 43 to July 43, only four weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: You weren’t even there yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: No, I came, I was there for one week with them, so I saw them really for one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: So that was the last time you saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: That was the last time I saw them.</span> <span id="s124">Just for one week.</span> <span id="s125">At that time already my young sister was with me.</span> <span id="s126">She was in Westerbork and my other sister, two sisters were in Westerbork with me at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: The families were allowed to meet and talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: In Westerbork you had close contact really.</span> <span id="s129">It was permitted.</span> <span id="s130">You could talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s131">In Bergen Belsen, it was much more difficult.</span> <span id="s132">There was work.</span> <span id="s133">When I worked in the kitchen from three o’clock in the morning, I didn’t see anybody, only certain people in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s134">That’s why I left little notes for my wife, just to say what I am doing and what is happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Well, I think that can conclude our discussion about your parents.</span> <span id="s136">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Sister Julia Bola</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: We are speaking to Mr. Polak about his sister, Julia Bola.</span> <span id="s139">Mr. Polak what can you tell us about Julia?</span> <span id="s140">When was she born, where was she born, what was she like as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: My sister Julia was a. I would say, a woman with problems.</span> <span id="s142">I hate to say that.</span> <span id="s143">Basically she always had emotional problems from early date on.</span> <span id="s144">She was in a way, she was beautiful.</span> <span id="s145">She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn’t make it easiest in life, and she suffered.</span> <span id="s146">I think somewhere by the fact that my father favored my younger sister at a later date.</span> <span id="s147">She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn’t have gotten married because he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly not the right man for her and she never recognized that.</span> <span id="s148">They fortunately I would say, had no children.</span> <span id="s149">They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in Holland.</span> <span id="s150">Both he and she were good speakers.</span> <span id="s151">They taught Hebrew.</span> <span id="s152">Her Hebrew was much better than mine.</span> <span id="s153">They were planning to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s154">I don’t recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in Holland and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war.</span> <span id="s155">She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in Amsterdam until July ’43.</span> <span id="s156">They were sent in the same transport as I to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s157">They also were put on the Palestine list.</span> <span id="s158">With the Palestine list they came to Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s159">Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the Palestine transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: That was in July 1944.</span> <span id="s162">She has a terrible time in Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s163">She deteriorated fast, she looked terrible when I last saw her, which was, as I recall, only the beginning of April 1945 in Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s164">We didn’t see each other too much because I worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s165">I do not know anything more than that they both went with the same train in those cattle cars in April 11, 1945 leaving Bergen Belsen and going to Germany.</span> <span id="s166">She was liberated together with me in Trovitz, near Leipzig and must have died two days after liberation.</span> <span id="s167">I learned that only, I would say, one week after I came out of a coma, they didn’t tell me right away, and in fact I do recall that about one week after I came out of the coma they told me that Roosevelt had died and that my sister had died.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q Can we go back maybe to, do you know, did she have any interests as a child?</span> <span id="s169">Did she play any instruments?</span> <span id="s170">Did you have any pets in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: We never had.</span> <span id="s172">Yes, we must have had cats somewhere.</span> <span id="s173">I remember something about cats.</span> <span id="s174">But, basically we were never pet lovers, so I don’t recall at all that we had pets.</span> <span id="s175">We all played an instrument.</span> <span id="s176">One of the things I do recall is notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my parents always teach us piano or violin, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s177">I had two years of piano lessons which was a complete waste.</span> <span id="s178">But, I do recall because somebody in a good family had to learn some instrument.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t remember what my sisters learned, but I’m sure they did too.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Was she friendly, did she have a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: She was friendly, she had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s182">Her friends circled around the same friends we had.</span> <span id="s183">Mostly of the Zionist groups.</span> <span id="s184">I really was more personally I was more geared to the non-Jewish friends I could get.</span> <span id="s185">Maybe at that time already I felt more I was a member of the basketball club, which had about twenty percent Jews.</span> <span id="s186">Or eighty percent non-Jews then.</span> <span id="s187">Not that it was ever mentioned to us or stated that it was twenty and eighty percent.</span> <span id="s188">Now I recall at a later date really, you know, I don’t think she went out to the non-Jewish world as much as I did.</span> <span id="s189">Of course having worked at the Carlton Hotel in Amsterdam, it made me also better understand the importance of the non-Jewish world to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s190">But she circled really around the life of completely Zionist life.</span> <span id="s191">That was ninety percent of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Is there anything else you would like to mention about Julia?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: No.</span> <span id="s194">The only thing I can say is that I do recall that in March 1945, she was very hungry and I had a little piece of bread and she asked me for that piece of bread.</span> <span id="s195">I never gave it to her.</span> <span id="s196">Now, if the psychiatrist would examine me he would say you have tremendous guilt thinking about it, and would have the rest of your life.</span> <span id="s197">I must say in all honesty I felt at that moment that piece of bread could save my life and I didn’t give it to my sister.</span> <span id="s198">But I still think about it.</span> <span id="s199">It wouldn’t have saved her life anyway, but things like that, you know, stay for a long time.</span> <span id="s200">That was about the last time I saw her.</span> <span id="s201">One of the horrors of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Thank you very much for your time.</span></p></body></html>
