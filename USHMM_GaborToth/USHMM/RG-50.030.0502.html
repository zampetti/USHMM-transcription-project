glad to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: (Let’s just start by you telling me your name, and when you were born, and where, and give me a little family picture.)</span> <span id="s15">My name is Budd Schulberg, and I was born in really a neighborhood that is now Harlem – I was born on 120th Street, March 27, 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: And, in a way, my parents told me I was maybe the only person who was a born screenwriter, because my father wrote a photoplay – it was on a suffragist subject.</span> <span id="s17">My mother was a suffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called “What Every Woman Wants” – I think it was called.</span> <span id="s18">And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days.</span> <span id="s19">And he told me it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse – I’ve always loved that name – who delivered me, at home, and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say.</span> <span id="s20">My father was one of the earliest, very early photoplay writers, as they called them then.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: (Take us from New York to California.)</span> <span id="s23">We left when I was about six years old.</span> <span id="s24">And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor, Famous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 – he started very, very young.</span> <span id="s25">But by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own.</span> <span id="s26">And become his own film company producer.</span> <span id="s27">So we went out to Hollywood very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">I really remember the ride on that train.</span> <span id="s29">It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the Superchief, even.</span> <span id="s30">And I vaguely remember that, being out on the observation car, and watching the country fall away behind us.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">My father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third “M” at MGM – the two of them together set up a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by the railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s32">It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio.</span> <span id="s33">So both Mayer and BP, so they both were making these early silent films.</span> <span id="s34">That’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">My father’s big discovery was Clara Bow.</span> <span id="s36">He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually, signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to Hollywood.</span> <span id="s37">I called Clara sort of a pre-Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen.</span> <span id="s38">She was known as the, as the “It” girl, from a famous novel of the time, and movie called “It.”</span> <span id="s39">And she had it.</span> <span id="s40">Clara really did have It.</span> <span id="s41">She really did.</span> <span id="s42">She’s still amazing to watch in those silent films.</span> <span id="s43">And that’s so – My father and Louis made their films for a few years, for about three or four years, and then Louis Mayer went to the newly formed MGM.</span> <span id="s44">And at that point my father went over, went back to Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of the west coast studio of Paramount.</span> <span id="s45">And so, all through my young manhood, growing up, I really grew up on the, in a way, on the backlot.</span> <span id="s46">I used to go there almost every day on my bike, drove through those famous gates, and roam around and play on the backlot sets, and wander into different stages where they were shooting amazing films.</span> <span id="s47">So all these famous stars were like old hat to us – they were more like people who just worked for my father – was the way we thought of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: (How early did you get interested in writing?)</span> <span id="s49">Very, very early, I’d say I was about 9 or 10, very early.</span> <span id="s50">It was very much a part of our household atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">My father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays.</span> <span id="s52">And he, also as a kid, worked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World – papers that we, that we dearly miss.</span> <span id="s53">There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we’re down to about two and a half.</span> <span id="s54">So, so he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">And my mother was a frustrated librarian.</span> <span id="s56">And she set up a very big library, thousands of books, all set up like a regular library, all numbered like a library, a real library.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">My father used to – Sunday morning was a ritual.</span> <span id="s58">He would read from the classics, aloud to us, Sunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so.</span> <span id="s59">It’s amazing what we read.</span> <span id="s60">We read through Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years and years, we heard that.</span> <span id="s61">So writing was very much part of our life.</span> <span id="s62">So I started when I was about 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents.</span> <span id="s63">So by the time I went to high school, I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">And it all went – it fell in place very naturally.</span> <span id="s65">I edited the high school – Los Angeles High School daily paper.</span> <span id="s66">We had a daily paper.</span> <span id="s67">I laugh because these days, my kids at Westhampton High School couldn’t get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn’t imagine putting it out every day.</span> <span id="s68">But we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">So anyway, that’s why, so we breathed that atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published, entitled, They Cried a Little.</span> <span id="s71">Sonya said that in our house, where in other homes they might have a piano and people might sit down – Sonya said, in our house, we had a typewriter, and as we passed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and Stuart, Stuart wrote very well, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: (He was 8 years younger than you.</span> <span id="s73">That’s quite a gap when you’re kids.)</span></p> <p><span id="s74">It was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Stuart had several short stories in The American Best Short Stories.</span> <span id="s76">He really wrote very well.</span> <span id="s77">If he hadn’t gotten into television producing, he might very well have just gotten into pure writing also.</span> <span id="s78">It just ran in our family, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">My sister is really an excellent writer.</span> <span id="s80">I’ve often said, and I mean it.</span> <span id="s81">She’s a better writer, she’s a better, delicate writer than I am.</span> <span id="s82">If we had a little contest, describing some Hollywood street.</span> <span id="s83">She can still do that better than I can; she’s very, very sharp.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">The difference was that I made, I made much more of a job of it, an everyday job.</span> <span id="s85">And Sonya is so finicky that nothing ever satisfies her.</span> <span id="s86">She’ll take a short story and work on it for a year, and still not want to show it to anyone.</span> <span id="s87">She’s a perfectionist.</span> <span id="s88">But in the real life of writing you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s89">You’ll spend the rest of your life polishing one thing.</span> <span id="s90">And Sonya tends to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: (Were you and your siblings very competitive?)</span> <span id="s92">Not really.</span> <span id="s93">I was so much the elder of the three.</span> <span id="s94">And with my father and my mother divorcing when I was a teenager, 17 or 18, and Sonya and Stuart younger, uh, I was very worried about them.</span> <span id="s95">I sort of uh, took on my father’s failed responsibilities.</span> <span id="s96">I was worrying about their school and how they would react to a divorce, and all of that.</span> <span id="s97">So I wouldn’t say we were very competitive, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: (You were born just at the time that the First World War started.</span> <span id="s99">Do you have any memories of the First World War?)</span> <span id="s100">It’s funny, I do have.</span> <span id="s101">One memory was being on a train going west, this was in 1918.</span> <span id="s102">It’s almost the first memory I have, being on a train.</span> <span id="s103">And I was about four years old.</span> <span id="s104">And, and my father’s partner, Harry Abrams, his daughter was about eight, and the two of us were in a bunk together.</span> <span id="s105">And we stopped in a station, and a train full of soldiers was just opposite the platform.</span> <span id="s106">And I remember looking at them and they were sort of jeering and making sort of lewd remarks about, I don’t know what they were saying, but I remember that moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">And I remember being with my mother on a as the soldiers were, had just come back from World War One and were marching down 5th Avenue, and I’ve got just a glimpse of a memory of that.</span> <span id="s108">It’s almost my earliest memories of World War One.</span> <span id="s109">I also remember collecting silver tinfoil, balls of it that somehow were being given for the war effort.</span> <span id="s110">I don’t know exactly how they used it, but those are the, those are about the only ways I relate to World War One.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: (Let’s jump forward to the approach of World War II.</span> <span id="s112">Now you have sudden success writing, right?</span> <span id="s113">Why don’t you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war started.)</span> <span id="s114">.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Well, 19 –, let’s see.</span> <span id="s116">When I got out of college in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father’s assistant, had now set up his own studio, and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born – which was the daddy of all those later Star is Borns.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">And, let’s see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter.</span> <span id="s118">And I had a seven-year contract – it started at 50 and went to 75 a week.</span> <span id="s119">At the end of seven years, I would have been making $500.</span> <span id="s120">And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write screenplays that David, I don’t think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already planning.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">And then they would call us in – I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who comes in off the bench.</span> <span id="s123">If there was some immediate problem, David would call Ring Lardner and me – we were a writing team.</span> <span id="s124">We were both about 21, 22 years old.</span> <span id="s125">We were just out of college.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">And he would call us in on –like on A Star is Born.</span> <span id="s127">They couldn’t figure out the ending of A Star is Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of Grauman’s Chinese and sees her husband’s footprints and handprints, and when she’s asked her name.</span> <span id="s128">She’s now a big movie star, and he’s gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn’t stand his failure while she’s gone up.</span> <span id="s129">And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she says, “This is Mrs. Norman Maine.”</span> <span id="s130">– and it’s a big ending in the movie.</span> <span id="s131">Things like that, little bits and pieces.</span> <span id="s132">It wasn’t awfully satisfying.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">By the time he was about to pick up my third option, I went in to David and I asked David – I’d known him so well for years and years – my mother even put him, my mother really stage managed his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother really sort of put them together, encouraged them.</span> <span id="s134">And I’d known him since I was a kid, and I said, “David, do me a big favor, please, don’t pick up my option.”</span> <span id="s135">And David was really very hurt.</span> <span id="s136">He said – he felt really insulted, and he said, “Well, I have great plans for you.</span> <span id="s137">I was thinking that as I get older, I may retire, and you might be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you the way you work….”</span> <span id="s138">You could see this going on until the 21st century – a dynasty of the Selznicks and the Schulbergs.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">And I said, “Well, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you.”</span> <span id="s140">And David said, he said, “Well,” he said, “ I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer” – and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that’s exactly what he said – he said, “I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but,” he said, “I figure that sooner or later your producer’s blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in.”</span> <span id="s141">I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon.</span> <span id="s142">It’s in The Last Tycoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there.</span> <span id="s144">I started writing short stories for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines.</span> <span id="s145">And I was doing very well with that.</span> <span id="s146">And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run?</span> <span id="s147">And I then decided that I’d like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel.</span> <span id="s148">And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble.</span> <span id="s149">Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) – (PAUSE)</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: (Let’s start that sentence again.)</span> <span id="s151">We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments.</span> <span id="s152">We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters’ Guild and the Anti-Nazi League – all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program.</span> <span id="s153">So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in order to – I’d like to stop and write this book.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">The answer was, “I guess you’ll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that” – Lawson was the head of the communist party – “to decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments.”</span> <span id="s155">So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">And Jack said, “Well, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I’ll sort of supervise the writing of the book.”</span> <span id="s157">And I said, “Jesus, Jack, I can’t do that.”</span> <span id="s158">And Jack started to give me things about the responsibility to the party.</span> <span id="s159">And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it.</span> <span id="s160">And they said, “No, you have to do it, or if you….”</span> <span id="s161">Finally, one day I went home with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, “Jigee, I can’t take the argument any more.</span> <span id="s162">It’s just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the car and drive away and just leave.</span> <span id="s163">And even that was, even that – people don’t realize how tightly disciplined the party was.</span> <span id="s164">You couldn’t just get in a car and drive away.</span> <span id="s165">If you were going to New York you had to tell them where you were going.</span> <span id="s166">And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York.</span> <span id="s167">It was very tightly controlled.</span> <span id="s168">So I just – the very act of getting in a car and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">And when I got back to, I went back to Dartmouth, where I’d gone to college, and found a little house, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was.</span> <span id="s170">And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy.</span> <span id="s171">Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it’s just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English.</span> <span id="s172">And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party.</span> <span id="s174">And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own.</span> <span id="s175">But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People’s World, which was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name – he wrote a rave review of the book.</span> <span id="s176">He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about – raved about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">That caused a firestorm apparently.</span> <span id="s178">They called him in and they gave him hell – Lawson and company.</span> <span id="s179">Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, “On further consideration” – and he even said, “It’s been pointed out to me the shortcomings,” and he absolutely trashed the book.</span> <span id="s180">Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn’t, if he didn’t do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party.</span> <span id="s181">He had to do it, and so he just trashed the book.</span> <span id="s182">It was a terrible book.</span> <span id="s183">It didn’t do that and it didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s184">It was really disgraceful, just disgraceful.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?)</span> <span id="s186">Yeah.</span> <span id="s187">The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me.</span> <span id="s188">He was just in a rage.</span> <span id="s189">When I came in, he screamed at me.</span> <span id="s190">It was almost like that Judge Freisler.</span> <span id="s191">And he screamed at me.</span> <span id="s192">“You’re a traitor!</span> <span id="s193">You’re a traitor!”</span> <span id="s194">Like that, he got purple, he was so mad.</span> <span id="s195">“How could you write that terrible book?!”</span> <span id="s196">he screamed at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that – my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father.</span> <span id="s198">He took off the same way, and he said, “B.P. I blame you for this.</span> <span id="s199">You should have stopped him.</span> <span id="s200">It’s your fault.”</span> <span id="s201">He was yelling, too.</span> <span id="s202">You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">My father said, “Louis, I did try to stop him.</span> <span id="s204">I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the book.”</span> <span id="s205">I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me.</span> <span id="s206">“If you publish this book, it will ruin you.</span> <span id="s207">You’ll never be able to live.</span> <span id="s208">You’ll never get a job here again.</span> <span id="s209">And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother – who was just entering the agency – it will hurt the whole family.</span> <span id="s210">You’ve got to put – don’t publish the book.”</span> <span id="s211">My father wrote that.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Anyway, Louis Mayer said – he said, “You know what I think we should do with him?”</span> <span id="s213">He said, “I think we should deport him.”</span> <span id="s214">And he really meant it.</span> <span id="s215">It was really sort of fascinating, because I always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country.</span> <span id="s216">They thought of it as their own country.</span> <span id="s217">It was like Luxembourg or something.</span> <span id="s218">They ran that country.</span> <span id="s219">And they could do anything they wanted.</span> <span id="s220">The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name.</span> <span id="s221">He was on a weekly salary.</span> <span id="s222">They paid him every week.</span> <span id="s223">And they could do anything.</span> <span id="s224">They could cover up any crime.</span> <span id="s225">It never got in the paper.</span> <span id="s226">Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody.</span> <span id="s227">He did.</span> <span id="s228">And no one every heard about it.</span> <span id="s229">Nothing.</span> <span id="s230">Because they ran everything, including the press.</span> <span id="s231">It was really their country.</span> <span id="s232">So when Mayer said that – it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported.</span> <span id="s233">And my father – I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn’t as smart in a practical way as Louis was.</span> <span id="s234">And my father said, “Louis,” he said, “maybe you’re right, but,” he said, “where do you think his St. Helena should be?”</span> <span id="s235">He said, “Maybe we should deport him to Catalina Island.”</span> <span id="s236">And according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn’t think that was a bit funny.</span> <span id="s237">So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both.</span> <span id="s238">It was from both extremes.</span> <span id="s239">So I went back to New York, and – of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast.</span> <span id="s240">And then, from then on, which pretty much I’ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I’ve tried to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: (Remind us how old you were at that time – you were very young.)</span> <span id="s242">I was about 25.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">(Drinks)</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: (So wait till you’re finished with the water… Tell us again that you were twenty five years old.</span> <span id="s245">I mean, that’s a vulnerable time to be so berated by everyone around you.)</span> <span id="s246">Yeah.</span> <span id="s247">That book changed my life completely.</span> <span id="s248">It even cost me harmony with my first love of my life, my wife, Jigee, Virginia.</span> <span id="s249">It even cost me the marriage in a way, because Jigee wanted to stay west.</span> <span id="s250">She didn’t like the east.</span> <span id="s251">And she thought the climate was bad for our little daughter Vicky, and we sort of argued about that, back and forth.</span> <span id="s252">And the, she insisted, almost, on, on, that we live out there.</span> <span id="s253">And I was saying, “I can’t live out there.</span> <span id="s254">It’s over for me there.</span> <span id="s255">And in the east, I’m really accepted now.</span> <span id="s256">And I have a new contract for a book, and I’m – my new life has begun.”</span> <span id="s257">It really planted the seeds of our breaking up eventually.</span> <span id="s258">That book changed me in every possible way.</span> <span id="s259">It was really funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: (Give us a sense of the chronology when it was published, and then, if you could move forward to the war, which obviously changed things for everybody, right?)</span> <span id="s261">I started the book in the spring of ‘39.</span> <span id="s262">I finished it in the, about fall of, of 1940.</span> <span id="s263">It was published, uh, on my birthday, uh, in 1941.</span> <span id="s264">And uh, and then, then I was working on my, I was back in Vermont.</span> <span id="s265">I was starting my second book.</span> <span id="s266">And then came Pearl Harbor, and we were in the war.</span> <span id="s267">And then I, I was anxious to get in the war, and I, uh, I applied to the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s268">Uh, and then I, I went back to Hollywood to see my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke to the, John Ford, the famous movie director.</span> <span id="s269">Ford was forming this outfit, the – called the Navy OSS Photographic Unit that would work with the, in the OSS with, with photographic in- intelligence.</span> <span id="s270">And because of my book’s success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me, he said he would like me to be in that unit.</span> <span id="s271">So that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s272">I then applied, with his recommendation.</span> <span id="s273">And that took about six months before I was approved.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">And in the meantime, I went down to Mexico and waited in Mexico and wrote screenplays to support myself, wrote screenplays down there, for Mexican producers.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">And then finally I was, I got my Navy commission and went to Washington to report to John Ford.</span> <span id="s276">And that was the beginning of my war experience.</span> <span id="s277">I was in, in for about four years, because after the war, I was with the Nuremberg Trial.</span> <span id="s278">It seems to me, I think it was from spring of ‘42 to spring of ‘46 before I got, before I got out, because the last six or seven months was spent preparing a film for the Nuremberg, the photographic evidence for the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: (Tell us a bit more about John Ford’s role.</span> <span id="s280">So you went into the Navy, because he was in the Navy, and he already was forming this unit.)</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Yes.</span> <span id="s282">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: (But was it solely Navy personnel?)</span> <span id="s284">No.</span> <span id="s285">It was not.</span> <span id="s286">It could have been anywhere.</span> <span id="s287">It could have been Marine, or Army.</span> <span id="s288">I think that Jack just had contacts with the Navy.</span> <span id="s289">He was a friend of Bill Donovan, the OSS head, of the newly formed OSS.</span> <span id="s290">And, so it was a Navy outfit that really was, didn’t really have very much to do with the Navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">At the same time, there were some really ridiculously funny things like at our headquarters in Washington, at the Agricultural Building, if you wanted to go out for lunch, you would go to the Marine Sergeant and say, “Permission to go ashore, Sir.”</span> <span id="s292">We had all this naval talk, even though we never saw a ship.</span> <span id="s293">But, Ford did send me for naval training anyway, to Fort Schuyler.</span> <span id="s294">I went to Fort Schuyler and got Navy indoctrination, where I had some trouble with navigation and all these things, I wasn’t very good at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: (Tell us about John Ford and your story about his erratic responses to you in terms of requiring Navy behavior.)</span> <span id="s296">John Ford, of course he was a genius, but he had a, I think he had a kind of sadistic trait.</span> <span id="s297">Because when I came in to report – I’d known him in Hollywood, and I was still thinking of him as a movie director and me as a young writer.</span> <span id="s298">So I walked in and said, “Hi Jack, I’m here, like, what do you want me to do?”</span> <span id="s299">It was sort of like that.</span> <span id="s300">And Ford was now a Navy Commander, and he said, “Ensign Schulberg, that’s no way to report to your commander.</span> <span id="s301">Come to attention and salute and make an official report.”</span> <span id="s302">And so on.</span> <span id="s303">I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, “Ensign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.”</span> <span id="s304">And he’s said, “That’s more like it.”</span> <span id="s305">So he’s like a standard stiff-necked Navy commander.</span> <span id="s306">It was so typical Ford, so I say, OK, if that’s what he wants, I’ll do it.</span> <span id="s307">I don’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">So the next time I come into his office I give him a sal…and say, “Ensign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.”</span> <span id="s309">John Ford says to me, “Oh, for Christ’s sake, Budd, you don’t have to go through all that.</span> <span id="s310">Sit down.</span> <span id="s311">Let’s talk.”</span> <span id="s312">Like now he’s just a movie director again.</span> <span id="s313">That’s the way he was.</span> <span id="s314">He loved to keep people off balance.</span> <span id="s315">That was a big thing with Ford, to keep them off balance.</span> <span id="s316">Whatever you thought he was going to say, he’d say something different.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">But he took glee in, and he said, “We’re going to send you to Fort Schuyler, and they’ll really knock some Navy discipline into you.”</span> <span id="s318">He said, “You’re going to find it very tough.”</span> <span id="s319">He couldn’t wait for me to suffer there, at Fort Schuyler.</span> <span id="s320">And so I went to Schuyler – I didn’t mind it really, I found it rather interesting.</span> <span id="s321">Tough, but – and we’d run around the Fort at 6 o’clock in the morning and go all through this stuff, and so it was sort of interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">And one really funny thing happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">There were two little ensigns from the South.</span> <span id="s324">One was named Watts and the other was named Furr.</span> <span id="s325">One came from Mississippi and the other from Georgia.</span> <span id="s326">And they would always stare at me.</span> <span id="s327">I’d be doing something and they’d look up and they were staring at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">And one night after mess, I came back to my bunk, and they came over, and they said, “Excuse me, Schulberg, would you mind if we talk to you?”</span> <span id="s329">And I said, “Well, no.”</span> <span id="s330">So they sat down opposite me in this little bunk.</span> <span id="s331">And I said, “OK, what do you want to talk about?”</span> <span id="s332">And they said, in that thick southern accent, I can’t do it, they said: “Someone told us that you were a Jew.”</span> <span id="s333">And they said, “You know, we’ve never seen one before.”</span> <span id="s334">It was like looking at a koala bear from Australia or something, and they’d never seen one before.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">And then they, and then we got to chatting a bit.</span> <span id="s336">And then they – they were very polite.</span> <span id="s337">He said, “Well, Sir, if you don’t mind our asking,” Furr said, “What do you do in civilian life?”</span> <span id="s338">And I said, “Well, I’m a writer.”</span> <span id="s339">And Furr said, “A writer.</span> <span id="s340">That’s interesting.”</span> <span id="s341">He said, “We’ve got a couple” – he came from Oxford, Mississippi – he said, “We’ve got a couple of writers in our town.”</span> <span id="s342">And I said, and I said, “You mean Faulkner?”</span> <span id="s343">And he said, “Yeah, the Faulkner brothers, the brothers.”</span> <span id="s344">He said, “You know, those two guys” – he said, “I’m a druggist.”</span> <span id="s345">He worked in a drug store, and his whole view of Faulkner – he said, “These two Faulkner brothers,” he said, “almost every morning, they come in and buy aspirin, because they’ve got such bad headaches, because they drink so damn much at night.”</span> <span id="s346">That was his – And I said, “Well” – and I said, “William Faulkner?</span> <span id="s347">You know William Faulkner?”</span> <span id="s348">And he said, “Well sure, I see him every morning.”</span> <span id="s349">He said, “How do you know him?”</span> <span id="s350">He had no idea that he was famous.</span> <span id="s351">He just thought he was a crazy guy in town.</span> <span id="s352">They had no idea he was a famous writer.</span> <span id="s353">They were so funny.</span> <span id="s354">They used to… After that, they would, whenever they saw me – I should write about them some time – they would –(Drinks) Umm, whenever they saw me, they would say, “Hi, Schulberg,” and then they’d look at each other, be sort of pleased.</span> <span id="s355">It was like that, I mean, it was just a, I was just a bizarre thing to them.</span> <span id="s356">I didn’t feel really anti-Semitism, it was just, simply, they had never seen one, that’s all.</span> <span id="s357">----------------(?)</span> <span id="s358">or something.</span> <span id="s359">It was so… And the final exam - it was just murder.</span> <span id="s360">You, you had to chart the, chart the passage of a ship, and you get all these instructions, thirty knots at this and then left to here and right to there, trying to take it from this one place all the way through the canal, to docking.</span> <span id="s361">And I didn’t know what the hell I was doing.</span> <span id="s362">I was sweating.</span> <span id="s363">I said, “I’m going to flunk this thing, Ford is going to kill me.”</span> <span id="s364">I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">I swear to God, as I’m sweating this out, Furr and Watts are sitting right across the aisle from me, and I see a hand coming in surreptitiously, and he shows me his paper so I could copy it and pass.</span> <span id="s366">They saved me.</span> <span id="s367">They saved me – Furr and Watts.</span> <span id="s368">God, they were sort of lovable, really.</span> <span id="s369">I’m sure when they went home, big stories about how they met this Jew.</span> <span id="s370">Now we know one, like, we really saw one.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: (How are we doing on tape time?</span> <span id="s372">Time?</span> <span id="s373">OK) So, then I came back from Fort Schuyler, and Ford called me in and said – well, by this time I’m really snapping, I’m really Navy.</span> <span id="s374">I’ve been there for three months or something.</span> <span id="s375">And I’m very snapped up.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">And Ford the sadist said, “Well, how’d you like that?”</span> <span id="s377">And I said, “Gee, I really loved it, Commander, it was great.”</span> <span id="s378">It was sort of laying into him, and he wanted me to say, God, I suffered there or something.</span> <span id="s379">He was not happy – he thought I was suffering there at Fort Schuyler.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">But after that, after that, the first nine or ten months or almost a year, we worked just in, in Washington.</span> <span id="s381">And Ford had made a film about, a film for public consumption about, about Pearl Harbor, and he asked me to write the, sort of the commentary, the narration, I mean, titles and stuff, and so on.</span> <span id="s382">I worked on films like that, which was more or less like working in Hollywood.</span> <span id="s383">And, then he sent me overseas to London.</span> <span id="s384">I was there in the blitz, and we did some, some undercover work in, in London, and then Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">And then we had some really interesting assignments.</span> <span id="s386">One was not really involved in photography.</span> <span id="s387">We were part of a little group that, as soon as a German town fell, we would rush in and try to grab as much information – we would go to the SS headquarters and things like that and grab papers and orders and things like that.</span> <span id="s388">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s389">It was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: (Was this in 1943? ’</span> <span id="s391">44?)</span> <span id="s392">Yes, I’d say this was ‘43, ‘44, yes, as we moved through Belgium and into Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">And then they used writers in a very creative way.</span> <span id="s394">They had writers like me work with, on the team that would drop, drop agents behind the line.</span> <span id="s395">And each agent had about, a team of about eight that took care of them.</span> <span id="s396">They all had different assignments.</span> <span id="s397">One would just – took care of his general welfare.</span> <span id="s398">And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be dropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s399">And I as a writer would work on their cover story, which was very much like writing a story.</span> <span id="s400">It was exactly like writing a character in fiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they would say when they got, if they were interrogated.</span> <span id="s401">And so that was really interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Right before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent.</span> <span id="s403">I was just amazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people.</span> <span id="s404">And he’d become quite famous.</span> <span id="s405">He had been actually dropped in Berlin or something, or got to Berlin.</span> <span id="s406">He went to the Adlon Hotel, and became a big pal of some big SS general.</span> <span id="s407">He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some kind – I forget what the hell they thought he was selling – but he became a pal and drinking buddy, and so –.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Now it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before he could do 50 drops.</span> <span id="s409">He really was worried that the war would be over.</span> <span id="s410">He couldn’t wait to get his fiftieth in.</span> <span id="s411">And, but three days before, three or four days before the end of the war, back he went again.</span> <span id="s412">I asked him, it’s against regulations really, because everything is so secret.</span> <span id="s413">But if he ever survived, if he ever came to the States, I’d love to know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s414">Because it was frustrating.</span> <span id="s415">When we did this work, when they made contact inside, they made someone, not us, but just someone, in London I think it was, so we would never know what happened, we didn’t know whether they got killed or were doing great.</span> <span id="s416">We never could sort of complete the experience.</span> <span id="s417">So I asked him, if he ever got out, if he survived this last one, and got to the States, I wish he would look me up and tell me what the hell happened to him.</span> <span id="s418">But I never heard from him.</span> <span id="s419">I don’t know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: (So you had intelligence training, also – not just naval training, but intelligence training?)</span> <span id="s421">That’s right, so they sent me to that school; it’s the same place where the CIA is now.</span> <span id="s422">Yeah, that was interesting.</span> <span id="s423">They sent me to a school.</span> <span id="s424">There were a hundred or so agents, at agent school.</span> <span id="s425">We were there about a couple of months, and each one had to make up a false identity, as to who they were and what they did.</span> <span id="s426">And they just went, funny things – I said I was a sports writer.</span> <span id="s427">You had to of course choose something that you could talk about, or be questioned about, that they didn’t know enough about, to pass.</span> <span id="s428">So I said I was a sports writer.</span> <span id="s429">I didn’t say Los Angeles, but close to Los Angeles, like Alta , that I knew enough about.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Sometimes at three o’clock in the morning, they would wake you up and shake you and say, “What’s your name?</span> <span id="s431">What do you do?”</span> <span id="s432">– kind of like that, to try and catch you.</span> <span id="s433">And fascinating, too, every Saturday night there was a long drinking session.</span> <span id="s434">They would all be at a long table, and they had every kind of booze on the table, and they would encourage people to drink.</span> <span id="s435">And they would see who fell apart in drinking, and who didn’t.</span> <span id="s436">And they would weed them out like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: (Were you good at that?)</span> <span id="s438">Yeah, I was.</span> <span id="s439">Yeah, I had had quite a bit of training in it by then.</span> <span id="s440">Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Yes, I passed the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: (Better at drinking than navigation.</span> <span id="s443">They have to change tapes, so we can take a little break.</span> <span id="s444">Did I hear you right?)</span> <span id="s445">So I came back from that….</span></p> <p><span id="s446">END of Tape 1 Tape 2 of 3:</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: (Why don’t you tell me how Stuart was brought into the unit and when that was?)</span> <span id="s448">Well, Stuart joined the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s449">And after his Marine training – the same tough stuff – even tougher maybe that he went through – he was assigned to a film unit, a film unit in the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s450">Meantime, I heard that we’d a slot open in our outfit.</span> <span id="s451">Someone had dropped out.</span> <span id="s452">I forget what happened to him.</span> <span id="s453">Anyway, I then recommended to Ray Kellogg that we get Stuart, I said he was really very, very able.</span> <span id="s454">And so they did suggest to Stuart that he apply, and Ford approved it, and so forth.</span> <span id="s455">And so Stuart came over, and from that time worked with us.</span> <span id="s456">And that’s how we both happened to be, at the end of the war, involved in the Nuremberg Trial preparation.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: (Just a little background: Did you work at all with the Signal Corps?</span> <span id="s458">Did you have any connection or cooperation with the Signal Corps units, and with George Stevens’ unit?)</span> <span id="s459">No, we had no connection whatsoever with the Signal Corps.</span> <span id="s460">It drives me a little crazy, because it will never get straightened out, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s461">Somehow on the Internet it says that George Stevens worked on the Nuremberg film.</span> <span id="s462">And I get questions many times: How was it to work with George Stevens?</span> <span id="s463">And he seems inextricably bound up in our project.</span> <span id="s464">I didn’t even know, know George Stevens.</span> <span id="s465">I know his son quite well, but I don’t think I even ever met George Stevens.</span> <span id="s466">And he had nothing whatsoever to do with our project.</span> <span id="s467">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">What he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a film unit and went around photographing the concentration camps, and made several films that were, I think, quite effective.</span> <span id="s469">But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">For one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence.</span> <span id="s471">But we never saw George Stevens.</span> <span id="s472">And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to disconnect it.</span> <span id="s473">It comes up constantly.</span> <span id="s474">It’s right there, if you find it – George Stevens worked on this.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">It’s one of the many, many troubles with the Internet, that’s really a big negative for me.</span> <span id="s476">I get asked questions about Hollywood, about, did I get back to Hollywood work because I testified to the committee after the war, and I didn’t go anywhere near Hollywood.</span> <span id="s477">I still felt outlawed, understand.</span> <span id="s478">And I lived in, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and just wrote books.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">But all that misinformation is set in there, and it will be there forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: (I agree.)</span> <span id="s481">And I’m sure there’ll be biographies written full of misinformation.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: (OK, So George Stevens had nothing to do with The Nazi Plan.)</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: (And did George Stevens and his group have anything to do with John Ford and his unit?)</span> <span id="s485">Nothing.</span> <span id="s486">Zero.</span> <span id="s487">Nothing.</span> <span id="s488">They were two completely separate – I think that Stevens apparently did some very good work, but it had nothing to do with John Ford’s OSS unit.</span> <span id="s489">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: (OK.</span> <span id="s491">Why don’t you tell us, give us some detail about how it came about, your suggestion about photographic evidence, and when you first came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to that.)</span> <span id="s492">At the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested in, was one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major war criminals.</span> <span id="s493">And he, he called a meeting – I need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much.</span> <span id="s494">(Drinks) He called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could contribute to the building of an international trial.</span> <span id="s495">And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I worked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford – Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford might make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior.</span> <span id="s496">So I guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking about the importance of the impending trial.</span> <span id="s497">And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to make a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s498">I got the feeling at the meeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor.</span> <span id="s499">I think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Anyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS Photographic – it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we could use at, at a trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">As a result of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would look, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial.</span> <span id="s502">And so, so I … Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and – with my brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence.</span> <span id="s503">So, he set up in, I think in Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s504">And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler’s official photographer.</span> <span id="s505">And Hoffmann, who – oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von Schirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend.</span> <span id="s506">It was really ironic because in a sense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">But as I point out – with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do anything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a slavish point.</span> <span id="s508">I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, in a way.</span> <span id="s509">We would say that the – feeling anti-German at that time, because we did feel that the country really overwhelmingly had supported Hitler.</span> <span id="s510">You see those crowds of millions and millions of people would turn out for those rallies.</span> <span id="s511">And we said that we thought of the Germans as being either, either at your throat or, or at your feet.</span> <span id="s512">That’s what we said.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">And at that point, we found them willing – that even formerly Nazi people would do anything that you, anything that you wanted, because they were scared of us also.</span> <span id="s514">But by then we were the conquerors and they were scared about what we might do to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: (Was Hoffmann that cooperative too?)</span> <span id="s516">Hoffmann was totally cooperative with Stuart and turned over his entire treasure trove of photographs to Stuart.</span> <span id="s517">Went over with his staff, he had his staff down there, the way I had up in Berlin.</span> <span id="s518">(Coughing) (Drinks water)</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: (So, Budd, when did you first go to Nuremberg, to the city?</span> <span id="s520">And what did you find when you were there?)</span> <span id="s521">What did I find there, did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: (When did you first get to Nuremberg?)</span> <span id="s523">Very soon after we, after we set up headquarters in Berlin, in the Wannsee, very fancy, plush – it was like the Beverly Hills of Berlin, I guess, in a way, or even Bellaire.</span> <span id="s524">And at that time, I, I uh, after we set up shop there, then because, I went down to Nuremberg to talk with the Jackson legal staff to get the particulars of the indictments and find out, find out specifically what, what photographic, how the photographic evidence would, would dovetail with their actual indictments.</span> <span id="s525">And uh from the point on we worked very closely.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">There was a lieutenant Jim Donovan who served as a liaison between the Jackson staff – he was on Jackson’s staff, well we all were really, we were officially on Jackson’s staff too – would work out the, the working arrangement between the indictments and what we could do to back up those indictments photographically.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">And we worked with Ben Kaplan, whom I still see from time to time on the Vineyard – a very distinguished lawyer and I think a judge later, but we would work closely with them, and sometimes I was down there frequently.</span> <span id="s528">I might fly down for a few hours and fly back, and so I was in Nuremberg a lot, every, maybe a couple of times a week even, during that period when we were preparing the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: (What was the city like?</span> <span id="s530">What was the atmosphere like?)</span> <span id="s531">Well, the city was a ruin.</span> <span id="s532">It was really a wreck.</span> <span id="s533">And the uh, and the Germans seemed very beaten down and sort of depressed, and uh, and eager to please, really, eager to please you, and sort of scared of you, too.</span> <span id="s534">It was very much a sense of the conquered and the conquerors.</span> <span id="s535">But it was shocking to see those cities.</span> <span id="s536">I saw Cologne, Berlin itself was, Jesus – I flew over Berlin in a small plane, and it looked like a honeycomb.</span> <span id="s537">There was hardly a roof left in all of this enormous city.</span> <span id="s538">There was hardly any roofs on the buildings.</span> <span id="s539">You could just see right into them.</span> <span id="s540">It was totally destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: (Did you have any reflections on the impact of Allied bombing and whether it was justified?)</span> <span id="s542">Well, that’s a tough question, because really you might say on both sides, it really doesn’t seemed justified to uh bomb civilians, you know, on one side or the other, just as the Nazis were doing in London, and we were doing in Dresden and everywhere else.</span> <span id="s543">We did destroy those cities.</span> <span id="s544">At the time, I felt that, at that time I felt that we had to do it, because we, apparently that was, they thought, the only way to win the war.</span> <span id="s545">And God knows we had to win the war if we wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s546">At the time, at the same time, it was really horrendous to see what we had done, I mean to people, and oh God, the wreckage of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: (I’m sorry, go ahead.)</span> <span id="s548">When I saw Berlin, I, my feeling was that it would take fifty years or more to ever get it back together.</span> <span id="s549">I was amazed at how quickly they restored those cities.</span> <span id="s550">I was amazed at the resilience of people to rebuild them.</span> <span id="s551">I thought it would take all through the 20th century.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: (When did you first have real knowledge about what had been going on in the concentration camps?)</span> <span id="s553">Um, trying to remember – there – Even before the war, there had been word, word had gotten out that there were concentration camps, uh, in, in 19… let’s see, what’s it in, yeah, in 1938.</span> <span id="s554">Joe, Joe Louis’s uh, when— it was a, famous story that, there was, you know, that was – Braddock’s manager was Jewish, and, and Goebbels was working very hard to set up a championship fight between Braddock the champion and Max Schmeling in Germany.</span> <span id="s555">And Joe Gould, the manager – I went to see him in the hospital shortly before he died.</span> <span id="s556">And whether he made it up or not, Joe Gould told me that, that he got a phone call from Schmeling in Germany, and Max was dying to set up this rematch with Louis.</span> <span id="s557">And, so he called.</span> <span id="s558">Joe Gould was actually at, at Stillman’s Gym when he got the call.</span> <span id="s559">And Schmeling said, “Joe, I’m here with, with, I’m here with Mr. Goebbels in his office, and he would like to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s560">And so there was Goebbels in Berlin talking to this little Jewish guy in Stillman’s Gym.</span> <span id="s561">And of course now, it sounds made up, but what, what Joe Gould told me that day in the hospital was that, he said, Goebbels said, “We’re very anxious to arrange a championship match between your fighter and our fighter, in Berlin, and we, and we want to know what your conditions are.”</span> <span id="s562">And Gould said, “Well first, I want 500,000 dollars in a New York bank before we leave.”</span> <span id="s563">And he said that Goebbels said, “Well, that’s no problem.”</span> <span id="s564">And he said, “And also, we want, one judge must be American, and we want an English referee.”</span> <span id="s565">And he said, “Well, just a minute, I’ll have to ask Mr. Schmeling.”</span> <span id="s566">Then he came back he said, “Mr Schmeling says that’s OK, too.”</span> <span id="s567">And then he said, “And we want ten first class passages, and, and first class accommodation for ten people in your best hotel,” and so on.</span> <span id="s568">And he said, “Alright that’ll be alright.</span> <span id="s569">Is there any other condition?”</span> <span id="s570">Gould said that he said, “Well, there’s just one more.</span> <span id="s571">We’d like you to release all, all the Jews from your concentration camps.”</span> <span id="s572">So that was ’38.</span> <span id="s573">So by that time we were hearing rumors about the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s574">It was beginning to get out.</span> <span id="s575">They were just starting.</span> <span id="s576">I’m not sure exactly when they set them up.</span> <span id="s577">But there were only a few in the beginning.</span> <span id="s578">I think Dachau was one of the early ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Incidentally I, getting ready for the Nuremberg trial, I went to the Dachau trial as an observer.</span> <span id="s580">I didn’t work on the trial, in fact, I was an observer at the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: (And that was for the OSS?)</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: (For the OSS?)</span> <span id="s584">For the OSS, yes, everything I did was on behalf of our OSS unit, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: (OK, so let’s jump in.</span> <span id="s586">The war ends, they undertake this incredibly ambitious – ) Very.</span> <span id="s587">It had never been done before, never</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: ( -- and so fast, so fast.</span> <span id="s589">So talk to me about what they wanted from you, how you could do it in the time there was.</span> <span id="s590">Tell us about that.)</span> <span id="s591">They were building a case that the Nazis and Hitler had conspired almost from the beginning, almost from 1933 on, to breach the Treaty of Versailles and to find ways to get around it.</span> <span id="s592">And so they had these, many different steps of the indictment – of crimes against humanity, and, and crimes against the existing peace of the world, and so forth.</span> <span id="s593">There was a whole series of them.</span> <span id="s594">And for each one I would sit down with Donovan, sometimes with Ray Kellogg in attendance also – Ray served as sort of an intermediary between Donovan and me – and Donovan would spell out, out for us what the indictments were, show us, in fact I would read them, and then ask us, “How do you think that you see film building or buttressing the case that we’re making?”</span> <span id="s595">So, so I would go away with that information and then, then look for film that would answer his, his, what he was looking for.</span> <span id="s596">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: (Where did you look first?)</span> <span id="s598">Stupidly, we, as a shortcut, because we were very, very worried about time – at that time it was like August, and the trial was supposed to open on the 15th of September.</span> <span id="s599">We had no time.</span> <span id="s600">So we got, so as a shortcut, we thought we’d look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually that was produced, had come from Germany, and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn’t answer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them.</span> <span id="s601">And so I, I went down with a list.</span> <span id="s602">And at that point Donovan, Jim Donovan said, “Well, Budd, that’s film that was released in the United States.</span> <span id="s603">Even though the source was German, we can’t use anything that was at the influence, say, of Fox Movietonews, because the defense attorneys would jump in and say ‘That, that’s not admissible evidence, it might have been doctored,’ if they can’t tell what happened to it, and so forth.</span> <span id="s604">It has to be only German film, made in Germany, photographed by the Germans, official Germans, too – the army or the Waffen SS people and so on.”</span> <span id="s605">It made our job so much more difficult.</span> <span id="s606">I wasn’t sure we could really do it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">And then we heard that that film was, the German film was all in the Russian sector, which made it even more difficult for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">It’s sort of a long story, Raye, but I went to the head of the Russian archives, this unusual man, uh, Major Avenerius he was, and I told him what we were looking for, and as I said last night, he, he asked me, well, he said, “Did you come up from the John Ford unit?”</span> <span id="s609">And I said, “Yes,” and he said, “Well, that’s very interesting.”</span> <span id="s610">And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar.</span> <span id="s611">He knew every, he really knew every Ford movie.</span> <span id="s612">He named them, he must have named twenty of them or more, every single one, all the way back to the early 20s.</span> <span id="s613">He knew the obscure silent films.</span> <span id="s614">He knew every damned shot.</span> <span id="s615">It turned out he was a… He was like really basically a civilian, and he’d been a professor at the film institute in Moscow, and John Ford was his favorite of all world directors.</span> <span id="s616">John Ford was his favorite director.</span> <span id="s617">He knew everything about Ford.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">And he found it very interesting that Ford was the commander of the outfit.</span> <span id="s619">And he asked me if Ford would be coming, and I said “Well, yes he might come, just to inspect what we’re doing.”</span> <span id="s620">And he said, “Would you introduce me to him?”</span> <span id="s621">All his life he’d wanted to meet John Ford.</span> <span id="s622">I said, “Well, sure, if he comes.</span> <span id="s623">I think he may come.”</span> <span id="s624">And with that, that opened the door.</span> <span id="s625">He told me to come back in the morning.</span> <span id="s626">And he opened up to us only, German, not all but a lot of the German newsreel film that they had shot themselves, and that we, a great deal of that record, the whole record of the growth of the Nazis and their coming to power officially through that strange uh, actually through an election, and all the rest of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">So much of that film that we got from him the next day [coughs] we got because of the John Ford connection.</span> <span id="s628">We actually got a truck and loaded the truck with film.</span> <span id="s629">We had, we only showed four hours at the trial but we had maybe forty or fifty hours.</span> <span id="s630">We had hundreds and hundreds, hundreds of thousands of feet – it may have been as much as a million feet, I swear to God.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: (Do you want to clear your throat?</span> <span id="s632">And then I’d like to have you go back and tell us – This was at the Babelsberg studio, right?</span> <span id="s633">Mention where Avenerius was taking you.</span> <span id="s634">And also, talk about, you were presumably working on 35mm film, which is very unwieldy.</span> <span id="s635">Let’s go back into that, so you can tell us where, and some of those things about the film conditions, and how you could handle film, both viewing it, copying it, all of that.</span> <span id="s636">So, go ahead.)</span> <span id="s637">Well, we got so much of this film from him, as I mentioned last night, and after a few days of this, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff.</span> <span id="s638">Apparently his colonel had objected to his giving us so much film, even though the Soviet Union was one of the four parties represented in the prosecution.</span> <span id="s639">But the colonel stopped it.</span> <span id="s640">And then, I won’t go into so much detail, but then we had to win over the colonel, which we did with this lavish party that we threw for him, an all night into the dawn party.</span> <span id="s641">When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up, and we showed them the July 20th trial, which they were very interested in, and they wanted a – we had that and they didn’t – and they wanted a copy of that, which we would make for them.</span> <span id="s642">And so, softened up, the colonel then gave us permission to drive way into the Soviet sector.</span> <span id="s643">And it was on that trip that – which the Russians said it was the furthest any Americans had been allowed in to penetrate the Soviet sector – they knew of this tunnel where film had … I should backtrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">My two, my two SS film editors – we had recruited them from a POW camp – Walter Rothe and Curt von Molo were their names - and they told us that there were films made of, actually showing the Jews being shoved into cattle cars and ripped of their rings and jewelry and, and various atrocious things that the SS were doing to these poor Jewish victims.</span> <span id="s645">And, they had both worked on those, edited those films, and had shown them to Goebbels and Himmler, and obscenely, they called them ‘desserts,’ because they would be shown after dinner like a dessert in a – I guess as an amusement, partly an amusement but partly it was supposed to be reporting.</span> <span id="s646">These were like SS reports on what they were accomplishing.</span> <span id="s647">And they told us that there were a great many of these films.</span> <span id="s648">And the Russians said that they might be in this place, where they’d been sort of sealed up in a tunnel.</span> <span id="s649">And they did take us there, and it was on fire.</span> <span id="s650">It was burning.</span> <span id="s651">It was almost, it, it was, God, it looked like acres of film were burning.</span> <span id="s652">We did pick up little pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">And then they told us about two, two places in the sector, one called Rossleben and, and Rudersdorf – two small towns where the same thing.</span> <span id="s654">They would apparently make a tunnel into a mountainside or a hillside, and then seal up this film.</span> <span id="s655">And they were hiding it.</span> <span id="s656">And, and so we drove to both places.</span> <span id="s657">And in both places, of course, Rossleben and Rudersdorf, we found the same thing that we had found in the Russian sector.</span> <span id="s658">The film was burning, or had been burned – acres of it.</span> <span id="s659">It was huge.</span> <span id="s660">And once again, we were cheated out of getting what would have been just invaluable stuff.</span> <span id="s661">And again, we picked up here and there – it would be like a foot of, of film that was – you could see what it was if you held it to the light.</span> <span id="s662">And we did find some of that and made copies of it and, and brought that, and brought that down to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s663">But I was convinced by this having happened three times that someone must be informing them that, that we were coming to get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: (So what you’re saying really suggests that even though there was officially a prohibition on filming any of these kinds of activities, these guys were telling you that it was filmed.)</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: (Presumably this was film that was kept highly secret, right?)</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Yes, Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: (And not something that went through the Propaganda Ministry. )</span></p> <p><span id="s669">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: (Well that’s one question.</span> <span id="s671">And the other part is – these acres of films, was it your feeling that some of that was official German film, like the Goebbels empire, or that these were all SS film locations?)</span> <span id="s672">I don’t know if they all were, because we really couldn’t, we were not able to examine them the way that we would have wished to, but I got the feeling that these were more SS films that they were hiding, rather than the Goebbels propaganda films.</span> <span id="s673">But there might have been some of both.</span> <span id="s674">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s675">I really don’t know the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: (But tell us again where the German newsreel material was that you found.)</span> <span id="s677">Well, that we found mostly in the Babelsberg, where, that Avenerius was in charge of.</span> <span id="s678">Most of that film came from there that they had – all of the newsreel film that had been shot all, all through the war, from the early days.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: (Do you remember where you found the film of the trial of the bomb plotters?)</span> <span id="s680">Yes, I do.</span> <span id="s681">It, it was, I really, practically found that myself, with a couple of people with me.</span> <span id="s682">We – It was a film lab, and in the basement we found about twenty, twenty reels of film, and so I just took it with us and went back and started to run it.</span> <span id="s683">We didn’t know what was in it, and there was the whole God damned trial of the plotters.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">I was rather surprised, seeing the film did, The Nazi Plan, which had only a snippet of the trial, that I can’t remember why that was chosen, because there were far more shocking scenes than that one that we showed, that was not as abusive as some.</span> <span id="s685">I don’t know why that one… For some reason, Donovan, at first he didn’t want to use any of the film.</span> <span id="s686">He thought that crimes against their own people would not be as germane.</span> <span id="s687">I didn’t really understand it, because after all we were using film of the anti-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people.</span> <span id="s688">I never really agreed with him.</span> <span id="s689">I don’t know what his reticence was about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: (Well, I wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that the people on trial for trying to kill Hitler were not the defendants in the dock at Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s691">This was a really opposite polarity.)</span> <span id="s692">Well, that’s true.</span> <span id="s693">And Judge Freisler was not – God he was a horrible, but it’s true he was not on trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: (I think he was killed in an Allied bombing raid, actually, while he was in a courtroom.)</span> <span id="s695">Freisler, I think he was.</span> <span id="s696">I think he was killed.</span> <span id="s697">Thank God, he was a, God what a horrible….</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: (I share your, your passionate horror for that trial footage.</span> <span id="s699">I know it very well.)</span> <span id="s700">That trial was something.</span> <span id="s701">Then also… I don’t think, I don’t think I spoke about it last night, but the, our, our SS editors told us that the, uh, the uh, July 20th people, in being convicted, they were actually hung alive on meat hooks, big meat hooks, and just put like that and left to die.</span> <span id="s702">And that was photographed.</span> <span id="s703">That was photographed.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: (Filmed?)</span> <span id="s705">Filmed, I mean, yes, filmed.</span> <span id="s706">And the idea was that they would show that to every, in every diplomatic center, show it to all the diplomats, Nazi diplomats and High Command people, as a way of frightening them against doing something like that again.</span> <span id="s707">What we heard was that it, it sort of backfired.</span> <span id="s708">It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the regime and they stopped circulating it.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">And of course we were dying to get hold of that film.</span> <span id="s710">We were told that someone had actually sold it to someone in, in Switzerland, and so I went to Switzerland, went to Bern and to Basel, trying to find out if I could get the film.</span> <span id="s711">And a guy, a guy came to my hotel and said that he had the film, and, and he asked me how much I would pay for it.</span> <span id="s712">And I forget what I said – I had been told, I think, that we could go up to 5000.</span> <span id="s713">I think I started at 2500.</span> <span id="s714">And he said, he wouldn’t even think of it for 2500, and then we got up to 5000.</span> <span id="s715">And he came back and said, “I’ve got other people interested also, in it and I think they might be willing to pay more than 5000.”</span> <span id="s716">And then I only had permission for five, so I had to call Ray Kellogg and find out how much more we could pay than 5000.</span> <span id="s717">And it took time and red tape, and meanwhile this little guy came back.</span> <span id="s718">I waited there in the hotel, and he came back and looked at me, and I think he asked some exorbitant amount like 10,000.</span> <span id="s719">I said, well, I don’t have that yet.</span> <span id="s720">And he said, “Well, I have someone who’s willing to pay and I’ve decided not to come back any more, and I’m going to sell it to him.”</span> <span id="s721">And apparently they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Apparently it was Nazi people in Spain, where a great many had been able to reach and survive, and they bought it.</span> <span id="s723">And I went back empty-handed.</span> <span id="s724">I was very disappointed I didn’t get the film.</span> <span id="s725">If they’d given me enough money, if they had said 20,000… It was almost, it was like buying a Hollywood story, but – going back to my boss to ask how much money can I give him.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: (Was he a German?</span> <span id="s727">Was this little man a German?)</span> <span id="s728">No, I thought he was Swiss.</span> <span id="s729">I thought he was Swiss and not German.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: (You know, everyone’s still looking for that film – still looking for it.)</span> <span id="s731">These two people, they had seen it.</span> <span id="s732">And they described that film to me, said it was the most horrifying thing because the people lived for some time.</span> <span id="s733">And it was really gruesome.</span> <span id="s734">But it’s never been seen, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: (So who were the people who described – ) It’s way down in Argentina, maybe, or somewhere, that film.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: (But not in Russia, huh?</span> <span id="s737">You see a lot of speculation is that it got to Russia.)</span> <span id="s738">Yeah, but they never found it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: (No, and I think the Russians would have exposed it if they had it.)</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: (So who told you about actually seeing the film?)</span> <span id="s741">I’m trying to think – I’m trying to remember.</span> <span id="s742">Curt von Molo told me that he had not seen the film, but that someone had, that he knew had seen the film and told him about it.</span> <span id="s743">But he himself had not actually worked on that film.</span> <span id="s744">In fact, that there wasn’t anything to edit.</span> <span id="s745">Apparently they just photographed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: (So when you had to choose material for the Nazi Plan, I assume you were trying to show the defendants, in action, among other things.</span> <span id="s747">How did you decide what to keep and what to throw out?)</span> <span id="s748">Well, it was awfully tough, because we had such an embarrassment of riches.</span> <span id="s749">We had so God damn much material.</span> <span id="s750">What I would do is more or less make a list of what we had and then go down check it out with Jim Donovan.</span> <span id="s751">And he would say ‘Yes’ to that – specifically, things like the self-incriminating statements, like, like Goering, Goering reading the racist laws.</span> <span id="s752">So he said – In fact, watching the film yesterday, for the ordinary public, it’s a shame we can’t subtitle it, because Goering was saying something about the Jews, like that we need to sweep Germany clean with a steel broom, things like that, that were incriminating, so many things they were saying that were definitely in breach of international law.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">So it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination.</span> <span id="s754">I had told Jim Donovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to 5, and we could run all day.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">And he said, well obviously, we can’t do that.</span> <span id="s756">And we finally worked it down.</span> <span id="s757">Jim Donovan suggested four hours.</span> <span id="s758">And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the indictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the morning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock.</span> <span id="s759">And that film unit had so damn much film –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I’m interested in Joe Zigman since he also worked on the other film.)</span> <span id="s761">We had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and Bob Webb.</span> <span id="s762">And then we had one Russian girl – I swear to God, I don’t remember how she got assigned to us.</span> <span id="s763">She was very helpful.</span> <span id="s764">She was a very small Russian newsreel editor.</span> <span id="s765">I think her name was (Shostopol) or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">And so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to follow a sort of a rough outline that I would make.</span> <span id="s767">Let’s see now, we start in 1930 and we show highlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then somebody tried to select the most effective visually and verbally.</span> <span id="s768">And thank God, of course we had interpreters with us to translate for us, as my, my three years of German at Dartmouth College was being strained to the breaking point.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: (And were they handling original films, or did you make work copies?</span> <span id="s770">How did they do that?)</span> <span id="s771">Let’s see, at first we just looked at the original film, and then as we started making our selections, we would, then we would make copies of the footage that they were selecting.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: (And the bosses in Nuremberg – describe again how, how they wanted to review the film work.)</span> <span id="s773">Well, for one thing, they would say something, that they needed a photograph or something.</span> <span id="s774">The next day, they’d be calling and saying, “Well, where is it?</span> <span id="s775">Bring it down.”</span> <span id="s776">We would try to explain, that first we have to select, we have to edit it, we have to – they never understood it.</span> <span id="s777">They never understood.</span> <span id="s778">And General Donovan was very impatient.</span> <span id="s779">He had no patience with us at all, none at all.</span> <span id="s780">Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn’t be fulfilled down where we were, and that was the trouble.</span> <span id="s781">And he would be embarrassed, “Well, where is it?”</span> <span id="s782">So that, uh….</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Donovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know.</span> <span id="s784">His, his nose was out of joint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn’t want to play second fiddle to Jackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn’t stop us, but we were left in place without Donovan, to finish the work that we’d been asked to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: (So when you were working that quickly, and you got a little more time because the trial was postponed –) Thank God.</span> <span id="s786">When they said September 15th – we, we debated whether to go down and admit, I don’t think that there couldn’t be any photographic evidence.</span> <span id="s787">You’ll have to – Even though Jackson in his opening day remarks mentioned that, I think, it was historic, it was the first time ever that there would be – it was not only the first international trial, but the first trial I believe that ever used photographic, film photographic evidence that way.</span> <span id="s788">And we were almost ready to say we can’t do it.</span> <span id="s789">And then word came, it’s been postponed until October 15th.</span> <span id="s790">And then we had a month’s leave.</span> <span id="s791">But as we got toward October 15th we weren’t ready either.</span> <span id="s792">We still had like a month’s work, even killing ourselves with the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">And then thank God came this second postponement to November.</span> <span id="s794">And that really saved us, because without that, there wouldn’t have been any Nazi Plan film in the courtroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: (And when it was shown, I’m imagining – was it a film with tape joins, or had you made a print from, from the assembled material?)</span> <span id="s796">Yes, we ‘d made a print of the condensed four hour version, yeah, yes, but as noted Ray Kellogg had to – he testified as to the authenticity of the film, that it was all German film and so forth, and so forth, and that all we’d done is brought four hours in place of four hundred hours, that we could have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: (Did you ever consider whether you had too many Nazi Party rallies?)</span> <span id="s798">I was worried about that.</span> <span id="s799">I was worried about the party rallies, but at the same time, the party rallies included two valuable things.</span> <span id="s800">One was what they actually said at those rallies, which as it moved on, became more and more inflammatory as they got more and more powerful, and as the western democracies surrendered to them, and so on.</span> <span id="s801">They became more and more aggressive.</span> <span id="s802">So there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can’t trace.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">And also, there were people whose very presence indicted them.</span> <span id="s804">People would say that we, like Speer was one, and Schacht was another – and a number of people – and Keitel and Jodl – but people who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related.</span> <span id="s805">And showing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them.</span> <span id="s806">And, and Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: (Let’s talk about Leni Riefenstahl.</span> <span id="s808">Were going to change tape again, …so we won’t talk about Leni yet.)</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: (When you showed the Nazi Plan in the courtroom, you were there.</span> <span id="s810">Were the defendants glad to see themselves up on the screen?)</span> <span id="s811">No, I really wouldn’t describe it that way.</span> <span id="s812">No, I don’t think they were overjoyed.</span> <span id="s813">I think they were worried.</span> <span id="s814">They looked worried really.</span> <span id="s815">They looked very, they were very concerned.</span> <span id="s816">Goering is, is interesting.</span> <span id="s817">Goering was by far the smartest of all the people on trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">I remember the day at our hotel, when the captain psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited.</span> <span id="s819">He’d been testing the IQs of the various defendants.</span> <span id="s820">And he said, “My God, that Goering he acts like a clown.</span> <span id="s821">He’s a genius.”</span> <span id="s822">He said, “His IQ went through the roof, he’s so smart.”</span> <span id="s823">That guy’s name was Murphy, Captain Murphy, who strangely enough years later committed suicide also.</span> <span id="s824">I don’t remember why.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">But Goering tended to take the whole trial very seriously, as I mentioned last night.</span> <span id="s826">He acted like, as a defendant was who feels that he has a chance of being found not guilty.</span> <span id="s827">I don’t know if he really thought so, but that’s the way he acted, and that was his demeanor most of the time in the courtroom.</span> <span id="s828">He would take notes, and he would consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he took it very seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Some just sat like, as if they were staring.</span> <span id="s830">Streicher had a funny look on his face.</span> <span id="s831">And the two military people, Keitel of the Army and Adm. Jodl [sic] very clearly, very clearly were saying, were disassociating, their attitude was, we shouldn’t be here, and we have nothing to do with this.</span> <span id="s832">And they would sort of turn away, and act rather haughty, like that.</span> <span id="s833">They were all kind of different.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">But it is true that the day of the Nazi Plan screening I was very, it was like three months of work, it was like your movie is about to open, and I was very keen to get there.</span> <span id="s835">I purposely got there as early, so early I think I was the first one to walk in, and so I was able to get a seat.</span> <span id="s836">I sat at the end of the Russian table, and that table – as I noticed again last night – was like maybe ten feet from the dock, and from that vantage point, I was able to watch them.</span> <span id="s837">They were almost as near as you are, as you are to me, just a little further, but I could watch them absolutely, all their faces, I just going down the line, back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: (In the dark?)</span> <span id="s839">Well, it was dark except for the light of the screen.</span> <span id="s840">I could see them though.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: (Did you feel proud of your work?)</span></p> <p><span id="s842">I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: (Interruption) I was feeling awfully relieved that we had it in time, I think that was my main emotion.</span> <span id="s844">It was really touch and go, too.</span> <span id="s845">I mean I would get calls twice a day, “How is it?</span> <span id="s846">Is it ready?”</span> <span id="s847">It was also, I just couldn’t take it down and show it.</span> <span id="s848">I had to take it down and screen it for Jackson’s staff to make sure it was all germane, and, and I was very worried about that too – that they might say “No you can’t” – and they were very haughty, I mean they, their attitude toward us was sort of, “Who needs them?”</span> <span id="s849">I mean, “They’re just a pain in the ass, sort of a nuisance,” I felt, and we don’t really, they were such – not Donovan, but Ben Kaplan and the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: (OK, I think we’re out of here, right?)</span></p> <p><span id="s851">END Tape 2 Tape 3 of 3:</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Leni Riefenstahl.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">[Sound problem – Boom mike was missing.]</span> <span id="s855">Well, the – of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl’s master film of the Nazi party day – I think it was the seventh – called the Triumph of the Will.</span> <span id="s856">It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them.</span> <span id="s857">The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work.</span> <span id="s858">It was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s859">The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption.</span> <span id="s860">It was shown all over Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and the Sudetenland, and on and on they went, one little step at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, “How can we possibly defeat that power?”</span> <span id="s863">It was overwhelming, just overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">I think it was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions.</span> <span id="s865">It was a powerful piece of propaganda.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">And so, it was, it didn’t take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl.</span> <span id="s867">She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports.</span> <span id="s868">She was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine.</span> <span id="s869">And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they directed to me to some place in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s871">And I went there, and then I went to Kitzbühl.</span> <span id="s872">And one by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living – sort of hiding in the open, in a way.</span> <span id="s873">It wasn’t exactly hiding but she wasn’t advertising either, what her address was.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her house and literally just knock on the door.</span> <span id="s875">She was living in a very nice place – it was a big, big, rustic – it looked like three stories – a very, quite large – on a, overlooking a Bavarian lake.</span> <span id="s876">It was a very nice place.</span> <span id="s877">So that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s878">I just knocked on the door and somebody came to the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">And I was in my Navy uniform, of course.</span> <span id="s880">And I said, “I would like to speak to Miss Riefenstahl.”</span> <span id="s881">And they let me in.</span> <span id="s882">It was a little man, said he would call her.</span> <span id="s883">So I sat down, and I waited.</span> <span id="s884">It took a very long time for her to come.</span> <span id="s885">I think it was almost half an hour, maybe.</span> <span id="s886">She took a very long time coming.</span> <span id="s887">I think she was making up.</span> <span id="s888">After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker – big star in Germany –all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">And she finally came, and I sat with her on a couch.</span> <span id="s890">And she started right away working on me.</span> <span id="s891">She said, of course, “I’m a film artist, and internationally respected.”</span> <span id="s892">And she gave a very positive rundown on herself.</span> <span id="s893">And she said, “I’m respected everywhere in London, in Hollywood, and so forth, and I’m not a Nazi, I’m a pure film artist.”</span> <span id="s894">That was her own party line and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too.</span> <span id="s895">And, and when she told me how well received she was in Hollywood, of course that was my hometown.</span> <span id="s896">She didn’t know that I came from Hollywood.</span> <span id="s897">She just saw a young, an American officer who was trying to do her in.</span> <span id="s898">And she told me that, after all, even in 1938 everyone in Hollywood received her as a pure filmmaker and fellow artist.</span> <span id="s899">And I didn’t tell her that I was in Hollywood when she came.</span> <span id="s900">Hal Roach was an extremely rightwing – the old comedy producer/director Hal Roach gave a party for her, a big reception party, and asked all the main people in Hollywood to come.</span> <span id="s901">And all of the liberal people like Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy Parker and so many, Freddy March – a whole bunch, there must have been twenty – they were each given a list of ten people to phone and say, “Don’t go.”</span> <span id="s902">I had a list myself.</span> <span id="s903">And the party was a fiasco.</span> <span id="s904">Only about eight or ten people – just the extreme right wing people like Victor McLaglen, people like that – only the fascist minded people, of which there were unpleasantly some in Hollywood.</span> <span id="s905">It was a total fiasco.</span> <span id="s906">Basically, the party was a disaster for her.</span> <span id="s907">But I didn’t tell her that.</span> <span id="s908">I just listened and listened.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">But as I said last night, I had this warrant for her in my pocket.</span> <span id="s910">It was like burning a hole in my pocket.</span> <span id="s911">I thought, I would just let her talk a little longer, so I relaxed her.</span> <span id="s912">I didn’t argue with her at all about what she thought she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Finally I took the thing out and said, “Miss Riefenstahl, I’m sorry, but I have to take you to Nuremberg.”</span> <span id="s914">And that’s when she screamed “Puppi, Puppi, they’re, he’s arresting me,” she screamed.</span> <span id="s915">“He’s arresting me.”</span> <span id="s916">And he ran in.</span> <span id="s917">I didn’t know at the time, he was a major in the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s918">And I told her, I tried to reassure her, I said, “Look, you’re not being put on trial with Goering and von Ribbentrop, but we do need you as a material witness, and you’ll be held, you’ll be put up in one of the hotels, and held until the court releases you.”</span> <span id="s919">And so out we went.</span> <span id="s920">We went in – I wish I had a photo of that – because sitting outside was a weapons carrier, like an open truck almost.</span> <span id="s921">It was just the three of us, and we drove from there, from Kitzbühl, all the way to Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s922">She didn’t say anything on the way.</span> <span id="s923">She was just silent.</span> <span id="s924">She didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s925">She was very ticked off – very.</span> <span id="s926">And I guess scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: (Did she speak English?)</span> <span id="s928">Yes, she could speak English, I guess quite well.</span> <span id="s929">She spoke fairly well – accented, but fairly well.</span> <span id="s930">I didn’t need an interpreter with her, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: (How did you use her?)</span> <span id="s932">They would run film, we ran the Triumph of the Will and the other film that she made, and we would ask her to, we would stop it and ask her who was that, and who was that, and identifying people.</span> <span id="s933">Where and when and who it was, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: (Did she work with you both in Berlin and in Nuremberg?)</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Only in Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: (Only in Nuremberg?)</span> <span id="s937">I took her only to Nuremberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: (So she wasn’t in Wannsee…) No, she was never in Wannsee with us, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: (Do you remember what month it was, when in the course of the project?)</span> <span id="s940">When I took her there?</span> <span id="s941">I think it was quite soon before the trial actually started.</span> <span id="s942">I think it was like a week before, in, in early November.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: (Who wrote the intertitles for The Nazi Plan?)</span> <span id="s944">Well, I think I did, with the people that we had.</span> <span id="s945">We had this German prosecutor who had – I never quite understood how – he had defected in ’41 and got to the States, I think probably through the efforts of the OSS he somehow got to Switzerland on German business or something, and then defected.</span> <span id="s946">And he was a very helpful of course in defining for us what we were looking at.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: (So he was anti-Hitler, and he lived in the States and spoke English too?)</span> <span id="s948">Yes, yes he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: (Intertitles grew out of your list, your script you were taking back and forth for approval?)</span> <span id="s950">Yes, I think it was, yeah.</span> <span id="s951">We didn’t take the actual film.</span> <span id="s952">We would make a note describing what it was and, and summing up what was being said, or being written.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: (Tell us more about your brother’s role in The Nazi Plan.)</span> <span id="s954">Stuart, Stuart got, he located Hans Hoffmann, and Hoffmann was the key still photographic - both cameraman and archivist in, in Germany.</span> <span id="s955">He was really Hitler’s photographer.</span> <span id="s956">And as I mentioned, he was the father in law of one of the major war criminals.</span> <span id="s957">Baldur von Schirach was the head of the youth movement.</span> <span id="s958">And so Stuart with Hoffmann got access to, I guess, as much still photographs as I had film up in Berlin.</span> <span id="s959">He and the separate staff that he had went through thousands and thousands and thousands of photographs, doing much the same thing that I did, showing them to Donovan as to their value as evidence at the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">[Footnote: This refers to Heinrich Hoffmann.]</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: (And they were entered into evidence separately…) Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s962">They were entered separately</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: (Were you and Stuart together when you went through OSS training?)</span> <span id="s964">No, no we weren’t at all, because my training preceded Stuart’s, as I’d been in for almost a year, I think, before Stuart was transferred to the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s965">And I’m not sure that…see, I’m not sure that Stuart went through that, what you might call spy school.</span> <span id="s966">I don’t remember that he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: (Were you in Washington together?)</span> <span id="s968">Oh yes, it was at the south Agriculture Building.</span> <span id="s969">That’s where I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s970">It was treated like a ship.</span> <span id="s971">It was referred to as a ship.</span> <span id="s972">And we would “go ashore” and all this nonsense.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: (You know it’s right across the street from the Holocaust Museum?)</span> <span id="s974">I’ll be damned.</span> <span id="s975">No, I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s976">That’s where we were every day.</span> <span id="s977">That’s really ironic.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: (Could you tell us a little more about the SS editors?</span> <span id="s979">Von Molo &amp; Rothe – what were their sympathies?</span> <span id="s980">What were their attitudes to what the Nazis had done?)</span> <span id="s981">Well, Walter Rothe was, had been a Fox Movietone film editor, he was a newsreel editor.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Curt von Molo had been a feature film, film editor.</span> <span id="s983">He told me that he had worked with Fritz Lang and with some of the top German directors, and he seemed very, he seemed quite intelligent.</span> <span id="s984">And the two of them, instead of being two Nazi POWs that might have managed sympathy for each other, the two of them couldn’t stand each other.</span> <span id="s985">They didn’t like each other.</span> <span id="s986">And each, both of them told me – “I was recruited into the SS film unit but I was, I didn’t want to do it, but I had to or else.”</span> <span id="s987">Each one said the same thing, “I was really anti Nazi.”</span> <span id="s988">Each one said about the other guy: “Walter Rothe really was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s989">He was very sympathetic.”</span> <span id="s990">And Rothe said the same thing about von Molo.</span> <span id="s991">He was anti Nazi but von Molo was pro-SS and wanted to get in that SS film unit.</span> <span id="s992">They both said that.</span> <span id="s993">They had no use for each other at all.</span> <span id="s994">I really didn’t know which of them was right.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Also, Curt von Molo told me that all through the war, while he was working for the SS, that a Jewish film editor had been hiding in his attic, like in his house.</span> <span id="s996">And I took that with a grain of salt, because it was a joke to us.</span> <span id="s997">But from the first crossing over into Germany, we didn’t meet a German who didn’t have a Jew in the attic.</span> <span id="s998">How could there be six million Jews in the concentration camps, because they must have all been up in the attics.</span> <span id="s999">Everybody we met, almost without fail, would say, “I was against Hitler and I saved a Jew in my attic.”</span> <span id="s1000">It got to be a joke with us.</span> <span id="s1001">And von Molo said the same thing.</span> <span id="s1002">He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was very precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films, at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">I guess I didn’t tell that last night.</span> <span id="s1004">One Sunday, we – we would tend to try to rest on Sunday.</span> <span id="s1005">We were, everybody was really wiped out by this work.</span> <span id="s1006">One Sunday, I said to von Molo, “Look, Curt, I’m really sick of hearing about these Jews in the attic, I’ve had it up to here with it, and I’ve got to tell you I don’t believe it, and he said, “Well, honestly, I’m telling you the truth.</span> <span id="s1007">It was that fellow, a friend of mine, that I worked with in the studio, you know, UFA.”</span> <span id="s1008">And I said, “Look, it’s Sunday morning.</span> <span id="s1009">Let’s take the day off.</span> <span id="s1010">We’ll take a jeep, and you and I and a driver, we’ll just drive around the whole day in Berlin.”</span> <span id="s1011">Because, that’s right, he said, “Someone told me that he survived and that he’s back.</span> <span id="s1012">Someone said they saw him in Berlin, just a few days ago, and thank God, apparently he’s alive.”</span> <span id="s1013">So I said, “Curt, let’s take the day off.</span> <span id="s1014">And we’re going to look for this Jew in the attic.”</span> <span id="s1015">And we did.</span> <span id="s1016">So we start out, and he noticed some girl in Nuremberg, and we go there and we find her – it was incredible we could find anybody, with how they were living – the place was a total disaster – people were living in holes and doorways and Christ knows, anyway this first girl says, “I heard that too.”</span> <span id="s1017">And I (referenced?)</span> <span id="s1018">this person, we went to see him, it was amazing we’d find anybody but there was still, even with everything down, there was a kind of amazing word of mouth.</span> <span id="s1019">People seemed to know where other people were.</span> <span id="s1020">And to cut this short – after a few hours of going from one (street?)</span> <span id="s1021">to another, and finally to his actual, we found his own girlfriend, who had survived the war.</span> <span id="s1022">She lived all the way through the war in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1023">And she said, “Yes, he is, he’s definitely here.”</span> <span id="s1024">And she told us where she thought he was.</span> <span id="s1025">And we went there.</span> <span id="s1026">And here comes this little Jewish guy, he was still in his concentration camp stripes and still – he out, and he sees Curt, he hugs Curt, and he says to me, “This man saved my life.</span> <span id="s1027">I actually lived in his attic.”</span> <span id="s1028">And we finally found a real Jew in the attic.</span> <span id="s1029">And apparently Curt was telling the truth the whole time.</span> <span id="s1030">And from that time on, I became very, now I believed, now I knew that Curt was for real and that he really, he told me that Fritz Lang left, and he tried to leave, and got stopped, or something.</span> <span id="s1031">He wasn’t able to leave.</span> <span id="s1032">He was hoping to leave, too.</span> <span id="s1033">Now I believed him.</span> <span id="s1034">Now I thought that Walter Rothe was a Nazi rat.</span> <span id="s1035">But it really was an unbelievable story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: (Did Von Molo &amp; Rothe ever ask you about being Jewish?</span> <span id="s1037">Did they ever bring the subject up?)</span> <span id="s1038">No, not that I remember – no, I don’t remember them ever, no, I don’t, I don’t think they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: (Were there family members from your mother’s side who were affected by the Holocaust?)</span> <span id="s1040">Well, not really directly, no.</span> <span id="s1041">My mother was born in Latvia, and she came to the States with her parents when she was very, very young, like a year old – a baby being held in her mother’s arms, and she had no memory at all of Latvia, but that’s where she was born.</span> <span id="s1042">And my father, my father was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and his parents had come from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1043">But neither family was German-Jewish or, or involved in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: (But you must have still felt a personal commitment to this history) Oh gosh, yes, oh God, yes.</span> <span id="s1045">Oh absolutely, we thought, after all, if we’d been here, Warsaw or anywhere – We’d be one of these poor wretches in the ovens, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">One funny thing happened in Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1047">We were in this big mansion, really, in Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1048">And we just went in one day and said, “We’re staying here.”</span> <span id="s1049">And they, the woman was very well-to-do and she still had her servants and everybody living in the big house in Wannsee.</span> <span id="s1050">Out in the back of the little garden where there was a freshly dug grave that we could see, and apparently that was her husband.</span> <span id="s1051">We never really got clear on what the circumstances were, but they were obviously very well connected; they had done very nicely, until one day I got a bad cold, and I stayed in bed, I was in this big bedroom with my sniffles.</span> <span id="s1052">And she and the staff were very concerned about me.</span> <span id="s1053">They were taking care of me, the poor thing.</span> <span id="s1054">And they were bringing me tea and chicken soup and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1055">And I thought to myself, “If this had been last year, they would have been killing me, and now they’re taking care of my cold.”</span> <span id="s1056">I never told them about the Jewishness or anything.</span> <span id="s1057">But it struck me funny, the concern they showed for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">(Did you or your brother experience any hostility from Germans in the initial encounters when you started looking for materials?)</span> <span id="s1059">Not really.</span> <span id="s1060">The reaction I got was more, asking people, there’d be kind of a sullen – some, they were worried.</span> <span id="s1061">My impression was, Raye, that they were more defensive in being worried they might be involved.</span> <span id="s1062">They were like Just like the Jew in the attic – the reverse of that was no one to have heard of a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">I went to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1064">It must have been two miles outside of Dachau, and I got lost, and I asked the way to the Dachau concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1065">And this was two miles away.</span> <span id="s1066">They had never heard of it.</span> <span id="s1067">They didn’t know what I was talking about.</span> <span id="s1068">That was the attitude – more than hostility, was, I would say, their most concern was saving their own skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: (Tell us more about attending the Dachau Trial – how long were you there)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">I was only there about a week or so.</span> <span id="s1071">In fact, it was so typical there.</span> <span id="s1072">The, the, the pattern of denial was amazing.</span> <span id="s1073">The commander’s name was Wolf, and I swear to God, he looked kind of Jewish and had the Jewish name of Wolf.</span> <span id="s1074">And his defense was sort of like, it really was, his defense was sort of like – “Well, I tried to save as many as I could.</span> <span id="s1075">Like I could have killed 35 or 40 thousand a week but I only killed 17 thousand.”</span> <span id="s1076">It was like he saved the lives of all these people.</span> <span id="s1077">That was, that attitude went all the way down the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">There was one big stupid looking guard, and he was accused of maltreating the Jewish prisoners, and he actually said, he said, “Well, this woman, you see,” he said, “I was under orders, I had to kick her,” he said, “but I didn’t kick her nearly as hard as, I was trying to kick her as little as”.</span> <span id="s1079">.</span> <span id="s1080">It was, all the way down the line that was the attitude – that they did it as little as possible to survive.</span> <span id="s1081">I loved that thing about the kicking.</span> <span id="s1082">They only kicked her a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">And, and Wolf was, Wolf was hung.</span> <span id="s1084">I think he was the only one there, I think, that was hung.</span> <span id="s1085">The others there got sentences, different, but depending on their importance, on their involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">[Footnote: The Dachau Commander on trial was named Weiss – Martin Gottfried.</span> <span id="s1087">A prosecution witness named Wolf demonstrated punishment on the whipping block at Dachau.</span> <span id="s1088">See USHMM photo #61085] [Footnote: 42 were charged; 40 stood trial.</span> <span id="s1089">All 40 were found guilty; 36 were sentenced to death by hanging.</span> <span id="s1090">Official name of the trial was U.S. vs. Martin Gottfried Weiss, et al.</span> <span id="s1091">It began Nov. 15, 1945 and ran to December 13, 1945.]</span> <span id="s1092">I was only there to see how the trial was run, sort of getting ready for Nuremberg, which was of course on a much, much higher scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: (Was Stuart with you at all in Nuremberg, or in Berlin?</span> <span id="s1094">Did I ask you that already?)</span> <span id="s1095">It was just a short time.</span> <span id="s1096">It seems to me – I wonder if Sandra could confirm this – as far as I can remember, Stuart, I don’t think he was there on the, when we showed the film.</span> <span id="s1097">I think by that time Stuart – I’m quite sure had gone home.</span> <span id="s1098">I think he had finished his work.</span> <span id="s1099">I just remember him at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1100">But I don’t remember working with Stuart all the way through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: (Take us a little farther along into the Pare Lorentz documentary, and that project as it emerged.)</span> <span id="s1102">I was living out on my farm.</span> <span id="s1103">And I got back from the war in, I think it was February of ’46 was when I finally got released from the Navy.</span> <span id="s1104">And I got, I bought that farm out in Bucks County.</span> <span id="s1105">And Pare Lorentz came out to see me.</span> <span id="s1106">Oddly enough, he was married to the girl, Elizabeth Graham, that I had worked with as a co-writer for Selznick.</span> <span id="s1107">And I knew her very, very well, liked her.</span> <span id="s1108">And so he came out to see me to describe the film he was planning to make on Nuremberg, and he thought that after my Nuremberg experience, I would be the logical one to write and work with him on the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">And I told him that I had been in the war for four years.</span> <span id="s1110">I had just gotten out and now I had a contract for a novel with Random House, and they were actually paying me so much a month as an advance, and I was living on that, and so I had to go back and get started on my other career.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">He then tried again, sometime afterwards.</span> <span id="s1112">I saw him in New York, and he again urged me to write this, he was very set on doing it.</span> <span id="s1113">And at that point, we talked about Stuart.</span> <span id="s1114">Stuart actually had done an excellent job in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1115">I mean on his he was very able and very smart with it, and so it just seemed a logical, logical job for Stuart, which Pare then proceeded to work with Stu.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: (Did you follow very closely the making of the project?</span> <span id="s1117">Were you in touch with Stuart much?)</span> <span id="s1118">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1119">I would not say very closely, no.</span> <span id="s1120">I, of course I was in touch with Stuart and would see Stuart from time to time in New York, and I think once or twice I went out and saw Pare with Stuart and just heard what they were doing.</span> <span id="s1121">I forget if they asked me anything, but they might have.</span> <span id="s1122">But it was more like that, but it, I was not in constant touch, but I was very aware of Stuart’s work and aware of the troubles he was having, that Sandra explained last night in much more detail, but I was aware of all the back and forth troubles with the, uh, with the group in, in Germany that were trying to stop the film and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: (Do you remember at all hearing about this remarkable film footage that Stuart uncovered of this killing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Well, I just remember hearing about it once – that they actually had finally found something that we had hoped to find.</span> <span id="s1125">We never really found anything that was related to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1126">We had hoped to.</span> <span id="s1127">And we’d been told there was such film, but we had never uncovered it, so I was fascinated by what Stuart did, yeah.</span> <span id="s1128">I wish we could have shown that at the trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: (I’m sure you do.</span> <span id="s1130">Who told you that there was footage of the gas chambers?</span> <span id="s1131">Was this more from your SS editors?)</span> <span id="s1132">Yes, yes, they said that it, it also had been photographed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">(Did you ever come across Walter Frentz, who had worked with Leni Riefenstahl as a cameraman on the Olympics film?)</span> <span id="s1134">I remember his name but I don’t recall talking to him.</span> <span id="s1135">I remember his name, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: (Because he filmed some of those things you put in The Nazi Plan, you know.)</span> <span id="s1137">No, I don’t remember talking to him directly, only hearing about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: (Is there anything you could tell us about the link between the fact that Stuart and Joe Zigman worked on both The Nazi Plan and the Nuremberg documentary?</span> <span id="s1139">Do you have any thoughts about that continuity between them?)</span> <span id="s1140">Well, only that, I think that Stuart, in getting ready to make that film with Pare, that a very logical, the most logical film editor would have been someone who worked on The Nazi Plan.</span> <span id="s1141">And he was very friendly with Joe Zigman.</span> <span id="s1142">And, I think Bob Parrish had gone back to Hollywood and was building his own career right after he got out.</span> <span id="s1143">And so I think that Joe was the logical choice for, and an ideal choice for Stuart.</span> <span id="s1144">I remember him very well too, Zigman.</span> <span id="s1145">He was an awfully good person.</span> <span id="s1146">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: (Pare Lorentz seems to remember him very fondly, too.)</span> <span id="s1148">Yes, he was awfully appealing.</span> <span id="s1149">When did Joe die?</span> <span id="s1150">Do you know when?</span> <span id="s1151">Cause I lost touch with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: (I haven’t found out exactly.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: (SS editors – How did the main film editors use them?</span> <span id="s1154">Were they used as assistant editors?</span> <span id="s1155">Cutting?)</span> <span id="s1156">No, I don’t recall them, I don’t recall them.</span> <span id="s1157">… They were much more just advising as to what film was available.</span> <span id="s1158">I don’t think that they, I don’t remember them ever actually working on a Moviola, editing the film.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: (And Movieolas are what you used, right?)</span> <span id="s1160">That’s what they used then, oh yes, God, yes.</span> <span id="s1161">Hours and hours and hours at the Moviola</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: (Separate tracks for sound?)</span> <span id="s1163">Yes, I think there were separate tracks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: (For your material for The Nazi Plan, if I understand correctly, you only used original tracks that were found with the films?)</span> <span id="s1165">Absolutely, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1166">That’s the only thing we could do.</span> <span id="s1167">We couldn’t use anything that was not the German original, and nothing else, because they thought the defense attorneys would pounce on it.</span> <span id="s1168">And by the way, the defense attorneys took their jobs very seriously, because it was not like a routine, cut and dried.</span> <span id="s1169">They really, they were all excellent German lawyers.</span> <span id="s1170">And they worked very diligently and would make, I mean their, they argued very hard for their clients; they really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: (Did you have a sense that there was anxiety on the part of the prosecution, as to whether the film evidence would be accepted and valid in supporting the indictment?)</span> <span id="s1172">Well, uh, only at the beginning – at the beginning, much more than later.</span> <span id="s1173">I would say that gradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the statements were to what they had on paper.</span> <span id="s1174">And so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we went along, and that when they found that statements and pictures really were incriminating, they felt that it would bolster their case.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">I think it was quite surprising and very enterprising of Justice Jackson, coming from the background that he did – after all, he wasn’t John Ford from Hollywood – that he was as, as, as open to the use of film, which was so innovative and had never been done, as he was.</span> <span id="s1176">He was really very sympathetic to its use, as long as, as long as we were diligent.</span> <span id="s1177">Ben Kaplan who’s this very nice guy that I still talk to on the Vineyard.</span> <span id="s1178">He was very, very tough, and he was rather snooty about it.</span> <span id="s1179">I mean, he was doing it because they told him, but his heart wasn’t really in it, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s1180">But he would put it to very tough legal tests as to whether it was just movies or it really was, really was indictable evidence, which was good, really.</span> <span id="s1181">That was useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: (I believe that was the standard.</span> <span id="s1183">Visual images could be entered as long as they were pertinent, directly pertinent to the charge.)</span> <span id="s1184">Exactly, exactly, exactly.</span> <span id="s1185">And that’s what he held us to.</span> <span id="s1186">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: (Well, that must have made your job really hard at the beginning, when they hadn’t decided yet what the indictments were going to be.)</span> <span id="s1188">That’s very true.</span> <span id="s1189">At the beginning, the whole thing was so, so nebulous, that we almost had to try to read their minds as to what they would be looking for.</span> <span id="s1190">We had to decide – these non-legal minds of ours – what did seem to us indictable evidence.</span> <span id="s1191">Yeah, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1192">We had pretty good – but I must say, looking back, that we had a pretty good sense of what was really verbal and visual crime.</span> <span id="s1193">We had some sense of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: (Do you know what was done with the original film elements when you were finished?)</span> <span id="s1195">Well, I was very nervous about that, because, for one thing, on the July 20th, all that film, I had something which, there was some army colonel that was attached to us, and we found out that he had taken some of that film and sold it to some American company.</span> <span id="s1196">And I just hit the ceiling, because all this stuff was very valuable in a private profit-making way.</span> <span id="s1197">It was all very hot film, you might say.</span> <span id="s1198">I had nightmares about how people might try to grab it and steal it and, and, and sell it.</span> <span id="s1199">And this colonel in the army, I asked that, I talked to Kellogg about him and asked that he be removed from us.</span> <span id="s1200">I talked to people about – you must not –everybody has to be absolutely, totally honest about this, and, and scrupulous about it.</span> <span id="s1201">We must send all of it back to the National Archives, and nowhere else.</span> <span id="s1202">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1203">I sent all of the film to the National Archives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: (So, you must have required security even for the cutting rooms?)</span> <span id="s1205">Well, we did.</span> <span id="s1206">Yes we did.</span> <span id="s1207">Yes they did.</span> <span id="s1208">Yes, we were concerned about that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: (Did you every sleep during this period?)</span> <span id="s1210">Sleep?</span> <span id="s1211">I don’t think any of us every slept very much.</span> <span id="s1212">I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1213">We were very hopped up.</span> <span id="s1214">We were so excited, and also driven.</span> <span id="s1215">The phone calls from Nuremberg were a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1216">When the phone rang from Nuremberg, I would grit my teeth – I knew what was coming.</span> <span id="s1217">And we were, we lived really in, in fear that any moment, they would say, “Pack it in, we’ll do without the film.”</span> <span id="s1218">We were very afraid that might happen, and so we all went on, on very little sleep, very little sleep.</span> <span id="s1219">But we were all very nerved up, too, and hyper, and really very into how much we were being challenged to do in a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: (There must have been a great deal of comradeship.)</span> <span id="s1221">There was, it was a very close unit.</span> <span id="s1222">Bob Parrish who unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago, he became one of my best friends.</span> <span id="s1223">He was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s1224">He was more or less in charge of all the film editors.</span> <span id="s1225">And he was a lovely man.</span> <span id="s1226">He was a sort of child star.</span> <span id="s1227">He was a great pet of John Ford.</span> <span id="s1228">Ford really loved Bob, and really helped him after he passed from acting to get in on the ground floor of film editing, he helped him a lot.</span> <span id="s1229">And Ford – as nasty as I could find him – was always very benign with Bob.</span> <span id="s1230">He really liked Bob.</span> <span id="s1231">And Bob was a charming guy, as well as being very, very, very able.</span> <span id="s1232">I think he won an Oscar later for Body and Soul, editing.</span> <span id="s1233">And then later he became a film director, on his own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: (How do you look back on this fitting into your whole career and life?</span> <span id="s1235">What does this short period mean to you in terms of what you did?)</span> <span id="s1236">Well, I think of myself as being very lucky, really, that I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and that I was very lucky they chose me for that job.</span> <span id="s1237">They could have picked somebody else, I guess.</span> <span id="s1238">And I think that just now, looking back that long ago as some, just one chapter in my life.</span> <span id="s1239">In just a short time I’ve celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trial.</span> <span id="s1240">And quite recently I celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Watts Writers Workshop, that I got started when, on the day the curfew was lifted on the Watts riots, or the Uprising as they always called it down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">I think I’ve been lucky that I’ve been able to be at certain places at the right times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: (We only have a couple more minutes…)</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: (Do you want to describe some more about the Watts Workshop?</span> <span id="s1245">That seems like a wonderful…) Well, I . . . .</span> <span id="s1246">Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40th, and, and uh saw these men who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids who were running the streets and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on the phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep, profound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of this Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and throwing Molotov cocktails and all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">When I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it was pretty wild still there.</span> <span id="s1248">Some buildings were still smoking and smoldering, and there were little fires in the different open lots, and it was very, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea, sort of a wild idea, of starting a writer’s workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of a settlement house called Westminster.</span> <span id="s1249">I just put a sign up on the bulletin board saying “Writer’s Workshop, anybody interested sign below.”</span> <span id="s1250">And I said I would be back every Wednesday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">It took me a long time, for about 2 ½ months nobody came.</span> <span id="s1252">Nobody came.</span> <span id="s1253">I just sat there.</span> <span id="s1254">I just sat there, and I learned a lot about Watts.</span> <span id="s1255">I read the local paper, The Sentinel, I talked with the social workers.</span> <span id="s1256">I went down in the, in the pool hall, sat around there, got kind of snubbed and glared at.</span> <span id="s1257">I learned a lot, and my wife Geraldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she said, I’d come back and she said, “Well, what happened?”</span> <span id="s1258">I’d say, “Well nobody showed up.”</span> <span id="s1259">And she’d say, “How long can you really, sort of a Don Quixote act, this is getting ridiculous, how many times can you go to Watts and nobody shows up?”</span> <span id="s1260">And I said “Well, I think I’ll just wait till, I’ll give it from August until Thanksgiving.”</span> <span id="s1261">This is now into, maybe early October.</span> <span id="s1262">And I said, “If nobody shows up by Thanksgiving ok, I’ll, uh, I’ll pack it in.”</span> <span id="s1263">Finally, finally, the next time I went down, this one guy came.</span> <span id="s1264">And it was, it was Charles, uh, Taylor, and he came with a young somewhat, uh, somewhat demented, uh, young man, very disturbed.</span> <span id="s1265">And, uh, and this Charles sat opposite me and the young man sat right up, right next to me and just staring right at me.</span> <span id="s1266">It was a, uh, strange, just stared at me.</span> <span id="s1267">And, uh, anyway, I brought down Claude Brown’s book, Manchild in the Promised Land and this guy Charles said, “What is all this?</span> <span id="s1268">What are you up to?</span> <span id="s1269">What are you trying to do?”</span> <span id="s1270">He was rather, a little bit belligerent, challenging, and I said, “There’s no mystery to it, I’m trying to start a writer’s workshop.”</span> <span id="s1271">And I then read to him some excerpts from Manchild in a Troubled Land, and it was a little bit about, about Claude at the age of about 10, and, uh, there’s been a riot in, in, uh, in Harlem, and he’s too small to go to it but his big brother’s saying, “Boy it was great.</span> <span id="s1272">We got a, we got a television set, and a radio and this and that,” and, um, little Claude says, he writes this, “Gee, that sounds like such fun.</span> <span id="s1273">When can we have another one, when can we have another riot?”</span> <span id="s1274">And when I read that out loud to him, his reaction was amazing, he said, “I didn’t know you were allowed to write that in a book!”</span> <span id="s1275">He said, “Would they arrest him for that?”</span> <span id="s1276">And I said, “Not only not arrest him, this book is a major bestseller.</span> <span id="s1277">He’s making a lot of money out of this book.”</span> <span id="s1278">Well, he was just amazed.</span> <span id="s1279">And that was, that really opened the door, I think he went back, because next the day, next Wednesday, two or three people showed up with him, I think, including Johnny Scott and a few other young poets.</span> <span id="s1280">I’ll make this short, but what they showed me – I couldn’t believe.</span> <span id="s1281">Their work was so goddamn good.</span> <span id="s1282">Johnny Scott was a goddamn genius.</span> <span id="s1283">I read some the other day, it’s so good, and some of the others were too.</span> <span id="s1284">And that was the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">I then went to Los Angeles magazine and told them about this, and I showed them the work, and so they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and, uh, Time Magazine picked up on it, did a big story – also running a page of Johnny Scott and Jimmy Sherman, Sammy Harris, all these young poets.</span> <span id="s1286">And for that to be in Time Magazine was a huge, huge thing.</span> <span id="s1287">And they were offered money.</span> <span id="s1288">Then it got bigger and bigger, and it’s still going.</span> <span id="s1289">We have now, now we have in New York, and when I got to New York I started it there, and we now have the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center on, uh, on 96th Street.</span> <span id="s1290">And there we have a faculty of twenty, and it’s, it’s much more, much more structured now.</span> <span id="s1291">Now it’s a real writing school, and, uh, it’s going very strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: (So you’re back to where you were born.)</span> <span id="s1293">Pretty much, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1294">Yes, I am, it’s very close to where I was born, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: (Budd, this is such a privilege and I thank you so much.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: (I wish we could keep going.</span> <span id="s1298">We’ll have to do it the next time).</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Oh, alright, Raye, fine.</span> <span id="s1300">It’s been nice to talk to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: (Thank you so, so much) You’re very welcome.</span> <span id="s1302">You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">END Tape 3 USHMM Archives
