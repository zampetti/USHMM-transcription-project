would like to start and give us a frame of time and place?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Engel: You ask and I will answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Interviewer: How old were you in 1936?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Engel: I was 35 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">15:01:48 Interviewer: So what was happening then?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Engel: What was happening?</span> <span id="s21">It wasn't new, the anti-Semitism because it was always there.</span> <span id="s22">It started with the children's education.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Interviewer: How old was Eriks then?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Jacoby: In 1935, I was seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Engel: But not with my children education at --.</span> <span id="s26">They didn't take the Jewish children to colleges.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">15:02:24 In high school, they still could go, but not to colleges.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">About six percent of the students could be Jews at this time, but they didn't go because they didn't feel good.</span> <span id="s29">So they had to go to</span></p> <p><span id="s30">other countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Interviewer: The Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">15:03:14 Engel: The Jews.</span> <span id="s33">They went to Italy.</span> <span id="s34">They went to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s35">They wanted to become doctors, lawyers or</span></p> <p><span id="s36">something.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Interviewer: And you had one boy older than Erika and one younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Engel: But it doesn't matter because I wouldn't send anyone to</span></p> <p><span id="s39">college.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">15:03:49 Then they started with the licenses for the Jewish businessmen.</span> <span id="s41">Everybody had to prove that they were really Hungarian born.</span> <span id="s42">At this time already, it wasn't all Hungary.</span> <span id="s43">When my parents and grandparents were born,</span></p> <p><span id="s44">15:04:13 Hungary was very big.</span> <span id="s45">When fascism came, it was declared separate states.</span> <span id="s46">So my father had to go and look for his birth certificate.</span> <span id="s47">It was in another part of the country.</span> <span id="s48">It</span></p> <p><span id="s49">15:04:43 belonged to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s50">It was very hard to get it because you had to have witnesses.</span> <span id="s51">His witnesses were all very old.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">They couldn't remember anything.</span> <span id="s53">So it was very hard.</span> <span id="s54">Of course, a lot of bribery and</span></p> <p><span id="s55">15:05:03 a lot of money could get this.</span> <span id="s56">Even with that it was very hard because they took all the money and they didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">15:05:43 Interviewer: You were telling us earlier about your father.</span> <span id="s58">Do you want to talk a little about him ?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Engel: My father.</span> <span id="s60">He was a well-to-do man so we didn't feel too much of the anti-Semitism because they were dependant on him.</span> <span id="s61">He had 400 workers in</span></p> <p><span id="s62">15:06:06 his coal mine.</span> <span id="s63">Almost the whole town was not much more than this because it was at this time about 3000 or 4000 people.</span> <span id="s64">So they were dependant on him.</span> <span id="s65">Later on, in '18 after the revolution when they took everything away, all these people who he</span></p> <p><span id="s66">15:00:46 brought home from the front in the First World War came in and said.</span> <span id="s67">Look, the mine is ours and you ___ Interviewer: They nationalized your mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">15:07:16 Engel: So then we saw the real nature of these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Later on, it wasn't so bad because people got used to the changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">In the first days of the revolution, everybody was mad.</span> <span id="s71">But it calmed down a little.</span> <span id="s72">They accepted that, in this little city, they can't do anything without the Jew.</span> <span id="s73">They never went to school.</span> <span id="s74">They didn't know how to write their</span></p> <p><span id="s75">15:08:06 names.</span> <span id="s76">They couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s77">They needed the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">so it was a little easier.</span> <span id="s79">Only it was not good because every three or four months, there was another government.</span> <span id="s80">But with the people, it wasn't so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Interviewer: We were talking before about the envy and the anti-</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Engel: The anti-Semitism was always there.</span> <span id="s84">We went to Jewish</span></p> <p><span id="s85">schools beaus there</span></p> <p><span id="s86">15:08:35 was no public school.</span> <span id="s87">There was the Catholic, the Protestant and the Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">So they hated each other.</span> <span id="s89">The Catholics hated the Jews and they hated the Protestants.</span> <span id="s90">The hated each other and they both</span></p> <p><span id="s91">15:08:55 hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s92">So it was always there.</span> <span id="s93">When children went on the street, the Gentile children always said" This is Jew.</span> <span id="s94">This is Jew."</span> <span id="s95">And maybe they throw a rock.</span> <span id="s96">But you got used to it because everything came only from the people not the government.</span> <span id="s97">In this little city that was dependant on the Jews, the</span></p> <p><span id="s98">15:09:35 government was dependant on the Jews too.</span> <span id="s99">You remember all these stories from Germany about how they were always dependant on the Jewish money.</span> <span id="s100">It was so in Hungary too.</span> <span id="s101">So the anti-Semitism</span></p> <p><span id="s102">didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s103">15:09:56 come out.</span> <span id="s104">Even if they ware anti-Semites, it didn't come out in the open against us.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Interviewer: How were you experiencing it later, Eriks, as a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Jacoby: Well, I remember as a child that I was always afraid of the</span></p> <p><span id="s107">non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">15:10:21 I grew up in the city of Miskolz?)</span> <span id="s109">My brothers went to ...?)</span> <span id="s110">and they had these little pairs.</span> <span id="s111">I remember that they were going to school during the day.</span> <span id="s112">That was alright.</span> <span id="s113">But in the evening, our maid always had to go and fetch them because</span></p> <p><span id="s114">15:10:33 they would be beaten up on their way home.</span> <span id="s115">In the morning too.</span> <span id="s116">When I went to Eddering(?)</span> <span id="s117">where my mother was born, there was a very interesting relationship with the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s118">I was allowed to</span></p> <p><span id="s119">play with</span></p> <p><span id="s120">15:10:55 them, but I knew that there was something in between us that we could never talk about.</span> <span id="s121">I wasn't sure what it was.</span> <span id="s122">I remember not understanding why I was not as free or good as they</span></p> <p><span id="s123">were although</span></p> <p><span id="s124">15:11:11 they looked worse than I did.</span> <span id="s125">As a child, that was a very confusing thing for me.</span> <span id="s126">I didn't understand the distinction and on what basis there was a distinction between us.</span> <span id="s127">I also knew, for example, exactly how to behave with them.</span> <span id="s128">I knew what I could do, in whose house I could go and whose house they would throw me out or not welcome me.</span> <span id="s129">Also, I remember stories about the (cher?)</span></p> <p><span id="s130">15:11:41 non-Jews.</span> <span id="s131">I remember the words being used: "Oh, he's a rocher(?)</span> <span id="s132">It means he's a wicked man.</span> <span id="s133">I remember trying not to pass in front of his house because as children, we were affected by these words.</span> <span id="s134">We didn't understand exactly what could be done to us, but we knew that if there was somebody who was a rocher(?)</span> <span id="s135">, perhaps we couldn't even pass</span></p> <p><span id="s136">15:12:05 in front of his house.</span> <span id="s137">Something terrible might happen to us.</span> <span id="s138">The thing I most clearly remember has to do with the Church.</span> <span id="s139">I remember that there was a real frightful experience: the Easter.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">We were very</span></p> <p><span id="s141">15:12:25 frightened.</span> <span id="s142">We were told not to go outside because something could happen to us.</span> <span id="s143">We didn't quite know what.</span> <span id="s144">As I think back, all the beautiful pageantry of the Church becomes very hateful to me.</span> <span id="s145">There was danger lurking behind those pageantries.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">I couldn't understand because synthetically, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s147">I couldn't understand how that could hurt me.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">15:13:04 Christmas also was a very frightening experience for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Mainly because we didn't understand the connection.</span> <span id="s150">Nobody sat down with us and explained what might happen or why there are those feelings.</span> <span id="s151">So I think children were not paid much attention to.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Interviewer: Was there a reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">15:13:28 Engel: I didn't feel these things that she felt because when I was at home, I felt independent like my father.</span> <span id="s154">I was in business with my father.</span> <span id="s155">I had to deal with all these people and they were really dependant on my.</span> <span id="s156">They had to get a loan.</span> <span id="s157">They had to buy something on charge.</span> <span id="s158">So they were dependant</span></p> <p><span id="s159">15:14:02 on my father and dependant on me.</span> <span id="s160">So I didn't feel these things.</span> <span id="s161">When I went on the street, I felt that I was more than they were.</span> <span id="s162">They wouldn't dare say a word that I wouldn't like because they knew that I could do something for them back.</span> <span id="s163">It was already the march of fascism.</span> <span id="s164">She didn't belong already.</span> <span id="s165">She was already</span></p> <p><span id="s166">the third generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">15:14:47 But I didn't feel these things because I thought that I am more and you depend on me.</span> <span id="s168">I didn't feel bad when I went into the priest and I told him... My father wouldn't know about it, but there was a young priest who I would sit down with.</span> <span id="s169">I told this young priest what I wanted to tell him.</span> <span id="s170">I wasn't</span></p> <p><span id="s171">15:15:18 afraid of him.</span> <span id="s172">I had this strength because it was my background that made me strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Jacoby: I remember when we had restaurant in Miskolz(?)</span> <span id="s174">.</span> <span id="s175">During the night, we usually put down a heavy iron grate or curtain.</span> <span id="s176">That covered all the window.</span> <span id="s177">They used to come at night and bang on</span></p> <p><span id="s178">15:15:52 the .</span> <span id="s179">.</span> <span id="s180">Our house was attached to the restaurant.</span> <span id="s181">They used to bang on them and call," Dirty Jew."</span> <span id="s182">Open up.</span> <span id="s183">I don't know how real the danger was, but I remember being very frightened.</span> <span id="s184">My father was very frightened too.</span> <span id="s185">My mother wasn't so frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">15:16:18 She went to the kitchen and took out the long knife and she said "Nobody's going to come in here" She was standing there with that long knife at the door and if anybody would dare come in... Now, I don't know if she would have done anything, but those were very frightening times.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Later on, when things got worse as I grew older, I remember mostly how we were kind of ostracized from other people.</span> <span id="s188">That was mostly in Miskolz(?)</span> <span id="s189">.</span> <span id="s190">I remember that we had a neighbor, an older</span></p> <p><span id="s191">15:16:59 man.</span> <span id="s192">He didn't allow us to come near his house.</span> <span id="s193">"Dirty Jewish kids!</span> <span id="s194">Keep away from my place" We used to be so scared of him.</span> <span id="s195">He used to yell at us.</span> <span id="s196">We never dared to cross in front of his house.</span> <span id="s197">What happened, and it really has a very sad ending, was this man himself was a third generation convert.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">15:17:27 His grandfather was a Jew.</span> <span id="s199">He was transported to Auschwitz in the same cattle car that I was.</span> <span id="s200">I never forgot that.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Interviewer: So who brought you up to 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">15:18:14 Jacoby: The other neighbors... for example, we lived in an apartment building and upstairs there was a Catholic family.</span> <span id="s203">They had a son about my age.</span> <span id="s204">I</span></p> <p><span id="s205">15:18:30 very much wanted to be his friend.</span> <span id="s206">I would have liked to visit him especially when it came to be Christmas.</span> <span id="s207">I went up and I wanted to look in at their Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s208">I had great envy of the little colored candies that were a Christmas decoration.</span> <span id="s209">I</span></p> <p><span id="s210">15:18:55 wanted so badly to have one.</span> <span id="s211">I wanted to go in to say hello to them.</span> <span id="s212">The boy noticed that I was lurking around their room and came out and said "I can't talk to you.</span> <span id="s213">My mother told me I can't talk to you.</span> <span id="s214">You are Jewish"</span></p> <p><span id="s215">15:19:13 By than, of course, I understood, but it was a real pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">I just couldn't understand why.</span> <span id="s217">I understood that because I was Jewish, but I didn't understand why I wasn't okay to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">15:19:31 I remember one of the neighbors of my girlfriend whose house we went to play at.</span> <span id="s219">The neighbors kids also played with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">The neighbors kids were sent to get some bread from the Jewish bakery.</span> <span id="s221">They brought it home and then sliced the</span></p> <p><span id="s222">15:15:57 bread and took the crust off each slice.</span> <span id="s223">I said to the lady "Why do you take the crust off?</span> <span id="s224">My mother says that's very healthy" So she said "That's because the Jews touched it.</span> <span id="s225">We can't eat it if the</span></p> <p><span id="s226">15:20:14 Jews touched it" So these were the things that I'm sure affected me and gave me the kind of image about myself that something must be terribly wrong with me.</span> <span id="s227">In contrast to my mother who never felt there was something wrong with her, I always felt</span></p> <p><span id="s228">there</span></p> <p><span id="s229">15:20:32 was something wrong with me.</span> <span id="s230">I couldn't understand why.</span> <span id="s231">I always tried very hard to be a good girl and the best student I could be, but still I wasn't good enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Interviewer: At that point, you were still in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Jacoby: I was still in school.</span> <span id="s234">I went to a Jewish elementary school and then to a Jewish junior high school which was a community school.</span> <span id="s235">It was a very good school.</span> <span id="s236">From that school,</span></p> <p><span id="s237">15:21:03 children who graduated either entered a teachers'seminary which was also a Jewish community school or they would go to a non- Jewish school like a commercial high school if they could.</span> <span id="s238">By the time I graduated from junior high, there was no opportunity for me to go on to any other school.</span> <span id="s239">Although I was a very good student,</span></p> <p><span id="s240">I</span></p> <p><span id="s241">15:21:33 was not able to go on studying any more.</span> <span id="s242">I felt very betrayed about that.</span> <span id="s243">I thought that if I studied hard, I could do something, but I couldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Interviewer: What did you want to do?</span> <span id="s245">What was your dream?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Jacoby: I didn't want to do business; I grew up in a business family.</span> <span id="s247">I wanted to be some kind of a professional.</span> <span id="s248">I didn't know exactly what, but I knew I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s249">My brothers were sent to Yeshivs(?)</span> <span id="s250">and I was envious of them.</span> <span id="s251">Probably I</span></p> <p><span id="s252">15:22:12 wanted to study something about the Jews.</span> <span id="s253">I was very interested in that.</span> <span id="s254">I also wanted to compete with the boys.</span> <span id="s255">I wanted to be as good as them.</span> <span id="s256">I don't remember if I had any definite goals, but I knew that I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s257">Studying was</span></p> <p><span id="s258">very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Interviewer: Was this okay with you and your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">15:22:38 Engel: Yes beaus I always wanted to study my whole life.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">My father agreed that I could study what I wanted because he trusted me and he loved me very much.</span> <span id="s262">Of all the children, I can</span></p> <p><span id="s263">say that he 15 22:59 loved me the most and he trusted me the most.</span> <span id="s264">I never wanted to stay in businsss either.</span> <span id="s265">I wanted to study.</span> <span id="s266">I asked to study.</span> <span id="s267">So, I didn't mind her.</span> <span id="s268">The boys we minded because we wanted them to be reading a lot about religion.</span> <span id="s269">We wanted them to know a lot of Talmud.</span> <span id="s270">It was much harder to study the Talmud than to study</span></p> <p><span id="s271">for a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Interviewer: You mentioned before that your father was convinced that you wouldn't go away from the religion and you were convinced that Erika wouldn't go away from the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Engel: Yes.</span> <span id="s274">Because they were growing up and there weren't public schools so there wasn't a mix of the</span></p> <p><span id="s275">15:24:03 students like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Jacoby: Every family wanted their children to be educated.</span> <span id="s277">The boys of course wanted their children to have a lot of Jewish studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">15:24:25 Interviewer: Then as the war came on and you were struggling with that, school stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Jacoby: Yes.</span> <span id="s280">All the schools were stopped.</span> <span id="s281">There was no more Jewish education or any education for children.</span> <span id="s282">Jewish children were not accepted anymore to the Catholic or Protestant high schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">15:24:51 Interviewer: Were you hearing what was going on in Germany and Poland?</span> <span id="s284">What did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Jacoby: I had very little factual knowledge.</span> <span id="s286">I only had impressions.</span> <span id="s287">I remember when some of the refugees arrived and we heard stories about how their families were</span></p> <p><span id="s288">15:25:52 killed.</span> <span id="s289">There was one evening when we had a wedding for a rabbi who escaped whose whole family was killed.</span> <span id="s290">He remarried in Hungary.</span> <span id="s291">I remember that we had to hide him in our house.</span> <span id="s292">We</span></p> <p><span id="s293">15:25:35 made a kind of underground wedding for him.</span> <span id="s294">I remember how impressed I was about the danger of that.</span> <span id="s295">We heard the stories about Hitler.</span> <span id="s296">I must have been very young.</span> <span id="s297">We fabricated stories of heroism, what we could do to Hitler.</span> <span id="s298">I remember how we</span></p> <p><span id="s299">15:25:57 tried to outdo each other.</span> <span id="s300">"I would do this" And the other would say "No, I'm going to do this."</span> <span id="s301">We kept boasting about our courage and how we would deal with this man.</span> <span id="s302">Of course, there were Hitler jokes and things like that coming from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s303">My brothers would come home every night with a new joke about how we were going to overcome Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">15:26:23 The fear of Hitler was among us all the years while the stories went on, but I don't think that I had an actual, factual knowledge of what was really happening.</span> <span id="s305">You probably did.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">15:21:41 Engel: In the first years when Hitler came up, we were so Hungarian that we ware really angry with the Allies that they took away from Hungary the tutors(?)</span> <span id="s307">and took away from Germany the rule.</span> <span id="s308">We were really angry.</span> <span id="s309">Four years we were in the war</span></p> <p><span id="s310">15:27:07 and they took everything away.</span> <span id="s311">So first we really didn't mind what he did because the Versailles Peace Treaty wasn't right.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">We felt this way as Hungarians.</span> <span id="s313">We were more Hungarian than Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Later when he came out with all these laws against the Jews, we</span></p> <p><span id="s315">started to</span></p> <p><span id="s316">15:27:45 think that this is against us and not against the allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Interviewer: But you still felt safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Engel: I felt safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Jacoby: Until when?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Engel: Until he wasn't in Hemuskolz(?)</span> <span id="s321">.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Jacoby: Do you remember your brother who was studying in</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Preshbourg(?)</span> <span id="s324">?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">15:28:11 Engel: Not in Preshbourg(?)</span> <span id="s326">, in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Jacoby: In Austria.</span> <span id="s328">He came home and told us about what was happening.</span> <span id="s329">What happened then?</span> <span id="s330">You didn't believe him?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Engel: Nobody believed him.</span> <span id="s332">He came home and said that the Germans came into Vienna.</span> <span id="s333">They threw</span></p> <p><span id="s334">15:28:32 people out of the Viendorz(?)</span> <span id="s335">.</span> <span id="s336">His rabbi's wife had to clean the street.</span> <span id="s337">All kinds of things.</span> <span id="s338">So in the restaurant(?)</span> <span id="s339">, people said to him "You know, you'd better not say these things because you can get in jail" But he believed this so after half a year, he wasn't in Heinrick(?)</span> <span id="s340">.</span> <span id="s341">He told everybody and nobody wanted</span></p> <p><span id="s342">to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">15:29:12 Interviewer: Where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Engel: To Mexico.</span> <span id="s345">He went to all the lands.</span> <span id="s346">He went to Greece.</span> <span id="s347">He went to Italy.</span> <span id="s348">He went everywhere until he got out of Proportagard(?)</span> <span id="s349">in the last ship to Mexico.</span> <span id="s350">But nobody wanted to believe him.</span> <span id="s351">It was</span></p> <p><span id="s352">15:29:30 already 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Jacoby: so interesting to hear this because, Engel: Because we had Horty(?)</span> <span id="s354">.</span> <span id="s355">We believed so in Horty.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Interviewer: Admirer Horty.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Jacoby: But what about your brothers?</span> <span id="s358">Your brothers were old and taken into the working camps already</span></p> <p><span id="s359">5:29:50 why before Hitler came in.</span> <span id="s360">What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Engel: Because in the first years in 1939 when they first took my older brother, after a year he came back.</span> <span id="s362">So we thought that when they took the other ones out, they want come back too.</span> <span id="s363">But nobody</span></p> <p><span id="s364">came 30:00 back.</span> <span id="s365">I don't know why we couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s366">We saw already that these Jews who came in 50 years ago from Gardisia(?)</span> <span id="s367">, from Poland... They had already grandchildren there and they had businesses there.</span> <span id="s368">One day came that everybody had to go and register and they took all of the men away.</span> <span id="s369">We didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s370">15:30:48 know where they were.</span> <span id="s371">They took the men to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">15:31:01 Interviewer: So you didn't recognize that this was different?</span> <span id="s373">This wasn't just like conscription into the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Engel: We were very backwards in Jewish leadership.In Budapest, the big ones, they knew already.</span> <span id="s375">They knew already, but didn't know it in 1944 when Eichmann(?)</span> <span id="s376">came in because until 1944, nobody left Budapest either.</span> <span id="s377">They went only when they</span></p> <p><span id="s378">15:31:44 were taken by Eichmann(?)</span> <span id="s379">.</span> <span id="s380">They didn't go before.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Jacoby: I think that there was a terrible ignorance and denial on the part of the Jews.</span> <span id="s382">It is incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s383">I don't know what we could have done because even those who tries to escape couldn't get visas.</span> <span id="s384">We couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s385">We didn't have many</span></p> <p><span id="s386">15:32:12 friends.</span> <span id="s387">We couldn't really hide, but I'm sure we could have done more than what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Engel: But if you went somewhere, you had to eat.</span> <span id="s389">Nobody would serve you anything to eat any where.</span> <span id="s390">This was the main reason why people didn't go.</span> <span id="s391">You didn't have anything to look forward to.</span> <span id="s392">You had children and you had to eat, you had to sleep somewhere.</span> <span id="s393">Where</span></p> <p><span id="s394">can you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">15:32:43 Interviewer: Was there already much hunger in 1940, '41,</span></p> <p><span id="s396">'42?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Jacoby: Rations, yes.</span> <span id="s398">I don't know if there was hunger.</span> <span id="s399">I remember we couldn't get flour or oil or we had to go somewhere to pick up</span></p> <p><span id="s400">these things even</span></p> <p><span id="s401">15:33:05 potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Engel: But you weren't starving.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Jacoby: It wasn't starving.</span> <span id="s404">It wasn't like in the ghetto or</span></p> <p><span id="s405">anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Engel: Until 1944.</span> <span id="s407">In 1944 when Hitler came in, you couldn't buy anything.</span> <span id="s408">We gave away all our clothes.</span> <span id="s409">In the night, a peasant woman came and brought the chicken and we would give her what we</span></p> <p><span id="s410">had.</span> <span id="s411">In 1944</span></p> <p><span id="s412">15:33:33 after Hitler came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Interviewer: Was that then a closed ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Engel: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Jacoby: See, everything that happened in the other countries that took years in terms of the ghetto and the deportation...</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Engel: This took six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">15:33:52 Jacoby: The whole thing went very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Engel: Six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Jacoby: As a matter of fact, that's the tragedy of the Hungarian</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Engel: Half a million Jews they took in six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Jacoby: But the Hungarian Jews could have probably been saved already because Hitler was losing the war.</span> <span id="s423">He was willing to negotiate and had they bombed the</span></p> <p><span id="s424">15:34:15 railroads, they could have been saved.</span> <span id="s425">As Elie Wiesel said, 100 people a day were killed at that time.</span> <span id="s426">So that is a real</span></p> <p><span id="s427">tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Interviewer: But Hitler had sent Eichmann in?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">15:34:36 Jacoby: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Interviewer: It's very deliberate.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Jacoby: He was the one who was in charge of the deportation of the</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Out here were some Hungarian leaders who were able to buy themselves out and escape.</span> <span id="s434">Of course, there was a lot of turmoil about this among the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">15:35:20 Interviewer: Some sense of betrayal.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Jacoby: Yes.</span> <span id="s437">Also after March 19th when the Germans physically marched in...see until then I remember the debates.</span> <span id="s438">'there not going to come in.</span> <span id="s439">They're not going to come into Hungary.</span> <span id="s440">We are cooperating.</span> <span id="s441">We are good Nazis.</span> <span id="s442">That's what they said.</span> <span id="s443">"Hungarians are good Nazis.</span> <span id="s444">They're not going to have Germany occupy the country.</span> <span id="s445">So we believed them.</span> <span id="s446">Although we're going to have a hard life or we are discriminated against or we are beaten.</span> <span id="s447">My brother was beaten most every day because</span></p> <p><span id="s448">15:36:00 he had to go to something like a youth group where they were taken out and given military training, but after each training, they were beaten.</span> <span id="s449">That's how they were sent home.</span> <span id="s450">My uncles were in these forced labor camps attached to military camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">But all these things we were kind of coping with.</span> <span id="s452">We were still in our home.</span> <span id="s453">No Germans were present until March 19th.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Engel: You know who?</span> <span id="s455">Because in the government, there were still ministers who didn't like the Jews, but they were m___.</span> <span id="s456">They didn't</span></p> <p><span id="s457">want to deport</span></p> <p><span id="s458">15:36:49 the Jews from Hungary.</span> <span id="s459">Until we had a minister named Kar(?)</span> <span id="s460">and they killed him.</span> <span id="s461">After him came another one and they gave up to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Interviewer: So until this time, the family was still intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">15:37:17 Jacoby: Yes.</span> <span id="s464">Except my uncles were taken into forced labor camps.</span> <span id="s465">On March 19th when the Germans marched in, my brother who was at that time 17 or 18 went to a football game in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">He loved football.</span> <span id="s467">On his way back on a train ride, he was caught</span></p> <p><span id="s468">in a raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">15:37:48 That was the very day when they marched in.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Engel: They caught all the Jews on the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Jacoby: They arrested him and he didn't come home.</span> <span id="s472">So we didn't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s473">He disappeared at that time.</span> <span id="s474">We tried to figure out what happened.</span> <span id="s475">They said that they were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">They were here, they were there.</span> <span id="s477">Later we heard that they were taken to Auschwitz, but we didn't hear that until after the war</span></p> <p><span id="s478">15:38:19 Engel: No.</span> <span id="s479">When we arrived at Auschwitz and he gave us the number, he said I gave your brother a number a few days ago, but they sent him away already someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Interviewer: You never saw him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Engel: No, he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Jacoby: Then my father was taken to a forced labor camp.</span> <span id="s483">He left a little before Shavor(?)</span> <span id="s484">.</span> <span id="s485">I remember 15:38: seeing him.</span> <span id="s486">My father was very gentle and not a real hero, macho type.</span> <span id="s487">I was very worried about him.</span> <span id="s488">I remember his skin was always so white.</span> <span id="s489">I knew at that time that he couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s490">He just wasn't physically strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Engel: Physically strong, he was, but he just wasn't strong in feelings.</span> <span id="s492">He was always scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">15:39:25 Jacoby: He was also saying that people started to convert.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">One after the other.</span> <span id="s495">They thought they could save themselves.</span> <span id="s496">My father said,"People without any inner strength" He couldn't understand how they could give up their religion.</span> <span id="s497">But as I said, when he packed this bag on his</span></p> <p><span id="s498">15:39:50 back and said goodbye, I had the feeling that I would not see him again.</span> <span id="s499">He didn't look like a man who could survive.</span> <span id="s500">My younger brother, Moshe, went to Edder.ng(?)</span> <span id="s501">where my grandparents were at the time.</span> <span id="s502">We thought he would be safer there.</span> <span id="s503">And they took him from there.</span> <span id="s504">He didn't survive.</span> <span id="s505">He died of typhus just a week</span></p> <p><span id="s506">before the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Interviewer: What about your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">15:40:31 Jacoby: After the Germans came in, they made a Ghetto out of our street and a few more streets so that all the Jews who lived in Mishkolz(?)</span> <span id="s509">, we were about 10,000 maybe more, all came to live in that confined areas.</span> <span id="s510">We had several families living with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">During that time, I was allowed to go out to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">They said, who can go to work can go to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Engel: We knew already that they would take us to work somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">To Poland they told us.</span> <span id="s515">But who has work at home, they would leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">So she went to</span></p> <p><span id="s517">15:41:26 a farmer to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Jacoby: And I was able to get some food through the farmer.</span> <span id="s519">In June at this time, there were bombings probably by the Russians.</span> <span id="s520">We spent a lot of time in the basement where we had a shelter.</span> <span id="s521">I remember that so much happened there that had nothing to do with the war and had to do with</span></p> <p><span id="s522">15:42:07 my age.</span> <span id="s523">I remember that was the first time I met a young man that I liked.</span> <span id="s524">I remember feeling wonderfully happy down in the shelter.</span> <span id="s525">And excited.</span> <span id="s526">And waiting to see him in the shelter.</span> <span id="s527">That was my big adventure.</span> <span id="s528">Another thing that is so incongruent as I think back is that the family who moved in with us had more money than we did.</span> <span id="s529">By then we had very little</span></p> <p><span id="s530">15:42:39 because our business had been closed about a year already.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">These people moved in and brought butter.</span> <span id="s532">They gave bread and butter to their little kids and I was dying to get a piece of bread with butter, but I was ashamed to ask for it.</span> <span id="s533">So I never did.</span> <span id="s534">I remember that I could see and smell the butter, but I couldn't ask for it.</span> <span id="s535">It was too hard.</span> <span id="s536">Then after a few weeks, they told us that</span></p> <p><span id="s537">we</span></p> <p><span id="s538">15:43:13 should pack our stuff together.</span> <span id="s539">Whatever we could carry on our backs.</span> <span id="s540">We would be transported to another area outside the city which was the brick factory.</span> <span id="s541">There was no factory there.</span> <span id="s542">There were shelters for the bricks with roofs, but nothing on the floor</span></p> <p><span id="s543">15:43:36 So they told us to pack whatever we can take.</span> <span id="s544">Of course, everybody packed whatever we thought was the most important things in our lives.</span> <span id="s545">I don't know what you packed.</span> <span id="s546">I packed my diary, my pictures, my notebook.</span> <span id="s547">Everything I thought I couldn't do without.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">It had nothing to do with survival in a physical sense.</span> <span id="s549">I guess that I just wanted to survive in a psychological.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">15:44:02 Engel: We could take anything because they knew that they would take it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Jacoby: So then we went to this brick factory and that's where the reality of the situation really hit me.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">As I said earlier, I was thinking that it was even fun for me.</span> <span id="s553">I enjoyed the fact that we were together with so many people.</span> <span id="s554">I enjoyed the social aspects of it.</span> <span id="s555">My friends were all near.</span> <span id="s556">So it</span></p> <p><span id="s557">was</span></p> <p><span id="s558">15:45:25 very exciting for me.</span> <span id="s559">I couldn't feel the pain or the worry about things.</span> <span id="s560">Then in the brick factory, they told us that this is where __ staying.</span> <span id="s561">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s562">Nothing on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">There was some straw and I remember that we wanted to lay on the straw.</span> <span id="s564">Then, I wanted to go to the bathroom and they told us that there were no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s565">I couldn't</span></p> <p><span id="s566">15:46:00 understand how they could bring us to a place with no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s567">I remember that the men started to dig trenches to make latrines.</span> <span id="s568">It was an open latrine.</span> <span id="s569">It was just a little bit away from where the shelters were.</span> <span id="s570">They said,"That's where you go" And I wouldn't go.</span> <span id="s571">So I remember that for three days, I</span></p> <p><span id="s572">15:46:35 didn't go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s573">That was probably the beginning of the humiliation that I just couldn't get adjusted to.</span> <span id="s574">Then as soon as we settled down and set up a community kitchen, the transports suddenly started to strive from the outskirts of the city.</span> <span id="s575">Every day, we went up and watched who was coming.</span> <span id="s576">We were</span></p> <p><span id="s577">15:47:04 separated [from them].</span> <span id="s578">We were fenced in.</span> <span id="s579">One day, I saw my grandfather and grandmother.</span> <span id="s580">This grandfather that was held in awe by everybody, I suddenly saw being thrown out of the wagon.</span> <span id="s581">He was a beautiful man.</span> <span id="s582">Big white beard and very gentile looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">There was nobody to help him.</span> <span id="s584">I</span></p> <p><span id="s585">15:47:39 jumped over the fence and I put him on my shoulders and</span></p> <p><span id="s586">carried him down.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Interviewer: He had a stroke many years before?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Jacoby: Yes.</span> <span id="s589">He wasn't quite conscious.</span> <span id="s590">I couldn't understand how they could do that to him.</span> <span id="s591">I carried him down and I laid him down on the straw.</span> <span id="s592">He started asking me where he was.</span> <span id="s593">I started</span></p> <p><span id="s594">15:48:02 giving him this story that we are going to Palestine.</span> <span id="s595">That we are on the boat and the Messiah(?)</span> <span id="s596">had come.</span> <span id="s597">I remember deciding that I had to take care of him.</span> <span id="s598">There was no accommodation for sick or old people.</span> <span id="s599">Finally, we took him to one of the shelters where a hospital was set up.</span> <span id="s600">There were all these dying people there.</span> <span id="s601">All these helpless, dying people.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">15:48:40 I organized my friends and we decided to take care of them.</span> <span id="s603">I remember how I had to overcome my repulsion to clean up the soil of these old people.</span> <span id="s604">And to feed them.</span> <span id="s605">I remember feeling that if anything, this is the best thing I can do in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">15:49:15 It didn't last very long.</span> <span id="s607">We were there about ten days.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Everybody was brought there.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">My whole family who was alive or was still around, they all arrived there.</span> <span id="s610">So we all got together.</span> <span id="s611">Mostly kids and aunts.</span> <span id="s612">All of the uncles were taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">15:49:32 Some of my impressions of that place were that the Hungarian soldiers were different looking than the regular policemen.</span> <span id="s614">They wore a fester in their hats.</span> <span id="s615">They were called gender(?)</span> <span id="s616">.</span> <span id="s617">They had bayonets.</span> <span id="s618">That was a change.</span> <span id="s619">We still didn't have any Germans around.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">15:50:05 I remember somebody got a postcard from Auschwitz to the brick factory.</span> <span id="s621">It said,"We arrived.</span> <span id="s622">We are fine.</span> <span id="s623">Loved somebody from our town.</span> <span id="s624">So we started to weave these dreams again.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">15:50:27 Always weaving dreams about how good its going to be once we are taken away from this awful place.</span> <span id="s626">Were going to go somewhere.</span> <span id="s627">They're going to care for the old people.</span> <span id="s628">Were going to be working.</span> <span id="s629">We're going to have food.</span> <span id="s630">All this confusion is going</span></p> <p><span id="s631">to end</span></p> <p><span id="s632">15:50:44 and were going to be okay.</span> <span id="s633">We kept saying that to ourselves.</span> <span id="s634">So, one day they told us to pack everything we</span></p> <p><span id="s635">15:51:55 can carry on our backs.</span> <span id="s636">We went up again on this little hill and were put into wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Engel: Every day, they took transports from the different shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Everyday, we ran from our shelter to another one because we heard that the Americans already were in France.</span> <span id="s639">It was June 6th.</span> <span id="s640">Every</span></p> <p><span id="s641">day</span></p> <p><span id="s642">15:52:41 counted.</span> <span id="s643">Monday the deportation started so Monday you went to one shelter and Tuesday you went to another shelter.</span> <span id="s644">So finally they took us up.</span> <span id="s645">There were about 20,000 Jews and two Germans.</span> <span id="s646">They had whips and were yelling,"Run, run, fast, fast."</span> <span id="s647">They put us in the cars.</span> <span id="s648">There were 80 inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Interviewer: Any men left?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Jacoby: There were some.</span> <span id="s651">Some of the older men were there.</span> <span id="s652">Those that were not taken to forced labor camps.</span> <span id="s653">The kids under 15 were there too.</span> <span id="s654">So we were all pressed into this wagon.</span> <span id="s655">That's</span></p> <p><span id="s656">15:53:50 when I discovered my neighbor who I didn't know was Jewish</span></p> <p><span id="s657">sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Engel: My father got sick in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s659">There was a wagon and they put all the sick people there.</span> <span id="s660">I didn't want my father to be alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">He couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s662">He couldn't drink.</span> <span id="s663">So I went and got Lila(?)</span> <span id="s664">and they took her as a nurse for the sick people.</span> <span id="s665">So my</span></p> <p><span id="s666">15:55:40 mother and father weren't there.</span> <span id="s667">Father was alive when we arrived.</span> <span id="s668">My mother got out of the wagon.</span> <span id="s669">I ran to where they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">She was standing there in a nice dress and I said, "Come down and well go together.</span> <span id="s671">But she was smarter</span></p> <p><span id="s672">15:56:23 than I was.</span> <span id="s673">She said, "No, I see that they are people.</span> <span id="s674">You know that what happens to me and your father will happen.</span> <span id="s675">Go and take care of your daughter and sister and leave me here.</span> <span id="s676">So I ran back to them.</span> <span id="s677">We were standing there five in a line.</span> <span id="s678">I had a cousin there with two little children.</span> <span id="s679">I had the little girl in my hands,</span></p> <p><span id="s680">15:57:21 There was Mengele.</span> <span id="s681">He was standing there and he was counting people.</span> <span id="s682">He said,"Women give the children to the older and go on this side to work."</span> <span id="s683">So I felt that I was young.</span> <span id="s684">I was 40</span></p> <p><span id="s685">years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">15:57:52 So I took this baby and I gave it to the mother.</span> <span id="s687">She cried,"Don't leave me alone.</span> <span id="s688">I can't take care of two children."</span> <span id="s689">But I gave it to her.</span> <span id="s690">There came Mengele.</span> <span id="s691">He said,"Where do you want to go?"</span> <span id="s692">I told him on this side.</span> <span id="s693">"Are you strong?</span> <span id="s694">Can you work?"</span> <span id="s695">I can work more than all</span></p> <p><span id="s696">15:58:27 these young people who you sent there.</span> <span id="s697">So I went there and the other four went on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Jacoby: When we arrived at Auschwitz, one of the things that I remember that I was hoping for was some order because of the very</span></p> <p><span id="s699">great confusion that</span></p> <p><span id="s700">15:58:50 was before this in the ghetto and in the brick factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">There was order when we got out.</span> <span id="s702">Because I saw people lined up there and I felt some relief.</span> <span id="s703">I heard the music and saw the beautiful flowers.</span> <span id="s704">I was hoping that something would happen.</span> <span id="s705">I saw in the far background so many people</span></p> <p><span id="s706">15:59:21 wearing prison garb.</span> <span id="s707">They were waving to us and signaling to us.</span> <span id="s708">I figured that they must be the mentally ill.</span> <span id="s709">I didn't understand what they were trying to tell us.</span> <span id="s710">The message was of course to try to get on that side and not on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Interviewer: Introduce yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Engel:My name is Malvina(?)</span> <span id="s713">Engel(?)</span> <span id="s714">.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Jacoby: My name is Erika Jacoby.</span> <span id="s716">I was born in Miskolz(?)</span> <span id="s717">Hungary</span></p> <p><span id="s718">in 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">16:01:32 Engel: I was born in 1901.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Jacoby: I wanted to come back a little to what we said earlier when my mother said that there were only two soldiers when we were put in the transports.</span> <span id="s721">What that really meant is there were only two German soldiers, but the Hungarians cooperated and collaborated so much.</span> <span id="s722">They were the ones who actually carried out the orders.</span> <span id="s723">So that didn't mean that they were only guarded by only two soldiers</span></p> <p><span id="s724">16:02:11 Which obviously would have made it very easy for some of</span></p> <p><span id="s725">us to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Interviewer: What happened then when the transport got you to Auschwitz and you were divided up?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">16:02:29 Jacoby: When we were divided up, my mother finally found me and my aunt.</span> <span id="s728">We were in the same barracks.</span> <span id="s729">We were shaven and given one piece of clothing.</span> <span id="s730">No underwear, no shoes.</span> <span id="s731">I remember laughing.</span> <span id="s732">We looked at each other and laughed because we</span></p> <p><span id="s733">16:02:55 looked so horrible.</span> <span id="s734">We didn't recognize each other.</span> <span id="s735">The whole process of getting undressed in front of the Germans and being exposed there brought back this feeling of senselessness.</span> <span id="s736">I wanted order.</span> <span id="s737">I guess what I wanted was to make some sense out of this.</span> <span id="s738">It was so foreign.</span> <span id="s739">We were brought up in a very modest,</span></p> <p><span id="s740">religious</span></p> <p><span id="s741">16:00:00 Jewish home where not only did we not get undressed in front of other people, but we didn't uncover parts of our bodies ever.</span> <span id="s742">To follow the order to get undressed, we looked at each other</span></p> <p><span id="s743">and we</span></p> <p><span id="s744">16:04:20 didn't believe that we really had to do that.</span> <span id="s745">That this wasn't an order we could say no to.</span> <span id="s746">So when we arrived at the barracks, I was looking for friends to see if some of my classmates were there.</span> <span id="s747">One of my classmates who was my very best friend happened to be with me.</span> <span id="s748">We were given food to eat in this pot.</span> <span id="s749">They told us that ten of us will drink from this pot.</span> <span id="s750">I</span></p> <p><span id="s751">16:05:11 wanted to drink, but I just couldn't and my friend said that she wasn't even going to try.</span> <span id="s752">I remember that I begged her,"Please do because you're not going to live" And she said,"No.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">I just can't.</span> <span id="s754">I can't drink that."</span> <span id="s755">The third day, I finally began to drink the soup.</span> <span id="s756">So I could overcome my repulsion with that, but she couldn't.</span> <span id="s757">And she didn't live.</span> <span id="s758">She died a few weeks later of starvation.</span> <span id="s759">She couldn't even drink</span></p> <p><span id="s760">16:05:50 that soup.</span> <span id="s761">The confusion and the senselessness were the most overwhelming feelings I had.</span> <span id="s762">____ We saw all these fences, watchtowers and Germans, but we didn't understand.</span> <span id="s763">I was sure that my grandparents were taken to a hospital and that we were going to see them on Sunday.</span> <span id="s764">I was very sure</span></p> <p><span id="s765">16:06:37 of that.</span> <span id="s766">I don't think that I paid any notice to the chimneys.</span> <span id="s767">After ten days, they told us that if they could take us to a place to work then we would be safe.</span> <span id="s768">So we knew that we had to get away from there.</span> <span id="s769">So after ten days when they asked for a</span></p> <p><span id="s770">transport, we</span></p> <p><span id="s771">16:07:13 wanted to go.</span> <span id="s772">They were taking transports one after the other to working camps.</span> <span id="s773">So we were taken to Krskow which is not really the city, but the outskirts which are called Prashov(?)</span> <span id="s774">.</span> <span id="s775">It</span></p> <p><span id="s776">wasn't too</span></p> <p><span id="s777">16:07:36 far from Auschwitz, but we traveled for a day and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">It was a completely different scene.</span> <span id="s779">The work was mining rocks out of the mountain.</span> <span id="s780">It was terribly hard.</span> <span id="s781">It was so exhausting and impossibly difficult that many of us just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s782">Many</span></p> <p><span id="s783">16:08:06 of us perished there.</span> <span id="s784">We met older inmates there who had hair.</span> <span id="s785">That was very encouraging for me.</span> <span id="s786">We asked them why they still had hair.</span> <span id="s787">Then they started telling us these horrible stories.</span> <span id="s788">This young man told us that he had</span></p> <p><span id="s789">16:08:52 to kill his whole family before we arrived there to make room for us.</span> <span id="s790">They had to exterminate all the children and older people to make room for the workers.</span> <span id="s791">One day, we were able to get to the trash and find some horse bones that they threw out from the kitchen.</span> <span id="s792">This was the middle of summer and very hot so the horse bones were covered with flies.</span> <span id="s793">I remember that we got to these bones and we started</span></p> <p><span id="s794">16:09:36 chewing them.</span> <span id="s795">We were feeling like we found paradise.</span> <span id="s796">We also had a lot of bedbugs which contributed to our suffering.</span> <span id="s797">They got on these sores that we had developed from lack of nutrition and</span></p> <p><span id="s798">started eating.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">16:09:56 point that we actually had little bedbugs nestled inside our cheeks.</span> <span id="s800">There were some things that were better such as we had beds and some things were of course already worse.</span> <span id="s801">We heard the Russians coming closer and closer.</span> <span id="s802">This was 1944 in the summer.</span> <span id="s803">We</span></p> <p><span id="s804">heard already</span></p> <p><span id="s805">16:10:43 about the Normandy invasion.</span> <span id="s806">We were hoping that with the Russians advancing, we would be liberated.</span> <span id="s807">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s808">As soon as the Russians got close enough, the Germans loaded us into the cattle cars and transported us back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s809">There was a big difference because this time, we already knew what Auschwitz was.</span> <span id="s810">We wizened up.</span> <span id="s811">We knew what happens when you get there and you're selected out.</span> <span id="s812">We knew what the chimneys were.</span> <span id="s813">I was very worried about my mother.</span> <span id="s814">During the summer, she was the one who was</span></p> <p><span id="s815">still stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">16:00:20 We used to carry big rocks and hand them over to each other.</span> <span id="s817">She used to want to skip me and give over the bag to the next one.</span> <span id="s818">Of course, she suffered a permanent back injury from that.</span> <span id="s819">Toward the end of our stay in Prashov(?)</span> <span id="s820">, she</span></p> <p><span id="s821">16:00:50 developed a fever everyday.</span> <span id="s822">Her legs ware covered with sores which we wrapped with paper so that the flies wouldn't eat at it.</span> <span id="s823">When we arrived at Auschwitz, suddenly I saw all my cousins who looked in pretty bad shape being sent to the wrong side.</span> <span id="s824">I saw my mother standing there looking pretty hellacious.</span> <span id="s825">We decided that we</span></p> <p><span id="s826">16:12:20 were going to stay together.</span> <span id="s827">So we sent my aunt first because she was the strongest and we knew that she would pass.</span> <span id="s828">Then we decided to send my mother second.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">As I saw her pass in front of Dr. Mengele, I suddenly yanked the wrapping off her legs because I saw that anybody wearing wrapping</span></p> <p><span id="s830">was</span></p> <p><span id="s831">16:12:51 sent to the other side.</span> <span id="s832">I gave her a clap on her back.</span> <span id="s833">She straightened up and passed without any hitch.</span> <span id="s834">Then we were taken to the baths.</span> <span id="s835">Of course, every time we were taken to the baths, we were never sure whether that was really the baths or the gas</span></p> <p><span id="s836">chamber</span></p> <p><span id="s837">16:13:20 We were shaven again.</span> <span id="s838">That was a real loss because already we had a little bit of hair.</span> <span id="s839">It seems ridiculous that that was important, but it was.</span> <span id="s840">This time we also got numbers tattooed on our arm.</span> <span id="s841">We were taken to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s842">On our way to the barracks, I found two treasures.</span> <span id="s843">I found a little spreading knife and little</span></p> <p><span id="s844">silver necklace.</span> <span id="s845">Somebody</span></p> <p><span id="s846">16:16:38 must have lost it.</span> <span id="s847">I was delighted.</span> <span id="s848">I put on the necklace and I felt like nobody could do anything to me.</span> <span id="s849">We arrived at the barracks.</span> <span id="s850">We had beds here.</span> <span id="s851">Ten of us were on one of these platforms so that every time somebody had to turn, everybody had to turn.</span> <span id="s852">We had no blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">16:17:10 My mother was quite ill.</span> <span id="s854">I used to cover her with my body every night because she was shivering so.</span> <span id="s855">They thought that she had malaria.</span> <span id="s856">I wouldn't let her go to the infirmary because I knew that if she went there, she would never come back.</span> <span id="s857">One day we stood in line for food.</span> <span id="s858">This blockhauphster(?)</span> <span id="s859">who was a very beautiful Jewish young woman saw me standing in line with this necklace.</span> <span id="s860">She tore it off my neck.</span> <span id="s861">Of course, I</span></p> <p><span id="s862">16:17:59 started to cry.</span> <span id="s863">My mother became furious.</span> <span id="s864">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Engel: I told her,"How can you be so cruel?</span> <span id="s866">You have children too.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">She said,"What shall I do for you?"</span> <span id="s868">Give her a half a spoonful more</span></p> <p><span id="s869">soup every day."</span> <span id="s870">Jacoby: So from then on, I got a half a spoonful more food which probably helped me survive.</span> <span id="s871">They took us to the bath once a week because the Germans were very meticulously clean.</span> <span id="s872">They were</span></p> <p><span id="s873">16:20:12 afraid that we would get ill and then they would get ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">They disinfected us once a week.</span> <span id="s875">As we were walking to the baths one day, we saw my uncle next to the road working with the __.</span> <span id="s876">My uncle who has taken away the first</span></p> <p><span id="s877">16:20:46 day the Germans arrived in Hungary.</span> <span id="s878">He saw us and he started to scream.</span> <span id="s879">We couldn't get to him of course.</span> <span id="s880">On our way back, he managed to get through the fence.</span> <span id="s881">He gave us bread and a sweater for me.</span> <span id="s882">He gave us a kiss and a hug.</span> <span id="s883">We never saw him again.</span> <span id="s884">He was killed I think when they blew up one of the crematorium.</span> <span id="s885">We were taken to another working camp after six weeks.</span> <span id="s886">This was probably the best conditions that we had in the camps.</span> <span id="s887">During this time, my mother</span></p> <p><span id="s888">16:22:13 was the sickest.</span> <span id="s889">She was so sick that sometimes I had to hide her in the trash in the mornings because she couldn't go out to work.</span> <span id="s890">I would dig her at night.</span> <span id="s891">From that camp, we went to another camp.</span> <span id="s892">We were taken away in the middle of December.</span> <span id="s893">In this</span></p> <p><span id="s894">16:23:17 camp, we dug trenches and also pipes.</span> <span id="s895">Then we were taken to an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s896">At first, we were housed about six m__ away and every morning we had to walk at work in the snow to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">My mother became a forbef(~) there.</span> <span id="s898">That meant that she was a very good worker.</span> <span id="s899">She was</span></p> <p><span id="s900">16:23:50 supervising 24 of us.</span> <span id="s901">I was several times able to survive by sheer luck.</span> <span id="s902">One of the things I did was I made little charms from leftover metal.</span> <span id="s903">I sold them for bread.</span> <span id="s904">I even sold some to the German soldiers who sent it home to their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">16:24:42 I don't know if by then we had any different understanding of what was happening, but I think we still believed that although everybody else's family was destroyed, not ours.</span> <span id="s906">We had a whole system for survival.</span> <span id="s907">For example, one of the things that helped me</span></p> <p><span id="s908">was that</span></p> <p><span id="s909">16:25:12 every night, I took off that one piece of clothes and I folded it just the way I would at home.</span> <span id="s910">I tried to simulate some kind of balance in my life.</span> <span id="s911">The other thing I remember is that we took off a little piece of our bread and we put it away for shabath?</span> <span id="s912">So you saved that for Shabat?</span> <span id="s913">We always had too pieces of bread.</span> <span id="s914">Standing in line, we would sometimes pray</span></p> <p><span id="s915">16:25:46 loudly.</span> <span id="s916">Whoever knew the prayers would lead us.</span> <span id="s917">We were liberated on May 8,1945 by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s918">We stayed about a month in the ares.</span> <span id="s919">My mother went to work for the Germans to get some food for us.</span> <span id="s920">She went back to work for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">16:26:13 After about a month, we were able to get a wagon with a horse.</span> <span id="s922">We hid inside the wagon that took us to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s923">We started our journey back to Hungary because we wanted to see who was alive from our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Interviewer: Who was left?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Jacoby: Every day, everybody who was alive went to the railroad station waiting for others to see who was</span></p> <p><span id="s926">16:27:04 coming.</span> <span id="s927">So I arrived there and my brother was there.We lived for about two years in Hungary ____ two years in Cuba.</span> <span id="s928">I couldn't get into the United</span></p> <p><span id="s929">16:27:28 States and other way so I came in illegally.</span> <span id="s930">I was flown in by a private pilot.</span> <span id="s931">That's how I finally got to the United States where I finally married Emily to whom I was engaged to before we left Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">My mother and brother ware able to get from Cuba to Mexico where my uncles were.</span> <span id="s933">Eventually, my mother came over to the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Engel: That's the nice part of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">16:28:37 Interviewer: Thank you for telling us.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">.</span> <span id="s937">END.</span></p></body></html>
