League of Minnesota and the Dakotas HOLOCAUST ORAL HISTORY TAPING PROJECT</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: This is David Zarkin on June 13, 1984, at the University of Wisconsin at River Falls in the house of Professor Richard Darr.</span> <span id="s5">We are doing an interview for the JCRC, ADL Holocaust Oral History Project.</span> <span id="s6">Professor Darr, can you tell me what your position was and what unit you were with in the Army, and dates when you were inducted into the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I was a sergeant and infantry squad leader in the 65th Infantry Division, 260th Infantry Regiment.</span> <span id="s8">I went into the service September the 2nd of 1942, and was discharged April the 4th of 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Q: Tell me about your active tour of duty and where you were stationed and what your duties were, your assignments when you left for overseas.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: We left for overseas in December of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: We landed at Le Havre, France.</span> <span id="s13">And then we went from France to Holland, Luxembourg, Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s14">The hostilities ended for me in Linz, Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: And what kind of job did you have in the Army then?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was squad leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: So tell me about what you saw and what you did then?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Our unit began combat south of Metz, during the assault on Metz.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Where is Metz?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Roughly, the border between France and Germany.</span> <span id="s21">And then for 16 days we were in the basement of a house in Franzlautern, which was a bridgehead across the Saar River from Kaiserslautern.</span> <span id="s22">And then after the 16 days in the basement of this house, our division broke through the Siegfried (Line) and into Germany.</span> <span id="s23">Things were moving very fast by then.</span> <span id="s24">The Siegfried was the German defense line, which they had taken years to build – the bunkers and emplacements – that’s why we were held up for 16 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What month and what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: This was March, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: So then after you broke through the German defenses, then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, we continued east.</span> <span id="s29">We didn’t always know where that road leads.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So you were paralleling a road?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I don’t recall the exact thing we were doing, except engaging in spasmodic contact with the enemy.</span> <span id="s32">By that time, the war was beginning to draw to an end.</span> <span id="s33">And a little later on, a month or so, prisoners were coming in by the droves!</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: German prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Yeah, Germans surrendering.</span> <span id="s36">At the concentration camp itself the German troops had left by the time we physically arrived at the camp.</span> <span id="s37">There was no combat at the camp itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: And you don’t know the name of the camp that you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: It’s more likely to have been Ohrdruff and Buchenwald, because Mauthausen is in the corner where Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany meet.</span> <span id="s40">My particular unit, my squad and the 1st Battalion of the 260th Infantry Regiment were moving towards the Linz air base.</span> <span id="s41">That was south of Linz, whereas Mauthausen is northwest of Linz.</span> <span id="s42">Therefore, that’s why I think it was the other two, because I know that I participated in over-running two of the camps.</span> <span id="s43">Our division history says we participated in three.</span> <span id="s44">Therefore these photos came from one of those two.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Who took the photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Someone else in the organization.</span> <span id="s47">I don’t even recall his name anymore.</span> <span id="s48">We used to make fun of him because he was carrying a camera, and we thought that ( there were) more important things to do than carrying cameras.</span> <span id="s49">When he was to get the films developed, he asked me if I wanted a set of them and I told him I did.</span> <span id="s50">That’s how I came into possession of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: So what did you see when you got to the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Well, I myself, and I think it would be a general rule, had no concept that such places existed!</span> <span id="s53">The prisoners knew that we were coming, that is they knew that a military force was defeating the Germans and approaching the camp.</span> <span id="s54">They didn’t know it was us, particularly, but they knew it was American troops, or maybe they thought it was British.</span> <span id="s55">Their joy was overwhelming.</span> <span id="s56">They were hanging on the barbed wire fences, and to the degree that they had any energy, were cheering and just overjoyed to see us!</span> <span id="s57">For us – I’m speaking for myself, but I think this is verified in many sources – it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s58">It was an unbelievable, shocking, sight.</span> <span id="s59">Because those who were living looked like living cadavers!</span> <span id="s60">The scenes were just horrible!</span> <span id="s61">Really bad!</span> <span id="s62">And the open pit burial, and (sigh) people stacked, literally stacked like cordwood.</span> <span id="s63">And the ones who were – using the term loosely -- the ones who were living were living in rags.</span> <span id="s64">And then at one of the camps, I can’t tell you which, we spent the night sleeping on the ground, outside of the camp, right outside the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s65">I was sleeping on the ground.</span> <span id="s66">We all were, because we were told not to mingle in the camp.</span> <span id="s67">There was fear of typhoid – the spreading of typhoid.</span> <span id="s68">But the prisoners, of course, were just so overjoyed, and they would hang on the fence and talk to us.</span> <span id="s69">Well, only a survivor could tell you what their feelings must have been after all that time.</span> <span id="s70">Many of them had waited a long, long time to feel that, in a sense, they were no longer ignored.</span> <span id="s71">Somebody had finally recognized their case.</span> <span id="s72">Maybe you oughta cut it off, ‘cause I’ll tell you something that maybe you shouldn’t…(gap in tape)</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Well, let’s talk about the physical description of the camps.</span> <span id="s74">What you can remember about the buildings, how they were laid out and that kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Well, the buildings were laid out approximately like some military bases in the U.S.</span> <span id="s76">The ones that I recall were one-story, wooden structures, narrow, but quite long.</span> <span id="s77">I wouldn’t want to guess the length of ‘em.</span> <span id="s78">They were longer than they were wide.</span> <span id="s79">I recall the ones that we entered, although we weren’t really supposed to enter them, I’m guessing now, but the bunks, rather than being, say, double, two bunks like normal, were at least maybe five bunks, and could’ve been six bunks high.</span> <span id="s80">And in some of them, of course, the people couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s81">They were too weak, I guess.</span> <span id="s82">And they would be just crowded into these bunks!</span> <span id="s83">And the bunks had virtually no headroom, because if you have ‘em five high, and an eight foot or ten foot high ceiling, you couldn’t sit up in the bunks!</span> <span id="s84">They were just that crammed together!</span> <span id="s85">And in many, many instances, the people in them were probably physically incapable of getting out, and standing up, and greeting us, or greeting even their fellow prisoners who were able to stand up.</span> <span id="s86">But many of them, when we approached the camp, or I suppose, when they knew we were approaching – from previous nights, maybe the sound of the shelling was getting closer – here they were, clutching both hands, trying to stand up, to greet us.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Well, what else can you remember about the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Well, I don’t think I have any more words than what many other people have said.</span> <span id="s89">There just aren’t that many words, I guess.</span> <span id="s90">It was something so unexpected!</span> <span id="s91">To see people in that condition.</span> <span id="s92">I think most of us – having talked to other guys that were with me – it was just virtually a total shock!</span> <span id="s93">We’d never seen humans who were still living in such bad condition.</span> <span id="s94">I don’t think there are any real words that can truly express the impression it made on me.</span> <span id="s95">And it’s an impression that I’ll never relinquish.</span> <span id="s96">I can’t relinquish it.</span> <span id="s97">It’s just impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Tell me a little bit more about the physical layout.</span> <span id="s99">Were there any railroad tracks there or any trains there?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I don’t recall a train being there, but there were railroad tracks, yes.</span> <span id="s101">Physically it appeared like an American Army prison in the United States!</span> <span id="s102">That is, it had guard towers, and barbed wire fences.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t think we knew at that time, although we’ve learned since, that the barbed wire fences were also electrified.</span> <span id="s104">I don’t recall any of us knowing that – or mentioning it, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Did you get a chance to look at any of the other buildings?</span> <span id="s106">You talked about the barracks, but like where the officers stayed, or the guards, where they lived, or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: The guards – no.</span> <span id="s108">I don’t recall that.</span> <span id="s109">Obviously each camp had them, but any specific individual’s observations were pretty limited!</span> <span id="s110">First, we weren’t supposed to enter the camp!</span> <span id="s111">We did, but in a surreptitious way.</span> <span id="s112">We slept outside the camp, right on the ground, the night after capturing of the camp.</span> <span id="s113">I’m not sure “capturing” is correct; the Germans had fled.</span> <span id="s114">And then we moved on the next morning.</span> <span id="s115">There was some social interaction in the sense that some of us, as individuals, took it upon ourselves, in violation of the regulations, and went in the camp with, say, a certain prisoner whom we might have entered into a conversation with, or maybe two or three prisoners, that we might’ve started talking to, through a buddy-buddy association, momentarily.</span> <span id="s116">So any individual observations were in a sort of restricted sense.</span> <span id="s117">It wasn’t a guided tour!</span> <span id="s118">I would imagine if I’d said, “Hey, can I see the officer’s quarters?’</span> <span id="s119">they would have shown me.</span> <span id="s120">Why would they not have shown me?</span> <span id="s121">But it never occurred to me to ask to see the officer’s quarters, because my relationship was with a particular prisoner – or maybe two or three of his buddies – that were capable of physically moving around fairly well.</span> <span id="s122">Most of them were not capable of moving around much.</span> <span id="s123">They were physically incapable of doing much of anything!</span> <span id="s124">They had no energy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Well, the ones that you were able to talk to, did they tell you about what went on in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Just in a general way.</span> <span id="s127">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s128">Maybe much more occurred at the time – I’m certain it did – than I remember.</span> <span id="s129">I can’t remember any specific charges, except that maybe the prisoner might say that Sergeant Schmidt oughta be killed, or make some statement like that, meaning that the German sergeant Schmidt had mistreated them.</span> <span id="s130">But I don’t recall having a conversation other than in general terms about it.</span> <span id="s131">And of course part of it, remember, was a language barrier.</span> <span id="s132">Some of them could speak fairly good English, and I spoke a little German.</span> <span id="s133">I’d had two years in college in German, but I wouldn’t say that my German was very good.</span> <span id="s134">But by my little bit of crude German, and maybe their little better level of English knowledge, we communicated.</span> <span id="s135">And – I’m not certain that it was the safest thing to do – there was a good deal of gift-giving, particularly of food, to the prisoners.</span> <span id="s136">We didn’t have much, but we had K-rations at that time.</span> <span id="s137">I say in one sense – maybe they knew that they couldn’t eat the food too fast, or too much, because their system wasn’t conditioned to it – so in that sense, maybe we gave them too much food.</span> <span id="s138">This was very simple food.</span> <span id="s139">You know what a K-ration is.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: It’s something common to the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: They came to us in boxes about the size of a Cracker Jack box.</span> <span id="s142">And one was breakfast, one was lunch, and one was dinner.</span> <span id="s143">And for those who couldn’t read, they were in different colors.</span> <span id="s144">I don’t recall the colors now, but breakfast might, for example, be a yellow Cracker Jack box, lunch red, and green supper.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Was it dehydrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: No, it would be like a powdered drink mix, a can of deviled ham, these little cans, you can still buy them in grocery stores, and a package of crackers.</span> <span id="s147">Maybe a chocolate bar.</span> <span id="s148">A five-cigarette-package of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s149">The breakfast one, of course, had canned eggs and powdered coffee, powdered milk.</span> <span id="s150">That sort of thing.</span> <span id="s151">I’m not certain that dehydrated food existed then, did it?</span> <span id="s152">Seems to me that’s probably a post-war phenomenon.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: So did they get sick from this?</span> <span id="s154">Some of the people in the camp/</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Well I imagine that if one had been virtually starved for eight months and then got, say, from 20 troopers, the same number of chocolate bars, if they tried to eat all 20 at once, I’m assuming they’d get sick!</span> <span id="s156">I don’t recall any getting sick, and maybe it happened after we’d left the next morning.</span> <span id="s157">I’m hoping that the person who got the 20 candy bars – this is hypothetical, but I’m certain that some of them did get that many, and cigarettes and everything else – we gave them all we had, you know, which wasn’t much, because K-rations aren’t much – but given the fact that their bodies were not conditioned to eating this kind of food, unless they ate it very slowly, I’m assuming – and remember, I’m no medical specialist – that it would have an adverse effect on them physically.</span> <span id="s158">I would think that a person who’d been living in those conditions would have to re-enter the world of gourmet eating in a rather evolutionary way, rather than in an abrupt way.</span> <span id="s159">But as I say, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s160">But if it is true that they got sick as a result of our generosity, maybe in a way we shouldn’t have opened up our hearts and our – we didn’t have packs, we carried the K-rations in a blanket roll, so they didn’t get many – but for them it would’ve been a lot of food.</span> <span id="s161">For us it was nothing, because we had access to all the food we wanted.</span> <span id="s162">We could always get more.</span> <span id="s163">We gave them all we had!</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: You indicated that you were only at each camp for about a day then, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And you were at a pretty low level – I mean you were not privileged to the kind of follow-up that was done, after the Army left the camp.</span> <span id="s167">Or did you have any idea about…</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Not until some years later.</span> <span id="s169">But this was after hostilities.</span> <span id="s170">I mentioned that I had had two years of college at the time I went into the service.</span> <span id="s171">Then when I was discharged in ’46, I went back and finished.</span> <span id="s172">Got my bachelor’s degree and then returned to military government.</span> <span id="s173">But that was in ’48 that I returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Military government?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s176">At first I was on the three-man economic advisory staff to General Clay, at the top level.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: In Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s179">We had an office in Frankfurt, and one in Berlin.</span> <span id="s180">And then I asked for a transfer to a lower level, because working at that level I might as well have been at the Pentagon.</span> <span id="s181">They weren’t all Americans, obviously, but there were only Americans, French, Russian, and British, and I thought since I was in Germany, that maybe I should know more about the German culture, so I asked for a transfer.</span> <span id="s182">Then I was made Deputy Military Governor of Kreiss Viblingen.</span> <span id="s183">“Kreiss” is the German word for “county”.</span> <span id="s184">Viblingen is right outside Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s185">And then after serving a short time as Deputy Military Governor, I was made the Military Governor of Kreiss Vachnon.</span> <span id="s186">That’s the second county northwest of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s187">Stuttgart, in a sense, was the “state” capitol, and the counties of Wurttemberg-Baden were accountable to the state capitol of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s188">The governor of Wurttemberg-Baden at that time was a former congressman, Charles La Follette from Indiana.</span> <span id="s189">And then I served as military Governor of County Vachnon.</span> <span id="s190">And there was a small Jewish D.P. camp – not a concentration camp – in my county.</span> <span id="s191">Then it was in ’49 that the functions of military government were shifted to the Department of State from, at that time, the War Department.</span> <span id="s192">It changed later to the Department of the Army, and so the personnel would remain the same, but my title, rather than being “Military Governor,” was “Resident Officer.”</span> <span id="s193">See, the State Department had, in ’49, begun to take over the governmental administration from the military.</span> <span id="s194">But even as Military Governor in ’48 we wore civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s195">It could be the specific person might have cherished his military uniforms so much that he continued to wear it – I don’t know of any exceptions, but there might have been – but when I say “we”, other governors were going to the office in what we would wear to the office here: a sport coat, with tie, or a business suit with tie.</span> <span id="s196">The title was “Military Governor” and the Germans recognized it.</span> <span id="s197">One of the reasons for that was it was part of the de-Nazification program.</span> <span id="s198">We felt that it would be psychologically better, in terms of furthering democracy, to wear civilian clothes as part of re-educating the German populace, I guess.</span> <span id="s199">And so although the title was “Military Governor”, and the stereotype in one’s head is wearing a uniform, we appeared just like we would have dressed if we were working in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Well this must have provided you with some new insights and some opportunities, being a Governor and Deputy Governor, after the war.</span> <span id="s201">Would you care to share some of what you learned in those positions?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: The major problem—that is, within the West German economy – that we had was lack of housing, of course.</span> <span id="s203">That occupied more of the time of military governors, I would suppose than any other issue.</span> <span id="s204">Housing, in the first place, was short.</span> <span id="s205">But then there was the continuing influx of people, German citizens, from East Germany and Czechoslovakia, over to West Germany.</span> <span id="s206">It took often a great deal of suasion to get the local German – and my county, Vachnon, was a rural county – it took a good deal of suasion, and sometimes the suasion had to be rather overt, in order to get local village governments to allocate space for their own displaced citizens who had come from the east.</span> <span id="s207">As the German army moved east into a large portion of the Soviet Union and the Ukraine, particularly, German citizens were permitted to move there and the Ukrainians or whomever – or Czechs – were deprived of their land and Germans took over.</span> <span id="s208">And in addition to political people who didn’t want to remain with the East German government, there were a lot of German civilians from that part of Europe, in the upheaval after the war, who were returning, in a sense, to Germany, but now West Germany – the Western Zone – who no longer had a home in that portion, and to find housing for them was extremely difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Well, did you get a chance to learn what became of the people who were in the camps, when you were in the government there?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: No, I had no administrative responsibility for the small Jewish D.P. camp in my county.</span> <span id="s211">However, I had contact with them, in that German authorities were not permitted to try non-Germans for what the Germans may have considered violation of their law.</span> <span id="s212">For example, at my level – that is the county level – for misdemeanors, the governor acted as judge.</span> <span id="s213">I’ll give you an example.</span> <span id="s214">One day two German policemen brought in one of the residents of the Jewish D.P. camp.</span> <span id="s215">They had arrested him for selling black market meat.</span> <span id="s216">We didn’t permit them to be tried in German courts.</span> <span id="s217">So I asked the German policeman something to the effect that, do they raise cattle in the D.P. camp over there?</span> <span id="s218">Obviously they didn’t raise cattle.</span> <span id="s219">Then I asked him, “Well, you will first have to bring me the German farmer that sold the meat to the D.P. camp inmate, in order to prove that he engaged in selling black market meat.”</span> <span id="s220">Because he would have no other source than, obviously, a German farmer.</span> <span id="s221">With that, the German police dropped the case.</span> <span id="s222">At that time, we felt – and there was plenty of proof – that non-Germans – and they may have been German citizens, but they were Jewish – wouldn’t have gotten a fair trial.</span> <span id="s223">And therefore the German police were permitted to arrest and bring to trial German citizens – that is, non-Jewish German citizens, Aryans, so to speak.</span> <span id="s224">The American military government, nor the British, nor the French, nor the Soviets, as far as I know, didn’t interfere with that portion of their legal system.</span> <span id="s225">But when it was a non-German, or a Jew who was German, they were not permitted to try them.</span> <span id="s226">A specific military governor who might have been an attorney, but the military governors only heard misdemeanors, not felonies.</span> <span id="s227">There were trained attorneys at the state level, in this case, Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s228">I’d go over there maybe every two weeks just to check in and see how things are, and talk to the “Chairman” – or whatever the title of the person was.</span> <span id="s229">I didn’t find a lot of propaganda, probably because much of it had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s230">Military government, however, had quite extensive records on former Nazi party members, because we did attempt to not have government in the hands of former party members.</span> <span id="s231">The political process in Germany was more democratic than it was here, in the sense that there, even the Communist party was on the ballot, and we had outlawed them in our own case here.</span> <span id="s232">On the city council of Vachnon, was a Communist party-elected city councilman, which by that time, was impossible in our own democracy.</span> <span id="s233">The party had been outlawed here.</span> <span id="s234">There wasn’t any “Nazi” propaganda, particularly.</span> <span id="s235">And this is only an intuitive feeling, but I felt that former Nazis were certainly “covering” for each other.</span> <span id="s236">That is, they tended to look out for each other, which is understandable.</span> <span id="s237">At that time, to be a Nazi was obviously not in very good repute, and so it was kept quiet, and one didn’t have occasion to hear them on many unguarded moments.</span> <span id="s238">Maybe, I would suppose, that being around the Governor, they would be even more aware of being rather subtle (laughter) about their background.</span> <span id="s239">The elections, by that time, ’48 and ’49, were open in Germany.</span> <span id="s240">Of course they couldn’t have a Nazi party.</span> <span id="s241">As you know, in Germany there’s a multiple party system, much more so than ours.</span> <span id="s242">There are a vast number of political parties there.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: You went to the Nuremberg trials.</span> <span id="s244">What year was that in?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: This must have been in ’49.</span> <span id="s246">A rather close acquaintance was the Military-Governor in Nuremberg, and I just went.</span> <span id="s247">I didn’t go to the trials, I just went to the buildings where the trials were.</span> <span id="s248">I was impressed!</span> <span id="s249">It looked like a high-class American county courthouse.</span> <span id="s250">Marble stairways, a rather vast expense.</span> <span id="s251">But I wouldn’t know anything about the trials.</span> <span id="s252">I would personally visit this friend who was the Governor of Nuremberg, and I was staying at his own house.</span> <span id="s253">He took me to the building in which the trials were held, but then we went to many places in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s254">Since he was the Governor, he had access to a castle and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: What else do you recall from those years when you were in the government there in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Well.</span> <span id="s257">(sigh) You don’t mean in terms of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Well, if there’s anything that relates to that, yeah.</span> <span id="s259">Filling in of your knowledge of what went on in the concentration camps, as a result of your having served in the military government.</span> <span id="s260">Would you have any insight as to what went on in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Oh I think we’ve all gotten greater insight of what went on just in the course of our general readings.</span> <span id="s262">It’s not just any government documents.</span> <span id="s263">An ordinary citizen has learned, a good deal since then.</span> <span id="s264">There’s Schindler’s List right over there.</span> <span id="s265">Have you read it?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: No, I haven’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Okay, you can have it.</span> <span id="s268">I’ll give it to you.</span> <span id="s269">That’s about those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: That’s a novel, or is it a…</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Not a novel.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: This is a book that’s out on the market now.</span> <span id="s273">By Thomas Kenneally.</span> <span id="s274">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I think you’ll find it fascinating.</span> <span id="s276">He was one of the few – maybe that’s part of the “blurb” – who made it as easy as he could, not always in an absolute sense very easy, but relatively easy for his inmates, relative to other German commanders.</span> <span id="s277">It’s quite a book, Incidentally, he is buried in a Jewish cemetery in Jerusalem, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: In your office on your wall, I see you have a certificate.</span> <span id="s279">It says, “The United States Holocaust Memorial Council hereby expresses appreciation to Richard Darr for valiant service during the 1944-45 liberation by Allied Forces of Nazi concentration camps, International Liberators Conference, October 26 through 28, 1981.”</span> <span id="s280">And then under that it says, “United States Department of State, Washington, D.C.” And who is it signed by?</span> <span id="s281">Maybe you could tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: It’s Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s283">He’s Chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Maybe you could tell me about how it was that you happened to receive that certificate and where it was at and how you felt about all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Well it was at Mount Zion synagogue in Saint Paul.</span> <span id="s286">It was ’82, then.</span> <span id="s287">The International Conference, I take it, occurred in Washington, and then, as I understand it, from the Jewish Community Relations Council in St. Paul, or Minneapolis, these awards were given regionally – that is, throughout the United States – and I received mine.</span> <span id="s288">I think it was in April of ’82, or March, in spring of that year, along with four others from Minnesota.</span> <span id="s289">Also it was a service at which there were also some survivors participating, a meeting of the liberators and the survivors.</span> <span id="s290">I think “liberating” may be too high-sounding a word for us, but nevertheless, that’s what they referred to us as.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And how many were there?</span> <span id="s292">Liberators?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: There was myself and then four from various towns in Minnesota.</span> <span id="s294">I don’t recall the communities from which they came.</span> <span id="s295">I recall that one was a member of a tank crew, participated in the liberation of one or maybe more.</span> <span id="s296">I can’t recall the other three, but I do remember talking to the former tank crew member, but I wouldn’t know his name.</span> <span id="s297">The only way I’d know their names is to go back and look in the newspaper.</span> <span id="s298">(Laughter) and I don’t suppose they remember my name.</span> <span id="s299">And then after the service – the formal portion – my wife and I talked with a family, the wife of whom was a survivor.</span> <span id="s300">The husband wasn’t.</span> <span id="s301">We had a rather, I guess you couldn’t call it “pleasing”, but an enlightening conversation with them.</span> <span id="s302">Maybe 10 or 20 minutes of it.</span> <span id="s303">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Would you care to recall what was discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, I felt that I should have felt more humble than she did, but she gave me the impression – well maybe it’s because she was so appreciative, obviously, of having survived – maybe you’d need some sort of personal hero, which I wasn’t, obviously.</span> <span id="s306">What she had gone through far surpassed anything that any of us had gone through.</span> <span id="s307">And I say that I should have been – relative to her – she shouldn’t have been the humble one, I should have been the humble one.</span> <span id="s308">But it was an interesting interchange between the two families.</span> <span id="s309">But I mentioned to you personally, earlier, that I think it would be more interesting, and I know I want to do it sometime, to listen to some of the survivors’ stories.</span> <span id="s310">Some of them must be not only fascinating, but also horrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Well those are available, through the project.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s313">PAGE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s314">PAGE</span></p> <p><span
