Papier</span></p> <p><span id="s5">00:00:41 Q: Would you state your name and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: I am Fritz Gluckstein.</span> <span id="s7">I was born in Berlin, Germany January 24, 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">00:00:57 Q: Tell us about your early childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Idyllic.</span> <span id="s10">My father was a judge.</span> <span id="s11">We had many family and friends.</span> <span id="s12">There must have been anti-Semitism, but I didn't notice it.</span> <span id="s13">I have the most pleasant memories.</span> <span id="s14">We went to synagogue on Fridays, and on Shabbat there were special services for children.</span> <span id="s15">I remember a Seder, I went with a maid, and we brought a pike and inside the pike, was another little pike.</span> <span id="s16">Honest gefilte.</span> <span id="s17">And my father raised his wine glass and smiled.</span> <span id="s18">I knew we had good wine at that Seder, if he smiled.</span> <span id="s19">I wasn't aware of any differences between Jews and non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">00:03:19 Q: Describe your daily life during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My education began when I was six years old in a neighborhood public elementary school.</span> <span id="s22">This was before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s23">Nothing happened, at school, for the first two years – maybe an occasional snide remark.</span> <span id="s24">We had these forms to fill out, questions about ourselves, and my teacher told me – don’t put down Jewish, but Mosaic.</span> <span id="s25">I don't know what it meant.</span> <span id="s26">In 1933, when Hitler came to power, my father lost his job.</span> <span id="s27">We moved to a much smaller apartment, we had no maid.</span> <span id="s28">Money was tight.</span> <span id="s29">But my mother was not Jewish, and her sister took care of me.</span> <span id="s30">She bought me everything from socks to suits.</span> <span id="s31">My father began doing honorary work for the Jewish congregation.</span> <span id="s32">I think I knew something was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">00:06:25 Q: Tell us about anti-Jewish laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Then, we were not allowed to have maids, but it meant little – we had no money anyway.</span> <span id="s35">I was too young to appreciate what was happening.</span> <span id="s36">I knew my father had lost his job, and people were leaving the country.</span> <span id="s37">People discussed leaving the country – should we go?</span> <span id="s38">What would we do?</span> <span id="s39">They said, after all, it won't be that bad.</span> <span id="s40">My father had served in the Army, and was decorated.</span> <span id="s41">We said this is after all a country of poets and thinkers.</span> <span id="s42">Let's see what happens.</span> <span id="s43">Some people realized what was going on and tried to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s44">Some friends of ours tried to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s45">There were quotas for visas – the lines outside the American Consulate were very long.</span> <span id="s46">My mother stood in the line for these friends.</span> <span id="s47">Nothing was concrete.</span> <span id="s48">I put it all off on having less money, the smaller apartment.</span> <span id="s49">It got worse after the first two years.</span> <span id="s50">Anti-Semitism got stronger and stronger, even in the school.</span> <span id="s51">I wasn't forced to leave school, but it became untenable.</span> <span id="s52">I went to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s53">More Jewish schools were being established.</span> <span id="s54">Some of these schools were private, and others were run by individuals or by the congregation.</span> <span id="s55">Eventually, Jews were required to leave public schools.</span> <span id="s56">It took some time though, and it had become too miserable to stay anyway.</span> <span id="s57">Jewish private schools were very similar to public schools.</span> <span id="s58">There was the same curriculum in the Jewish schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">00:11:27 Q: Please cite examples of state-sponsored persecution.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I was too young I knew my father had lost his job.</span> <span id="s61">I knew Jews kept more to themselves.</span> <span id="s62">Outright, state-sponsored persecution did not come until 1938 with Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s63">This was foreshadowing.</span> <span id="s64">Jews had to have their names on their storefronts in big letters, so you could tell which stores on the streets were owned by Jews, and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s65">So, one day, I went to school and I saw glass on the streets.</span> <span id="s66">And I realized there was glass all over the street in front of the Jewish stores.</span> <span id="s67">And there was smoke coming from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s68">This was Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s69">Kristallnacht was the first major government sponsored event I recall.</span> <span id="s70">The other things I remember are minor such as Germans marching around in uniform, singing some songs.</span> <span id="s71">We took it in stride.</span> <span id="s72">You ignored it.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">00:14:10 Q: Was the Jewish community large?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes, the Jewish community was large.</span> <span id="s75">It was one of the largest in Germany with Orthodox Jews, conservatives, and liberals.</span> <span id="s76">When the time came that Jews were not permitted to go to concerts and theatres, we had our own concerts and theatres.</span> <span id="s77">We were very active.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">00:15:15 Q: Did these restrictions occur before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Some.</span> <span id="s80">Things weren't that obvious before.</span> <span id="s81">I recall things becoming different after that night.</span> <span id="s82">No movies, no theatres.</span> <span id="s83">The war started in 1939.</span> <span id="s84">Everybody had the same ration cards in the beginning.</span> <span id="s85">Later our cards were stamped with Jew in the middle.</span> <span id="s86">Then, they stamped Jew on the coupons because of what happened.</span> <span id="s87">You could cut off the coupon and not know if it belonged to a Jew.</span> <span id="s88">Jews could only go to the store between four and five o'clock.</span> <span id="s89">You had to be home by eight o'clock.</span> <span id="s90">And certain parts of Berlin were off-limits.</span> <span id="s91">Sometimes, the regular police did not know all the restrictions, such as you could not go down the main boulevard, Koefusandun.</span> <span id="s92">The regular police did not know, but we knew.</span> <span id="s93">The curfew was unofficial, too but we knew it.</span> <span id="s94">If someone saw you and reported you to the regular police, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s95">But if the Gestapo knew, there would be consequences.</span> <span id="s96">These were subtle changes.</span> <span id="s97">They did not come overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">00:18:48 Q: What happened to your family and friends after Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: The dam broke.</span> <span id="s100">Things really started to happen.</span> <span id="s101">Some friends were sent to camps.</span> <span id="s102">Others were deported to Poland.</span> <span id="s103">There were more regulations.</span> <span id="s104">Jews could not own furs.</span> <span id="s105">We could have no valuables, or pets.</span> <span id="s106">Our family got rid of our dog.</span> <span id="s107">We could not have phones, radios.</span> <span id="s108">Bit by bit.</span> <span id="s109">Today this, and tomorrow that.</span> <span id="s110">And these were not written regulations, but by mouth.</span> <span id="s111">You knew you had to do it.</span> <span id="s112">In school, classes were sent to collect the valuables.</span> <span id="s113">The synagogues were used to hold the collections, to collect valuables, bikes, furs, certain musical instruments.</span> <span id="s114">There was food rationing.</span> <span id="s115">You could only purchase food between four and five o'clock.</span> <span id="s116">No milk, no white breads, no meat.</span> <span id="s117">Jews could not go to the barber or the hairdresser.</span> <span id="s118">We had a friend who had learned to cut hair years and years before, and he had to remember how it was done.</span> <span id="s119">When the war started, there were the ration cards.</span> <span id="s120">One event in particular, I remember.</span> <span id="s121">We were told in school that we had to wear the Star of David.</span> <span id="s122">A rabbi who taught Hebrew told us.</span> <span id="s123">We talked about it, what it would mean, and what we would do if we were attacked.</span> <span id="s124">There was also a white star that had to be fixed above our apartment door.</span> <span id="s125">I believe some people were embarrassed.</span> <span id="s126">I believe there were attempts to organize insults on Jews, but people did not rise up against Jews.</span> <span id="s127">When rations were cut, particularly for Jews, I remember walking on the street.</span> <span id="s128">There was a woman walking in front of me.</span> <span id="s129">I remember she turned suddenly, and gave me food.</span> <span id="s130">Some people were most embarrassed.</span> <span id="s131">My mother's sister did much to help us, and so did non-Jewish friends, relatives on my mother's side.</span> <span id="s132">My aunt gave us food in the dark of night.</span> <span id="s133">One evening, she met me at a corner to give me groceries.</span> <span id="s134">And who was there, watching?</span> <span id="s135">The biggest Nazi in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s136">My aunt said to her, "Good evening.</span> <span id="s137">I am going home.</span> <span id="s138">The boy is helping to carry my groceries."</span> <span id="s139">The question about the star was what to do after air raids.</span> <span id="s140">We had forced labor, cleaning up after the air raids.</span> <span id="s141">I went to one place, and my father was in another.</span> <span id="s142">If you wore the Star of David, you were likely to be beaten up.</span> <span id="s143">If you went without the star, there might be a check.</span> <span id="s144">They would see a young man, without a uniform.</span> <span id="s145">It would be very strange.</span> <span id="s146">Is he a deserter?</span> <span id="s147">Without your star, the officer would arrest you.</span> <span id="s148">It happened to me twice.</span> <span id="s149">The first time, it was the regular police and they probably didn't know I was supposed to wear the star.</span> <span id="s150">The second time, it was Gestapo.</span> <span id="s151">I could tell by the uniform.</span> <span id="s152">I am quite sure he knew I was supposed to wear the star.</span> <span id="s153">But, he checked my identifications and gave it back to me.</span> <span id="s154">He let me go.</span> <span id="s155">If you wore the star, it had to be sewed absolutely tightly to your left side.</span> <span id="s156">They came with a pencil and tried to get the pencil behind the star.</span> <span id="s157">If the pencil went behind the star, then you were in violation of regulations that said you had to have the star fastened on.</span> <span id="s158">They arrested you.</span> <span id="s159">When the deportations began, the real Holocaust began.</span> <span id="s160">You'd go to school in the morning, and some benches would be empty.</span> <span id="s161">The teacher would try to find out where the students were.</span> <span id="s162">Of course, there was no phone, so a student would be sent.</span> <span id="s163">And they would find a paper seal on the door.</span> <span id="s164">They came in the night.</span> <span id="s165">You'd never know who would be next.</span> <span id="s166">Later, it become more organized.</span> <span id="s167">They'd send lists to people to fill out, so you would list your belongings.</span> <span id="s168">When the Gestapo came, they would check the list against what was in the house.</span> <span id="s169">This way, you could not give away any of your property.</span> <span id="s170">I understand that if the transports were not full, they would pick up children off the streets to fill them.</span> <span id="s171">Some Jews, without stars, tried to go underground and disappear.</span> <span id="s172">Some Jews assisted the Gestapo to find other Jews.</span> <span id="s173">It was a very sad time.</span> <span id="s174">One time, I was without my star on the platform of a street car.</span> <span id="s175">And there was a woman, a spy.</span> <span id="s176">I got off at the very next stop as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s177">I wonder what happened to them, these spies.</span> <span id="s178">The Russians came in and I understand they did not survive, but, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">00:33:25 Q: What year did the deportations begin?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: They started about 1942.</span> <span id="s181">I think in 1941 or 1942.</span> <span id="s182">Bit by bit.</span> <span id="s183">First, some of the class might be missing.</span> <span id="s184">Then, it was very organized.</span> <span id="s185">They sent the lists.</span> <span id="s186">I used to work at a factory, and one morning they came in trucks.</span> <span id="s187">They took us all to an empty amusement hall.</span> <span id="s188">Some unfortunates had to go to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s189">Because my mother was a non-Jew, they let me go.</span> <span id="s190">When I came home, some good neighbor said the Jew is back!</span> <span id="s191">First they got my father and then, me.</span> <span id="s192">They took me to an old people's home, with a cemetery in the back.</span> <span id="s193">Moses Mendelsohn was buried in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s194">There was an interrogation.</span> <span id="s195">The German Gestapo sat in chairs along the wall.</span> <span id="s196">The interrogation was done by the Austrians.</span> <span id="s197">They tried to trip us up, incriminate ourselves.</span> <span id="s198">I was fortunate, they let me go.</span> <span id="s199">I remember this, it was my sixteenth birthday.</span> <span id="s200">My friends were waiting for me at home, and I was delayed.</span> <span id="s201">Good neighbors tried to warn us – they're going around picking up Jews.</span> <span id="s202">Other neighbors called the police.</span> <span id="s203">We were bombed twice.</span> <span id="s204">The second time, we went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s205">In the morning, the Gestapo wanted all of us for work at their headquarters.</span> <span id="s206">I used to go quite regularly in the morning to the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s207">The Krufiss Einschalt, Eichmann was there.</span> <span id="s208">Eichmann was a non-descript man who never raised his voice.</span> <span id="s209">The real heavy was his deputy, Gunther.</span> <span id="s210">He'd tiptoe through the halls, wanting to catch people at rest.</span> <span id="s211">I was at the meeting house recently, and they showed pictures of war criminals, still wanted.</span> <span id="s212">There was Rolf Gunther.</span> <span id="s213">One officer, Heidenburg, treated us exemplary.</span> <span id="s214">He particularly treated me in an exemplary fashion.</span> <span id="s215">He tried his best to keep me from unpleasant work and nasty officers.</span> <span id="s216">I could feel that he wanted to do his best.</span> <span id="s217">In fact, I hope he made it.</span> <span id="s218">One guard, who if you blew your nose, was after you.</span> <span id="s219">Another, he never did anything.</span> <span id="s220">You found human beings in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s221">It was rare, but you found them.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">00:41:10 Q: Did you have a bar mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: In 1940, I had a normal bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s224">Food was scarce.</span> <span id="s225">But thanks to my aunt, we had enough.</span> <span id="s226">We saved food from the rations, and my aunt knew a baker.</span> <span id="s227">I remember that the synagogue was cold, and it took place in a smaller room.</span> <span id="s228">I got Mark Twain books.</span> <span id="s229">It is a very pleasant memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">00:42:49 Q: Tell about the forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: After the school shut down, the students were forced into labor.</span> <span id="s232">My first job was in a factory, where I made instruments.</span> <span id="s233">They came in trucks then and took us to an amusement hall.</span> <span id="s234">My second job was with a company that took care of burned buildings after air raids.</span> <span id="s235">It was hard work.</span> <span id="s236">One day, a wall fell on me.</span> <span id="s237">There were all sorts working, young and old, lawyers and musicians.</span> <span id="s238">For the young, the problem was, that we weren't learning anything.</span> <span id="s239">We didn't go to school!</span> <span id="s240">We were schooled on the job.</span> <span id="s241">We were asked questions while we emptied the wheelbarrows.</span> <span id="s242">It was almost like regular classes, the fellows who filled the barrows switched.</span> <span id="s243">I still remember some questions, some poems, translations.</span> <span id="s244">It was mental discipline.</span> <span id="s245">My mother had to go to work, too.</span> <span id="s246">She worked at a factory, making uniforms.</span> <span id="s247">The Jewish Hospital was in good shape.</span> <span id="s248">The bad medical care was not bad.</span> <span id="s249">But if you were sick, after two days a doctor would come and see if you were still sick or if you could go back to work.</span> <span id="s250">Jewish physicians were only allowed to treat Jews.</span> <span id="s251">They had blue signs with white letters.</span> <span id="s252">It was the same for the lawyers.</span> <span id="s253">There was less need for the lawyers, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">00:50:28 Q: What happened to the Jewish community when the Nazis began to</span></p> <p><span id="s255">lose?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: In Berlin, the community was close at one time.</span> <span id="s257">But there was actually not much Jewish life anymore.</span> <span id="s258">People were afraid to go to services.</span> <span id="s259">The first place to pick up Jews was at the synagogue.</span> <span id="s260">Minsk was bombed out, more or less; there were no regular services anymore.</span> <span id="s261">We met in minyons.</span> <span id="s262">At Passover, we baked our own matzoh out of rye flour.</span> <span id="s263">We only came together to find out what the new rumors were.</span> <span id="s264">There were not people to take care of the graves in the cemetery, so we worked there.</span> <span id="s265">Or, we sorted papers in the administrative buildings.</span> <span id="s266">Until quite late, we had a congregation newsletter.</span> <span id="s267">But that stopped.</span> <span id="s268">Prior to the end, you were glad if you saw another Jew because he wasn't deported.</span> <span id="s269">Most were deported.</span> <span id="s270">Some lived underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">00:55:42 Q: How did you avoid deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: My mother wasn't Jewish, and they weren't as efficient as they thought.</span> <span id="s273">They did not get to it.</span> <span id="s274">I am glad to be alive.</span> <span id="s275">If the Russians had not been so fast, I wouldn't be here.</span> <span id="s276">In the northern part of the city, they had begun to line up the Jews and shoot them.</span> <span id="s277">When the Russians came, we had a difficult time proving to them that we were Jews, because there were so few left.</span> <span id="s278">There were two armies.</span> <span id="s279">One to the south and one to the east.</span> <span id="s280">One day, I went out to get water and somebody told me to stop.</span> <span id="s281">It was a Russian.</span> <span id="s282">Others had already been in my house and they waved to the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">00:58:41 Q: How many Jews were in Berlin at the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s285">Who was a Jew?</span> <span id="s286">Who was not?</span> <span id="s287">Who had to wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A Jew with four grandparents had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s289">Half-Jews, the children had to wear stars if they were raised as Jews.</span> <span id="s290">No stars if they were not raised as Jews.</span> <span id="s291">They had better ration cards, but they still had to work.</span> <span id="s292">One who was called a mischling "half breed" had no star.</span> <span id="s293">The other was gertenschuller "in effect, Jewish" had to wear a star.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">1:01:01 Q: Explain the ration system.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: There was no white bread and no meat.</span> <span id="s296">Between four and five, you had to do your grocery shopping.</span> <span id="s297">There was nothing left in the shops, by then.</span> <span id="s298">Decent shopkeepers kept food.</span> <span id="s299">Some were most decent, and went far beyond the call of duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">1:02:33 Q: How were living conditions in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: During the day, we worked ten or twelve hours and during the night, we got up three times if we were lucky.</span> <span id="s302">Five times if we were not.</span> <span id="s303">We would have to walk to the air raid shelters because the Nazis thought we would signal to the planes.</span> <span id="s304">All we wanted was to sleep.</span> <span id="s305">The weather forecasts would tell us how many air raids there would be that night.</span> <span id="s306">We actually welcomed bad weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">1:05:14 Q: How did you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: There were three categories of survivors.</span> <span id="s309">The first, my case, my mother wasn't Jewish.</span> <span id="s310">Most went underground.</span> <span id="s311">They took off their star, and disappeared.</span> <span id="s312">Others, the Gestapo forgot.</span> <span id="s313">They would go to pick them up and maybe their house wouldn't be standing.</span> <span id="s314">And then they would forget them.</span> <span id="s315">Most however, went underground.</span> <span id="s316">You talk about active resistance, but in sheltering Jews, there were many cases of passive resistance.</span> <span id="s317">Pastor Rachwitz went all out to shelter Jews in a church.</span> <span id="s318">He persuaded his congregations to shelter Jews.</span> <span id="s319">Notes were written Jew sheltering Rachwitz.</span> <span id="s320">Catholics and Protestants some went all out.</span> <span id="s321">The second time we were bombed, we were allocated quarters with another family.</span> <span id="s322">My father's colleague went underground and came with us.</span> <span id="s323">It was a risk.</span> <span id="s324">You could convince people for a time that you had a right to be there.</span> <span id="s325">Some got caught and, didn't make it.</span> <span id="s326">Much was done by the resistance to help the Jews.</span> <span id="s327">Food, clothing, and an explanation for the people who were in hiding.</span> <span id="s328">Some actually went underground.</span> <span id="s329">They never came outside.</span> <span id="s330">They were in a basement, or a shelter in the yard.</span> <span id="s331">You would have to explain why there was this person, my uncle.</span> <span id="s332">Young people were the hardest to cover up.</span> <span id="s333">There always was the question, why are they not in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">1:10:28 Q: Describe the final days of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: There was an air bombardment.</span> <span id="s336">Russians were on two sides.</span> <span id="s337">The German army was in the streets, preparing for a street by street defense.</span> <span id="s338">It actually happened in the east, but in the west, the Russians were too fast.</span> <span id="s339">One day I walked out, and all around there were dead bodies.</span> <span id="s340">I thought a man had fallen so I tried to help him up.</span> <span id="s341">That was my first time seeing a dead body.</span> <span id="s342">And sanitation had broken down.</span> <span id="s343">It was April, warm, and most unpleasant.</span> <span id="s344">The Russians handled it well.</span> <span id="s345">They couldn't bring too much food with them.</span> <span id="s346">In the cemetery there was a greenhouse.</span> <span id="s347">The Russians took out the flowers and grew tomatoes and in parks and gardens, they had vegetables.</span> <span id="s348">The city was divided of course into zones, Russian, American, British, and French.</span> <span id="s349">The divisions were important for Jews.</span> <span id="s350">When one wanted to immigrate, it was very difficult to apply for a visa from the Russian sector.</span> <span id="s351">You were lucky to be in the American or British sectors.</span> <span id="s352">Even the French made it difficult.</span> <span id="s353">They all took turns providing food and everyone waited for the American month.</span> <span id="s354">They gave us white bread.</span> <span id="s355">Much better food.</span> <span id="s356">Currency was not Mark, but American cigarettes.</span> <span id="s357">Every Friday night, we went to the Chaplains Center in the American sector.</span> <span id="s358">Rabbi Herbert Friedman, gave me my first piece of gefilte fish.</span> <span id="s359">He got an Army truck to deliver to each home.</span> <span id="s360">He had lists of letters, and he checked all the addresses.</span> <span id="s361">One night, friends here had written to the rabbi-chaplain.</span> <span id="s362">He found us.</span> <span id="s363">Water and electricity were back.</span> <span id="s364">Everybody wanted to know what to do?</span> <span id="s365">Younger people wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s366">My father had gotten his job back, but he said if he had been ten years younger he would have left.</span> <span id="s367">But what could he do as a judge?</span> <span id="s368">He had to stay.</span> <span id="s369">He said to me you go.</span> <span id="s370">And don't study a profession limited to one country.</span> <span id="s371">I left as soon as I could.</span> <span id="s372">I had no hate towards Germany, but I did not think it was my duty to rebuild it.</span> <span id="s373">I helped bring in food, CARE packages, along with rations of coffee and beverage powder.</span> <span id="s374">It was a great moment, opening the packages, when one found cigarettes.</span> <span id="s375">Their worth depended on the brand of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s376">Camels got you lots of food.</span> <span id="s377">Each brand had a certain value on the black market.</span> <span id="s378">My mother helped people that were going to be deported.</span> <span id="s379">When they got the lists, a sign of deportation, she would help them pack.</span> <span id="s380">With experience, she knew what was needed.</span> <span id="s381">She gave moral support.</span> <span id="s382">It made it easier.</span> <span id="s383">She'd go back to their homes when the Gestapo came, and make it easier.</span> <span id="s384">We named our daughter after my mother.</span> <span id="s385">Her name was Heveld, but because of Ruth, you know, where you go, I will go we named her Ruth.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">1:25:41 Q: How and when did you come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: After the war, I went back to school.</span> <span id="s388">I tried to learn English.</span> <span id="s389">I told a professor when I got here, and he asked about my English – when I came here I could read Shakespeare, but not the funnies.</span> <span id="s390">Now I can read the funnies, but not Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s391">We were given joint affidavits.</span> <span id="s392">Jews were assigned and sent to the U.S.</span> <span id="s393">One day, it was my turn.</span> <span id="s394">I could carry 100 lbs.</span> <span id="s395">I didn't have that much.</span> <span id="s396">Now, I look at what I have amassed.</span> <span id="s397">Then, I had only fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s398">The food was fantastic on the ship.</span> <span id="s399">I never saw the Statue of Liberty; we came in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s400">I saw cars from the deck, some lights, and a street.</span> <span id="s401">That was my first sight of America.</span> <span id="s402">It was overwhelming in New York.</span> <span id="s403">No ration cards.</span> <span id="s404">It was amazing; you could go to the store and buy anything.</span> <span id="s405">It was so safe and civilized.</span> <span id="s406">I asked someone about the boxes by the mailboxes, why did people leave them there?</span> <span id="s407">I was surprised that nobody took them.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">1:31:14 Q: Were you sponsored?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No, it was a joint affidavit.</span> <span id="s410">A friend in L.A. wanted me, and they would have become my sponsor.</span> <span id="s411">But, I wanted to try it on my own.</span> <span id="s412">I was given the choice of Detroit or St. Paul.</span> <span id="s413">I went to St. Paul.</span> <span id="s414">I took the night train to Chicago, and then to St. Paul.</span> <span id="s415">Bill Hoffman picked me up.</span> <span id="s416">He is an author of, "Tales of Hoffman" and "Those were the Days".</span> <span id="s417">Family Services took good care of me.</span> <span id="s418">My first job was as a porter, and then I assembled refrigerators.</span> <span id="s419">I went to the movies, and I read the funnies.</span> <span id="s420">I met my wife at the Hill House.</span> <span id="s421">I was the assistant caretaker.</span> <span id="s422">Students came and cooked their dinners there on the weekend.</span> <span id="s423">They mixed up the dishes, I used to get so mad and say, "You've mixed up the dishes!"</span> <span id="s424">Once there was this pretty redhead, I told her about the dishes.</span> <span id="s425">That's how I met my wife.</span> <span id="s426">I came here and started to study at the University of Minnesota.</span> <span id="s427">In Germany, I had finished the mid-term, but it didn't do me any good.</span> <span id="s428">I started again as a freshman.</span> <span id="s429">I wanted to become a veterinarian.</span> <span id="s430">While I studied, I tutored others in German.</span> <span id="s431">Then I spent two years in the Army in Frederick, Maryland.</span> <span id="s432">Then I went to a lab in Iowa, as an animal pathologist.</span> <span id="s433">Then to the Department of Agriculture here in DC, in 1960.</span> <span id="s434">I did foreign work, seeing about diseases that animals had in other countries.</span> <span id="s435">I went to the Smithsonian; I did not work with stuffed animals.</span> <span id="s436">Then I went to the National Library of Medicine, where I still am.</span> <span id="s437">I still have the star.</span> <span id="s438">It had to be tightly attached.</span> <span id="s439">I still have the paper that excluded me from service in the German Army in1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">1:45:04 Q: Is there anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: I am fortunate to have survived.</span> <span id="s442">I am grateful to the United States for the opportunity for a new life.</span> <span id="s443">I had to be convinced to give this interview, but I feel it is necessary.</span> <span id="s444">It really happened.</span> <span id="s445">Too many want to believe that it did not happen.</span> <span id="s446">We must make sure it is never forgotten.</span> <span id="s447">That the Holocaust is never forgotten.</span></p></body></html>
