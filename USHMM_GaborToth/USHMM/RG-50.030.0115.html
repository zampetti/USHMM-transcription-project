you know, in that area.</span> <span id="s20">This is still now in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Um....</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: But then I moved out very, very early.</span> <span id="s23">My father came back from the World War I.</span> <span id="s24">He was in the Austrian army.</span> <span id="s25">He went...he came back, and we moved to his home town-- named Rzeszów--on the other side of the San River, in the county of Rzeszów.</span> <span id="s26">And this is where my residence was.</span> <span id="s27">I lived...I grew up there; and I went there to the [Krauner (ph)] School and then there to gymnasium--which is their secondary school, their high school, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Tell me about your family.</span> <span id="s29">Tell me about your parents and...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Well, the parents were just hard-working people, you know.</span> <span id="s31">They did...they are not...they were not doing very well.</span> <span id="s32">After war, uh, nobody really was doing well in in those small towns.</span> <span id="s33">I remember from my childhood, from Rzeszów, when the mother would go to the town to the market place to...to uh, to get uh soup which was which was uh distributed by the committee, Hoover Committee.</span> <span id="s34">Yeah.</span> <span id="s35">So I remember vaguely this, this thing, you know.</span> <span id="s36">So uh, as I say, they were just...just hard-working people; and uh...and uh...uh really not excitement, not much excitement about what's...what was going on.</span> <span id="s37">But you know I was living close to the nature; and from the very, very beginning, I..</span> <span id="s38">.</span> <span id="s39">I learned to love the nature.</span> <span id="s40">I used to go with my sister out to pick up flowers.</span> <span id="s41">Early in the spring, to the woods; but always alone, with her, as a small kids.</span> <span id="s42">And they was...they would let us go, and we would go very far.</span> <span id="s43">And maybe this was a, this escapades were very important in my life; because later on when I became alone, when I lived alone, when I had to make a decisions, I was ready to make any kind of a decision, you know.</span> <span id="s44">Which I think I contributed to my survival a little bit, because you know I would, uh, be able to, to, uh, to move around very, uh, freely.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Let's come back to you as a child a little bit.</span> <span id="s46">Um, what kind of a school did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: I went to a grammar school.</span> <span id="s48">This was uh this was boys and girls together, you know?</span> <span id="s49">Uh, big school...and uh, I only finished four classes; because from the fourth class I went to the secondary school, which was the, the...the...there were, you know, the Polish uh...uh schools were organized at that time.</span> <span id="s50">And I then attended eight classes.</span> <span id="s51">Eight years of...eight years of the high school.</span> <span id="s52">High school was a little bit different.</span> <span id="s53">It is, uh...high school plus two years of college, uh--that school, you know.</span> <span id="s54">When you graduate from that school, you go straight to university.</span> <span id="s55">And I did go the university, Jagie oniów [Jagiellonian] University in Kraków, where I, uh, studied, uh, history of art.</span> <span id="s56">And this made me, you know, got interested in the art itself.</span> <span id="s57">So I joined...so I enrolled into the art school, Academy of Fine Arts, in Kraków; and I finished that school in 1939, just in time before the, uh, war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What was Kraków like in those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Kraków?</span> <span id="s60">Kraków was a, uh, a very beautiful place to live in, you know.</span> <span id="s61">In those days, you know.</span> <span id="s62">Surrounded with so many landmarks and beautiful churches.</span> <span id="s63">Jewish synagogues.</span> <span id="s64">We used to go there.</span> <span id="s65">We had a..</span> <span id="s66">.</span> <span id="s67">in, in, in uh, uh...I had to, I had to attend also the classes, you know, in the art...the art school, the history of art classes.</span> <span id="s68">Now the professor was Franz Klein.</span> <span id="s69">He's a Jew, you know.</span> <span id="s70">There were a lot of Jewish professors, you know.</span> <span id="s71">And he was, uh, very fond of Kraków, and knew everything.</span> <span id="s72">Kraków, it's a old city.</span> <span id="s73">In order to appreciate that city, you have to go into the basements; because in the basement you see the whole history, how it developed.</span> <span id="s74">You see all the styles that, uh, are not visible outside.</span> <span id="s75">So we went to the synagogues.</span> <span id="s76">There is a..</span> <span id="s77">.</span> <span id="s78">in Kraków, there is one synagogue which was, uh, in...looks like a church, fourteenth-century church.</span> <span id="s79">It's in gothic.</span> <span id="s80">And it was donated to the Jewish community by the King Kazimierz Wielki, who brought the Jews to Kraków, and settled down...uh, settled this community in a town, uh, called Kazimierz.</span> <span id="s81">Yeah.</span> <span id="s82">So, uh, uh...they had, you know, very much a part of the Kraków history; and they lived there 'til '39.</span> <span id="s83">Now, I don't know what's happened there.</span> <span id="s84">You know, I haven't been there.</span> <span id="s85">But I understand, you know, there are no Jews, not many left.</span> <span id="s86">So, so apparently this uh whole section of town have changed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Did...as the war approached, did you have Jewish friends as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Oh, in my class, in our art school, I had...you know, there were several Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s89">I might even later on remember names, uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: That's OK.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: This is...this was international, I would say, group of people.</span> <span id="s92">There was a woman, she was Italian.</span> <span id="s93">There was a uh...a Russian emigrée, a woman.</span> <span id="s94">There were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s95">There were Poles.</span> <span id="s96">There were Jews; and there was even a French uh...uh, a French uh fellow, you know.</span> <span id="s97">So they're uh international in a group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: As...what happened to this life when war broke out?</span> <span id="s99">Can you tell us what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Completely changed.</span> <span id="s101">Immediately.</span> <span id="s102">Immediate changement.</span> <span id="s103">When I left Kraków, uh before the Germans occupied it, and I went ...uh, I traveled through the villages and small towns eastwards ...uh, ahead of Germans.</span> <span id="s104">Because this was the order by the Polish military.</span> <span id="s105">We hope that we'll be drafted, sooner or later, to the military.</span> <span id="s106">And, of course, this never happened.</span> <span id="s107">So when I went too far--I went almost to the eastern border--and I found out that it is the Russians who are now marching westwards, occupying that part; so I have to, you know, make quick decision.</span> <span id="s108">And I chose rather to stay on the German side, so I moved back and joined the Germans, you know (laughter).</span> <span id="s109">I crossed that territory into...into the Germany, and I went back to Kraków.</span> <span id="s110">But this was, this was city looked completely different.</span> <span id="s111">First of all, the whole government of Generalgouvernement, moved into the...Kraków.</span> <span id="s112">Kraków became this uh...capital of that uh province, uh so there were so many Germans.</span> <span id="s113">The Germans uh were everywhere.</span> <span id="s114">And then of course the persecutions started immediately.</span> <span id="s115">All the professors at the university were arrested, and they were sent to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s116">People in my age, again, were being arrested all the time and sent as forc...forced labor to Germany.</span> <span id="s117">So I had to leave that uh...that uh city and go back to uh Rzeszów, where I found...uh, thought would be safer to live; but not because uh....</span> <span id="s118">Again, I joined the underground uh organization; and, of course, because of that, you know, I was in in constant threat of being arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: How did you join and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: There is by, you know, a few people knowing, you know; and they....</span> <span id="s121">This...this was, you know, situation where you never know more than three people.</span> <span id="s122">You know.</span> <span id="s123">So you really, know, was given a job to do and this was in organizing--very early, 1939 still, and 1940 at the beginning.</span> <span id="s124">So, uh, there was not, not much as the...the activity as more just the organizing uh process that we are involved, you know.</span> <span id="s125">Hiring more and more people, you know.</span> <span id="s126">But this was from the very, very beginning uh ...in action.</span> <span id="s127">On account of that, and also because uh uh again the Germans were, you know, arresting young people and uh taking them to Germany to forced labor camps, I had to uh, uh...uh... stay in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Yeah.</span> <span id="s129">I had to...I, I was not sleeping at home for, uh, for many months; because, you know, it was, uh, uh, not safe.</span> <span id="s130">And out of that came the idea that I must go.</span> <span id="s131">Cross the border, and go to another country; and, uh, maybe again join the army in France, which was being uh...uh, organized at that time.</span> <span id="s132">Uh...so with three other people, uh, I..</span> <span id="s133">.</span> <span id="s134">on...in March 1940, I uh...I went through the Tatra Mountain[s] to Czechoslovakia; and I traveled through the through the Czechoslovakia, yeah.</span> <span id="s135">And I traveled almost to the other end of that little country, almost to this Hungarian border.</span> <span id="s136">And here we...I, myself and another uh fellow, we were arrested; two survived and two escaped--but two of us were arrested, because we just, uh, ran into the uh...uh...set-up, you know, by the...by the police.</span> <span id="s137">They waiting for us.</span> <span id="s138">So, uh, they arrested us and then they sold us to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s139">Yeah.</span> <span id="s140">Slovaks sold us to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, they...I understand that they were paying money, being paid money for that, you know; because they were, they...in other words, uh, they were, um, working as agents for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s142">You know, Slovaks at that time were cooperating with Germany.</span> <span id="s143">There was a government run by that uh uh priest Haha [NB: reference to Joseph Tiso?]</span> <span id="s144">.</span> <span id="s145">Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">And uh... and, of course, they...they allowed German to...on the roads come in to the trans...military transport to go right through Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s147">So, uh, at the end, uh, they gathered us all arrestees--and there were thousands of people that were being arrested--uh, so about...a huge train, a huge train was going toward the Polish border one day.</span> <span id="s148">And we crossed the border to the town of Muszyna, where the Gestapo took it over.</span> <span id="s149">And that is why I got in contact with the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s150">And they were immediately, uh, segregating all those uh, arrested...arrestees.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Uh, I tried to...I, first of all, I..</span> <span id="s152">.</span> <span id="s153">made up a, uh...false name; and I stick with that false name all the time, because I was ashamed to let my parents know that I allowed myself to be arrested.</span> <span id="s154">(Laughter).</span> <span id="s155">Yeah.</span> <span id="s156">And so I stuck to that, uh, false name; and, of course, everything, all the personal data and everything uh, uh...was changed to and also falsified... falsified.</span> <span id="s157">And I figured that it would be good idea to uh to to be born in Soviet territory, because I was hoping, "Well, the Germans will never get there."</span> <span id="s158">(Laughter) How wrong I was!</span> <span id="s159">(Laughter) So I uh...I gave all the data and places in the in the territory which was at that time occupied by Russia...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: What was the false name you used?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Uh, Johann Barasz.</span> <span id="s162">The one that you see on that uh document that I show you [NB: Photograph shown at the end of the interview identifies him as "Józef Bara_"].</span> <span id="s163">Yeah.</span> <span id="s164">And uh with this name I travel from, from...from Muszyna to another prison in uh Nowy S_cz, and to Tarnów.</span> <span id="s165">Now in Tarnów, on June 14th, seven hundred fifty-six young people uh assemble in uh mikva...is that Jewish name?</span> <span id="s166">Uh, mikva--yeah, that uh public bath--at night; and in the morning, we march to the station, boarded a train and started...and uh the train started west, you know, toward Kraków.</span> <span id="s167">But we didn't know...nobody told us where we are going, what's going to happen to him, to us.</span> <span id="s168">Uh, we just was riding in that train until we came to Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Tell, tell us a little bit, if you would, about the people you were rounded up with....</span> <span id="s170">And you were not Jewish, so why...why...why were you put on a train with Jews do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: These were not Jews.</span> <span id="s172">They were all Poles.</span> <span id="s173">This five hundred, this seven hundred fifty-six people, they were all like me; people like me who wanted to join the army.</span> <span id="s174">Or, maybe some who maybe wanted to do some black-marketing; because situation, economic situation, in Poland at that time was very bad.</span> <span id="s175">But uh...uh...and maybe there were a few oth...other who were arrested inside, in Poland; you know, on the underground activities.</span> <span id="s176">This is, these were the types of people; but mostly young people, you know?</span> <span id="s177">The oldest I remember was a sergeant.</span> <span id="s178">Uh he must, he must have been in, in...in forties at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">I'm sure he probably did not survive.</span> <span id="s180">And uh...but mostly this was people in twenties, and everybody hopeful.</span> <span id="s181">People with uh...we, we are all waiting uh what's going to happen in France.</span> <span id="s182">You know, there were so many stories going on those days a big uh offensive, German offensive, being prepared uh in 1940.</span> <span id="s183">And, of course, we all hoped that it will end tragically for Germany, and the uh Allied Forces will win.</span> <span id="s184">How...when we arrived in 19, 19 ...in June 14th, on the railroad station, that is the first thing what we heard: that the Paris has been taken by German army.</span> <span id="s185">And there was a hugh celebration and the champagne corks popping, popping up, and uh soldiers shooting into the air.</span> <span id="s186">So it was a terrible news, psychologically, for us.</span> <span id="s187">People who...we did not know where where do...where we are going, what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s188">Afternoon that...that day, you know, train started moving; and finally we came to a very obscure small station.</span> <span id="s189">And above us hung a huge sign: "Auschwitz."</span> <span id="s190">Of course, we did not know what it means-- "Auschwitz"--because it sounded German.</span> <span id="s191">And some people thought, "Well, maybe we've already crossed to uh...to uh Germany."</span> <span id="s192">But a station worker, uh, explained to us that we are on...uh, really in O_wi_cim.</span> <span id="s193">O_wi_cim is a Polish name for the name "Auschwitz."</span> <span id="s194">And uh we were moved on the side track, and uh in about five minutes we found ourselves in the front of a large building.</span> <span id="s195">Uh there were three of them...middle building, uh large, it was surrounded by uh by the uh, uh...uh barbed wire fences with uh gates, watch towers.</span> <span id="s196">And this was a camp, the first camp.</span> <span id="s197">Now the buildings belong, uh, to Polish tobacco monopoly.</span> <span id="s198">Uh that uh first building uh, uh...uh, consisted uh really of two rooms; big rooms, you know, where we were herded, and we slept on the on the straw.</span> <span id="s199">There was nothing organized.</span> <span id="s200">It was just to keep us in.</span> <span id="s201">Before us came thirty kapos from Sachsenhausen, from...and they got, they were numbered from one to thirty.</span> <span id="s202">The man that I was talking about lat...uh before--uh, Otto Küssel--who escaped with me, was number two.</span> <span id="s203">Now so...first Polish number is thirty-one.</span> <span id="s204">I believe the last number of our transport was uh seven hundred eighty-four or eighty-five.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: That's what...so you were on the first transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: In the first transport.</span> <span id="s207">It's funny thing about that uh arrival scene because, you know--as I say, I have to point it out--we still did not know where we were.</span> <span id="s208">We didn't know how the concentration camp looks like.</span> <span id="s209">Uh, as a young man in Kraków while I was a student, I heard about Dachau.</span> <span id="s210">I heard even about, uh, Buchenwald; you know, the famous camps.</span> <span id="s211">That were, you know...but we only heard, uh heard about, uh, the camps where the Hitler keeps his political enemies, you know.</span> <span id="s212">No one, never even occurred to us that this might be a place for us, too.</span> <span id="s213">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: When you got off the train, what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: When I got off, no...before...when the train stopped, I saw on one side a line of soldiers, uh, with machine guns.</span> <span id="s216">On the other side in the fenced-in area in that real camp, I saw people in striped uniform.</span> <span id="s217">They looked like, uh...uh hospital patients.</span> <span id="s218">These were those thirty Kapos who were brought from uh...they... from Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s219">They looked so innocent, you know?</span> <span id="s220">Not... they looked just like a, like a patient; but when the doors opened in the train...these are the people who, you know, attacked us with the...with clubs, with, uh....</span> <span id="s221">These was the soldiers' helpers; and we already know really, you know, we're in huge trouble from the very beginning.</span> <span id="s222">There was not time to grab the, uh, suitcases and all our belongings.</span> <span id="s223">We all just had to jump, uh, from the train; and right away, you know, uh, we are in, uh... beaten and kicked and everything.</span> <span id="s224">And this way we marched to the, uh, inside; and they right away, uh, uh...made a column of us, and were, uh...we were, uh, processed.</span> <span id="s225">That means we have to be, you know, the...the...the data, the personal data, was, uh, was written under; and then they...then they shave our heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">They gave us number.</span> <span id="s227">My number was 564.</span> <span id="s228">And, uh, immediately they started a gymnastic with us.</span> <span id="s229">There was nothing else to do; so, so they says that first an gymnastic, uh, the German call it Hüpfenrollen, all kinds of, uh, terms.</span> <span id="s230">I remember a beautiful grass around that building; but in few hours, there was no grass at all, you know.</span> <span id="s231">In the next few days, it was really uh necessary to go and find something to do other than gymnastic.</span> <span id="s232">You know, a real work, even a hard work.</span> <span id="s233">And, uh, I was assigned to a group that was going to a military compound, uh, nearby to clean uh uh the rubble which was...uh, they partially destroyed this whole building.</span> <span id="s234">And in a week or two, we moved over there to a small camp consisting of three blocks in one corner of that compound.</span> <span id="s235">And this was the beginning of the camp Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s236">Out of that, uh, area we would then go out and build first of all a kit...a prison's kitchen, and then surround the whole area--which was twenty- one, uh, brick blocks--with uh barbed wire, electrified barbed...uh, barb...barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s237">And immediately after uh after this was accomplished, this...the new transport start arriving.</span> <span id="s238">And there are transport who had come from Silesia, from Kraków, from Warsaw; and uh from other countries, too.</span> <span id="s239">And ...and uh to the end of that year, to the first winter, the camp was probably about uh, uh fifteen thousand people strong, you know.</span> <span id="s240">Immediately, Germans began uh to...uh enlarge the camp by building new blocks.</span> <span id="s241">They built another eight blocks; and uh so the...so the thirty, thirty-nine blocks was the end of the...of the whole construction in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Tell me more about what your...what a day was like in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s243">From the morning 'til night.</span> <span id="s244">What was a day like?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Well, we would get up very early, even before the sun... sunrise.</span> <span id="s246">And immediately...and eat and get a uh uh substance that was called "coffee," which was made out of the bark uh of a..</span> <span id="s247">.</span> <span id="s248">some tree, I don't know.</span> <span id="s249">I mean, it was bitter but it was black, you know.</span> <span id="s250">And it was bitter, and...that's it.</span> <span id="s251">Now if you have saved uh some bread from the day before, then you're lucky and you'll eat that uh that piece bread before going to work.</span> <span id="s252">But if not, then you just drank that coffee.</span> <span id="s253">And then immediately you were thrown out.</span> <span id="s254">Regardless of weather, you thrown out uh...outside and you'd have to stay and wait for a roll call.</span> <span id="s255">The reason being that people, uh those who are um... who are um...who are uh assigned to do the cleaning would uh clean up the rooms where we slept; and they themselves would then join us and go to work with us.</span> <span id="s256">And certain hour after, uh we would all assemble and there was a roll call.</span> <span id="s257">A roll call uh is the...it is a ceremony that the Germans never stopped uh doing.</span> <span id="s258">It was uh at certain times uh three roll calls a day; in the morning, in the uh at noon, and in the evening--and later on, too.</span> <span id="s259">But not less than two.</span> <span id="s260">And after roll call--if everything was OK, if there was nobody missing, you...you...all the dead from the night before were counted....</span> <span id="s261">And they were, have to be counted because at night the offices, German offices, were closed.</span> <span id="s262">So if anybody died, you would be counted as alive until the offices opened so he could be uh crossed out in the big book and say that he is uh...he is dead.</span> <span id="s263">So anyway this was...if everything accomplished, and uh and nobody, as I say, was missing, then you would join the groups, working groups.</span> <span id="s264">So the people would go, you know; some would go to the uh...uh to...with the wheel-barrows and uh spades, you know, to do the work on improving the roads or to the agriculture or, you know, or to the so-called "Bauhof" [Ger: "building yard"], where all the professionals were working.</span> <span id="s265">Uh, uh...all the skills like uh...uh masons and uh...and uh carpenters.</span> <span id="s266">There was a, also in Auschwitz, in that area, a group of uh sculptors from Zakopane.</span> <span id="s267">They would do this...they would, they would create the plates for SS; and, you know, the ashtrays--all kinds of things made of wood.</span> <span id="s268">So I, I even work with them for a while.</span> <span id="s269">Also there was another jobs, very important; of course, in...in uh offices.</span> <span id="s270">I work, my first work was in uh...an architect's office; and uh I was assigned to do the renderings, color renderings, of uh projects that were in...in uh...on the drawing table.</span> <span id="s271">Uh, all these drawings will then, will go with the plans to Berlin for approval.</span> <span id="s272">Everything has to be proved; approved in Berlin, or in Sachsenhausen or in Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s273">I also had a secondary responsibility uh...in that office.</span> <span id="s274">I would help the surveying team.</span> <span id="s275">From the very beginning, uh, the surveying team would go in the terrain and do a uh...work on the map.</span> <span id="s276">And they were really hurrying; the German wanted it, that map, because the uh area around Auschwitz was being depopulated, the vill...villages destroyed, people taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s277">Uh so, uh that any terrain would have to be measured...uh all the roads and all the buildings or everything, and sent; because on it, that basic map, they would do the planning what's going to be there in the future.</span> <span id="s278">On one (cough)...one area of that uh big territory there, the camp on...later on they built a huge compound "Birkenau," which is the village of Brzezinka.</span> <span id="s279">In Polish, it's called Brzezinka.</span> <span id="s280">In German, they call it "Birkenau."</span> <span id="s281">Uh, this is where later on, in 1940, would be start the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s282">So, uh, until the evening we would do all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s283">Uh, all of this outside of the camp; uh, so we would go in the extra guards.</span> <span id="s284">Extra guards--there are large garrison in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s285">Uh, they would set out some...1941, some hundred guardsmen, and they would join--few of them with every group--and go and stay the whole day.</span> <span id="s286">Again in the evening we would all return.</span> <span id="s287">And, uh...uh on the average day in Auschwitz there were always orchestra playing, and uh the people would return and form like a small parade.</span> <span id="s288">Yeah.</span> <span id="s289">With the tools in the hands that they used during the work.</span> <span id="s290">They would march to German tangos and (laughter) and uh...military songs; and this was must.</span> <span id="s291">And to attention, of course, while the commandant and all the SS would watch.</span> <span id="s292">And you have to do, uh, march very briskly, like uh...like a soldiers; because the German, they like make of us soldiers.</span> <span id="s293">Uh, to a point, yeah.</span> <span id="s294">And then of course we would assemble on the roll call place, and there would be the roll call again.</span> <span id="s295">If the roll call was successful--nobody had escaped--uh, then we would go, and we would get your our uh...our uh supper.</span> <span id="s296">If there was a situation what somebody escaped, then instead of going to the Block, we would wait.</span> <span id="s297">And, uh, meantime the search party would go out and search for, uh...for a man who has escaped; and the search party would be, uh, composed of the soldiers and the Kapos, uh, from there.</span> <span id="s298">So there would be about three hundred, four hundred people going around and looking for, uh...for an escapee.</span> <span id="s299">Usually it was not, uh...it was almost impossible to leave entirely the area of the...where, where the during the day the guards were stationed; because, uh, it is always, uh, open...that area was open...and there was no, uh, no places, no...no bushes, no trees, nothing, you know.</span> <span id="s300">So app...usually an escapee would have to know, uh, have to, uh, get the hiding somewhere in the building in that area outside of the camp, and then wait for a night to come.</span> <span id="s301">So that is why most of those who escaped, uh, usually were found.</span> <span id="s302">Now if a man was found, then he would go to a bunker for a while, true uh...uh.</span> <span id="s303">And he would be asked question: why he did it, how he did it.</span> <span id="s304">Gestapo were interested in that.</span> <span id="s305">And then on the next day or day after, he, uh...he would be paraded through camp; and then, uh, on the, uh, roll call, uh, ceremony he would be hang on the gallows.</span> <span id="s306">And this was a regular punishment.</span> <span id="s307">If a..</span> <span id="s308">.</span> <span id="s309">if this was not the case, then we would go just simply to the blocks and get our soup and bread and margarine, whatever.</span> <span id="s310">And it was all kinds of, uh, uh...and this diet was, uh, usually a watered soup and a slice of bread, and a little bit of of margarine.</span> <span id="s311">That's it.</span> <span id="s312">And then after that, uh, there was about one hour of daylight; so in this time you would have to repair your uniform, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Under the supervision of Blockältester, who was the...the manager of the Block.</span> <span id="s314">And what is the Block?</span> <span id="s315">Block was a, uh, a number of people who lived on...in...on one floor.</span> <span id="s316">Blocks, uh, buildings, were two-story buildings; and that means in every building, uh, would be two blocks, uh...because there were two different floors.</span> <span id="s317">Sometimes even on, uh, in, uh, on attic they would form another Block.</span> <span id="s318">And generally was not more...not enough room more for some hundred and fifty men.</span> <span id="s319">But I remember times when there were up to one thousand people in every Block.</span> <span id="s320">So in one bed, we would sleep six of us.</span> <span id="s321">So there was actu...actually no sleep; we were just sitting, you know, the whole night.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: When did things begin to change in Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s323">When did you get the museum in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: The museum in Auschwitz, uh, was in, uh, in 1941 established.</span> <span id="s325">The idea was, uh, uh, came from the, uh, comman...the camp manager.</span> <span id="s326">His name is, uh, Fritzch, Commandant Fritzch.He created two things.</span> <span id="s327">Museum and the orchestra, symphony orchestra.</span> <span id="s328">Uh, symphony orchestra was, uh...uh, very large.</span> <span id="s329">It was opera...uh, run professionally.</span> <span id="s330">It was so good that they would, uh, allow her to go to the neighboring town and have a concert, for Germans, in Katowice, in...in Bytom, even in...in...in Wroc_aw [Ger: Breslau].</span> <span id="s331">Now, museum was beginning, uh, from, started from small beginnings that Franz Targosz was the manager of that.And his, uh, function was to go and look, and...and, uh, confiscate a more interesting items that the people used to bring when they come to camp; so in museum were things like, uh, national flags, uh, military, uh...uh, orders.</span> <span id="s332">You know, there were Jewi...Jewish bibles.</span> <span id="s333">There were, uh, there were, uh, folklore uniforms, all kinds of, uh, maps, all...this kind of things, you know.</span> <span id="s334">And there were...now, the reason why the German, uh, allowed this--uh, and they even, the German even allow a big area for that at certain point.</span> <span id="s335">Why?</span> <span id="s336">Because they were always expecting a International Red 1 SS Hauptsturmführer Karl Fritzch, deputy to Rudolph Höss at KL Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s337">Transferred to KL Flössenburg in January 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">2 Franciszek Targosz, prisoner no. 7626, persuaded the SS to set up the Museum and organized a Kommando of painters, sculptors, jewelers and watchmakers for that purpose.</span> <span id="s339">See Garli_ski, Fighting Auschwitz, pp. 89-90.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Cross, uh, visit.</span> <span id="s341">So if this would occur, then they would have a, uh, opportunity to tell, "Look, and...you know, the prisoners here are uh doing alright, you know.</span> <span id="s342">They are living, they are...you know, they are having even a museum!"</span> <span id="s343">And things of that sort.</span> <span id="s344">In the museum there were, uh, several people working--or employed--were, you know, to send, that, uh, were sportsmen.</span> <span id="s345">I, I mentioned before [Czerk (ph)].</span> <span id="s346">He was one of the...of the steady people working there.</span> <span id="s347">He was painting on glass.</span> <span id="s348">There were two Jew, Jewish fellows who were translating with the bible.</span> <span id="s349">It was also Fritzch's idea.</span> <span id="s350">He wanted to have a bible, uh, translated from, uh, Hebrew to German; so there was a, uh, uh, older man.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Uh, he was a rabbi.</span> <span id="s352">And he knew the bible, and he was translating into Polish.</span> <span id="s353">And there was another, uh, friend of his who translated it from Polish to German.</span> <span id="s354">Now in four years, I understand they translated two pages.</span> <span id="s355">(Laughter) And they both survived, because the Germans just simply have forgotten about them.</span> <span id="s356">This is something that happens very often in, in, in the big camp--that, you know, once you establish yourself then they will forget about you.</span> <span id="s357">And then you are on your own.</span> <span id="s358">It is up to you, to survive.</span> <span id="s359">That means you have, you have a..</span> <span id="s360">.</span> <span id="s361">you, you learn the...you learn the tricks how to not be beaten, how to, uh, stay in hiding if it's necessary.</span> <span id="s362">And, of course, there was always a time, uh, an opportunity, to get an extra food, too.</span> <span id="s363">And this was also important.</span> <span id="s364">So those two fellows, you know, survived.</span> <span id="s365">You know, with all this Holocaust, they...nobody bothered them.</span> <span id="s366">And of...and it goes for other people, too.</span> <span id="s367">Those who are chosen when the transport came, and they were chosen to go as prisoners--I mean to be uniformed as prisoners and go to for work...they usually, uh, survived, most of them, you know.</span> <span id="s368">Unless they were either, you know, run into the trouble, uh, with the...with the Kapos, with, uh, Blockältesters, or they got sick.</span> <span id="s369">A lot of people, uh, died in Auschwitz, unfortunately; because of the, uh, uh...like uh...there was a typhus, you know?</span> <span id="s370">The typhus killed thousands of thousands of people.</span> <span id="s371">Another way to die in Auschwitz was to go and be executed, you know.</span> <span id="s372">The Gestapo always uh, you know, was the final judge and, uh, on the fate of a man.</span> <span id="s373">And they would...and they sometimes wait a long time before they, uh, would, uh, send a man for execution.</span> <span id="s374">Sometimes I know people who, some who survived two years in camp; and then they were executed.</span> <span id="s375">Uh, and they were never told for what-- for why, yeah.</span> <span id="s376">The execution was taking place in Block 11, uh, on the courtyard between Block 12 and Block 11, and that execution wall still standing in Auschwitz today.</span> <span id="s377">And uh...at the beginning, uh, execution was performed by a platoon of soldiers, uh, with, uh, with rifles; and it was very noisy.</span> <span id="s378">People in Auschwitz knew about it, that something's going on in in the camp; uh, because there was that salvo.</span> <span id="s379">So later on the Germans changed the whole, uh, occurrence.</span> <span id="s380">They would, uh...they would use a silencer; and one man would execute a, uh... the prisoners by pointing to the neck, you know.</span> <span id="s381">And, uh, I remember, uh, I know the man who was executioner.</span> <span id="s382">He was, uh, a top sergeant.</span> <span id="s383">Uh, his name was, uh, Palitzsch.He was a twenty-nine year old man.</span> <span id="s384">He had a family and four children.</span> <span id="s385">But at the end, he fell in love with Jewish woman; and he was sent, uh, to the 3 SS Hauptscharführer Gerhard Arno Max Palitzsch.</span> <span id="s386">Employed as Rapportführer in KL Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">concentration camp and to the east front.Nobody knows what's happened to him.</span> <span id="s388">But these men, these men had certain...in 1942, executed in one afternoon three hundred people.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did you see it, and can you tell us about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I didn't see the...the action; but I saw the corpses being driven on the big wagon and the...with the blood running to the street, as they were uh...uh...on their way to crematorium.</span> <span id="s391">This we saw, all...all of us, because you know, we were waiting for a roll call at that time when they were going right through, to the main gate, you know.</span> <span id="s392">Yeah.</span> <span id="s393">Now, uh, this three hundred people, this was a transport that was arrested in 1942 in a restaurant in Kraków.</span> <span id="s394">Uh, mostly artists and actors and uh...and uh, teachers (cough); and they were brought, uh, to O_wi_cim, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s395">And they, uh, were assigned the works; but only they work about two weeks, and they were all called up--their numbers called up--on the roll call, and, uh, assembled in, uh, Block 11 and shot, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You survived.</span> <span id="s397">One of the ways you survived was by contact through the Museum.</span> <span id="s398">Can you tell us what you did, and how you did things in the museum--what your contact was?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: I, uh...no, well I really can...uh, my contacts were actually uh with the surveying team-- earlier, you know.</span> <span id="s400">Museum is something that you do in your spare time.</span> <span id="s401">Uh, I was always working.</span> <span id="s402">I really never worked in the Museum as such; but I did lot of work over there and a lot of paintings that are still there, because it was a meeting place uh for many artists.</span> <span id="s403">There were about five hundred artists that I know in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s404">So uh many of them...there was even a hard place, a hard time to get a place to stand in the Museum and do some work.</span> <span id="s405">But, uh, the contact with the civilian were done uh...uh, when the...we would go, allowed to go and out to Auschwitz as a surveying team.</span> <span id="s406">Because automatically we had to have a contact with people, because we were going into the areas which was uh in process of depopulation and there were always few people still left uh wait...waiting to be transported somewhere.</span> <span id="s407">So that is how all the contacts grew up with the families and underground.</span> <span id="s408">And, uh, as you...when we were about to escape we had a very good contact with underground.</span> <span id="s409">And there was a plan drawn how; and where this will occur and in what time, on what day, and who's going to be waiting.</span> <span id="s410">And it worked the same way as was planned, after many months of uh missed opportunities and, you know, in uh disappointments; because you...you...you never are sure, you know, if you really succeeded.</span> <span id="s411">But uh....</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Tell us how you...how did you plan it, and who did you plan the escape with?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: I was planning with another man whose uh name is on that picture, Kuczbara [NB: identified on the photograph as "Bolos_aw Kuczbara"].</span> <span id="s414">Sometime, some day, as we were 4 See Garli_ski, Fighting Auschwitz, pp. 285-287.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">walking--at that time I was working in a different uh job.</span> <span id="s416">I was uh in "Arbeitseinsatz" [NB: "Special Work"], which is uh a uh labor relation office.</span> <span id="s417">And uh as we were wal...returning to the office one day, we just talked about it; and we found out that each one of us is...has a false name.</span> <span id="s418">And uh...and we came to the idea that this is a a good...that is a..</span> <span id="s419">.</span> <span id="s420">the next step would be...uh, should be an escape.</span> <span id="s421">And, of course, he told me that he's a Polish general's son, and that he goes to the certain areas in the camp and listens to the radio.</span> <span id="s422">Yeah.</span> <span id="s423">He has a communication with it....</span> <span id="s424">I don't know if this is uh true, because he was this kind of a fellow who imagined a lot of things; but anyway he was always very active.</span> <span id="s425">So, we had in our office a uh a sergeant, German sergeant--uh, blinded on one eye--older man, who was a teacher before; and he was the manager of that office.</span> <span id="s426">He was...he had a apparently large family, and he was always in the need of money.</span> <span id="s427">He was worrying so much about that uh family of his, so that Kuczbara-- who...you know, who knew almost everybody, uh...especially in in uh...in the area of...in the hospital area....</span> <span id="s428">Because he also was a dentist--although he told me he never was a dentist--but he was pulling the teeth in...he, he he was acting as a dentist in...in the camp.</span> <span id="s429">So he knew a lot of people there.</span> <span id="s430">And, see...so, uh, that...that German uh asked him for money, and he want us bring several hundred dollars...uh, marks, German marks.</span> <span id="s431">But there was this...there was a prob... there was a stipulation that we would have to go to Auschwitz to get this money; because it is our family that will bring that money, you know, and hide in certain area near...near town.</span> <span id="s432">And if we go there and we find money, he'll get it.</span> <span id="s433">Now this was a plan of escape.</span> <span id="s434">We were supposed to escape from that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">He'll get that money; but we will, we will escape.</span> <span id="s436">And there was a idea that uh we will give him something to drink.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Give who something to drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: A whiskey with a uh with uh...with sleeping pills in it.</span> <span id="s439">Or something.</span> <span id="s440">But what's happened: he didn't drink.</span> <span id="s441">He was not drinker, you know.</span> <span id="s442">This was one of uh thousands of soldiers who didn't use any (laughter)....</span> <span id="s443">So it, it didn't work, you know?</span> <span id="s444">We have to come back.</span> <span id="s445">There were several other ways we tried to escape.</span> <span id="s446">Never work.</span> <span id="s447">And finally we came on idea that we will never do it unless one will uh be dressed as a soldier.</span> <span id="s448">And we started organize a German uniforms.</span> <span id="s449">This took, took months.</span> <span id="s450">And uh...uh I, my job was to furnish...to give him all the documents the sol...the German soldiers uh usually carried in the wallet.</span> <span id="s451">And, uh of course, the main thing was to...to make that main, most important uh document where he needs a photograph.</span> <span id="s452">So, again, Kuczbara uh found...uh found...in his, in his bag on his arrival he apparently brought, you know, some pictures of his.</span> <span id="s453">See he went there and he found that uh, that one picture.</span> <span id="s454">He gave it to me.</span> <span id="s455">I painted a uniform on that pictures.</span> <span id="s456">We sent out then later on that photograph to the underground in Auschwitz, and they made a copy out of that.</span> <span id="s457">And the copy came back, and here was Kuczbara in the SS uniform.</span> <span id="s458">(Laughter) Yeah!</span> <span id="s459">So we used this uh...that photograph on that document; and uh, of course, other documents--that was, everything that a soldier should have in his wallet, he [NB: Kuczbara] had.</span> <span id="s460">Now there was a question of a revolver.</span> <span id="s461">Now, the revolver uh...we took from the office uh where we worked, because we saw a sol...a SS man locking a revolver in the drawer while uh on the weekend he was going to the Catholics.</span> <span id="s462">So uh we broke into that uh...table and took the revolver.</span> <span id="s463">So we had a revolver.</span> <span id="s464">Now, two other people joined us.</span> <span id="s465">Uh number two, who is that Küssel; and...and uh Januszewzki, who was also at "Arbeitsdienst."</span> <span id="s466">And these, we...people, we took because they were...they had a way of uh organizing almost anything in the camp.</span> <span id="s467">So what happened: Küssel went to a SS man in agriculture, and uh uh tried to uh loan from him a wagon and two horses.</span> <span id="s468">And for these, he offered him the...uh two...uh some furniture....</span> <span id="s469">I, I forgot, you know, what it was.</span> <span id="s470">Anyway, uh the uh SS needed something for furnishing his office.</span> <span id="s471">And, of course, if he would go, you know, straight away through a sign...through a signing the papers and the...and ordering this--you know, in official way--would take a month, you know.</span> <span id="s472">But here he come, he got in uh contact with the prisoner, and prisoner could do this immediately; because in everywhere in all these places...uh warehouses, there were always prisoners who worked.</span> <span id="s473">So this way we got the uniform; because, you know, it was the prisoners who work over there, too.</span> <span id="s474">And you know, you give prisoner uh some margarine or, you know, you do him a favor.</span> <span id="s475">And uh we were very important agency, because we could uh gave a man a good job uh for this, for...for...for uh giving that, you know.</span> <span id="s476">We would, you know, have another favor from, from other people....</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: At this point I need to stop.</span> <span id="s478">We need to change tapes... A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: ...and then we will come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s481">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s483">Uh, John, tell us now...you had uh, you're in the middle of planning for this escape... A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s485">You had uh arranged for the uniform?</span> <span id="s486">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s488">What happened then?</span> <span id="s489">If you could just repeat, you know, after the uniform?</span> <span id="s490">A: Well, we waited for a word from the outside people where, when the escape will occur.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">When, and what time.</span> <span id="s492">And uh we were given four days.</span> <span id="s493">We couldn't go...there was a plan for four days.</span> <span id="s494">Uh, we couldn't go in the first day because first day was a Christmas.</span> <span id="s495">The second day was a very bad weather after Christmas.</span> <span id="s496">So at the end, it was on 29 of December that in the morning we decided that we're going to go.</span> <span id="s497">And it happened this way: I went uh...Kuczbara and myself, we went to the office on usual schedule; and then went out of the office with the papers to, into...into the area where uh the people, usually new people, usually used to come and wait, you know, to...for, uh uh... in...interrogation, you know.</span> <span id="s498">That was our job.</span> <span id="s499">Two other people--uh Otto [Küssel] and uh Januszewzki-- they were uh the "Arbeitsdienst"; they had to uh send out all the columns out of the camp.</span> <span id="s500">And then they would come to our office and have to write a uh a report.</span> <span id="s501">Every morning.</span> <span id="s502">This I have to emphasize, how...how this uh uh the pro...procedure in, in our office were.</span> <span id="s503">Every morning, they had to write a report on how the employment of the whole camp looks like--where, how many they were uh... there were people employed in what categories of jobs, how many there are sick, and so forth.</span> <span id="s504">Now these reports written on a special typewriter, big one; was then be taken by a messenger--a soldier--who traveled to Oranienburg every day.</span> <span id="s505">Oranienburg was a uh headquarters of the labor, of all the labor assignments in the...in, in the...in the camps in the whole Germany.</span> <span id="s506">And uh on that particular day, 29 of December, they had to do that in order to be free.</span> <span id="s507">After that they could do whatever they wanted because, you know, they were not [Czerk (ph)].</span> <span id="s508">You know, they would uh they would visit uh various uh working groups in the field, or in the uh uh area inside the camp.</span> <span id="s509">So Otto went to that SS man, who...uh and he got from him a pair of horses and a wagon; and drove this, this uh vehicle through the camp, through a main gate, to Block 24 where we all lived.</span> <span id="s510">And he grabbed four or five prisoners who were wandering in the camp, and made them go into the attic; and from the attic they brought down four uh cabin[et]s, wooden cabin[et]s.</span> <span id="s511">They loaded it on the, on that vehicle--which was a platform--and he drove out of the camp again, went to that SS man he was dealing with, gave him two cabin[et]s for...for just uh making that deal; and with two uh... two cabi...cabinets on that wagon uh he would uh ride to a place where, in between, Kuczbara would dress into the uniform, SS uniform.</span> <span id="s512">Uh, and...and I was with him; and we were waiting for ...for those two to come.</span> <span id="s513">We took from our office about sixteen thousand names, files uh of people, uh of transports.</span> <span id="s514">Some transports were completely annihilated.</span> <span id="s515">You know, we took this as a..</span> <span id="s516">.</span> <span id="s517">as a sample what is going on in our...in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s518">Also, we took a list of uh people who were executed in uh...in Auschwitz--on the Block 11--with the signature of the, the top uh doctor, SS doctor.</span> <span id="s519">Uh, he had to countersign them, you know.</span> <span id="s520">So we had, you know, some twenty-four thousands of names that we took with us in our briefcases.</span> <span id="s521">And when the Otto and Januszewzki arrived with that wagon, we jumped on and we uh drove off to the main gate, again.</span> <span id="s522">And at 11 o'clock, uh we drove through the gate.</span> <span id="s523">The soldier opened the barrier.</span> <span id="s524">Uh Kuczbara told him, "Heil, Hitler!"</span> <span id="s525">And that's it, and this was the end.</span> <span id="s526">(Laughter) Because we were posing as a working group.</span> <span id="s527">We had a..</span> <span id="s528">.</span> <span id="s529">these uh cabinets.</span> <span id="s530">This was supposed to mean that we are, you know, delivering a furniture to a SS house somewhere in the area.</span> <span id="s531">So nobody bothers us.</span> <span id="s532">(Laughter) That's the way!</span> <span id="s533">And then we drove through on the road around the...near the uh Sola River, through Auschwitz to the village of [Brzeszkowice (ph)].</span> <span id="s534">The village [Brzeszkowice (ph)] was already empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">People were already thrown out.</span> <span id="s536">There were still buildings; and in those buildings the underground put in, you know, our...the, the civilian clothes for us.</span> <span id="s537">We changed.</span> <span id="s538">We... we uh...drove that uh vehicle into a..</span> <span id="s539">.</span> <span id="s540">into a alley under the roof.</span> <span id="s541">Horses to the...also.</span> <span id="s542">We take care of that.</span> <span id="s543">You know, all the documents were thrown to the well, uh deep well; and some stones thrown on the top of it.</span> <span id="s544">And then we went on that attic, the uh dress in the civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s545">And went outside and to the bridge on uh the River Vistula [NB: Wis_a (Pol)].</span> <span id="s546">That [Brzeszkowice (ph)], this is a triangle made of two ri...rivers, Vistula and Sola.</span> <span id="s547">It is isolated place.</span> <span id="s548">This is why we chose that place.</span> <span id="s549">We know not many people around; and on that bridge, uh Sola/Vistula bridge, there were four men waiting for us who had the bikes.</span> <span id="s550">Each one of them took one of us, you know; and then we had walked to the second village uh Libi_z, where we stayed for a week.</span> <span id="s551">Now the man...yeah, the man who, who was uh managing this whole uh project was a village manager of the the village Libi_z.</span> <span id="s552">And he had Germans living in his house.</span> <span id="s553">(Laughter) So uh this was also a very safe place this way, because it was no suspicion that it might be some... some, uh, strange people living in that area, you know.</span> <span id="s554">So, uh, we got contact with the, uh, underground.</span> <span id="s555">They came.</span> <span id="s556">They make a photographs of us, you know.</span> <span id="s557">They, uh, promise us to send us the, the German Ausweis, this documents; you know, personal documents.</span> <span id="s558">They took all the names of all those--you know, the killed people--in Auschwitz, and, uh, make some photographs, and that's it.</span> <span id="s559">And they left.</span> <span id="s560">The next thing what we did, was that we all at night crossed the border from that village for the next village not far from...from Libi_z, to Generalgouvernement.</span> <span id="s561">Generalgouvernement was a section of Poland that German considered Poland, but it was surrounded by the Germans and the governor was famous, uh...uh, Governor Frank.</span> <span id="s562">And, uh, when we, uh, crossed that border at night, two of the, uh, the men immediately boarded a train and went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s563">Two of us, you know, walked to the next village; uh, and we were prepared to hiding over there.</span> <span id="s564">We waited for about one week, until two ladies came from Warsaw with the documents for us.</span> <span id="s565">And we boarded train again from that village to Kraków, in order to take a night train to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s566">I was supposed to get a studio in Warsaw, a hiding...a, a place where the the people from the underground would meet, you know.</span> <span id="s567">An camouflage thing.</span> <span id="s568">And, uh, we made it all right to Kraków from the place Brzeszkowice; and as we were waiting in train, uh, to depart, the whole train had been uh was surrounded by the German tanks and the Gestapo went into the cars and arrested everybody.</span> <span id="s569">Took everybody.</span> <span id="s570">Men, children, women--everybody-- including the two of us, not knowing whom they have.</span> <span id="s571">So, uh, uh ...when we were arrested, we...we uh decided that we're going to have to...again try to escape again; because it was only three weeks after a escape and everybody would know now, uh recognize us in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s572">And we knew that this transport will go for sure to O_wi_cim.</span> <span id="s573">So, uh, at the, at the moment of, uh, transition from the truck to the, uh, gate in Prison Montelupich,I escape again.</span> <span id="s574">I threw out two of the soldiers and I start running, but the...Mietek,I don't know.</span> <span id="s575">He didn't do it, you know.</span> <span id="s576">So because we had it planned that we will, you know, go one in, uh, one direction and another one in other direction, and sort of a ....</span> <span id="s577">But, you know, he didn't do it.</span> <span id="s578">And they all, those soldiers, about forty of them maybe, you know, they, uh, start chasing me.</span> <span id="s579">They, they sho...uh, fire uh...shots were fired, you know.</span> <span id="s580">One hit me in the ankle, and that's it.</span> <span id="s581">I couldn't run anymore, and they captured me.</span> <span id="s582">And immediately they almost, they wanted to execute me right there, right on the street, you know?</span> <span id="s583">And I, uh, remembered that moment.</span> <span id="s584">I will never remem...uh, forget it to the end of my life.</span> <span id="s585">In the split of second, I was able to to see my whole life, all...I, I..</span> <span id="s586">.</span> <span id="s587">in that split of second, I converse with my family; with my sister, my my parents, uh friends.</span> <span id="s588">And then I was ready to die; and I even have uh enough time to wonder how I'm going to be uh looking on that snow, you know, after uh...after uh uh...dead, dead person.</span> <span id="s589">Yeah.</span> <span id="s590">But uh eventually, they uh...they did not do that; uh because it was a public place and I heard them uh talking among themselves that they going to do it on the...on the coal.</span> <span id="s591">There was a heap of coal uh right in the courtyard of the prison, and they usually execute people over there.</span> <span id="s592">But as we were walking toward that uh prison, uh the Germans were very nasty and somebody hit me with a with a revolver here in the head; cut my head, and this blood was start running.</span> <span id="s593">And I came inside that prison in such a bad shape, all bloody and so forth, that they didn't know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s594">So they sent me to a ambulatorium to stop the blood; and this is how I escape, because they forgot about me again.</span> <span id="s595">(Laughter) And uh the transport... Anyway, Januszewzki, the next morning, in the morn...went back to Auschwitz; and as I say, said, you know, Januszewzki had that big knife.</span> <span id="s596">Uh, he probably committed suicide, uh because he never arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s597">And I uh was sick for a few days, sick...and they and they used to come, you know; they would come, the soldiers, and they were very angry.</span> <span id="s598">And they would, you know, threaten me with all kinds of consequences; but at the end they were, they were proud of me, that I dared to escape.</span> <span id="s599">And we start talking, and they found out that I am an artist.</span> <span id="s600">In two days, they brought, you know, all the uh paints and uh material; and I start painting portraits.</span> <span id="s601">(Laughter) And uh it came to the point that they, there was one SS officer who wanted to release me.</span> <span id="s602">And he uh started an investigation into who I am, and so on.</span> <span id="s603">And, and here comes a uh uh...and...here the whole blame, you know, comes to... to that...to that bad document I..</span> <span id="s604">.</span> <span id="s605">I received from the 5 Montelupich, also known as Montelupi, was a prison located in Kraków.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">6 Nickname for Januszewzki, whose first name was Mieczysaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">underground, because they uh...they sent me something.</span> <span id="s608">They told me that I am living in Warsaw and...and on certain street.</span> <span id="s609">This street was non-existent.</span> <span id="s610">Everything was...was uh fake, and... instead to be released, I fell into such a suspicion that then lasted several years.</span> <span id="s611">That I wound up with beating and everything; and uh...and this is why they send me to those uh other camps uh later on, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s613">Stay where we are.</span> <span id="s614">Stay where--you are now in the prison.</span> <span id="s615">They had discovered the false papers...</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: The false papers, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s618">Where were you sent from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: From there I was sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s620">I came to Auschwitz, and again I was recognized immediately on the gate.</span> <span id="s621">But it was my friend who recognized me, and he ran to...to other people in the uh area in museum, in museum.</span> <span id="s622">And uh he told them who...that I returned, so they started to do something uh...uh to save me.</span> <span id="s623">So first of all, what they accomplished--they uh...they accomplished this: as they, that the whole, that the transport I came with was sent not...it was not uh processed in Auschwitz, but in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s624">And then sent me to Birkenau to a quarantine camp, where there's absolutely nobody knew me.</span> <span id="s625">And I stayed there for about two weeks; and from there I went to Buchenwald, on the transport.</span> <span id="s626">The transport was by train, uh and it lasted about three days.</span> <span id="s627">And uh then we uh uh it was, the situation in that...I mean, that uh whole transport was so dirty, uh so miserable that, you know, I got sick, got that eczema on my face and in the head.</span> <span id="s628">And the first thing what happened to me in uh Buchenwald: I got sick and I went to hospital, but again this eczema was so terrifying that the doctor, German doctor, got interested in.</span> <span id="s629">And I was under the personal care of the main doctor in, in uh...in Buchenwald; uh because he medically was so much interested in that case.</span> <span id="s630">And when...and, of course, it took about uh two months before I got out of that hospital; and when I did, there was a traveling paper for me waited waiting already in the office.</span> <span id="s631">I am supposed to go back to Kraków.</span> <span id="s632">But they didn't tell me that that I am going to Kraków; but I was transferred from one prison to another, some sixteen prisons on the way from Buchenwald to Kraków.</span> <span id="s633">And when I came to Kraków again, something uh encouraging happened for me.</span> <span id="s634">There was a uh uh uh...the...I mean, the access to the whole, to the prison, was uh was uh staffed by...I mean, uh there was a..</span> <span id="s635">.</span> <span id="s636">there were epidemic in...in prison.</span> <span id="s637">I, I forgot now what kind of epidemic; but anyway, the the SS did not come for some time.</span> <span id="s638">So I had a time to uh...to stay and, you know, think about my case; and in between I became a chef of the kitchen.</span> <span id="s639">(Laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: They, they...dur...during all of this, they never knew that you had escaped from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: They never....</span> <span id="s642">See, this was my point.</span> <span id="s643">Always do all kinds of things, create all kinds of lies; never tell them the truth that I ever was in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s644">Yeah.</span> <span id="s645">And this was to the very end.</span> <span id="s646">This is why my case was so complicated to the very end; because, you know, I never knew what was going to happen next.</span> <span id="s647">And, you know, they try all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s648">I remember when I was in that prison, once, uh, in the morning, you know, the...the keys turn in the lock, you know.</span> <span id="s649">The SS man, the officer, uh, walks in and he has my document, uh, uh...that they, uh, took away previously; and there I am there on that photograph with short hair.</span> <span id="s650">He say, "Why you have a short hair?"</span> <span id="s651">And I say, "Because I had a louse."</span> <span id="s652">(Laughter) So he stopped, you know.</span> <span id="s653">You had to have a good answer, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So you were taken to Buchenwald...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I was taken to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s656">I was released from Buchenwald, went back to Kraków.</span> <span id="s657">And now there is a Russian front coming in.</span> <span id="s658">See, the Russians, uh, came and they, uh, occupied...they, they, uh, were engaged in fighting Germans on the Oder River.</span> <span id="s659">This is in Silesia.</span> <span id="s660">Uh, meanwhile...I forgot that in the meantime I was, uh, transferred to, to Groß Rosen, you know, from, from, uh...from, uh, prison, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: So you went from prison to Buchenwald... A: To prison...</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: ...back to prison...</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: ...and then to Groß Rosen.</span> <span id="s664">Because of the situation on the front, they have to evacuate Montelupich; and they send me not to Auschwitz anymore--because Auschwitz was in danger--but to Groß Rosen.</span> <span id="s665">And this where the...I, uh...why I again, you know, got a good job in that, uh, office, uh, uh...for the labor relation, where I could see how they, uh, uh, sent out people to another camps to, uh...how they sell them to the private contractors.</span> <span id="s666">Uh, in, in Gross Rosen, this was a ceremony, you know.</span> <span id="s667">The owner would come to camp, and he would personally pick up the people and touch the muscles and, uh, uh...and, uh, after he was satisfied, then they would go, uh, to various places.</span> <span id="s668">Mostly it was the factories.</span> <span id="s669">Mostly it was a, uh, factories that, uh... that work on, in...in defense, you know.</span> <span id="s670">There were two factories uh that belonged to our, to Groß Rosen, that produced the poisonous gases--Dyhernfurt.There were, uh, factories in, uh...in Wroc_aw [Ger: Breslau], producing, uh, parts to the tanks and so forth.</span> <span id="s671">You know, very important industries, you know, uh, uh...defense industries.</span> <span id="s672">So people were, uh...those who had any profession, a good profession, uh, they would be treated very well.</span> <span id="s673">They would be paid the same, uh...the same wages as the German workers.</span> <span id="s674">This I have to add: that in Germany, in all the camps, also in Auschwitz, uh, people were on paper always paid.</span> <span id="s675">They always were paid wages.</span> <span id="s676">And our office consisted of two parts.</span> <span id="s677">One part was, 7 NB: Dyhernfurt I, one of two subcamps by this name, operated as Anorgana GmbH, a subsidiary of I. G. Farben.</span> <span id="s678">Location: Prussia/Lower Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">uh...dealing with assigning people to work.</span> <span id="s680">Another part was, were people who are counting the profits; and all those profits, from every day of work the prisoners earned, would be then transferred to the treasury of the SS.</span> <span id="s681">Now the same thing happened in Groß Rosen; only, uh, it was, you know, a more, uh, smoother operation and bigger one.</span> <span id="s682">Because, as I mentioned before, we had eighty-five camps.</span> <span id="s683">Some camps were five times bigger than the Groß Rosen itself.</span> <span id="s684">Another, uh, job that was...that the people from Groß Rosen would perform is a, uh...uh, is, uh...dig the, dig the stones in the ...and there were a lot of...how do you call that?</span> <span id="s685">I forgot the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Quarry?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Quarry, yeah.</span> <span id="s688">Yeah.</span> <span id="s689">There was a hugh quarry in Auschwitz, and they were, uh, producing the monuments to the cemeteries, you know.</span> <span id="s690">The people were working, too; and there was another, uh, the big job was assigned building the blocks, barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Because...because of this, uh, situation on fronts, the Auschwitz was being already in process of evacuation.</span> <span id="s692">We were expecting lot, lot of newcomers to come in; and they really come.</span> <span id="s693">Thousands of them, at the winding days of the history of the...of Groß Rosen.</span> <span id="s694">And, of course, we ourselves later on would all go and be evacuated; and some went on foot--mostly perished those who went on foot--and I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s695">I got a, uh...I went to a next camp, which is Hersbruck, in train...</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Can we hold that for one minute?</span> <span id="s697">I want to stay with Groß Rosen for one minute.</span> <span id="s698">Uh, did you do any painting in Groß Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s700">Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s701">I was...this is always...that, uh, play a very important role, uh, in protecting my life.</span> <span id="s702">I was always able to utilize this, uh, for some, someway.</span> <span id="s703">So I painted landscape mostly, and portraits; and, of course, by working in that, uh, office, I was, uh, assigned to a map that was hanging--huge, uh, war map--hanging in the commandant's office.</span> <span id="s704">And on it, I had to, uh, write in gothic, uh, characters all the data concerning that particular camp, and all the camps, you know.</span> <span id="s705">So to the very end I had to do it, even when...when we all were already locked up in the camp.</span> <span id="s706">There was no work.</span> <span id="s707">They still were calling my name.</span> <span id="s708">I would have to go to the commandant's office and change that map on a given day.</span> <span id="s709">Therefore, I knew completely everything what is going on, all the secrets.</span> <span id="s710">Uh, how the front, where the front is, how many people they...they have lost from that, from that crew of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s711">And which camp was taken over, which camp was lost, and so forth.</span> <span id="s712">So uh...and later on, I fig...I discovered that...that this was a very dangerous job that I was doing; because usually people who knew so much they would eliminate, too.</span> <span id="s713">I even didn't realize...uh, realize at that moment that I..</span> <span id="s714">.</span> <span id="s715">I would be on that list, but I probably was on that list.</span> <span id="s716">Only through a very lucky circumstances I got mixed up with new, uh, crowd somewhere in, uh, along the way, and that is why I survived.</span> <span id="s717">I also mentioned, uh, that story, that part about Groß Rosen, about being in camp with all the soccer teams.</span> <span id="s718">There were fourteen soccer teams, all uniformed.</span> <span id="s719">And they would all play on Sunday, a games from the six o'clock in the morning to...to the end of the day.</span> <span id="s720">And, uh, the beginning of it would be a parade, which would....</span> <span id="s721">I mean, the commandant would stay and ...and, you know, accept the parade.</span> <span id="s722">First was always a, a, uh, band walking in the front.</span> <span id="s723">Then would be some comics, you know...we had some comics, you know, entertainers.</span> <span id="s724">(Laughter) Yeah.</span> <span id="s725">In every camp entertainers had, you know, a chance to survive, you know?</span> <span id="s726">Uh, sportsmen, boxers, uh, soccer players, of course, you know.</span> <span id="s727">So then later on, all those teams would be marching; and two first teams would start playing, and they...when they finish, there will be another.</span> <span id="s728">And it was for championship, you know.</span> <span id="s729">But Groß Rosen was all...not always only soccer, because in Groß Rosen I saw hang peo...uh, six people hung [hanged] on one gallow and I saw a lot of people being hanged for committing a sort of sabotage.</span> <span id="s730">When we...yeah.</span> <span id="s731">And also on ...in Groß Rosen--before the evacuation, all the sick people in the hospital was, uh, put aside; and later on they were all eliminated, because they didn't want to take, uh...to the evacuation, uh, program include all those sick people.</span> <span id="s732">So it was a, a, uh, a very murderous game too, you know, although it looks so nice, uh, uh...on the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Is there anything else you want to add about Groß Rosen before we move on?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Well I could add only this: that the Germans, uh, ordered the whole camp be burned.</span> <span id="s735">As soon as we left the camp, the group of Kapos that, uh, remained, you know, put fire to all the blocks.</span> <span id="s736">All the blocks were wooden barracks.</span> <span id="s737">So today nothing left; only foundation and only the building--uh, one brick building, the entrance to the camp--which is still standing.</span> <span id="s738">Everything else was completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s739">There is absolutely no proof that there was a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Tell us what happened to you.</span> <span id="s741">Where did you go?</span> <span id="s742">Where were you taken when you left Groß Rosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I was, uh, taken by train to the next...to the...to the camp of Hersbruck.</span> <span id="s744">Hersbruck was a sub-camp of the big camp of Flossenbürg.</span> <span id="s745">And, uh, again, in, uh...I landed in, uh...in office over there.</span> <span id="s746">I had al..</span> <span id="s747">.</span> <span id="s748">yeah...I had the same; and this...this job, uh, I knew, you know.</span> <span id="s749">They always appreciate people who know, are familiar on the job, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Germans are very practical people.</span> <span id="s751">They might be very cruel, and they might...but you know, they are practical; and for, uh, for, uh, for this practical purpose they would use that man to, you know, to the very end.</span> <span id="s752">Uh, I was, uh, getting a good job.</span> <span id="s753">As I watched what the other doing, the whole transport that came from...from, uh, Groß Rosen were, uh, detailed to the work in the underground factory, uh, in the hills around Hersbruck; and to clearing the station, uh, of Nuremberg [Ger: Nürnberg] after the, uh, air raids.</span> <span id="s754">So, uh, part went here and part went there.</span> <span id="s755">And of course, you know, this was a murderous, uh, uh, assignment.</span> <span id="s756">There were a lot of people who died because, uh, the situation, the living conditions was at that time already disintegrating.</span> <span id="s757">The...so, was so primitive that, uh, even the strongest people have a hard time to survive.</span> <span id="s758">I would, I would not dwell more on that, uh...on Hersbruck.</span> <span id="s759">Hersbruck was a camp, uh, built on the swamp, right by the river.</span> <span id="s760">We had to walk on, uh, on the, on the raised uh walks that was raised about three feet above the ground.</span> <span id="s761">All of the blocks were built the same way.</span> <span id="s762">They were raised, because there were water underneath; and of course this is being a sub-camp, they didn't care about, you know, routine...regular, uh, camp routine.</span> <span id="s763">There were no roll calls anymore.</span> <span id="s764">The roll calls were performed, uh, uh...privately, on each block.</span> <span id="s765">The main thing was to do the work, you know.</span> <span id="s766">And the most important work for them was to work...uh, clear the destruction caused by the planes on the main station of Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s767">I went there several times.</span> <span id="s768">And I remember the first time we went to the Nuremberg, which is about twenty-six kilometers from the camp, uh, Hersbruck.</span> <span id="s769">It took us six hours 'til we arrived in, uh...in the Nuremberg station; because, you know, all the tracks were, uh, uh, in...completely destroyed.</span> <span id="s770">So uh Hersbruck was a target of the constant attacks by planes.</span> <span id="s771">The situation was such that there was a town of Hersbruck, and a camp in a valley-- narrow valley--and there were hills on both sides.</span> <span id="s772">And you would see those planes coming from one side of the hill and then disappearing on the other side; and they would throw bombs, everything what they had, in that area.</span> <span id="s773">And they were... and they were throwing bombs everywhere, camp or no camp.</span> <span id="s774">They were attacking all the plane...uh, trains that were approaching that station Hersbruck.</span> <span id="s775">Uh, sometimes the bodies would...uh, would land right in the center of the...of the camp, after... after they'd attack.</span> <span id="s776">So we were always, you know, under attack.</span> <span id="s777">But on uh second day, day after Easter, we all gather in the, uh (cough)...in the camp; and then we started the evacuation.</span> <span id="s778">There were ten thousand people that marched that day.</span> <span id="s779">We came after twenty days of the death march uh...through Dachau, only less than than two thousand men.</span> <span id="s780">Everything was...everything was killed or died out of hunger uh in, in between.</span> <span id="s781">Five days we didn't get anything to eat or to drink at all.</span> <span id="s782">Uh we were, we... we came as a ghost, really, to Dachau.</span> <span id="s783">And then in Dachau, nobody wanted to take care of us because Dachau itself was already in the process of evacuation.</span> <span id="s784">There were thousands of prisoners coming out of...uh coming into and out of the camp.</span> <span id="s785">So uh when they finally process us, they didn't give anything to wear.</span> <span id="s786">We were naked, and we were only wrapped in a..</span> <span id="s787">.</span> <span id="s788">in a blanket; and this way I lived several weeks.</span> <span id="s789">It had a uh some advantages, because I didn't attend, didn't have to attend uh roll calls; and I didn't have to go to work because I didn't have anything to wear.</span> <span id="s790">And this way I came, I uh uh...waited to the ...to the day--you know, 29 of April--when uh the...the uh final liberation came.</span> <span id="s791">It uh, days in Dachau were uh really quiet.</span> <span id="s792">You...uh camp was not working.</span> <span id="s793">Only the essential things were in operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Otherwise the pri...prisoners were in the blocks, and there were planes above Dachau all the time uh patrolling.</span> <span id="s795">Nobody was shooting at those planes; although there were thousands of SS in, at that time, in Dachau.</span> <span id="s796">Everybody was uh uh very down.</span> <span id="s797">Even the SS.</span> <span id="s798">The SS would not even go to the camp.</span> <span id="s799">And there were no roll calls of any, uh, no...this famous drills that usually, you know, taken were were in the camp.</span> <span id="s800">You know, in Auschwitz or in other camps.</span> <span id="s801">And uh, on the day of, uh, the, uh, liberation, the day looks even clo...more quieter than usually.</span> <span id="s802">But after noon, they order us into the blocks and they lock all the doors.</span> <span id="s803">They locked the doors, and the only people allowed outside were the, uh, fire, uh, uh, brigade made of, uh, SS and now of Kapos.</span> <span id="s804">And then we were receiving our supper, which is around five o'clock, a..</span> <span id="s805">.</span> <span id="s806">an attack started, you know.</span> <span id="s807">A hugh, uh, uh...I mean it's, uh...you heard, you know, the guns and you heard the revolvers and you heard, you know, all...all the front, all the all the fighting, you know, that is.</span> <span id="s808">And it lasted about, uh, twenty minutes, and then came the silence; and in those twenty minutes we all grabbed our things and we were ready to go.</span> <span id="s809">Nobody know where, but we were ready to go.</span> <span id="s810">But then there is a silence; and everybody paused and waited and...and thought, "Well, what's going to happen now?"</span> <span id="s811">And then I look in the windows, and I see thousands of people running towards the gate, towards the electric wire.</span> <span id="s812">I jumped myself from the window, and I ran and I come to the, uh, uh, the barbed wire fence and I see everything is pieces.</span> <span id="s813">Prisoners are shooting from the rifles, you know, to the air; and everybody enjoy.</span> <span id="s814">You know, and I saw first American soldier.</span> <span id="s815">And this is how it happened.</span> <span id="s816">And, uh... in Heaven are, uh, hundreds of, uh, various flags, national flags were flying over Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">LONG PAUSE</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: How long did you stay in Dachau after liberation?</span> <span id="s819">What did you do?</span> <span id="s820">How did they take care of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: They didn't take care at all.</span> <span id="s822">I mean, they...we were... the only...the, uh, man responsible for us in the Block--because we were in, uh...in an area where, which was behind the barbed wire too--was a, uh, Blockältester, who was a prisoner himself.</span> <span id="s823">And he didn't know really nothing, what's going to happen, just like we did.</span> <span id="s824">As I say, it was such a disorder everywhere that uh there was no work.</span> <span id="s825">There was no food.</span> <span id="s826">We were almost as hungry as during the, uh...this march from Hersbruck to Dachau.</span> <span id="s827">And there're some women over there--behind in the next block--too, you know.</span> <span id="s828">There were just a miserable creatures.</span> <span id="s829">They brought ...you know, Dachau was not known of having a women camp, but they were brought from somewhere.</span> <span id="s830">Probably a, a, a group that was traveling on foot and uh came to Dachau as the nearest camp.</span> <span id="s831">From there, they were sending people toward, uh, Garmisch-Partenkirchen [NB: Sub-camp of Dachau in Bavaria].</span> <span id="s832">You know, toward the Alps.</span> <span id="s833">Now, uh, Dachau was, uh, liberated on 29th of April.</span> <span id="s834">The same day--at night--on orders by Himmler, Dachau was supposed to be burned to the ground and everybody killed.</span> <span id="s835">And there were special positions of, for additional machine guns everywhere between the guards; and, uh, uh...the Americans really came about one hour before the deadline.</span> <span id="s836">They also had to fight after having liber...liberated us, hav...have to-- at night, because a division of SS was marching from Munich to Dachau.</span> <span id="s837">Dachau is about 14 kilometers from Munich.</span> <span id="s838">And they were kept from coming and, uh, taking over the camp only by American guards that first night.</span> <span id="s839">But we couldn't sleep, and there was all that for us.</span> <span id="s840">We were supposed to be, you know, sent out not from the Dachau in case of emergency; but the emergency did not materialize.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: What...af...you were liberated.</span> <span id="s842">What did you do?</span> <span id="s843">What did you, John Komski, do immediately after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Well, I was, uh...first thing what we did, we organize a..</span> <span id="s845">.</span> <span id="s846">a, uh, artist, uh...uh, group; because, uh, uh, the problem was immediately after our liberation how to get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s847">The, the Americans closed again...repaired the holes in the...in the fence and put the soldiers on the guard towers; and they were shooting if somebody was trying to get out of the camp, uh, not... in a not authorized way.</span> <span id="s848">And they would really did not issue permits for...for allowing people to go out, because there was a situation that they were afraid that the prisoners, those who would venture into the village, would kill Germans.</span> <span id="s849">Because there was such a hate for...for...toward the Germans that the Germans did not show up on the...on the street in towns or in the villages.</span> <span id="s850">They would sit locked in the houses.</span> <span id="s851">In Dachau itself, in the city of Dachau, their main street was a, uh...was a camp; military was camping right in the street, cooking, doing all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s852">Playing baseball, you know.</span> <span id="s853">And the Germans were sitting in the locked houses for weeks.</span> <span id="s854">The same thing was in the villages.</span> <span id="s855">They would not dare to go, venture outside.</span> <span id="s856">So, because of that, and also because of, uh, the epidemics--uh, I got also, uh, sick later on--uh, they would not allow to, uh, mix, to...to allow the prisoners go outside.</span> <span id="s857">And they keep them in...in, you know, and they tried to inoculate them and sort them, and...and, uh....</span> <span id="s858">And they did not help, because, uh, they didn't know how to deal with such a problem.</span> <span id="s859">First thing, first of all, we were all hungry.</span> <span id="s860">When the liberation came, next day they put us together.</span> <span id="s861">They again order a regular roll call, as the Germans used to do, and they counted how many they have of those liberated people.</span> <span id="s862">There were forty-four thousand, uh, at that time in Dachau.</span> <span id="s863">Later on they brought us food, which was a..</span> <span id="s864">.</span> <span id="s865">a, uh, loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s866">Everybody got a loaf of bread and a pork, uh, uh...can of of condensed pork fat.</span> <span id="s867">And some hungry people ate it, everything, immediately; and in five hours most of them were dead.</span> <span id="s868">Sixteen thousand people died after liberation, yeah, you know.</span> <span id="s869">Because the, uh...because they just over-ate all of a sudden, you know.</span> <span id="s870">I saw situation like this that, you know, we were receiving a, uh, soup in the, uh...very rich soup at noon; and the man get gets the soup, eats and then lays ...uh, sit down by the chimney, and in five minutes he is dead.</span> <span id="s871">Yeah.</span> <span id="s872">There were incredible--and then there were...people were, uh, were, uh, have a dysentery diseases, all kinds of, uh, of, uh, of stomach problems, because of that.</span> <span id="s873">And I got sick...I got a..</span> <span id="s874">.</span> <span id="s875">a fever and I was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s876">I almost died too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">There are a lot of people, thousands of people that died in American hospital in Dachau.</span> <span id="s878">And when I finally get out of that, the camp was already, uh...breaking up, because Americans needed that camp for, uh...for another use.</span> <span id="s879">They wanted to use then for, uh, military, for the prisoners of war camp.</span> <span id="s880">And, uh...prisoners of war who came to Dachau were the SS people.</span> <span id="s881">So by this time I was already in other camps, uh, in the displaced person, uh, camp; and they used to bring us very often to Dachau, and they would sit us in the front the barbed wire fence.</span> <span id="s882">And the Germans would parade behind, on the other side.</span> <span id="s883">And they, we would point out the people we knew because they were preparing court cases of all those arrested Germans.</span> <span id="s884">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Tell us very, tell us very briefly where you went after this and how you got from Europe to America.</span> <span id="s886">Tell us what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Well I, uh...first thing after I..</span> <span id="s888">.</span> <span id="s889">I, after I get out of my sick bed, was I went to Garmisch- Partenkirchen.</span> <span id="s890">I always was very fond of mountains.</span> <span id="s891">I heard about that that they are beautiful Alps, so I made that first trip.</span> <span id="s892">It took about one day--hundred kilometers, one day; but finally I got to Garmisch, and I, uh, went to the Zugspitze there.</span> <span id="s893">I went to the Zugspitze...uh, there is a special train that rides up to the mountain, and it was impossible to get a ticket, you know.</span> <span id="s894">And here I am waiting and deliberating, uh, in the station what I'm going to do next, and here comes an American soldier.</span> <span id="s895">And I recognized that this is my friend from Auschwitz, an artist, who in between, you know, he...who was from Auschwitz, evacuated to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s896">He was liberated earlier than me.</span> <span id="s897">He was liberated, Americans came earlier than that, and he joined the American army.</span> <span id="s898">Not only that, but he was already in action and he had... he had a medal for his service in American army because he got in trouble somewhere in the...in the Trieste.</span> <span id="s899">You know, in Italy.</span> <span id="s900">So he bought me a ticket to the...to Zugspitze, and I came from that Zugspitze back in the evening.</span> <span id="s901">And I found two girls, you know, walking on the street, you know.</span> <span id="s902">The one was my wife, future wife.</span> <span id="s903">She was with her friend, you know; and she lived nearby, near the station.</span> <span id="s904">There was a question--where are you going to stay for the night, you know.</span> <span id="s905">So here was a very convenient, uh, uh, way, uh, to...to arrange that, you know, by knowing somebody; so I..</span> <span id="s906">.</span> <span id="s907">I started out, uh.</span> <span id="s908">I came later on again to Auschwitz; and then my wife came to [Wagenril (ph)], to that, uh, displac...displaced person.</span> <span id="s909">She got a secretary job over there.</span> <span id="s910">And then again later on we both went to Garmisch, and... where we married.</span> <span id="s911">And because she was in Garmisch, uh, before the war ended, so she had a rights to to be considered as a..</span> <span id="s912">.</span> <span id="s913">as a person with permanent resident in Garmisch.</span> <span id="s914">So for that reason--uh, because I married her, you know--I got that residence too.</span> <span id="s915">And I could stay in Garmisch until we moved to a special house for the former prisoners of, uh, from the concentration camps in [Munau (ph)].</span> <span id="s916">[Munau (ph)] is about three, three kilometers toward the Munich.</span> <span id="s917">And, uh, from there...there, we, uh, applied for the papers, you know, to United States.</span> <span id="s918">I had an uncle at that time, who died already, and I got in contact with him.</span> <span id="s919">He sent me that affidavit...he wants to, uh, you know, bring me to the United States; but it didn't work.</span> <span id="s920">It, uh, it took more than one year, uh about two years before...because, before the papers were filed in uh in the in the consulate or in the embassy, I don't know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Anyway, it tooks years; and finally I came, uh, uh... and a Jewish organization came along and helped me.</span> <span id="s922">And with... uh, through them, you know...this was an organization based in New...New York City....</span> <span id="s923">They really, you know, helped; me because they were, uh, organizing a transport to the United States and I went with them, you know.</span> <span id="s924">Actually I, I went for the second, the second, uh, transport that...uh, under the...under this new law that was passed in Congress about the DP, you know; dur...during the Truman years, you know.</span> <span id="s925">So I went to United States; but, you know, uh, the situation was completely different than it is right now.</span> <span id="s926">Nobody cared about the poor displaced people who had came.</span> <span id="s927">I didn't have a time...I have very hard time to get a job.</span> <span id="s928">I..</span> <span id="s929">.</span> <span id="s930">there was, uh, impossible to get odd job any, anywhere.</span> <span id="s931">Although Elizabeth [NB: New Jersey], where I lived, was not very far from, uh, from, uh, New York City; so I went to the factory in the, uh...and I work in the factory for a year and a half before....</span> <span id="s932">And later on again, I went to Germany on the contract with United States Government.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: I need to stop here.</span> <span id="s934">We want to save some time to show the pictures.</span> <span id="s935">Uh, I just want to ask one quick question.</span> <span id="s936">I'd like you to go back to Auschwitz, to the museum.</span> <span id="s937">You did some painting in the museum at night, didn't you?</span> <span id="s938">In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s941">Would you tell us just very briefly about the...what you painted?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I painted scenes; uh, usually these were, uh, scenes with people, and from a, uh, illustration to the German musicals.</span> <span id="s943">Wagner, for example, is a..</span> <span id="s944">.</span> <span id="s945">has, you know, the dramas, you know.</span> <span id="s946">Things like that.</span> <span id="s947">The things that German allowed, and really uh were interested in.</span> <span id="s948">So, for example, uh, troubadours; you know, medieval scenes.</span> <span id="s949">They were very fond of it, you know.</span> <span id="s950">The whole SS was found on this principle of some, uh...some of a knight; knights, you know, in a medieval times.</span> <span id="s951">You know, the...Himmler himself, I think he organized that that way.</span> <span id="s952">So, uh, I painted this kind of a scenes; and a practical, uh, uh...pictures, like portraits.</span> <span id="s953">Portraits.</span> <span id="s954">This is how I uh could survive and live a little bit better than other prisoners; uh because uh they were bringing me uh food for that, you know.</span> <span id="s955">They, they sometimes were very gracious, and they bring the food; and...and uh it uh ...or even, uh even when uh Holocaust started, we had, you know, all kinds of things in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s956">We used to call it "Canada."</span> <span id="s957">Now all these remnants of the Jewish property that was confiscated by Germans, sorted out and sent to German stores or to the front; uh part of it...all of this was stolen, and appeared in a..</span> <span id="s958">.</span> <span id="s959">on the black market, and this black market was called "Canada."</span> <span id="s960">Now, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: We need to stop [here.</span> <span id="s962">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s963">OK.</span> <span id="s964">But we do need to stop and we're going to do the photographs.</span> <span id="s965">Thank you.</span> <span id="s966">That's quite a story.</span> <span id="s967">All right.</span> <span id="s968">I don't know how, you know, listening to your story, John, of of escape from Auschwitz, I still don't know how...I heard you, but I still don't...it still boggles the mind...it really does.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: You know, after a while, after that escape, after I have been liberated and...and uh some times, very often when I when I work at night in my studio, in my home, I sometimes remember...it comes to my mind all those things, and I laugh about it.</span> <span id="s970">I feel how how how this was a stupid thing.</span> <span id="s971">There was...this was this was so many...there was such a hazard involved in it.</span> <span id="s972">I could have been, you know, caught many many times, you know.</span> <span id="s973">I didn't, so maybe because...] [NB: Text in preceding brackets does not appear on videotape.]</span></p> <p><span id="s974">PHOTOGRAPHS ID photo strip--3 photos of prisoner in striped uniform with shaved head, resembling police mug shots.</span> <span id="s975">Left hand photo labeled: "No. 564, KL Auschwitz."</span> <span id="s976">Photograph of six persons seated around a table, circa 1942.</span> <span id="s977">Mr. Komski explains that four of these persons (including himself) were those who escaped from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s978">The other two are the headman of the village Libi_z--where the four escapees were hidden-- and his daughter.</span> <span id="s979">All six are identified by name.</span> <span id="s980">[NB: The same photograph is printed in Garli_ski, Fighting Auschwitz, between pages 288 and 289.</span> <span id="s981">However, the names of the four escapees are spelled differently than on the copy shown here.]</span> <span id="s982">Landscape painting of O_wi_cim castle and bridge.</span> <span id="s983">Painted by John Komski on one of his trips with the Auschwitz surveying team to explore and map territory outside the camp.</span> <span id="s984">Oil painting commissioned by an SS officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Painting--postcard painted by a prisoner at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s986">Shows Native Americans torturing white captives, used as an allegorical theme to express to the recipient the true nature of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Folder/letter, with painting of white flowers on blue background.</span> <span id="s988">Used by prisoner as officially sanctioned message home.</span> <span id="s989">No text.</span></p></body></html>
