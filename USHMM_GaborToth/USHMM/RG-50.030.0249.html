name, please, where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name now is Jacob Gert (ph) Weiner.</span> <span id="s12">And I was born in Bremen, Germany, on March 25, 1917.</span> <span id="s13">At that time, my name was Copper Gert Sweenetski (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: I think I would like to start by talking a little bit about pre-war life, your memories of your family and what life was like before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s15">So can you tell me a little bit what it was like growing up in Bremen?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I was born in Bremen, which was the second biggest port in Germany.</span> <span id="s17">And we lived in the southern part of the city called Neustadt.</span> <span id="s18">And my parents had a business.</span> <span id="s19">My father had a bicycle business, repair shop, selling motorcycles and automobiles and bicycles, mostly.</span> <span id="s20">And we had a very nice life.</span> <span id="s21">My mother came from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s22">And my parents got married in 1916.</span> <span id="s23">And I'm the oldest of four children.</span> <span id="s24">I have two brothers -- I had two brothers and one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Did you -- was your community a mostly Jewish community, or were you part of a larger community in Bremen?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: In the Neustadt where we lived, there were not many Jews living.</span> <span id="s27">And the synagogue, the community center was in the , that means on the northern part of the .</span> <span id="s28">And we had to walk there to the synagogue, which was about 35 to 40 minutes walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Were most of your friends Jewish, or did you have a lot of Gentile friends as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: We were very friendly with our neighbors, most of whom were not Jewish, and we played together with them.</span> <span id="s31">And the schools I went to were mostly non-Jewish people, non-Jewish teachers, non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: So you went to public schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: To a public school first, and afterwards to a kind of gymnasium which is called an oberealshure (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: So you were very comfortable in the general community.</span> <span id="s35">That was your world?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: We felt very comfortable.</span> <span id="s37">We were not one of the richest, but we made a living.</span> <span id="s38">And my father was respected as a very good mechanic.</span> <span id="s39">People came to him with repairs and bought bicycles from us.</span> <span id="s40">And my mother was, so to say, the bookkeeper and taking care of the things.</span> <span id="s41">And she had the very good handwriting.</span> <span id="s42">At that time we hadn't typewriters, and people came from far and wide and had her write letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Were you involved in cultural activities or community activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: To a certain extent, with the synagogue.</span> <span id="s45">We went to the synagogue, and I had religious lessons there in the afternoon, because we did not have a day school, a Jewish day school.</span> <span id="s46">So I went in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s47">And besides this, I was very friendly with some people, some youngsters who lived a little further out in Bremen, a suburb called Hammerlichen (ph).</span> <span id="s48">And those Jewish people whom I saw there, it was a two hours walk, but I went on the weekends several times.</span> <span id="s49">They were mostly from Poland, and they had settled there.</span> <span id="s50">There was a difference in the Jewish community between what they call the ost stuent (ph) and the west stuent (ph).</span> <span id="s51">And I felt very comfortable with the ost stuent (ph), too.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Did -- were you involved in any political organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Not really, but I remember that sometime before Hitler came to power, 1932, I remember, I was associated of going with the Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s54">And in the Zionist organization, it was more leftist.</span> <span id="s55">And I did not like this, because they are very close to Communism, and I did not like it, and I left.</span> <span id="s56">And some 30 or 40 other youngsters left with me, and we joined a different organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: This was also a political organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span> <span id="s59">It was not really a political organization.</span> <span id="s60">It was more or less a religious organization, a of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: What did you do in that organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: We tried to teach people something about Judaism.</span> <span id="s63">And we also tried them how to behave in the Nazi -- during the -- in the Nazi time.</span> <span id="s64">And, but we were not political in that sense.</span> <span id="s65">We did not want to join any political movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Judaism was quite important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">It was very important to me, because despite the fact that my father was not very religious and my mother came from a religious family.</span> <span id="s69">But I felt more religious.</span> <span id="s70">And especially through teachers whom I had there in the Jewish religious school.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And at this time, prior to 1933, there were never any obstacles to you expressing your Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, not to me.</span> <span id="s73">However, to my parents.</span> <span id="s74">And I remember that already in 1928 when we went for a trip to the park near Bremen, the Nazis were very influential, and they just had received 107 people, I think, 107 members in the parliament.</span> <span id="s75">And they came into the car where we were riding, into the street car where we were riding, and my mother was very much afraid that Jewish life in Germany would become different, which it did.</span> <span id="s76">And I saw many times that -- that the Nazis had in mind to exterminate all the Jews, especially in the non-Jewish school where I went, they sometimes ridiculed me and they said to me, "Go back to Jordan, go back to Palestine.</span> <span id="s77">You don't belong here."</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: These were other students?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Students, yeah, from the non-Jewish school.</span> <span id="s80">Q: And this was all prior to --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: This was even prior to Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So you were -- you were fairly aware of Naziism before Hitler came to power, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s84">But we never thought that he would get power, because the largest party in Germany were the social democrats.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: So how did all of this start escalating when Hitler came to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: When Hitler came to power in January 1933, we listened to the radio, and we thought that it would only last a little while.</span> <span id="s87">Because we had non-Jewish friends living near us, and they told us, "Don't worry, it will only last a little while, and it cannot go on this way.</span> <span id="s88">It will stop."</span> <span id="s89">However, by that time, many youngsters and many other people had joined the party.</span> <span id="s90">Some of them joined the party even though they were not 100 percent convinced about Hitler and had no -- much belief in him.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Why did they join the party?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: They knew things would change.</span> <span id="s93">And there were different reasons, because of the political speeches which Hitler made, because of blaming the Jews for having mishandled and brought Germany into such a mishap, like the S.I. and all kinds of things, you see.</span> <span id="s94">And they blamed the Jews on it, because that was one thing in order to get the -- to unite the party against Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: So did you sense that the people in your town started to believe this and believe in all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: There were some people who did not believe it.</span> <span id="s97">In Bremen, even more than Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Hamburg was more Communistic at that time than Bremen.</span> <span id="s99">Bremen was still, when they had the elections in 1933, 64 percent social democrat.</span> <span id="s100">And many times, I saw Nazis coming to our store who told me, "I'm really a Communist.</span> <span id="s101">But I have to cover it up, because if they ever found out, they would send me to the concentration camp," because they already had concentration camps in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So you didn't feel that it was going to be this serious?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: We felt -- we felt that every day had got more serious.</span> <span id="s104">Because in the very beginning, when they had the seven states -- seven days of celebration, when Hitler came to power, afterwards when they had the Reister (ph) fire, the burning of the ragster (ph) at the end of February.</span> <span id="s105">And then finally, when on April 1st, they had the first progrune, (ph) the day of solidarity, they called it, when -- which happened to be on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s106">And Jews were not allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s107">Non-Jews could go out.</span> <span id="s108">So we really felt it was very bad.</span> <span id="s109">Also, they forbade right away Schreichter (ph), that means slaughtering according to Jewish custom.</span> <span id="s110">So we felt it was getting bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Now, how did the attitudes of your friends, your teachers, start changing?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: In the beginning, they still came to our business.</span> <span id="s113">But as time went on, when Hitler made a law that all the parties were prohibited, except the Nazi national party, national socialist.</span> <span id="s114">And anyone who joins Jews, who talks to Jews, then they slowly kept away from Jews, from us.</span> <span id="s115">And it happened before, you see, that they tried to do something against it that we should not have business anymore, and take away the business from us.</span> <span id="s116">It happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Can you -- do you have specific memories of situations with good friends of yours who were not Jewish, or your teachers, how they started changing toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: There were many changes.</span> <span id="s119">Let's talk about, if I may, so talk about our neighbor.</span> <span id="s120">We had a neighbor who had also -- who had been placed there by the Nazis and had also a bicycle and repair shop.</span> <span id="s121">And he didn't know very much about the business.</span> <span id="s122">He came to my father, and my father taught him and gave him business and so forth.</span> <span id="s123">One day, the Nazis told him to build a high wall near our house, so high that we could not look out anymore, completely close our windows, just in order to take away business from us, even though he came to us and he wanted to -- he needed it, because he didn't know too much about the mechanics.</span> <span id="s124">Regarding the youngsters, the children, more or less, they were forced to join the Hitler Youth.</span> <span id="s125">And as soon as they joined the Hitler Youth, they were not allowed to have any more contact with Jewish people, with me and others.</span> <span id="s126">But the teachers, if that's what you are asking me, were different.</span> <span id="s127">The teachers were a different generation, the generation before.</span> <span id="s128">And they felt that it was not right to do this.</span> <span id="s129">And quietly taking me apart, they told me about it.</span> <span id="s130">But not publicly.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: So for a while, you still were in the public schools, the teachers were kind to you?</span> <span id="s132">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Things didn't change too much initially?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: No.</span> <span id="s135">In fact the teacher told me at that time in 1934, they made a law that Jewish children, especially orthodox Jewish children, were no longer allowed to go to school on Sabbath.</span> <span id="s136">They used to do this.</span> <span id="s137">And when they went to school on Sabbath, they would not write, would not take baggage along.</span> <span id="s138">Now they said, "If you come to school, you have to do everything."</span> <span id="s139">So I went to my teacher and I said to him, "I don't want to come any more on Sabbath."</span> <span id="s140">He said to me, "Why don't you want to come anymore?"</span> <span id="s141">So I said to him, "You know, when Hitler came to power, Hitler wanted Germans to know about their background as Germans, to give them a certain sense of identity, according to what he thinks is the identity.</span> <span id="s142">So I want to go a little bit back to my own identity to being Jewish.</span> <span id="s143">I want to be more Jewish now.</span> <span id="s144">You want to be more Nazi; I want to be more Jewish."</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: This was brave in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s147">And then the teacher told me, "What I will do to you is, whatever I teach on the Sabbath, I will tell the students to give you the notes.</span> <span id="s148">And besides this, on Sabbath, I will teach them Mein Kampf, Hitler's book, so you won't be there."</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Why do you think the teachers -- was this a risk for the teachers?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: It was a certain risk.</span> <span id="s151">But they did not do it publicly.</span> <span id="s152">They put on the Nazi emblem, which was like a life saver, double ring, with a swastika in it.</span> <span id="s153">And the teacher told me I had to put this on.</span> <span id="s154">This is my life saver.</span> <span id="s155">"They are taking away my job," and many jobs from teachers were taken away.</span> <span id="s156">The principal of my school where I went, non-Jewish, was retired, and so forth.</span> <span id="s157">The teachers at that time were about between 50 and 60 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how all this started changing.</span> <span id="s159">And my guess is that every year it certainly got worse in terms of your ability to spend time with your Gentile friends, or your teachers' relationships with you.</span> <span id="s160">How did life start changing?</span> <span id="s161">Do you remember any specific people or instances?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s163">We were good friends with people, neighbors.</span> <span id="s164">And there were some young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">We came together; we played together.</span> <span id="s166">There was a yard, what they call a playground like this, not far from us.</span> <span id="s167">And we played together with them.</span> <span id="s168">And everything was fine.</span> <span id="s169">I even went on bicycle tours with some of these people and everything was fine.</span> <span id="s170">I even have a picture at home where I am in this picture with the neighbors, the non-Jewish people who were with us.</span> <span id="s171">They were all very nice to us.</span> <span id="s172">However, it changed because everyone was forced -- two things.</span> <span id="s173">They were forced number one to join the Hitler Youths.</span> <span id="s174">And number two, they were forced to tell the Hitler Youths of what their parents thought about the Nazis at home.</span> <span id="s175">And so slowly it infiltrated to the parents and to others, you see.</span> <span id="s176">And they felt it was not safe anymore to talk to Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And they stopped talking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Slowly, they stopped talking to us.</span> <span id="s179">Then later on, they started to avoid us by walking on the other side of the street, or by just not talking to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Were they ever abusive or violent?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s182">But you could not complain, because there were still people there who were of the old type.</span> <span id="s183">And I remember that one day I went to the -- a fair, which they had in Bremen nor far from us, and they showed a puppet show.</span> <span id="s184">And in the puppet show, they showed how the one person went against the Jews, boop, boop, boop.</span> <span id="s185">So I asked a policeman there, which actually was stupid of me.</span> <span id="s186">But I asked the policeman, "Why do you show such shows?"</span> <span id="s187">You see, "Why do they show such shows here," you see.</span> <span id="s188">"The Jews are also people."</span> <span id="s189">He didn't answer, because the answer was simply, "Because this regime is against the Jews.</span> <span id="s190">That's why we have to infiltrate the public, and we have to make them aware that Jews are different.</span> <span id="s191">And they have to be done away with."</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: As time went on, were you ever hurt or abused in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Not directly.</span> <span id="s194">But I remember that one day, when I was in Wurzburg and I went home from the school to the dormitory, the boys came and they took away my hat.</span> <span id="s195">And they threw it up, and they tried to hurt and beat me.</span> <span id="s196">And, but I was lucky.</span> <span id="s197">Somehow I got this hat back.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Were you ever afraid?</span> <span id="s199">Did your parents start getting fairly worried about the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: My mother was very much afraid of this situation.</span> <span id="s201">And my father, too.</span> <span id="s202">But, so we started quite early, 1934, '35, or even before that, to find relatives or people all over in the world, wherever we thought we had some people.</span> <span id="s203">Because some of my mother's relatives had gone to Israel.</span> <span id="s204">Some had gone to South America.</span> <span id="s205">And my father, Russia was out of the question.</span> <span id="s206">To find out if they would be able to help us getting out, because we want to get out.</span> <span id="s207">And the only way, especially after the Nuremberg laws, 1935, and then 1936, they made it like imperative to move out.</span> <span id="s208">We couldn't stay there anymore, because the business got worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Was your father's business closed down?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Eventually, you see.</span> <span id="s211">They made very little -- they earned very little in that business.</span> <span id="s212">And they had something like what's called a community project whereby they collected food and so on.</span> <span id="s213">And we even had to use some of this food in order to live, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Now, you graduated from public school, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Yeah, even later.</span> <span id="s216">I graduated from some kind of high school in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: And then you went -- then you went onto --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: No.</span> <span id="s219">Then 1936 when I graduated from there, through the help of a teacher, a Jewish teacher in Bremen, I went to Frankfurt am Main.</span> <span id="s220">And I was in Frankfurt am Main for one year.</span> <span id="s221">We considered this, like, instead of military service, Jewish service, you see, because many people there prepared what they called Hashra (ph), which means preparation for moving out to Israel.</span> <span id="s222">At that time it was very difficult even to go to Israel because it was under British dominion, and the British didn't want anyone there.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So you went to -- you went to this school?</span> <span id="s224">A: In Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s226">And things -- were things more difficult, less difficult there?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: In Frankfurt, contrary to Bremen, we lived in a Jewish -- more of a Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s228">And at that time, we did not feel so much about what the outside world did.</span> <span id="s229">But we read, of course, the papers.</span> <span id="s230">But from Frankfurt after one year, I went to Wurzburg, which was a teacher's seminary.</span> <span id="s231">And this teacher's seminary was not far from the railroads.</span> <span id="s232">And there, I saw every day trains, freight trains, dozens of them, covered up with tarpaulin, with machine guns, moving to the front, to Czechoslovakia, to Poland, to all kinds of countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: What did you make of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: So we thought -- of course, this was done secretly.</span> <span id="s235">But we knew or we thought that this was a preparation for war.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Of course, now, you were thinking about war.</span> <span id="s237">You weren't necessarily thinking about concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: No.</span> <span id="s239">You see, at that time we knew there were concentration camps.</span> <span id="s240">Because already in 1933, '34, '33, when they had the Sachsenhausenbergerhomme (ph), we heard from friends of ours, Jewish friends, that they had received urns of ashes from concentration camps.</span> <span id="s241">And it said, "This person was killed while trying to flee," or, "This person committed suicide," or, "This person had been ill."</span> <span id="s242">And so we knew something was going on there, but we didn't really know what was going on there.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Do you -- do you have memories of any of the book burnings or any of some of the more violent outbursts?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s245">I remember the book burning was early in May 1933.</span> <span id="s246">And just because of curiosity, I wanted to go and see it.</span> <span id="s247">So I went out, it was in the evening, about 9:00, 10:00 o'clock, I went out to this big place where they had all the books and they were burning the books.</span> <span id="s248">And I was standing from afar.</span> <span id="s249">And I saw all of the -- thrust all of the books into this bookcase, into this fire and burned them.</span> <span id="s250">So I saw the book burning.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: This was in Bremen?</span> <span id="s252">A: In Bremen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: What did you make of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I only thought, "They don't know what they are doing."</span> <span id="s255">Because these were some of the most intelligent people, you see, that burned the books.</span> <span id="s256">They probably don't know anything about these books, you see, just to burn it.</span> <span id="s257">I say, by burning books, you cannot really do much, because other countries have the book.</span> <span id="s258">And so the books wouldn't get lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Was it frightening at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s261">Europe was frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Do you have memories of shops closing down, or any other violent outbursts prior to Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Prior to Kristallnacht, we had in Bremen what we called great big department stores.</span> <span id="s264">And there were two or three department stores in the main streets in Bremen.</span> <span id="s265">And they had actually built department stores which were new at that time, you see, were the newest kind.</span> <span id="s266">There was one department store by a Jewish person who had for the first time this escalators.</span> <span id="s267">They didn't have escalators before.</span> <span id="s268">And this went up to the fourth floor, the escalators.</span> <span id="s269">And people went there a lot, just because of the escalators, I think, Jewish department store.</span> <span id="s270">And they were closed and taken over by non-Jews.</span> <span id="s271">Or if they were not taken over directly by non-Jews, a non-Jew was made the chief manager of that department store.</span> <span id="s272">I think it was Bamberger's department store, if I remember, and certain others.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did -- I mean, did this make it more difficult to start getting things to have a normal life?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Not just the store, but in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: We tried to live a normal life as much as was possible.</span> <span id="s276">And we tried to get out of Germany as soon as possible and to find some way of living.</span> <span id="s277">You could not change, because since we had this business, and my father knew this business, and we were helping him in this business, that was a way, you see, we could make a living.</span> <span id="s278">You couldn't just change and do a different job.</span> <span id="s279">Because eventually he was thrown out of the , which means the trade union, and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s280">And they even tried to -- to find something out against him, like they came in and they bought certain things.</span> <span id="s281">And then they said, "These things were stolen."</span> <span id="s282">And they want to accuse him of having stolen these things.</span> <span id="s283">They came in and buying things at a different price, and just to say, "He oversells, he overprices," and things of this sort.</span> <span id="s284">But thank God, he was -- they couldn't put anything on him, you see.</span> <span id="s285">But they tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: How did you all combat this?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: It was very hard, very hard.</span> <span id="s288">I was not then so much involved anymore in the business, because I was living away, outside, away from Bremen.</span> <span id="s289">And I was more in a Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s290">But my mother felt very bad about it.</span> <span id="s291">And my father, too.</span> <span id="s292">And they tried to handle the situation as best as could be.</span> <span id="s293">And with the little they had, they continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Tell me a little bit about Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Actually, Kristallnacht did not start at Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s296">It started, I think, on the 28th of October, when a number of students from the school where I had been at that time were of Polish descent, and they were sent away.</span> <span id="s297">And that's where the story of Herschel Grynszpan comes in.</span> <span id="s298">They were sent away.</span> <span id="s299">First they were sent to a prison in Wurzburg.</span> <span id="s300">And we went there and we threw packages of food in there, and we tried to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">And we tried to tell them so-and-so.</span> <span id="s302">Then when the Germans and the Poles concluded their contract, I mean, the negotiations, then suddenly it stopped.</span> <span id="s303">And the trains which had been sent to Poland was like this: A part of the train in Germany, they could go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s304">The part of the train in Poland, they could stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s305">Even the Polish were just as much anti-Semitic as the Germans, maybe more.</span> <span id="s306">And the people in the middle were in No Man's Land.</span> <span id="s307">And that's where Herschel Grynszpan came.</span> <span id="s308">But two weeks later on November 9th, the 10th, was the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s309">No one thought of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">What happened is this: On the day before Kristallnacht, we were studying in school for a test which should have been the next day.</span> <span id="s311">And I had already been a student and a teacher in this school at the same time, because I spoke a little bit of Spanish, so I gave a little bit Spanish classes in school from October to November.</span> <span id="s312">And then in the night it happened, I went home early on that evening, because I wanted to study some more.</span> <span id="s313">And besides this, I wanted to have a good night's sleep for the test the next day.</span> <span id="s314">You want to hear more about that?</span> <span id="s315">So we went to sleep.</span> <span id="s316">Then in the middle of the night, about 2:30 or 3:30, I don't remember anymore the time.</span> <span id="s317">I think it was -- it was the night that I remember, the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s318">We heard noise coming in, into the dormitory where I stayed, which was in this little side street.</span> <span id="s319">And I woke up my colleagues, and I said to them, "What shall we do?</span> <span id="s320">There is noise.</span> <span id="s321">Shall we go and find out where the noise comes from?"</span> <span id="s322">So we waited, and we heard -- the noise got louder.</span> <span id="s323">So I said to them, "Let's make sure we are safe."</span> <span id="s324">So the window, there was a window in the room on the top, barricaded so we couldn't even go through that window.</span> <span id="s325">Outside, there was a hallway.</span> <span id="s326">And outside the hallway, there was a yard.</span> <span id="s327">So I said to them, "The best thing is we get dressed now.</span> <span id="s328">And if anything should happen, we are ready to encounter whatever there is."</span> <span id="s329">And I said, "Let's get our bags ready, if anything should happen."</span> <span id="s330">And then I said, "Let's maybe hide under the -- under the bed, or in that corner."</span> <span id="s331">And then I decided, "No, we don't -- shouldn't hide.</span> <span id="s332">We should just meet it head-on."</span> <span id="s333">So there was a door, one door, with a little lock.</span> <span id="s334">First I tried to lock it, but then I said, "It's no use.</span> <span id="s335">If they come, they come."</span> <span id="s336">And they did come.</span> <span id="s337">They made a lot of noise.</span> <span id="s338">They came in, and they saw our suitcases there.</span> <span id="s339">And they said, "Take these suitcases and throw them against the window."</span> <span id="s340">They wouldn't fall outside the window anyhow, because the windows were barricaded.</span> <span id="s341">Then he said, and I said to them, "What shall we do?"</span> <span id="s342">"Stay here and wait until we give you orders.</span> <span id="s343">And you should know, we never even bent a hair of a Jew, and we won't do it this time.</span> <span id="s344">But eventually, you will all be exterminated," something like that.</span> <span id="s345">I don't know if they said the exact words.</span> <span id="s346">So we waited, then said, "What should we wait for?</span> <span id="s347">Let's go downstairs."</span> <span id="s348">That was on the second floor.</span> <span id="s349">We went through the hallway, and we saw in the big -- there was another dormitory place.</span> <span id="s350">We were on a small side room with lamps hanging down.</span> <span id="s351">They just took their swords, or whatever they had, and cut off the electric lamps that were hanging down.</span> <span id="s352">They cut the faucet so that the water was just coming out.</span> <span id="s353">And they said to us, "Go downstairs."</span> <span id="s354">There was a non-Jewish janitor.</span> <span id="s355">And he said to us, "You better get dressed and get ready, because we don't know what's going to happen," because they didn't tell anyone else.</span> <span id="s356">Then the caretaker of the house thought it would be good idea to go to the police and tell them what happened.</span> <span id="s357">But that was a joke, because going to the police, they just kept him there.</span> <span id="s358">He never came back, and probably afterwards was sent to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s359">Then the woman of the house downstairs said, "What I will do," it is 4:00 o'clock in the morning, 4:30, "I will make some coffee for you.</span> <span id="s360">I will give you something to eat."</span> <span id="s361">And she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: This was a non-Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes, it was a non-Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s364">There was also Jewish woman there, both.</span> <span id="s365">Then we said, "Let's wait and see what's going to happen."</span> <span id="s366">The people who had come into the house, 10, 20 people, left.</span> <span id="s367">And there was quiet.</span> <span id="s368">But the non-Jewish janitor said to us, "They will come back."</span> <span id="s369">And they did come back.</span> <span id="s370">About 6:00, 6:30, they came back.</span> <span id="s371">And they told --</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Excuse me, this is the same morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: This is the same morning.</span> <span id="s374">On November 10th, it was a Thursday morning, they came back.</span> <span id="s375">And the Nazis who were not dressed in Nazi uniform, because they wanted the people to believe it's the foixvut (ph), the anger of the people.</span> <span id="s376">And this does not come from the party, but comes from the plain civilian people.</span> <span id="s377">They were in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s378">They told us, "Get a little bit together."</span> <span id="s379">We thought we should pack all of this.</span> <span id="s380">"No, don't worry.</span> <span id="s381">You will come back."</span> <span id="s382">Of course, it wasn't true, you see.</span> <span id="s383">So we took a few things along, and they said, "All of you assemble in this corner."</span> <span id="s384">And so we assembled in that corner.</span> <span id="s385">And then about 7:30 or so, they said to us, "Now let's go and march."</span> <span id="s386">They marched about three or four, maybe even six in a line.</span> <span id="s387">We were about -- I don't even remember how many people there were.</span> <span id="s388">But there were 50, 60 people or more.</span> <span id="s389">And we walked, it's a narrow street, through this narrow street.</span> <span id="s390">And we walked toward the prison they led us.</span> <span id="s391">And while we were going through the street, the populace, the people were standing at the side.</span> <span id="s392">I think they were all Nazis, because they spit at us, and they threw stones at us and all kinds of -- and they made noise and so forth.</span> <span id="s393">We went through the street and we passed by the synagogue.</span> <span id="s394">We saw the synagogue burning.</span> <span id="s395">And we went all the way, and Wurzburg is a city where there used to be a palace of the Bavarian king.</span> <span id="s396">We passed by there, and they led us to the prison.</span> <span id="s397">And they were -- the Germans were very methodical.</span> <span id="s398">When you came in, they took a picture of you, on the right side, from the left side, from the front.</span> <span id="s399">And they took all your money, or all kind of things which you had in your pocket.</span> <span id="s400">And they made a complete record of it.</span> <span id="s401">They were very meticulous.</span> <span id="s402">They were very orderly in that sense.</span> <span id="s403">And they gave it to us, and they said, "Sign here."</span> <span id="s404">Okay, we signed.</span> <span id="s405">Then they led us into cells, prison cells.</span> <span id="s406">And I was in prison cell number 99, I think.</span> <span id="s407">And there were about 15 boys in that prison cell.</span> <span id="s408">They put us in there, in the water cell.</span> <span id="s409">And there was, like, a toilet, a bowel.</span> <span id="s410">And there were windows on top, with iron bars.</span> <span id="s411">And there was -- I don't think anything else, maybe a few mattresses or so.</span> <span id="s412">And in the door was a little window.</span> <span id="s413">And through this window they gave us food about an hour later, like water with a few beans in it and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: How long were you in this prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: From that Thursday until the next Thursday, eight days.</span> <span id="s416">Q: It was fairly --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: And we always thought we would all be sent away.</span> <span id="s418">Because every morning and every evening, they took us all out.</span> <span id="s419">Once a day, they led us around the prison yard to give us a prison walk for an hour.</span> <span id="s420">And then they led us all out, and they read a list of names to make sure everyone was still there.</span> <span id="s421">And every day, the number had come less.</span> <span id="s422">And we imagined, because no one told us, that they probably were sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s423">And then came the last day of the seven days.</span> <span id="s424">They called us a list.</span> <span id="s425">They called us a list, and they read all the names.</span> <span id="s426">Then they read seven names, and I was among the seven whom they read.</span> <span id="s427">And they said to them, "Stay at the side."</span> <span id="s428">We stayed at the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: What were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: I didn't know what they would do with us.</span> <span id="s431">I think they would send us to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s432">But what happened was, all the others were sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s433">And these seven, I among them, was stateless.</span> <span id="s434">And they said to us, "You are stateless, and we are going to send you away," not telling us where.</span> <span id="s435">So I thought maybe they send me to Russia, because my father came from Russia.</span> <span id="s436">And I said to myself, "It's better to be in Russia than to stay here," even though I didn't know that at that time it was just as bad.</span> <span id="s437">And I already made up my mind to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s438">"Within 24 hours I will be in Russia."</span> <span id="s439">That was at noon-time then.</span> <span id="s440">Then they came back in the evening, and they called us again, the seven people.</span> <span id="s441">And they said, "Go downstairs and report to the office, the prison office."</span> <span id="s442">I know now that all the others were sent to concentration camps because they wanted to empty the prison of all the Jews.</span> <span id="s443">All people under 15 and over 60 were sent home.</span> <span id="s444">They only kept the people between 15 and 60, I think.</span> <span id="s445">So when we came downstairs, they told us, "You are free.</span> <span id="s446">Sign this."</span> <span id="s447">And they gave us back all the things which they had taken away from us.</span> <span id="s448">They were very meticulous.</span> <span id="s449">And they said, "Return within 24 hours to your home cities, and report to the Gestapo."</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Now, how did this feel?</span> <span id="s451">I mean, it must have been a fairly strange feeling that you were so close to being sent away.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I didn't -- I felt -- I said, "Whatever is going to happen to us, we cannot do much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">We can maybe pray a little bit," and that's what we did while we were together in this cell.</span> <span id="s454">"But what can we do?</span> <span id="s455">We hope for the best, you see, and we know bad things -- bad things are going to happen.</span> <span id="s456">We hope that a miracle or something would happen, and things will change for us."</span> <span id="s457">Well, it was very bad, and nothing helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Now, while you must have had a certain immediate relief at not being sent away, what were you thinking about the other people you had spent time with?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: We felt very bad about the other people that were sent away.</span> <span id="s460">And we hoped that maybe they wouldn't have to stay there such a long time.</span> <span id="s461">At that time, they had concentration camps, but they did not do the killings in such large measures as afterwards.</span> <span id="s462">They killed a few people, as I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s463">They sent the urns to those people about -- Jews and non-Jews.</span> <span id="s464">I even know non-Jews whose urns they had sent away, back to them, to family.</span> <span id="s465">So we thought -- and beside this, when we came out, we knew that Greppels (ph) had called off -- Gurling (ph) had called off the sending away the Jews on the day afterwards.</span> <span id="s466">It didn't make much difference.</span> <span id="s467">I only felt, I only thought that maybe I would come home and I would see what's going on there.</span> <span id="s468">But for eight days we didn't know what was going on in the world because we were completely separated from any news.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: I'm going to ask you, do you want a glass of water?</span> <span id="s470">A: No, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: I want to talk to you about what happened when you got home.</span> <span id="s472">You were from the prison, and then went back to Bremen; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s474">After I got out of the prison, I needed to go back to my home town.</span> <span id="s475">And I needed money for the train, and I had none.</span> <span id="s476">But as I say before, miracles happened.</span> <span id="s477">The miracle happened, I met the secretary of the school where I left.</span> <span id="s478">And I asked her, "Can I have some money?"</span> <span id="s479">And she gave me 20 marks.</span> <span id="s480">And I went back to the school to find out if any of my belongings were still there.</span> <span id="s481">And I went to the school, and I met another fellow, and -- but I couldn't find anything.</span> <span id="s482">It was all locked up.</span> <span id="s483">And so I went straight to the train station.</span> <span id="s484">And it was late at night, because we came out, it was in winter, November.</span> <span id="s485">It gets dark early.</span> <span id="s486">I came to the train station, and the train station was packed with Nazis and other people at that time.</span> <span id="s487">And I went to the counter, and I bought a ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">But during the train trip, I was afraid if they would find out that I'm a Jew, they would beat me up or throw me off the train.</span> <span id="s489">So while I was traveling on the train and the train would come to Bremen about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, I was walking always along the hallways in order to walk around and not sit at one place.</span> <span id="s490">Because I was afraid of that.</span> <span id="s491">And I was probably the only Jew there on the train.</span> <span id="s492">I don't know.</span> <span id="s493">So then I came back to Bremen.</span> <span id="s494">When I came to Bremen, it was a Friday morning.</span> <span id="s495">You can figure out, on the 10th, 17th, it was probably the 18th of November.</span> <span id="s496">And I came to the station, and I took a trolley car to where we were living.</span> <span id="s497">And I thought everything was okay.</span> <span id="s498">I tried to call my mother and my parents from the train station, but there was no answer.</span> <span id="s499">So I said, "Okay, I walk.</span> <span id="s500">I will go there myself."</span> <span id="s501">I went there.</span> <span id="s502">And I walked over.</span> <span id="s503">And when I came to our house, I saw the whole -- all the windows that barricaded with wood.</span> <span id="s504">And the side door had a note there, "Get the key from the police department."</span> <span id="s505">So before I went to the police department, I saw a neighbor of ours on the other side who had a furniture business.</span> <span id="s506">And he was really a good friend of ours, non-Jewish person.</span> <span id="s507">Because as I told you, we had mostly non-Jewish neighbors.</span> <span id="s508">And this man just went to me with a finger, "Come in, come in."</span> <span id="s509">He was afraid to say anything or stay outside.</span> <span id="s510">He did it from inside the window, and he took me in.</span> <span id="s511">And he took me in one of the rooms which was farthest away from the entrance.</span> <span id="s512">I think it was a safe -- he had a safe, I'm not so sure.</span> <span id="s513">And I don't know whether his wife was there or not, because we were also friends with his wife and his children.</span> <span id="s514">And he said to me, "I want to tell you what happened on the Kristallnacht."</span> <span id="s515">They didn't call it the Kristallnacht then.</span> <span id="s516">They called it the progrun (ph).</span> <span id="s517">"In the middle of the night, these people came," and he mentioned the name of these people.</span> <span id="s518">And they are mentioned in what I showed you, the Heid's (ph) Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What was the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Henreiz (ph) was one name, and I don't remember the other name.</span> <span id="s521">But it's in the -- in my records.</span> <span id="s522">And they came the night, and they were standing outside.</span> <span id="s523">And they were screaming, they were calling up, "Joe."</span> <span id="s524">My father's name was Joseph, they call him, Joe, "Open up."</span> <span id="s525">And when my father heard this, he fled.</span> <span id="s526">He ran over the roofs on the other side, and this man told me he went to the port, to the harbor, and he boarded a Swedish ship to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s527">I don't know, probably that's what he told him.</span> <span id="s528">"And your brother, your younger brother, who was just barmitzvah in October 1939, '38, he went to call a doctor.</span> <span id="s529">But he never came back."</span> <span id="s530">And my sister, she was in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s531">She was like a house -- household help.</span> <span id="s532">And so then he came in.</span> <span id="s533">They broke in.</span> <span id="s534">They broke everything, because later on when I came to the house, I saw everything ripped up and pasted and broken down, all glass inside.</span> <span id="s535">And I had -- it was not easy to get up to the second floor.</span> <span id="s536">And they asked your mother, "Where is your husband?"</span> <span id="s537">And my mother did not want to tell them.</span> <span id="s538">So she said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s539">When she did not tell them, they just shot.</span> <span id="s540">I don't know how many -- how many times they shot, but at least once, because afterwards I found the bullet there.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: That was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: And then he said to me, "What happened afterwards, two ladies came, and they buried her in the Jewish cemetery."</span> <span id="s543">And he was afraid to tell me anything.</span> <span id="s544">That was all he told me.</span> <span id="s545">And then I went to the police station, which wasn't too far.</span> <span id="s546">And I asked them for the key.</span> <span id="s547">They gave me the key.</span> <span id="s548">And they told me, "Write down where you are going to be," and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s549">And I said, "What do you need to know this for?"</span> <span id="s550">So they said to me, "We want to know where all the Jews are in all the world, because eventually we will come and we will conquer the world.</span> <span id="s551">And we will kill all the Jews in the whole world."</span> <span id="s552">So, "That's what you think."</span> <span id="s553">And I said to myself, "That's what they think, you see.</span> <span id="s554">But it's not always going this way."</span> <span id="s555">So I had the key, and I went in.</span> <span id="s556">And I saw everything was broken, and pictures were torn.</span> <span id="s557">And I looked there, and I found a little passbook picture of my mother.</span> <span id="s558">Probably she had taken it just before, because we had to send away to the other countries so they can get it.</span> <span id="s559">That picture I took later on, and I had it remade by some company in the United States and made a big picture.</span> <span id="s560">You saw the picture in the book.</span> <span id="s561">And they wrote a book about this later on.</span> <span id="s562">So that was it.</span> <span id="s563">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So your mother was already buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s566">She was not there, because this was already a week after the Kristallnacht when they came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: The house and the business were wrecked?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: The house and the business were all torn and so forth.</span> <span id="s569">So what should I do?</span> <span id="s570">I said, "To stay here in Bremen is no use, because there is no one there."</span> <span id="s571">So I went to the station again, to the train station, and I went to see my sister in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s572">So I took a train to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s573">And again, I was afraid, you see, there were Nazis there, all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s574">So I came to Nazi -- to Hamburg, just about twilight in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s575">And I knew the people where my sister was staying with.</span> <span id="s576">And I went over to this place, and it was already getting dark.</span> <span id="s577">So I -- so I came there, and I knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s578">And they were all there, the whole family.</span> <span id="s579">And they had about five children.</span> <span id="s580">And my sister was there, too.</span> <span id="s581">And they were all standing.</span> <span id="s582">As you know, the Jewish custom, on Friday evening, they make Kadriche (ph), you see, for Sabbath.</span> <span id="s583">I came just at that moment.</span> <span id="s584">And I asked them where my father had been, and my brother.</span> <span id="s585">I found out that my father was with some other relatives.</span> <span id="s586">He was sitting shiver (ph) at that time.</span> <span id="s587">And my brother had been sent to an orphanage in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s588">And I went there, and I stayed there for the rest of the week.</span> <span id="s589">And other things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: I did want to ask you, and I don't want to break up your train of thought here.</span> <span id="s591">But eventually, you went back to Bremen?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And you got involved as a representative from the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Intermediary, I guess you termed it.</span> <span id="s596">Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about, what your responsibilities were, why you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: After a while, after the Kristallnacht, after a while in December, some people came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Some people were released from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s599">Some came back.</span> <span id="s600">And they wanted again to make some kind of community, and the community took place at that time.</span> <span id="s601">They moved to a different house, not anymore in the synagogue, in the community house.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: This is in Bremen?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: In Bremen.</span> <span id="s604">They moved to a house of a private family, Greenberg, which was on Kohlhage Strasse (ph), but you don't have to know that.</span> <span id="s605">Anyhow, it moved to a private house, these people who had already emigrated from Bremen, who had come to America.</span> <span id="s606">And they had donated this house to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s607">And it was a house, and afterward 100 or more people were living in this house, because they made every little room into, like, a family place.</span> <span id="s608">So that's where we were living.</span> <span id="s609">And one of the people became, so to say, the president or the administrator of the community.</span> <span id="s610">And I was working with them, you see.</span> <span id="s611">I was working with them to prepare for emigration, misheighers (ph) is the translation.</span> <span id="s612">I even went to small places outside Bremen, Bremenhoffen (ph), and Weizamenda (ph) in certain places.</span> <span id="s613">And the Gestapo wanted to know everything that the congregation is doing.</span> <span id="s614">So I was appointed, I think.</span> <span id="s615">I don't know if I volunteered.</span> <span id="s616">Maybe I did volunteer.</span> <span id="s617">But I think I was appointed to go to them.</span> <span id="s618">So I went two, three times a week, and sometimes more.</span> <span id="s619">And then they wanted to know everything.</span> <span id="s620">The first time when I went there, they showed me a bunch of papers.</span> <span id="s621">And he said to me, "These are the things which we found in your parents' home."</span> <span id="s622">And I don't know if they ever gave it back to me.</span> <span id="s623">But they just showed it to me.</span> <span id="s624">They wanted to show they are honest people.</span> <span id="s625">They keep people's things and so forth.</span> <span id="s626">And then I asked him, I asked him, "Where is my brother?"</span> <span id="s627">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s628">So my brother was in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s629">But somehow, through circumstances which I don't know, he was released from Sachsenhausen and sent to a Jewish hospital in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s630">And it was in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s631">So my father and I, we went back to Bremen.</span> <span id="s632">My sister was -- remained in Hamburg, and my other brother was in the orphan home, as I said.</span> <span id="s633">And we were living in the house all by ourselves.</span> <span id="s634">Everything was destroyed.</span> <span id="s635">But on the second floor, we were sleeping there.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">And many nights, there was a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s637">Especially one night, I remember a knock at the door.</span> <span id="s638">And I looked out of the window.</span> <span id="s639">I didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s640">And I saw people in civilian uniforms, standing on the other side.</span> <span id="s641">And they called again, "Open up."</span> <span id="s642">I said to them, I said to them, "Okay, I will open up."</span> <span id="s643">So I opened up.</span> <span id="s644">And they came in, and they were looking all around.</span> <span id="s645">So I said, "What are you looking for?"</span> <span id="s646">They said to me, "We are looking for your brother."</span> <span id="s647">And I said, "My brother is in Hamburg in the hospital."</span> <span id="s648">But they didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s649">They looked all over.</span> <span id="s650">They looked under the couch, and over the couch, and in all corners.</span> <span id="s651">So they came all within the middle of the night, as if they didn't know it, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
