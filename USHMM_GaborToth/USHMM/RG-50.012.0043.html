Would your father have done the same if he was in similar circumstances with Antonin?)</span> <span id="s21">....Yes Antonin was a secretary in the camp Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s22">He remembers getting chocolates for the children in his barracks.</span> <span id="s23">His father would have done the same thing.</span> <span id="s24">He was the same kind of man.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">(Was there anti-Semitism in the town where you were raised?)</span> <span id="s26">....</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Antonin then told about how many children he had in his barracks: 1,300 children and 1,200 were Jewish.</span> <span id="s28">He then answered the question concerning anti-Semitism in his town.</span> <span id="s29">His response was there was a Jewish community, a Jewish cemetery, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">(Were your parents political?)</span> <span id="s31">They were Social Democrats.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">(When did you join the Communist Party?)</span> <span id="s33">....Early in his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">He had a tradition of a working family.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">(Did you risk your life in the camp?)</span> <span id="s36">....Thousands of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Not just for the children in his barracks but also for some adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Toni used to help the "to be exterminated" to change their names with already deceased prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">(Do you think of these camp years often?)</span> <span id="s40">...No.</span> <span id="s41">Then Toni tells a story.</span> <span id="s42">Once there were six students which the SS said must die.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Toni helped them switch names and numbers.</span> <span id="s44">He told them to stay with these new identities.</span> <span id="s45">But if they were to survive it would be hard for them to get papers because they would have been listed as dead and their family would have been notified.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">The SS asked Toni, "where are the Belgiums in his block.</span> <span id="s47">He said that his block was a transport block and people changed every day but he said he would look for them.</span> <span id="s48">When he returned he said that one died of typhus, the other of pneumonia, etc.</span> <span id="s49">After the war some men from Belgium were looking for him.</span> <span id="s50">There were five boys.</span> <span id="s51">He went to see them at the rendezvous place.</span> <span id="s52">There were five big men waiting for him there.</span> <span id="s53">The five big men were the same boys that he had saved.</span> <span id="s54">They threw him in the air with joy.</span> <span id="s55">They were the ones who at the end of 1944 were prisoners.</span> <span id="s56">(Antonin, were you beaten?)</span> <span id="s57">He said that he was the leader of block 66.</span> <span id="s58">But even though he was a block leader it was said that he saw people from the inside and</span></p> <p><span id="s59">not the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Antonin then talked about the transports.</span> <span id="s61">When they came in they had over two thousand children.</span> <span id="s62">But they did not come in every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">When the children started coming in large shipments he asked the committee chairman if he could make his block all children.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">The committee chairman agreed that it was a good idea but the other part of the committee didn't agree.</span> <span id="s65">They didn't want all those children together.</span> <span id="s66">The committee thought that people from other blocks would tell the children about their parents.</span> <span id="s67">So Antonin said that he would put up a sign that would not allow the others to come</span></p> <p><span id="s68">into the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Once Toni was talking to a Capo and told him he had been here for five years.</span> <span id="s70">Then he told the Capo he needed some materials for the children, he needed the chief of the resistance to do so.</span> <span id="s71">He then went to the SS camp fuhrer in the hospital and told him that he had a block of children for three and a half years and he needed some supplies for them.</span> <span id="s72">The SS was furious at the question.</span> <span id="s73">But it was possible to speak to the SS.</span> <span id="s74">Then another SS asked what was going on.</span> <span id="s75">Toni said he was ordered to make some beds but they also needed some covers.</span> <span id="s76">Antonin new some Germans before the war and so he asked this one he recognized for some blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">--(Toni drifts) Earlier when he was in Dachau on his first day a German capo took a chair and threw it at the newly arrived Czechs for not understanding him.</span> <span id="s78">Toni then jumped on him and tried to strangle him.</span> <span id="s79">Toni then said to the capo,"You are a communist(as was Toni), aren't you ashamed of what you are doing."</span> <span id="s80">The capo didn't seem to care about what Toni had said to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Toni thought that when you are in a camp for six years you forget all that you have learned as a child and in school.</span> <span id="s82">Toni then said that one doesn't realize that if he is to survive the camp that people will ask you how many people have you killed.</span> <span id="s83">--(Toni then returns to the original story concerning the blankets.)</span> <span id="s84">He then asked a capo that he recognized from Dresden in 1933 if he could get some blankets from the store.</span> <span id="s85">The capo asked how many, five or ten, Toni answered 2,000.</span> <span id="s86">He said that the children were cold and were just disinfected.</span> <span id="s87">In the morning Toni gave the</span></p> <p><span id="s88">children covers.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">(Why were you helping the children?)</span> <span id="s90">....</span> <span id="s91">It's instinct.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">(Were your brothers and sisters the same way as you?)</span> <span id="s93">Perhaps.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">In 1941 came the first soviet prisoners as they arrived the Germans made them run around naked to show the other prisoners that they were nothing special.</span> <span id="s95">The prisoners from the other barracks used to bring bread to the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">The prisoners had to where different colors to separate them.</span> <span id="s97">Red for politicals, Pink for homosexuals, green for criminals.</span> <span id="s98">In all barracks there were political and those who denounced the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">The response from the chief SS was that the criminals were to be the block leaders not the politicals.</span> <span id="s100">Toni's block leader soon left to join the army 5 or 6 day after he was made the leader.</span> <span id="s101">They needed a new leader and so Toni who was the secretary became the leader.</span> <span id="s102">Later he was caught and it was said that he had three inciters in his block.</span> <span id="s103">He denied what they said.</span> <span id="s104">For three days they went without food.</span> <span id="s105">Toni went to the SS and said that the three weren't just denouncing them they were denouncing everyone.</span> <span id="s106">Toni said that he had read it in one of their letters.</span> <span id="s107">Toni convinced</span></p> <p><span id="s108">them.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">(What did the children do all day long?)</span> <span id="s110">It was impossible to teach to those who had just seen their parents go to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Toni did manage to get them to sing.</span> <span id="s112">And once he told them about the French Revolution and they loved it because they could feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">(Did the war teach you anything?)</span> <span id="s114">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">(Did it change you?)</span> <span id="s116">No.</span> <span id="s117">Nothing in the world has changed him.</span> <span id="s118">Once in the camp the SS asked him how long was he in here.</span> <span id="s119">He answered five years.</span> <span id="s120">They then asked him if he was still a Communist.</span> <span id="s121">He said yes and they gave him the sign of block master.</span> <span id="s122">The SS must have liked his directness.</span> <span id="s123">Nothing has changed Toni.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">In order to survive one had to be the eternal optimist.</span> <span id="s125">Toni believed in people.</span> <span id="s126">The stupid with no identity always died in the camp.</span> <span id="s127">The optimist had a better chance to survive.</span> <span id="s128">Toni believed in himself.</span> <span id="s129">(What would you want to tell children about your experience?)</span> <span id="s130">He answered that his children from Buchenwald were now adults.</span> <span id="s131">These children had written him after the war.</span> <span id="s132">He feels that no children should have to go through a similar experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Right before liberation the SS came to him and asked for his Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Toni said that he had no Jews left.</span> <span id="s135">He said that yesterday they went on the transports.</span> <span id="s136">He said that he had only children who were not Jews.</span> <span id="s137">Before the SS came to the barracks he had told all the boys to say that they were not Jews if they were asked by the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">The SS believed him even though 90 percent of his children were in</span></p> <p><span id="s139">fact Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">(How does it feel to have saved all those lives?)</span> <span id="s141">Toni didn't want to answer, he just said that he had received a lot of cards from the children after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">After the camp had been liberated Toni took all the boys to a house not far from camp were some of the SS used to stay.</span> <span id="s143">They stayed there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">(How old were your children?)</span> <span id="s145">They were between 3 and 16 years old.</span> <span id="s146">At the house Toni sent letters to the American commander who was at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s147">Toni asked him for packages, especially chocolates for the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">(When was the first transport?)</span> <span id="s149">The first transport arrived in 1941.</span> <span id="s150">The children were from parents whom had already been exterminated.</span> <span id="s151">Later during the summer of '44 to '45 the transports came more from the west.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">(Are any of the children still in touch with you?)</span> <span id="s153">....No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">(What have been the best years of your life?)</span> <span id="s155">Before World War I, when he was happy all the time, when he was a child and they went</span></p> <p><span id="s156">bicycle riding everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">(Did you find the war years exciting?)</span> <span id="s158">....Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">(Would you do it again?)</span> <span id="s160">....No, once was enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">(Do you have any regrets?)</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Toni regrets nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">(Are you still a Communist?)</span> <span id="s164">...Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">(In 1968 what role did you play?)</span> <span id="s166">The same as now, Toni hasn't changed his attitude towards Communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">(Did your beliefs in Communism help you keep your identity?)</span> <span id="s168">His answer was that there are two types of Communists: the real ones and the others, Toni is a real one.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">(Where did you learn to grow fruit and vegetables?)</span> <span id="s170">As a child, he and the other children in his family had to help
