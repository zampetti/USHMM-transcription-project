<p><span id="s63">RB: No, not even much.</span> <span id="s64">That, later on in high school I recall once, one of the guys called me a dirty Jew or something to that effect, and we had a bash in in school yard.</span> <span id="s65">And I got a lot of applause because I knocked him out.</span> <span id="s66">So, it so happens he had a brother, a tall guy, who was one of the early S.S. men, the Black S.S., you know, a political guy.</span> <span id="s67">But otherwise I had no problems, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">NP: There was co-existing in the community?</span></p> <p><span

car.</span> <span id="s73">He had a bicycle and he went on his rounds visiting patients, which is also unheard of nowadays.</span> <span id="s74">And he went visiting and was very popular in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s75">We had a little dog who usually went along with him.</span> <span id="s76">And he, [unclear] and then he was a character, belonging to the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s77">And things went fairly normal, until first, when Hitler came.</span> <span id="s78">Then I do remember one particular thing, my father’s friends being, other doctors in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s79">And he usually got together on an evening and would say, “Well, let him get in.</span> <span id="s80">Let him get in.</span> <span id="s81">They won’t last

for about an hour, which amounted to very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">NP: Excuse me, that was called the Al Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">RB: The Real, Re--Re-...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">NP: Oh, the Real.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">RB: Yeah, Real.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">NP: Real.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">RB: Andreas Real...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">NP: Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">RB: Gymnasium, yeah.</span> <span id="s102">It was, Andreas was the name.</span> <span id="s103">Andreas Realgymnasium.</span> <span id="s104">Also my brother preceded me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">NP: And so the rabbi did the...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">RB: Well, he...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">NP: Teaching of the Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">RB: He, yeah, he taught religion and Hebrew to us, as far as I can remember.</span> <span id="s109">It was once a week.</span> <span id="s110">When the others had religious instruction we left and went to a different room with the rabbi and only three or four once a week in the whole school.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">NP: And this was at the Tunuv [phonetic] high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">RB: Yeah high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">NP: And so he was your private tutor, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">RB: He, well, sort of, yes.</span> <span id="s115">And he was, because we only, they rented, the community rented a hall for the Yomim Tovim.</span> <span id="s116">And my father was always the physician in residence and he always got an honor.</span> <span id="s117">And I wrote this down here too at one time.</span> <span id="s118">Well, it’s [unclear] important, actually.</span> <span id="s119">But we went there, that’s the only time.</span> <span id="s120">There were about three times a year we went to synagogue and, yeah, he was, in fact he always went with a silk hat on Yom Tov, a silk hat, and he got haftorah and one, I remember once he had forgotten his glasses.</span> <span id="s121">And he couldn’t read too well.</span> <span id="s122">And his arms just weren’t long enough.</span> <span id="s123">So it was a little awkward for him but he made it.</span> <span id="s124">He was well educated in Judaism.</span> <span id="s125">And in fact, I saw once his certificate of when he left the Gymnasium [unclear].</span> <span id="s126">And they said he leaves in order to take up the study of religion.</span> <span id="s127">Because his father was a rabbi--I never knew him of course--and he wanted him to be a rabbi too.</span> <span id="s128">But as soon as he got to Germany, or [unclear] or Berlin or wherever he got to, he took up medicine instead.</span> <span id="s129">And he paid for his education by tutoring other students.</span> <span id="s130">And also I know that he was in the German Army.</span> <span id="s131">And he got married in 1916 while he was in the army.</span> <span id="s132">And he was a physician in the army and he got an Iron Cross, second class, too, he was very proud of that in a way, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">NP: Indeed.</span></p>

<span id="s139">Aunts?</span> <span id="s140">Uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">RB: Well, no, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s142">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s143">We were, maybe we had guests over [unclear] at Pesach or something like that.</span> <span id="s144">I don’t really remember that too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NP: So your family’s reaction to Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in 1933...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">RB: I believe, well I said what he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NP: Your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">RB: He said, “Well, nobody will go for that.”</span> <span id="s149">My father was a liberal Jew in Germany.</span> <span id="s150">In fact, he was a member of the, I’ll say it in German first, the Reichsbund Jüdischer Frontsoldaten.</span> <span id="s151">That [chuckling] don’t try to write it.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">NP: Which means?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">RB: Which means the Organization for Jewish Veterans, the Jewish Veterans Organization, and who fought at the front.</span> <span id="s154">Yeah, I don’t know [unclear] active, how much action he had.</span> <span id="s155">I don’t, he had, he never fought.</span> <span id="s156">[chuckling] I saw one picture of him with, I think the only time he sat on a horse.</span> <span id="s157">And he also belonged to the Zentralverein, which is quite significant...</span></p> <p><span id="s158">NP: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">RB: The name.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">NP: The name?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">RB:

Staatsbürger Jüdischen Glaubens.</span> <span id="s165">That means the German Citizen of the Jewish Faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">RB: Well, it’s somehow significant, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">NP: And that was called the Zentralverein?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span

id="s173">RB: No, I don’t believe.</span> <span id="s174">He was interested in medicine, and he attended medicine lectures very often.</span> <span id="s175">He assisted well-known physicians occasionally.</span> <span id="s176">And I think this one of the contentions in the family.</span> <span id="s177">He was always out studying or...</span></p> <p><span id="s178">NP: Serving humanity.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">RB: Yeah, either serving or trying to learn more.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">NP: Did you have any contact with the Council of German Jews, which was called the Reichsvertretung?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">RB: Huh?</span> <span id="s182">Reichsvertretung, oh, the Reichsvertretung.</span> <span id="s183">No, I don’t have any--well I was a kid anyway so...</span></p> <p><span id="s184">NP: Right, right, and were you affected by the boycott of 1933 or by the Aryan Paragraph?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">RB: Well, only in [unclear].</span> <span id="s186">I don’t know what year it was, but they, eventually came, maybe ‘33, ‘34, ‘35, plastered, my father had his sign downstairs on the street, on the wall.</span> <span id="s187">And they plastered a sign over it, “Germans Resist.</span> <span id="s188">Don’t Buy From Jews.”</span></p> <p><span id="s189">NP: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">RB: They shouldn’t buy any health from the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">NP: Who were they?</span> <span id="s192">Who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">RB: That’s interesting too.</span> <span id="s194">They posted, they, the Nazis, they posted a guard--for a while anyway--and then it went back, we lived in the same building--in an S.A. uniform--you know, the cocky uniform.</span> <span id="s195">And actually my father had assisted at his birth.</span> <span id="s196">So that’s of interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">NP: That was interesting, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">NP: Yes.</span> <span id="s200">And so they put it...</span></p> <p><span id="s201">RB: At first they--he was also a public servant.</span> <span id="s202">He had the welfare patients, because the state-assigned doctors.</span> <span id="s203">And they took that away from him pretty soon, I think, in 1933, ‘34.</span> <span id="s204">Who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NP: And the laws, the Nuremberg Laws were passed in September of 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">NP: Right.</span> <span id="s208">And how was your life changed?</span> <span id="s209">Or, during this period did the family discuss leaving Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s211">It’s interesting, yes.</span> <span id="s212">As far as I remember, my father had an offer to go to Brazil, to a hospital somewhere there, to São Paulo, I believe.</span> <span id="s213">And he [unclear] them whether he should come.</span> <span id="s214">He said, “What would I do?</span> <span id="s215">I don’t know any Portuguese.</span> <span id="s216">And what do I know there?</span> <span id="s217">I don’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s218">Let’s sit it out.”</span> <span id="s219">So you know, unfortunately, he never went.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">NP: And what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">RB: I believe 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">NP: 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">NP: So he did not leave Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">RB: No.</span> <span id="s226">He never left Berlin.</span> <span id="s227">In fact, I don’t remember the year--I could look it up, you know--he was arrested.</span> <span id="s228">Somebody came, well I think, when, yeah, while I was in school, and took him to Moabit Prison, that’s the police prison in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">NP: Moabit?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">NP: M-O-A-...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">RB: M-O-A-B-I-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">RB: Police prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">NP: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">RB: As far as I know the--he was accused of illegal abortion.</span> <span id="s237">And he never returned.</span> <span id="s238">And they, an uncle or a cousin of my mother’s, actually was a lawyer in Berlin, well-known.</span> <span id="s239">And he was permitted to go to [unclear] and he said, “He hanged himself in the prison with a belt.”</span> <span id="s240">Which is very unlikely that a German police, in a prison, anyhow, they would allow a prisoner to retain a belt or even shoe laces, you know, whatever they do.</span> <span id="s241">But that’s what the verdict was, and to top it, I remember not too clearly but, about three or four days or maybe later my mother got a notification that “Dr. Britzmannn can be released.</span> <span id="s242">There is no case against him.”</span> <span id="s243">Now, it’s--my brother couldn’t remember that.</span> <span id="s244">So I don’t know how true, it’s whether it’s my imagination or what.</span> <span id="s245">But it’s, it fits in.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">NP: [Unclear].</span> <span id="s247">There was a conflict there.</span> <span id="s248">I mean, as to the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">RB: Oh yes, I mean it, certainly with a suicide.</span> <span id="s250">He wasn’t certainly a suicidal type, and, you know, it’s, that’s what happened and he is buried in Weissensee Friedhof, that’s the Weissensee Cemetery, the Jewish cemetery in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">RB: It’s well-known, it’s huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">NP: But for our transcriber.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">RB: W-E-I-S-S-...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">NP: W-E-I-S-S-...</span></p> <p><span id="s256">RB: E-N-S-E-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">RB: Cemetery, Jewish cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">RB: And I visited that when the Germans invited us, later.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">NP: Later I’d like you...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">RB: So we’ll...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NP: To discuss that.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">RB: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">NP: And so how did the family continue, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">RB: Well, I remember the, my wife [mother] had to sell all the equipment, of course, which she got pennies for, I believe.</span> <span id="s267">And so, and we looked for an apartment on the outside of Berlin.</span> <span id="s268">This was a working class neighborhood.</span> <span id="s269">And she moved to a, the western part of Berlin and had an apartment there.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">NP: Do you know the name of the town?</span> <span id="s271">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s272">RB: Yeah, in Berlin, yeah, Spessartstrasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">NP: And the street?</span> <span id="s274">That’s the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">RB: Yeah, that’s the street, S-P-E-...</span></p> <p><span id="s276">NP: S-P-E-...</span></p> <p><span id="s277">RB: S-S-...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">NP: S-P-E-S-S-...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">RB: A-R-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">NP: A-R-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">RB: Strasse, S-T-R--you know, street.</span> <span id="s282">That’s, the western part of Berlin, Bayrische Viertel or, they call it, you know, the [unclear] quarter.</span> <span id="s283">Anyhow, and there we, my brother and I and, at first, also my grandmother lived with us.</span> <span id="s284">And we stayed there until I emigrated and went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NP: And they had the funds to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">RB: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s287">You know, my parents weren’t rich, I’m sure, but it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s288">NP: They had a savings.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">RB: They had enough to hold out, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">NP: Did you maintain contact during this period with non-Jews?</span> <span id="s291">Neighbors, non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">RB: Very little.</span> <span id="s293">It was interesting, at one time I was friendly with, and my brother was too, with some non-Jews.</span> <span id="s294">My best friend was also a brother of a friend of my brother’s.</span> <span id="s295">And at first his older brother joined the Nazi movement, I don’t know which part of it.</span> <span id="s296">And then soon he, oh, I guess it was 1935, ‘36, he joined the Hitler Youth and that was the end of our friendship.</span> <span id="s297">And so I had Jewish friends, again, the brother of another friend of my brother’s.</span> <span id="s298">We became good friends.</span> <span id="s299">We went on vacation together, to camp, or whatever in the summertimes.</span> <span id="s300">At one time I remember we also went to Denmark with a Jewish group.</span> <span id="s301">But...</span></p> <p><span id="s302">NP: At this time?</span> <span id="s303">At this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">RB: Yeah, about 1936, I would say it was.</span> <span id="s305">And otherwise I, well, that’s not true.</span> <span id="s306">In 19--or earlier, I joined a general swim club, because it was good and I liked swimming.</span> <span id="s307">And in 19--it must have been 1934 then, we went on route marches, all, military training also, apart from the swimming.</span> <span id="s308">And I think that was quite good.</span> <span id="s309">And I got a bronze medal when-- at one time...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">NP: Oh, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">RB: In a race.</span> <span id="s312">But they came to me after.</span> <span id="s313">I was a kid and I didn’t care about route marches and going around, but more in a military

id="s326">RB: Then somebody approached me, he said, “I think you better leave.”</span> <span id="s327">And so then I joined the Jewish swim club [unclear] then.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">NP: And you, what happened to your family during Kristallnacht, which was November of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">RB: ‘38, right.</span> <span id="s330">Well, I was at that time employed as an

Hanscohn.</span> <span id="s349">It was called HACO.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">NP: Hanscohen, C-O-H-E-N?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">RB: C-O-H-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">NP: All

pharmacist?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">RB: Yeah, HACO.</span> <span id="s358">And I worked at this place, and which I quite enjoyed.</span> <span id="s359">At one time we had tried, or at least my parents had tried, to get me into an optics factory where they made microscopes.</span> <span id="s360">Because there was a friend of my father’s, or a patient.</span> <span id="s361">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s362">But it didn’t work out, and so some, I don’t know what connection got me there.</span> <span id="s363">And I worked there, which was quite pleasant.</span> <span id="s364">And then there was a law passed that all Jewish retail establishments had to paint an about six or eight-inch-high letters the name of the, like Hanscohn on the window.</span> <span id="s365">How about that?</span> <span id="s366">Which in other words means, recognize the Jewish place, and then they say, “Don’t Buy From Jews,” and the same old story.</span> <span id="s367">And then came first the--they painted “JEW” across it at night during the-- now I saw it in the evening.</span> <span id="s368">I walked by.</span> <span id="s369">That’s an interesting side line.</span> <span id="s370">We-- they painted it up in red paint, so I got on the phone and called my boss and he came over and we had plenty of turpentine in the store, of course, and we washed it down, the windows.</span> <span id="s371">But the next morning it was up again.</span> <span id="s372">They had come back.</span> <span id="s373">That was prior--see, all these things were methodically planned, and culminated in the November Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s374">Well, anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">NP: Did you witness the...</span></p> <p><span id="s376">RB: I was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">NP: Broken glass?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s379">I was out there, and in fact the--and I do remember a woman walking past one of the stores that had been broken into and telling a little boy, “Go ahead, boy, why don’t you take something?”</span> <span id="s380">In a Berlin accent.</span> <span id="s381">I don’t have to translate it here, but that’s what I want to tell you.</span> <span id="s382">So that’s the...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NP: This was from a..</span> <span id="s384">.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">RB:

id="s389">And the synagogue where I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1934...</span></p> <p><span id="s390">NP: Do you know the name of that synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">RB: Yeah, Prinzregentenstrasse.</span> <span id="s392">That’s called the, let’s not be technical about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">NP: We’ll make it through.</span> <span id="s394">The synagogue of your Bar Mitzvah.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">RB: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">RB: In 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">NP: And the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">RB: Prinzregentenstrasse, P-R-I-N-Z, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">NP: P-R-I-N-Z.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">RB: That’s Prince Regent, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">NP: Oh, Prince Regent.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">RB: Yeah, Regenten.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">RB: Street, S-T-R-...</span></p> <p><span id="s406">NP: So it was the Prince Regent Street Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">RB: Right, which was one of the more fashionable ones at the time, with Rabbi Swarsinski, who I never met again afterwards, but I talked to him in Wisconsin when I was there visiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">NP: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s409">RB: He didn’t have time to see me, but he, soon after that he died, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">NP: And he...</span></p> <p><span id="s411">RB: But he...</span></p> <p><span id="s412">NP: S-W-...</span></p> <p><span id="s413">RB: A-R-S-I-N-S-...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NP: Oh, K-I?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">RB: K--either I or Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">NP: And he was the rabbi at the time.</span> <span id="s417">Was, do you know what kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">RB: Well, but the--the two prominent, fashionable rabbis in Berlin were liberal, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">NP: [Unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s420">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s421">He was not Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">NP: Liberal meaning Reformed?</span> <span id="s423">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s424">RB: No, not Reformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">NP: No, not Reformed?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">RB: It’s more like Conservative here.</span> <span id="s427">And it was he, and the other one was Prinz.</span> <span id="s428">But he was I believe more Orthodox at least.</span> <span id="s429">More right-wingish.</span> <span id="s430">But they were the two fashionable, he was a young rabbi at that time, and then ours, one of ten [unclear] at the same time.</span> <span id="s431">He got at that time...</span></p> <p><span id="s432">NP: Ten?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s434">It was unusual in that way because a lot of people were planning already emigration or something.</span> <span id="s435">And to get them in, and I believe that it’s right.</span> <span id="s436">A lot of synagogues didn’t make it any more.</span> <span id="s437">I don’t know why there were so many.</span> <span id="s438">But that was a huge cathedral-type synagogue, beautiful, and I saw it later burn down too.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">NP: This was burned during Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">RB: Oh, at Kristallnacht, yes, the Prinzregenten...</span></p> <p><span id="s441">NP: The Prince Regent Street Synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s443">There is a story attached to that too.</span> <span id="s444">Do you want that now?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">NP: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">RB: Which happened later.</span> <span id="s447">When I was thrown out of school I was going to what they call Obersekundareife, and I mean four years of high school.</span> <span id="s448">After that, I just barely made that and I think I was the only Jew in class at that time.</span> <span id="s449">Interesting, at the beginning of 1933, ‘34, still in school, they always, every morning instead of, “Good morning, teacher,” it was-- you had to stand up, raise your right arm and say, “Heil Hitler.”</span> <span id="s450">Everybody, including the Jews.</span> <span id="s451">But soon it was made, “Jews are not allowed to say that any more,” which I didn’t mind, of course!</span> <span id="s452">And then I had to leave high school.</span> <span id="s453">I had to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">NP: What, excuse me, I see here written down that at the time that you were at pharmacy school...</span></p> <p><span id="s455">RB: That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">NP: As an apprentice.</span> <span id="s457">Oh, that was later...</span></p> <p><span id="s458">RB: That was later.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">NP: That you attended art school.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">RB: That’s when I was employed by HACO.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">NP: HACO.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">RB: You know, the pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">RB: HACO, and then I had to attend [unclear].</span> <span id="s465">I attended [unclear] pharmacy school, too.</span> <span id="s466">The--what I was going to say?</span> <span id="s467">Oh, I left there.</span> <span id="s468">And of course we were already living at the other-- at the apartment.</span> <span id="s469">You know the apartment...</span></p> <p><span id="s470">NP: In West Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">RB: In West Berlin, yeah, right.</span> <span id="s472">And somehow my brother was enrolled in the private lessons in photography by a Jewish photographer, who lived also [unclear].</span> <span id="s473">And we [unclear] dark room work and...</span></p> <p><span id="s474">NP: And what was the...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">RB: Dark room.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">NP: Dark room, oh dark room.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">RB: Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly that.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">NP: Yes, mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">RB: And my brother had gone to Reimann Kunstschule, which is art school, which later on changed their name to Kunst und Werken.</span> <span id="s480">That means art and work.</span> <span id="s481">It’s not important.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">NP: Art and work?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">RB: Yeah, Kunst und Werk, in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">NP: Kunst meaning?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">RB: But that--well Kunst?</span> <span id="s486">Art.</span> <span id="s487">Kunst is art.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s489">This helps our transcriptionist...</span></p> <p><span id="s490">RB: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">NP: While going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">RB: Well, he was there as a, in painting and sketching and so on.</span> <span id="s493">He was a commercial artist eventually.</span> <span id="s494">And that’s what he was interested in and I loved that.</span> <span id="s495">I wanted to join the, that was after HACO finished.</span> <span id="s496">I was admitted in the photographic section, photography section of the Reimannschule, Reimann.</span> <span id="s497">That was also of Jewish origin.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">RB: The name Reimann, R-E-I-...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">NP: R-E-I-...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">RB: M-A-N-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">NP: M-A--Reimann...</span></p>

That’s that.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">RB: You know, the Reimann Art School.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">RB: That’s just about the best in Berlin at the time, until-- and that’s in--there I was only for a few months, and the teacher, a Miss Barleben, which is also not important...</span></p> <p><span id="s508">NP: Well, Miss B-A-...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">RB: R-L-E-B-E-N...</span></p> <p><span id="s510">NP: Barleben.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">RB: A German, I mean non-Jewish, very pleasant, a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s512">She came over to me and, after they had told me I’d have to leave there too, no more Jews, and said, took me aside and said, “I like your work.</span> <span id="s513">Would you like to work for me in my studio?</span> <span id="s514">Unpaid of course.”</span> <span id="s515">And I grabbed the chance and [unclear].</span> <span id="s516">It was wonderful and I liked her, a nice person.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s518">NP: ...B, and this is Natalie Packel, continuing the interview with Mr. Roger Bryan.</span> <span id="s519">Mr. Bryan, how did the family continue to exist and make a living at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">RB: Well, my father ran, you mean after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NP: Yes, yes, and you’re describing...</span></p> <p><span id="s522">RB: And we had moved to the apart-...</span></p> <p><span id="s523">NP: Are we up to Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">RB: Oh, yeah, I guess so.</span> <span id="s525">Yeah, we’re still there.</span> <span id="s526">One incident, I guess it was after, between ‘38 and ‘39, we got word that the Gestapo was around the neighborhood and it would be a good idea if we didn’t stay at home that--for a couple of nights.</span> <span id="s527">Then my wife had, not my wife, my mother, had--that’s Freudian there, I guess--had friends, non--unmarried, three women, which were safe as far as the Nazis were concerned, at that time at least, and we stayed with them for two nights, my brother and I, stayed with them.</span> <span id="s528">But we never found out whether they, anybody ever came looking for us or...</span></p> <p><span id="s529">NP: If I may, who warned you?</span> <span id="s530">Who forewarned you?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">RB: Well, that’s a good question.</span> <span id="s532">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">NP: Neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">RB: Yeah, I guess it must have been, neighbors, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NP: Non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">RB: My mo--maybe some Jews; my mother knew that, lived around in the general neighborhood, not-- next door neighbors.</span> <span id="s537">But they lived around.</span> <span id="s538">So, you lived on rumors anyway in that town, at that time.</span> <span id="s539">Another thing talking about emigration, naturally we, or everybody else, all other Jews, wanted to get out somehow.</span> <span id="s540">And it was impossible.</span> <span id="s541">My brother had an affidavit to come to the States.</span> <span id="s542">They had long, long waiting lists.</span> <span id="s543">And his number never came up.</span> <span id="s544">I didn’t, he got it from an uncle who was in the professor, not an uncle, a cousin’s hu--my father’s cousin’s husband, a Professor Ttycocziner, in, at the Urbana University.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">NP: The professor’s name, if I may?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">RB: Tycocziner.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">NP: T-I-...</span></p> <p><span id="s548">RB: T-T-Y--I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">NP: T-T-Y?</span> <span

University, U-R-B-A-N-A; it’s in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">NP: All right, and where was this located?</span> <span id="s555">In...</span></p> <p><span id="s556">RB: I don’t know where Urbana is.</span> <span id="s557">It’s in the States, anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">NP: But in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">RB: In the States, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">RB: Anybody in that field would probably know him.</span> <span id="s562">In fact he was the radio specialist in, I think he worked with Fermi sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">NP: With Fermi?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">RB: Fermi, Fermi.</span> <span id="s565">Oh, no, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s566">You better not.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">NP: It’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">RB: [Unclear].</span> <span id="s569">Anyhow, I had never met him.</span> <span id="s570">His wife was my father’s sister or cousin, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s571">Anyhow, he was good enough to give an affidavit.</span> <span id="s572">So my brother with it was to no avail.</span> <span id="s573">It didn’t help him at all, to come through.</span> <span id="s574">And I had nowhere to go.</span> <span id="s575">And this Miss Barleben, who employed me...</span></p> <p><span id="s576">NP: Yes, the art teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">RB: In...</span></p> <p><span id="s578">NP: The art teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">RB: The, no, the photographer.</span> <span id="s580">She had a photo studio where I worked.</span> <span id="s581">I met an, she had an assistant, a non-Jewish, of course, assistant, who was very nice.</span> <span id="s582">In fact she, I still have one photograph she took of me in 1939, I guess.</span> <span id="s583">She had a boyfriend who was an S.S. man, a black S.S. man.</span> <span id="s584">And whenever he came visiting to the studio I had to slip into the darkroom.</span> <span id="s585">O.K.?</span> <span id="s586">So, but she never said a word to him, none.</span> <span id="s587">That’s how it went there.</span> <span id="s588">What I want to say, Miss Barleben had a sister, she was also a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s589">And again, everything worked on the “q.t.,” who had friends by the name of Parnofsky, who I didn’t know--only by name, in Berlin, who were ready to emigrate.</span> <span id="s590">And apparently they were very wealthy.</span> <span id="s591">And they, by I don’t know what means, they transferred a lot of money by the way of Switzerland to England or wherever.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">NP: And this was Miss Barleben’s sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">RB: Sister, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">NP: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">RB: Oh, no, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s596">NP: Her sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">RB: Yeah, sister, yeah, friend.</span> <span id="s598">And she, this Ilze Barleben, that’s the-- you know, arranged, because, I needed a deposit in a British bank of 100 pounds, in order to get into Britain as a trainee.</span> <span id="s599">That means young person to take a job that pays at least 30 shillings a week and 100 pounds, British pounds, deposited in a bank for security.</span> <span id="s600">Now through the, this person...</span></p> <p><span id="s601">NP: This...</span></p> <p><span id="s602">RB: Was some way...</span></p> <p><span id="s603">NP: This Parnofsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">RB: Parnofsky, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">NP: Who was related to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">RB: Who I never met.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">NP: Barlebens.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">RB: Yeah, who had arrangements for manipulating money or something or other.</span> <span id="s609">We sent, and this is a cloak and dagger story.</span> <span id="s610">I met a man at the corner of actually Prinzregentenstrasse, on there, one day, by, prearranged, had cash in a box, photographic paper box.</span> <span id="s611">The, I believe it was about 600 Marks, German Marks, to give it to him in order to get it transferred to Britain.</span> <span id="s612">Now, I didn’t know the man.</span> <span id="s613">I didn’t know who he was.</span> <span id="s614">I had anyhow a sign.</span> <span id="s615">I met him in the street, gave him the box, and that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s616">But within a week we got a telegram from London, “Guarantee available,” which means that the money had arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">NP: And this was in 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">RB: This was in 1939, and the Woburn House, and who looked after refugees...</span></p>

<p><span id="s623">NP: Oh, Woburn.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">NP: Yeah, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">RB: B-U-R-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">NP: That’s what we have.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">RB: U-R-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">NP: U-R-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">RB: Woburn House in...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">NP: I do re-...</span></p> <p><span id="s634">RB: London, yeah.</span> <span id="s635">Well, the committee [unclear] people over who worked with us there.</span> <span id="s636">And they had arranged--they got this from the--the arrangement with the British government that it can be done.</span> <span id="s637">But I didn’t have a job that paid 30 shillings a week.</span> <span id="s638">So a former girlfriend of mine, who had left for England, went around photographic studios and see if she could get me a job that paid 30 shillings a week.</span> <span id="s639">She hit on one guy in Whitechapel, which is a Jewish section of...</span></p> <p><span id="s640">NP: Waite?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">RB: London.</span> <span id="s642">White.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">NP: Whitechapel.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">RB: Mmm hmm, that’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s645">NP: Was this a Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">RB: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s647">I, well, yes, so she is.</span> <span id="s648">[chuckles] So, anyhow, she went around.</span> <span id="s649">And she hit on one guy at Studio Suss, S-U-S-S, in Whitechapel, who said yes, he’s willing to help, but he can only afford to pay 15 shillings a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">NP: What was that equivalent to, do you know, at that time?</span> <span id="s651">Not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">RB: No, it was, maybe even at that time a dollar here is quite different--what it is now about 50 years later.</span> <span id="s653">Anyhow, it’s not too much.</span> <span id="s654">So anyhow, here is the interesting part.</span> <span id="s655">A non-Jewish friend of my mother’s in Berlin, who was again a wonderful person--I’ve taken her photograph--I still have the photograph of her before--through her travel had befriended an English woman by the name of Louisa Howey.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">NP: H-O-W-E?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">RB: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s658">E-Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">NP: Oh, Louisa H-O-W-E-Y, O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">RB: Who lived in Watford [phonetic] in, near Harrow, London.</span> <span id="s661">Anyhow, this woman said, “I agree to keep him here, house him and feed him,” so on and forth.</span> <span id="s662">And the Woburn House agreed that this would be sufficient to make up for the other 15 shillings a week.</span> <span id="s663">So, it was touch and go.</span> <span id="s664">And I never went to see this Suss.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">RB: Like Jew Suss.</span> <span id="s667">There is a book called Jew Süss.</span> <span id="s668">Anyhow, there is a photographer in the studio and you know because it was ridiculous that the traveling costs would have cost me as much as that.</span> <span id="s669">And through this Louisa Howey, somehow I got a job with the Photostat division of Kodak in London.</span> <span id="s670">I mean, not much of a job; it paid about 25 shillings a week.</span> <span id="s671">But I was happy, and it was Photostat, it was at least the smell of high point developer.</span> <span id="s672">This is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">NP: Stimulating.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">RB: And I worked, and I, yeah, and a good break for me.</span> <span id="s675">And actually that’s where probably I improved my English.</span> <span id="s676">I..</span> <span id="s677">.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">NP: If I may...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">NP: Your mother, did she stay in West Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">RB: She stayed there, you know, and as soon as war, I got out about five, six weeks before war broke out.</span> <span id="s682">Then that severed all mail connection with Britain.</span> <span id="s683">And I couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s684">So she wrote only to my brother in Chile.</span> <span id="s685">He was on the high seas when war broke out, on the way to Chile.</span> <span id="s686">But she corresponded with him and I’ve still got, the peculiar thing, my brother sent me those letters, typed letters, some of them years later.</span> <span id="s687">I started reading and I haven’t got the heart.</span> <span id="s688">Anyway...</span></p> <p><span id="s689">NP: So you were with Kodak...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">RB: I was with Kodak for a while, yes.</span> <span id="s691">They were nice to me and they--until “enemy aliens” in Britain had to report for registration and eventually, on the 16th of May I believe it was, a guy came to the door, police.</span> <span id="s692">A report was taken there and no way of getting out of it.</span> <span id="s693">[unclear] I had a friend who worked at the home office somewhere where--“Oh, it won’t even be for a short while.”</span> <span id="s694">[Unclear] anyhow.</span> <span id="s695">Then I went to, you know I worked on the [unclear] barracks.</span> <span id="s696">They put us in different camps.</span> <span id="s697">[Unclear].</span> <span id="s698">And then the Dunera, now that’s another long...</span></p> <p><span id="s699">NP: This is the ship...</span></p> <p><span id="s700">RB: The ship, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">NP: That you were on.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">RB: HMT Dunera.</span> <span id="s703">That was a converted troop ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">NP: Excuse me, that was HMT, and then I, you showed...</span></p> <p><span id="s705">RB: Here.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">NP: Mr. Bryan is showing me a book, whose title is The Dunera Scandal, by Cyril Pearl, “A deplorable and regrettable mistake.”</span> <span id="s707">-Winston Churchill</span></p> <p><span id="s708">RB: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">NP: About the Dunera, and where were you heading at this time, at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">RB: Well that’s a peculiar story too.</span> <span id="s711">We were herded onto the ship.</span> <span id="s712">First of all, the married people said, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s713">Women and children will follow on another transport soon,” which of course never did.</span> <span id="s714">Another ship, the Arandora Star...</span></p> <p><span id="s715">NP: Aran--A-R-A-N-...</span></p> <p><span id="s716">RB: D-O-R-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">NP: D-O-R-A.</span> <span id="s718">Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">RB: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">NP: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">RB: On the--was torpedoed, and they lost more than half the people.</span> <span id="s722">They were partly German prisoners of war, and partly German refugees, internees.</span> <span id="s723">And I think two--I know I’ve got the numbers here, but were lost at sea.</span> <span id="s724">And they put them back on the Dunera about a week later and--these people--on the boat.</span> <span id="s725">And we, it was at least 90% Jews--German, Austrian, maybe a few, a mixed crowd and a few non-Jews, Germans they are, ex-Communists and what, and had escaped from Hitler.</span> <span id="s726">When we were embarking at Liverpool, the, they stood there, guards around us, and as soon as we got onto the ship, they took all belongings away from us.</span> <span id="s727">They ripped the cases and then people--papers, photographs--were thrown overboard.</span> <span id="s728">And so a couple of people were punched because they didn’t move fast enough.</span> <span id="s729">And it was our British “brethren.”</span></p> <p><span id="s730">NP: All by the British brethren.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">RB: And the ship, we were behind barbed wire for eight weeks.</span> <span id="s732">On the way, which we thought to...</span></p> <p><span id="s733">NP: In the ship itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s735">The--we were told, oh, by rumor, that this is going to Canada, the ship, or the U.S. Anyhow, we went on the Irish Sea the second night.</span> <span id="s736">A torpedo hit us, but it didn’t explode.</span> <span id="s737">There were two noises, resonations or bumps, whatever they were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">NP: By whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">RB: Ger--well, this came out, of course, later on.</span> <span id="s740">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s741">But there was no explosion, except there was panic.</span> <span id="s742">They had Italian and German prisoners, above us, on a deck above us.</span> <span id="s743">And they tried to pull down some of the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s744">And the troops threatened to shoot them.</span> <span id="s745">And they, anyhow, later on it came out, by a German U-boat command, but how true all this is has never been proven, that they shot a torpedo at us and it didn’t go off.</span> <span id="s746">It went underneath...</span></p> <p><span id="s747">NP: The British ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">RB: The ship.</span> <span id="s749">No, no, no, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">NP: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">RB: The Germans, yeah, submarine.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NP: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">RB: And the sea was pretty rough and they zig-zagged along and avoided them, without convoy.</span> <span id="s754">The convoy had left because the faster ships could go without convoy.</span> <span id="s755">And eventually, after days, it got warmer and warmer and we said, “This isn’t gonna be Canada.”</span> <span id="s756">You know, it was the coast of Africa.</span> <span id="s757">We went through [unclear] the Gold Coast down there.</span> <span id="s758">And then there was the war against the French at Dakar at the time.</span> <span id="s759">And the one for, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">NP: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s761">The condition of the ship, the food, the sleeping facilities...</span></p> <p><span id="s762">RB: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">NP: The sanitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">RB: Terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s765">The only thing in my favor was that I was young.</span> <span id="s766">There were a lot of young fellows.</span> <span id="s767">And partly we took it as a great adventure, for what it was.</span> <span id="s768">It’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s769">NP: Did you have something to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s771">The food was terrible, as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s772">Soup.</span> <span id="s773">And the hygienic facility was terrible.</span> <span id="s774">They put buckets in there, and when the sea was rough you can imagine what happened.</span> <span id="s775">And sleeping, we--it was so overcrowded, it was--I’ve got the figures if you want.</span> <span id="s776">I mean, we can look it up later.</span> <span id="s777">About three times as many on the ship as it was designed for.</span> <span id="s778">We slept, first some on the floor, some on benches, some on the mess table.</span> <span id="s779">The mess tables mostly were passing through the floor.</span> <span id="s780">And then they brought out some hammocks.</span> <span id="s781">I slept first on the--on a bench.</span> <span id="s782">And then let some other internee to, an older man--he couldn’t handle the hammocks.</span> <span id="s783">So I got a hammock, which was a lot better.</span> <span id="s784">And I slept in a hammock.</span> <span id="s785">And conditions were just impossible, which I described in my book and [unclear] from here.</span> <span id="s786">The worst thing, well not the worst, it was generally terrible.</span> <span id="s787">And then we got one piece of soap for ten people to last three weeks or something like that.</span> <span id="s788">And then they had taken every--they had stolen everything--jewelry, passports, emigration papers--people had thrown overboard.</span> <span id="s789">And I was in one incident that was funny.</span> <span id="s790">And I carried an attaché case.</span> <span id="s791">And Louisa Howey had sent me for my birthday, for my, that was my 19th birthday, on the Isle of Man.</span> <span id="s792">She said, “What can I send you?”</span> <span id="s793">I said, “Send me my Boy Scout’s uniform.”</span> <span id="s794">I had joined the Boy Scouts in London.</span> <span id="s795">But Rover Scouts, that’s, it was over 18.</span> <span id="s796">And, “Send me that.”</span> <span id="s797">And she sent me that.</span> <span id="s798">And some food and some sardines and something else to eat or too, I believe some candy.</span> <span id="s799">And yeah, shaving equipment.</span> <span id="s800">Anyhow, then I took that in my attaché case.</span> <span id="s801">They took that away from me too, of course.</span> <span id="s802">But it was kept behind barbed wire on the deck, near where we were looking out.</span> <span id="s803">And one of the--it was a former judge of the internees, was walking with a cane.</span> <span id="s804">So when the guar--went the other way, they were going up and down watching, I saw my case on top of the heap, some of it, all the other luggage.</span> <span id="s805">And I asked him, “Can I borrow your cane?”</span> <span id="s806">Two of my friends held the barbed wire apart.</span> <span id="s807">I pulled the case in.</span> <span id="s808">Everything was fine.</span> <span id="s809">Oh yes, a couple of books were in there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">NP: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s811">RB: Paperbacks, which was very good on the way.</span> <span id="s812">We had something to read.</span> <span id="s813">And I got this and distributed whatever we could eat from the case.</span> <span id="s814">And I was fortunate, one of the few to get toothpaste or something.</span> <span id="s815">But of course that didn’t last too long either.</span> <span id="s816">The washing, we only could only wash with salt water was in there.</span> <span id="s817">And not enough to eat, not enough to drink, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s818">It was [phone ringing] I can give that to you to read if you like.</span> <span id="s819">And at last and then we got to Cape Town, so we knew for sure [chuckling].</span> <span id="s820">[Unclear]and some of the soldiers absconded, didn’t get back on time.</span> <span id="s821">They were loaded with jewelry, which they had stolen from us, and money, too, things like that some of them had.</span> <span id="s822">And got drunk and never made the ship back.</span> <span id="s823">And then we went across the Indian Ocean.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">NP: Did you stay long in South Africa?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">RB: In, what, the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">RB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">NP: You just came...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">RB: Just, just overnight or...</span></p> <p><span id="s830">NP: Went there...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">RB: Two nights, maybe.</span> <span id="s832">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s833">It was a beautiful view from the ship as we left from Cape Town, but first we were up on the Gold Coast and then we put on some water, eventually, we got from somewhere.</span> <span id="s834">And then we started across the Indian Ocean.</span> <span id="s835">And somehow they got newspapers, [unclear], somewhere from the-- and it says, “Raiders in Indian Ocean,” which means German ships were in, submarines, [unclear], whatever.</span> <span id="s836">And the Germans, up above the deck above us, the German prisoners, saw this, and we found out later they tried to give signals in the sea where at night, putting light, you know, through the bulls-eyes.</span> <span id="s837">But nothing, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s838">We got across and the Germans and Italians, the prisoners of war, were taken off.</span> <span id="s839">We stopped at Perth, yeah, Perth, and then Adelaide, and they were taken off there.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">NP: A-D-E--Adelaide?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">RB: Ade--Adeliede, D-E-L-I-E-D-E.</span> <span id="s842">[Adelaide]</span></p> <p><span id="s843">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">RB: They were taken off, fortunately we [unclear] to another camp.</span> <span id="s845">And we went on to...</span></p> <p><span id="s846">NP: Do you know the name of the camps that they were taken to or...</span></p> <p><span id="s847">RB: I think Tatura.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">NP: T-A-...</span></p> <p><span id="s849">RB: T-U-R-A.</span> <span id="s850">Maybe there was another camp also.</span> <span id="s851">I can look it up in this book.</span> <span id="s852">Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s853">NP: The prisoners were sent.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">RB: The, yeah, prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">NP: German and Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">RB: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">NP: Prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">RB: Yeah, they were taken off, yeah.</span> <span id="s859">It’s maybe, I don’t know, it’s possibly--we had our leaders.</span> <span id="s860">There were some very young ones, anyhow, complained which you know, how the only decent person on the British side was the medical officer.</span> <span id="s861">And he tried to help a little bit.</span> <span id="s862">And he got several doctors aboard and he helped in sick bay and so forth.</span> <span id="s863">On the, I think, two people got, one jumped overboard on the day that his visa expired.</span> <span id="s864">And another one, I think they had a fight with another one and he had a heart attack and died on board ship.</span> <span id="s865">He, I..</span> <span id="s866">.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">NP: Were there any children on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">RB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">NP: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">RB: No, well, unless you call 15--16-year-olds children.</span> <span id="s871">Sure, now.</span> <span id="s872">I was 19.</span> <span id="s873">And I eventually, I don’t know how, I got a job in the galley, preparing food.</span> <span id="s874">That was already--but I don’t know how I got it.</span> <span id="s875">Yeah, got there and helped there, and of course you got fed properly, more quantity anyway.</span> <span id="s876">And when we got to Sydney Harbor we saw the bridge, the [unclear].</span> <span id="s877">We in the kitchen, we threw all the kitchen equipment overboard.</span> <span id="s878">Reactions!</span></p> <p><span id="s879">NP: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">RB: And, well there...</span></p> <p><span id="s881">NP: How many days were you aboard ship, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">RB: I probably, I could look it up.</span> <span id="s883">But it’s about eight weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">NP: Eight weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">RB: Eight weeks, under those conditions.</span> <span id="s886">You know, I don’t, no change.</span> <span id="s887">We wash our underwear in salt water once in a while and we have to wait till it dries.</span> <span id="s888">And it’s a lot of detailed stories which actually later on worse then.</span> <span id="s889">They took it to court in London and they made a long report and so on.</span> <span id="s890">That’s where the quotation comes also, you know, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s891">NP: From Winston Churchill?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">RB: Winston Churchill, well I guess he made...</span></p> <p><span id="s893">NP: From the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">RB: Yeah, that, well the book quoted him...</span></p> <p><span id="s895">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">RB: That it was a “deplorable mistake” interning us, altogether.</span> <span id="s897">So anyway, and there the Australian troops, they expected prisoners of war, yeah, [unclear] but they soon found out.</span> <span id="s898">They were very nice, very pleasant.</span> <span id="s899">And we got on a train to go west.</span> <span id="s900">This is all the other end of New South Wales.</span> <span id="s901">And they gave us box lunches and went on and eventually they, very talkative and right, the guide, and they couldn’t understand the whole situation.</span> <span id="s902">And very helpful and in a way.</span> <span id="s903">In one case one of the soldiers said, one of, “Well here lad, hold my gun,” his rifle, for a while, whilst he rolled a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">NP: They were trusting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">RB: Oh, yeah, eventually.</span> <span id="s906">We talked to them and they were human, Menschen, you know, and the others were what we call a Auswurf [an undesirable person].</span> <span id="s907">You know what it means?</span> <span id="s908">The...</span></p> <p><span id="s909">NP: Auswurf?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">RB: Auswurf?</span> <span id="s911">You know this word?</span> <span id="s912">Yeah, that’s Yiddish [German].</span></p> <p><span id="s913">NP: A--how shall we spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">RB: Ah, you don’t need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">RB: Now they were partly the retired and ex-retired soldiers, well, not a retired, a low medical grade or they couldn’t--had been on the front and partly wounded.</span> <span id="s917">They were disgruntled and partly, some of them are being evacuated from Europe too, and, at Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s918">You know the history.</span> <span id="s919">And they made all sorts of excuses afterwards, but the worst one was one of the commanding officers of the squad that was court-martialed later on, regardless.</span> <span id="s920">So on that trip to--which of course is quite interesting to us--we happened to be away from the ship in a friendly country at least and we saw kangaroos jumping along the railroad and it’s interesting.</span> <span id="s921">Sixteen hours on the train, we went to Hay, New South Wales.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">NP: To where?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">RB: Hay, H-A-Y.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">NP: Hay, New South Wales?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">RB: Sydney is New South Wales, but which is part of Australia.</span> <span id="s928">And that was just the edge of the desert, four miles from the desert.</span> <span id="s929">And as we got there the first night right away we experienced a sand storm.</span> <span id="s930">And one of the soldiers on horseback and that was wild west for us, anyway.</span> <span id="s931">And the camps were prepared in a desolate part.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">NP: So very different from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s934">But any young can take it much easier.</span> <span id="s935">And later on we had friends and...</span></p> <p><span id="s936">NP: If I may, did you have any news while on board ship or once you landed, of what was happening in the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">RB: It’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s938">NP: As far as...</span></p> <p><span id="s939">RB: Well, I don’t think they had...</span></p> <p><span id="s940">NP: Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">RB: They, no, no.</span> <span id="s942">In fact, nobody even in England knew much about what was going on in the camps and so forth.</span> <span id="s943">And those that knew didn’t tell.</span> <span id="s944">If you read the book, The Abandonment of the Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s945">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">RB: Then you know what happened.</span> <span id="s947">The ones that knew, didn’t say.</span> <span id="s948">And, no, we had no, till we, even when we got into the camp, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s949">NP: In Australia you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">RB: In Australia, at Hay, behind barbed wire again...</span></p> <p><span id="s951">NP: Behind barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">RB: Yes, with the Aussie troops and with a guard tower with a machine gun on top, but they just followed orders, and they were very pleasant later on.</span> <span id="s953">The camp, camp life in it’s--excuse me, in itself, was getting organized very well.</span> <span id="s954">We had very many capable persons, scientists and we...</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s956">NP: ...two, July the 9th, 1996.</span> <span id="s957">This is Natalie Packel, interviewing Mr. Roger Bryan.</span> <span id="s958">[tape off then on] Mr. Bryan, would you continue to describe your life in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">RB: In Australia.</span> <span id="s960">Now, as far as Australia is concerned, we never got out of the camp except once was an excursion to the Murrumbidgee River, which is nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">NP: M-A-R-A-M?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">RB: M-U-...</span></p> <p><span id="s963">NP: M-U--Muram, bigee, B-I?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">RB: B-I-G-E-E.</span> <span id="s965">Something [Murrumbidgee].</span> <span id="s966">An aboriginal name, I guess.</span> <span id="s967">The river, that was exhilarating because it was a change of scenery and we could swim in the river and there were eucalyptus trees on either side of the river.</span> <span id="s968">And that was quite an experience.</span> <span id="s969">I had various jobs in the camp.</span> <span id="s970">At one time I was a gardener for the Australian commander, his house, around his house.</span> <span id="s971">And that was another opportunity to get out of the camp.</span> <span id="s972">Then, in the camp, I was a mess orderly at one time.</span> <span id="s973">Then I was a medical assistant, somewhere, as a nurse, a male nurse sometimes.</span> <span id="s974">Then I had a job in the kitchen helping.</span> <span id="s975">As a matter of fact, apart from the excellent camp university that developed, because we had many doctors and scientists and lawyers among us, there were some excellent cooks and bak- [tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s976">NP: And so there were excellent cooks and bakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">RB: Yes, and that benefited us.</span> <span id="s978">And we had good chemists too.</span> <span id="s979">Because we, with all the load of mutton, they had a lot of fat.</span> <span id="s980">And he managed to get some chemicals and made soap out of the sheep’s fat, which helped.</span> <span id="s981">It--the activities--but the most important activities were, of course, the camp university.</span> <span id="s982">And I took some English classes there.</span> <span id="s983">And a couple of poems I still remember to this day that I..</span> <span id="s984">.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">NP: Poems?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">RB: Poems, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">RB: One by Milton on his blindness.</span> <span id="s989">I still remember it fully.</span> <span id="s990">And Longfellow, which I do remember as a young fellow.</span> <span id="s991">Well, anyhow, that, and I remember lectures by an Austrian, Doctor Eirich.</span> <span id="s992">He was an atomic scientist.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">NP: Doctor...</span></p> <p><span id="s994">RB: Eirich.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">NP: I-R-I-S-H?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">RB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">NP: I-...</span></p> <p><span id="s998">RB: E-I-...</span></p> <p><span id="s999">NP: E-I-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">RB: R-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">RB: I-C-H.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">NP: Eirich.</span> <span id="s1004">He was an atomic scientist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">RB: He was an atomic scientist.</span> <span id="s1006">We had a Doctor Wolf, he was a chemist.</span> <span id="s1007">We had industrialists.</span> <span id="s1008">We had...</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">NP: And the countries of their origin, do you know?</span> <span id="s1010">Dr. Wolf, Dr. Eirich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">RB: Germany, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">NP: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">RB: No, Eirich is Austrian.</span> <span id="s1014">I think he’s still around.</span> <span id="s1015">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s1016">And that helped a lot, because mail was terrible in the beginning and we were--had a pro forma sheet only to use, “don’t write between the lines.”</span> <span id="s1017">And certain things to add and certain were limited in how much you could write and how often you could write.</span> <span id="s1018">That changed eventually and one day, or it was after several weeks I think, we got mail in.</span> <span id="s1019">And I got...</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">NP: Did you hear from your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">RB: Eventually.</span> <span id="s1022">I got mail from England from, actually the friend of Louisa Howey’s who got me into the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s1023">He wrote me that Louisa died in an air raid.</span> <span id="s1024">The house where we lived was bombed with a direct hit.</span> <span id="s1025">And that was tough to take at the time because we’d gotten pretty close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">NP: It was a loss for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">NP: And so this was in 19-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">RB: It so happens that I had everything.</span> <span id="s1030">I still had there and photographic equipment and I lost it of course with the house.</span> <span id="s1031">And the raids were going on--on London.</span> <span id="s1032">We heard what the situation was there.</span> <span id="s1033">About Germany, of course, we didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s1034">I heard from my brother directly or, I don’t know whether he sent me on any letters that my mother had written to him, but she was always concerned about me, the “Das Kind,” the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">NP: Of course.</span> <span id="s1036">And your grandmother at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">RB: They, I knew, I guess I must have heard it through my brother.</span> <span id="s1038">They had put her in an old age home in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1039">But she died there eventually.</span> <span id="s1040">I don’t know any details or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">NP: The Archive at Gratz College has a Gedenkbuch...</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">RB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">NP: Which took about 20 years to compile.</span> <span id="s1044">They are, listed in there are names of families that lived in all parts of Germany and what eventually happened to them.</span> <span id="s1045">Some are--their whereabouts are unknown, but if they perished or where they were transported, that’s all listed.</span> <span id="s1046">If that might be of any help to you in any way...</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">RB: Well, it may be worth checking in.</span> <span id="s1048">The German government asked us to, I mean they gave all those [the camp University], the Berlin government anyway, wherever you originated, invited us in.</span> <span id="s1049">Lore, how long, what year was it?</span> <span id="s1050">Oh, she isn’t there, makes no difference.</span> <span id="s1051">Anyhow, it must have been eight, nine years ago--I can check it--to come.</span> <span id="s1052">The first year we turned them down.</span> <span id="s1053">We didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1054">We didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1055">They wrote again the following year, and we said, “Look, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1056">And at least I can do the cemetery and see what...” And then we did.</span> <span id="s1057">And it’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">NP: What year was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">RB: About eight years...</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">NP: About eight years, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">RB: About eight, yeah.</span> <span id="s1062">In the eighties, somewhere, well, maybe in, I can...</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">NP: Were there any neighbors that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">RB: No.</span> <span id="s1065">No, I’ll tell you something else that’s, I mean, at other times before that actually when I , well what--or do you want to continue chronologically?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">NP: Well, perhaps we’ll backtrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">RB: You want to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">NP: Yes, that would be good.</span> <span id="s1069">That would be good.</span> <span id="s1070">And so you were at the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">RB: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">NP: University.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">RB: I took on and off in case it, yeah, it can be relaxed.</span> <span id="s1074">I regret actually that I didn’t spend more time in that way.</span> <span id="s1075">And we get lazy and we’d play around with the kids.</span> <span id="s1076">And they had football teams and soccer teams rather, there, and whatnot, and shows, which were produced and actually written in the camp by someone there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">NP: What were, do you remember some of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">RB: Ray Martin was one of the guys that’s well-known.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">NP: A producer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">RB: Yeah, he was a producer and I guess he was an actor later on, too, and a movie director.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">NP: Do you remember the name of some of the shows, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">RB: Yeah, I, and they wrote poems, a lot of poetry were written in their hey days or gay days and.</span> <span id="s1083">actually making fun of the situation.</span> <span id="s1084">But it was very, some very good pianists we had there and also the officers, the Australian officers were invited and they came and enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1085">And I mean the people, the internees knew how to make it livable conditions.</span> <span id="s1086">Otherwise, the food improved, and well, they couldn’t improve the weather, but anyhow it was, anyhow people wanted to get out and occasionally one or two managed to get-- make use of a visa that they had or whatever.</span> <span id="s1087">And the transport eventually, then there came word that you may be allowed to join the British Army, the Pioneer Corps, and that’s one way of getting back to Britain, which was being bombed at that time.</span> <span id="s1088">So I considered, I didn’t, I applied only because I wanted to get out in the worst way, whatever plan it was.</span> <span id="s1089">And there, one small transport, a few left, and one was sunk, with a loss of life.</span> <span id="s1090">I don’t know if I can find out the details.</span> <span id="s1091">But ours was the Sterling Castle, a British ship, eventually.</span> <span id="s1092">And this time, no barbed wire.</span> <span id="s1093">And we...</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">NP: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1095">If I may...</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">RB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">NP: Back up a little.</span> <span id="s1098">Before you left, or all of the time that you were in the camp in Australia, did anyone come from the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">RB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">NP: To--they did, to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">RB: We had some visit-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">NP: Organize?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">RB: Well, the first one...</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">NP: Well, did you hear of, oh, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">RB: The first one I remember was a Reverend Twig.</span> <span id="s1106">He was non-Jewish, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">NP: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">RB: And he was also a Boy Scout leader.</span> <span id="s1109">And he, therefore, he talked to us and he, I believe he gave us, sent us some items which we wanted in the end, or needed.</span> <span id="s1110">And I personally didn’t see any other from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1111">Funny thing happened, it was known, of course, to the Jews in Melbourne and Sydney.</span> <span id="s1112">And in the Melbourne community, eventually, I got a letter from Ilse Dreyfus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">NP: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">RB: From Berlin.</span> <span id="s1115">Ilse, L--Ilse, E-L-S-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">NP: Oh E-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">RB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">NP: That’s I-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">RB: No, no, that’s right, I-L-S-E, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">NP: All right.</span> <span id="s1121">Here we go.</span> <span id="s1122">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">RB: Dreyfus.</span> <span id="s1124">And she said that, I believe that she saw my name on the list of internees that they had at the community center or whatever.</span> <span id="s1125">And is there anything that she could do for me?</span> <span id="s1126">But this Dreyfus was a member of the same dancing school I attended in Berlin when we went dancing.</span> <span id="s1127">You know, ballroom dancing.</span> <span id="s1128">And it was really funny.</span> <span id="s1129">I never saw her, and I wrote back and I thanked her, I believe, and that I didn’t need anything.</span> <span id="s1130">And I lost contact with her.</span> <span id="s1131">But it was rather--I don’t know what year I really took dancing school.</span> <span id="s1132">It must have been in ‘37, ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">NP: But bef--ORT, the organization, ORT...</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">RB: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">NP: Or HIAS, Joint Distribution Committee, were they in contact with...</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">RB: I believe eventually but...</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">NP: Not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">RB: Not with me personally.</span> <span id="s1139">I had no...</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">RB: Contact with--they had certain--well they used to, the British government when they sent a major in--who happened to be Jewish too--oh, what’s his name?</span> <span id="s1142">I can look it up too.</span> <span id="s1143">I have it on record [Major Julian Layton].</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">NP: It’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">RB: And he got things moving.</span> <span id="s1146">And especially with the court, we took them to court and they got court-martials, the officers, from the Dunera ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">NP: Who took them to court?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">RB: Well, the British government, but it took a long time.</span> <span id="s1149">And we, lawyers, got together and wrote a long detailed report about the treatment.</span> <span id="s1150">And one day, in fact we got delivery, luggage, to the camp.</span> <span id="s1151">It was all torn cases and most of the stuff, and no valuables.</span> <span id="s1152">Of course, they were missing.</span> <span id="s1153">It’s pretty rough the way it was.</span> <span id="s1154">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">NP: Could you describe your next journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">RB: Yes, well, that’s-- that only took five weeks back to England.</span> <span id="s1157">We went through the Panama Canal, a different route, through the Panama Canal then, and, well, we were free on board, aboard ship.</span> <span id="s1158">Not FOB.</span> <span id="s1159">And that was, we were over 150 of us or so.</span> <span id="s1160">And we got to England and went to Ilfracombe in Devon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">NP: I-L...</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">RB: F-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">NP: F-R-E?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">RB: No, F-R-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">NP: F-R-A...</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">RB: C-O-M-B-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">NP: M-B-E, in Devon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">RB: In the south of England.</span> <span id="s1171">And then there we, there was an induction center and training for about four weeks for the British Army, for the non-combatant unit, the Pioneer Corps, which had, other than the Jewish refugees that they finally admitted, they were the dregs of the army.</span> <span id="s1172">I, in fact, when I was, my first station was to Glasgow, Scotland.</span> <span id="s1173">And the sergeant we had there, who was a Scotsman, and he had been in the trash disposal unit for the city of Paisley, I think, which is just outside of Glasgow.</span> <span id="s1174">So that’s the account.</span> <span id="s1175">He wasn’t a bad guy, but not a brain surgeon.</span> <span id="s1176">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">NP: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">RB: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">NP: Where, were you shipped somewhere then or what were your duties at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">RB: There in Scotland, in the Pioneer Corps, we were employed mostly in building camps, army camps, erecting huts.</span> <span id="s1181">And most of our job, most of the time, was wheeling concrete and making, I mean, tough, very tiring, from morning to night and [unclear] machines.</span> <span id="s1182">And also building them and eventually I got a--I passed a test for carpentry, which gave me a little extra pay--good.</span> <span id="s1183">And then we had a job in town to paint some [unclear] hall somewhere in town.</span> <span id="s1184">And I went out with that group but I, eventually, I made lunch.</span> <span id="s1185">Well, lunch, made tea, at the canteen there.</span> <span id="s1186">The Salvation Army had a canteen and we got friendly and I ended up in--making three-course meals for our guys.</span> <span id="s1187">So that I didn’t have to paint then.</span> <span id="s1188">That lasted a while.</span> <span id="s1189">And then we moved.</span> <span id="s1190">In the meantime, the first night, the first weekend, we went to the Jewish Institute in Glasgow, who had, I guess it was a Sunday, for our boys in the forces, you know, entertainers, the food and drink and the dance.</span> <span id="s1191">And then I said to a friend of mine, “I’m gonna dance with her.”</span> <span id="s1192">That was it!</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">NP: The rest is history!</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">RB: Well, the funny thing is my wife, later she became my wife, said to her girlfriend there, “Oh yes, I danced with one of the boys that came just back from Australia,” meaning, came from Australia, not knowing my history, my background, which we cleared up afterwards.</span> <span id="s1195">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">NP: Could you describe the Jewish community in Glasgow?</span> <span id="s1197">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">RB: Well that, yeah, that was a fairly large community, a few thousand, and several synagogues and I got into that after I got out of the army, in the army, because in photography, I eventually with a partner, we started a firm there later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">NP: If I may back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">NP: When were you out of the army, with the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">RB: That took a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">NP: It did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">RB: Yes.</span> <span id="s1205">I went from there--we had several stations in different places in England.</span> <span id="s1206">In fact, I came back to Glasgow in order to get married and got a special leave in September, ‘43.</span> <span id="s1207">And on my wife’s 21st birthday.</span> <span id="s1208">I thought you may be interested to know I was 22, in uniform, and we had three rabbonim.</span> <span id="s1209">One nice old man with a gray beard, Rabbi Atlas, and one British Army...</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">NP: Chaplain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">RB: Chaplain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">NP: Chaplain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">RB: Chaplain, and one Polish army chaplain.</span> <span id="s1214">I don’t know why he was there.</span> <span id="s1215">Somebody with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">NP: Any names that you might remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">RB: Not the others, no, no.</span> <span id="s1218">I don’t remember any of those names.</span> <span id="s1219">My, oh well, it’s a funny incident if you want, are interested.</span> <span id="s1220">My--Lore’s uncle, that’s her reason for being in Glasgow...</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">RB: She was evacuated from Liverpool where she lived.</span> <span id="s1223">It was a protected area near the ocean, so she went to live with the uncle in Glasgow and he arranged more or less the wedding, who was there.</span> <span id="s1224">And he told me, “It’s a good idea if you learn the Harae-at-Mekudeshet-Lee,” you know, the vows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">RB: So I did.</span> <span id="s1227">I didn’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s1228">And when we stood under the chuppah [traditional wedding canopy]and Rabbi Atlas started Harae-at, I continued, instead of waiting to repeat, I said the whole Harae-at-Mekudeshet-Lee.</span> <span id="s1229">I know it now!</span> <span id="s1230">And he turned to one of the other rabbis and he said, “A Gelernter [Yiddish for a learned man]?”</span> <span id="s1231">Which I guess you know what it means.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">NP: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">RB: And it was embarrassing in a way, but a good laugh afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">NP: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">RB: That was at a kosher hotel in Glasgow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">NP: In Glasgow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">RB: In Glasgow, the Queen Hotel in Glasgow, in the--it doesn’t exist anymore.</span> <span id="s1238">In the Jewish section, like Whitechapel in London.</span> <span id="s1239">This was the Gorbals in Glasgow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">NP: What was it?</span> <span id="s1241">What did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">RB: Gorbals, the Gorbals is the district.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">NP: Oh, O.K. And can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">RB: G-O-R-B-A-L-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">NP: The Gorbals.</span> <span id="s1246">O.K., it was a district, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">RB: Yeah, a district in Glasgow, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">NP: O.K., and so you were married and, but still in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">RB: Sure, after that we went for a honeymoon to London.</span> <span id="s1250">Never mind the bombs...</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">RB: That was the V-2 at that, eh, the V-1 at the time, which they called the doodlebugs.</span> <span id="s1253">The--every one, and in fact we were at the Cumberland Hotel and there was air raid alarm and we stood as suggested, by others.</span> <span id="s1254">We stood in the doorway of a closet.</span> <span id="s1255">And the thing came down and shattered several windows all over but otherwise was not much harm done and, well, you just carry on.</span> <span id="s1256">That’s your--we always considered how it must have hit somebody else.</span> <span id="s1257">And so you carry on.</span> <span id="s1258">That was the general attitude at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">NP: And where did you live after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">RB: Well, I was in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">NP: Well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">RB: I was still in the army and well, certain, I was transferred to Oxford, I was stationed, which I liked very much, with the--so Lore on the phone said, “This looks very permanent here,” and so she came down and got a job in an ammunitions factory and worked on airplanes or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1263">But a couple of weeks later we were shifted down to the south of England.</span> <span id="s1264">That was D-Day then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">RB: They went across and we were ready in the embarkation center and from the embarkation center I got a phone call to report to the orderly room I am to go to London and report to GHQ Second Echelon, Prisoner of War Section.</span> <span id="s1267">When I got there the Major or whatever he was said, “Oh, I’m glad to see you.</span> <span id="s1268">And we had the intention of starting a Photostat section for the War Office here but that’s been scratched since then.</span> <span id="s1269">So since we see you’re a linguist we can make use of you in the enemy Prisoner of War Section here.”</span> <span id="s1270">Which, by then I stayed in London all through...</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">NP: How many languages did you speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">RB: Well, only--I speak only German and English, some French.</span> <span id="s1273">And very little Spanish.</span> <span id="s1274">[chuckles] So, that I didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s1275">I mean we had the air raids and all that.</span> <span id="s1276">You get, it’s amazing how you get used to it.</span> <span id="s1277">Because you become fatalistic, you know, so that’s, eventually--then this unit went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1278">We were transferred to Belgium and to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1279">The people, the unit in Brussels, from there--it was a documentation unit really--from there we went to Louvain.</span> <span id="s1280">When I was sent to Louvain...</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">NP: L--how do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">RB: L-O-U-V-A-I-N.</span> <span id="s1283">That’s...</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">NP: In France or...</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">RB: A few miles, no, a few miles from Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">NP: It’s still in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">RB: Yeah, a few miles from Brussels.</span> <span id="s1288">That was a Prisoner of War camp.</span> <span id="s1289">Well, I, actually I--that’s where it was I heard that they needed interpreters [unclear].</span> <span id="s1290">And that carried the rank of Staff Sergeant, so I was promoted and was in the Prisoner of War.</span> <span id="s1291">There are two incidents of interest.</span> <span id="s1292">First of all, there were about four-and-a-half thousand prisoners there, all mixed Germans.</span> <span id="s1293">And then one day I was supposed to address the crowd and give them instructions about something.</span> <span id="s1294">And I was going up on the podium.</span> <span id="s1295">But I picked a German translator, you know.</span> <span id="s1296">And he, he said, “You tell them.</span> <span id="s1297">They’ll not listen to me.”</span> <span id="s1298">He said, “If I think,” I didn’t really want these bastards [chuckles], to know.</span> <span id="s1299">And that worked out fine, but they had work groups that worked, went outside the camp to, whatever they were told to do.</span> <span id="s1300">And they marched them back about 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s1301">And I stood outside my office at that time.</span> <span id="s1302">And one of those from the ranks shouted, “Britzmann!”</span> <span id="s1303">So I told the corporal, “Take the man’s name and tell him to report to my office,” which he did.</span> <span id="s1304">And eventually the guy comes, a big strapping fellow, stood to attention and I said, I told him to relax.</span> <span id="s1305">And he said, “I am very”--“Well,” I said, I asked him, “Well what were you shouting about when you were marching in there?”</span> <span id="s1306">He said, “I’m very sorry.</span> <span id="s1307">I’m very sorry.</span> <span id="s1308">I should have known better.</span> <span id="s1309">But it’s you, it’s you, isn’t it?”</span> <span id="s1310">That was the guy who sat in high school the last two years next to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">NP: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">RB: And then, so we had a little talk.</span> <span id="s1313">He told me so many got killed, you know, people who were from our class got killed at the eastern front or so, you know, which didn’t move me too much I told him.</span> <span id="s1314">And then he told, I asked him if he needed anything and I got him a shaver and some toothpaste or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1315">And I never saw him again after that.</span> <span id="s1316">He happened to be a decent guy, I remembered.</span> <span id="s1317">He gave me that little, a few minutes between...</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">NP: [Unclear.]</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">RB: Getting his name and realizing who he was, I remembered that he was one of the last to join the Hitler Youth in that class.</span> <span id="s1320">And that was ‘36, about eight years before that, you know, seven or eight years.</span> <span id="s1321">And so that was it.</span> <span id="s1322">Another coincidence, I write this in my book about that, this, I hitchhiked once to, or tried to hitchhike to Brussels, from Louvain.</span> <span id="s1323">And stood there and a jeep, a GI jeep, picked me up.</span> <span id="s1324">And we got talking and I noticed he had a bit of a German accent.</span> <span id="s1325">And I asked him about where he came from.</span> <span id="s1326">Anyhow, he said, “From Plauen.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">RB: So I told him my wife came from there and said what her name was.</span> <span id="s1329">Ah!</span> <span id="s1330">Manfred her brother was his best friend there for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">NP: Oh, what a coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">RB: And I told her about the coincidence and well, I never saw him again either.</span> <span id="s1333">So, after that I, stop me if you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">NP: No, that’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">RB: Want to cut it short.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">NP: The names of these two fellows that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">RB: Yeah, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">NP: One was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">RB: That was Oberstabsfeldwebel, that sergeant major.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">NP: Ober--F-E-L-D?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">RB: Stab, S-T-A-B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">NP: Ober-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">RB: Stab-...</span></p> <p><span

W-E-B-E-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">NP: Oberstab-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">RB: B, B, not D.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">NP: Oh, B. O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">RB: -feldwebel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">NP: I’ll re-write this, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">RB: Yeah, you know, Webel, which means sergeant major.</span> <span id="s1355">Stuber, Gert Stuber, G--oh I don’t know what it’s name--that’s not important.</span> <span id="s1356">So, this...</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">NP: So there were two incidents of people that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">RB: Yeah, the other one, the GI, his name was Purilis [phonetic] if you want that, from Plauen.</span> <span id="s1359">So, [phone ringing] if it’s somebody for me let me know.</span> <span id="s1360">The--I went from there--Yeah, coming out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">NP: Are you all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">RB: Yeah, I’m fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">NP: Good.</span> <span id="s1364">O.K., fine.</span> <span id="s1365">No I’m...</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">RB: Now, then I got a transfer to Neuengamme concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">RB: I don’t know if you ever heard of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">RB: Neuengamme.</span> <span id="s1371">Do you want it spelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">NP: N-E-U?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">RB: N-E-U.</span> <span id="s1374">N, no.</span></p>

<span id="s1383">My son is coming right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">NP: Oh no thank you.</span> <span id="s1385">I don’t want to keep you.</span> <span id="s1386">No, I’m, this was just perfect, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">??</span> <span id="s1388">: Because I set the table in the kitchen...</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">NP: I don’t want to...</span></p> <p><span

lunch?</span> <span id="s1394">Or are we towards- Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">NP: And we continue with the interview of Mr. Roger Bryan.</span> <span id="s1396">[tape off, then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">RB: Yeah, Neuengamme.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">NP: Neuengammen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">RB: Neuengamme, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">NP: -gamme, concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">RB: Camp, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">NP: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">RB: Well, I was in the intelligence office there, and we had an assortment of Germans from civilians, ordinary civilians, industrialists, prisoners of war, regular army, S.S., party officials, whatever, in there.</span> <span id="s1404">I don’t know the full number.</span> <span id="s1405">It was well over 1,000.</span> <span id="s1406">And mainly for interrogation and documentation.</span> <span id="s1407">And, actually, in the end mainly, mostly wanted, maybe for a request.</span> <span id="s1408">Somebody says, “Do you have,” [door closes] [unclear].</span> <span id="s1409">That’s my son.</span> <span id="s1410">[tape off, then on] So, that went on for, in fact, I got friendly with the local KRIPO [Kriminalpolizei], which is the criminal police, because we had reason to keep them.</span> <span id="s1411">We had a theft in our kitchen, I think stores and somebody from local and we went in there and the former S.S. huts, which were about a half a mile away from there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">NP: S.S. what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">RB: Huts, where they lived.</span> <span id="s1414">They had, you know, the personnel, when it was, this is a former concentration camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">NP: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">RB: With electrified barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">RB: And so I went along with him on that raid and the women, former girlfriends of--helped us, a German policeman was [unclear] rough, the German way, not like a policeman normally would act in this country.</span> <span id="s1419">And he got on the--he drew his gun and said, “You whores, S.S. whores, get out of here!”</span> <span id="s1420">They were lying in bed and under the mattress they found several bags of coffee and [unclear] and they [unclear].</span> <span id="s1421">And I also went to the police in Hamburg and made a report there about some of the goings on in the camp.</span> <span id="s1422">And I got friendly with one of the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">NP: Excuse me, what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">RB: This was 1945, yeah, because--and I remember when I was in Brussels, it was VE day, and VJ day and VE day, you know, Victory in Japan and Victory in Europe, which was riots in, you know, just wild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">NP: What were the streets like?</span> <span id="s1426">What of the displaced persons?</span> <span id="s1427">Could you describe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">RB: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">NP: After the war, when you were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">RB: In, well, I didn’t see any displaced persons.</span> <span id="s1431">I was with the German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1432">And then we had in there all civilians and that.</span> <span id="s1433">I didn’t see any...</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">NP: People that were coming...</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">RB: Mainly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">NP: Out of the concentration camps...</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">RB: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">NP: To resettle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">RB: Concentration camps, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">NP: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">RB: But there weren’t any...</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">NP: Not where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">RB: DP camps where I was, no, not around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">NP: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">RB: No, not around there.</span> <span id="s1446">And we were busy with our stuff, you know, and, oh, I remember something.</span> <span id="s1447">In a funny incident in--we went to Hamburg at night pretty often, in the Sergeants’ club or whatever.</span> <span id="s1448">And I went on a trolley car in Hamburg again.</span> <span id="s1449">And I stood there and, of course, a British uniform.</span> <span id="s1450">And I had heard a woman talking to the driver.</span> <span id="s1451">And I stood there in front, you know, it was crowded.</span> <span id="s1452">And she said to him, “I,” in German, of course, and she thought I, nobody could understand her.</span> <span id="s1453">I mean, at least I couldn’t, you know, and she said, “I think it’s terrible how our German girls throw themselves at these Tommies.”</span> <span id="s1454">And she was ready to get off and I said in my best German, I said, “You don’t have to worry.</span> <span id="s1455">Nobody will make a mistake with you.”</span> <span id="s1456">And I got a kick out of it.</span> <span id="s1457">I don’t know what she thought.</span> <span id="s1458">Anyhow, the--in the camp, I had befriended a guy by the name of Ehrhardt.</span> <span id="s1459">He was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">NP: Ehrhardt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1462">He lived in Hamburg, some part of Hamburg, and he was an industrialist like a..</span> <span id="s1463">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">NP: How do you spell his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">RB: E-H-R-H-A-R-D-T, I believe.</span> <span id="s1466">[tape off, then on] I’ll tell you, as short as I can I’ll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">RB: He gave me a report that the S.S. officers in the camp there, they are still trying to be top dog and control the inmates.</span> <span id="s1469">And I think they even managed to get a telephone in there somehow.</span> <span id="s1470">Anyhow, they knew that he was not pro-Nazi.</span> <span id="s1471">He was anti.</span> <span id="s1472">We had a group come from Nuremberg to the camp, interviewing the prisoners--that was from the German defense--because it had to be proven that the S.S. was a criminal organization around there.</span> <span id="s1473">And he was going to give evidence or something.</span> <span id="s1474">Anyhow, he got word from another friend of his, “Don’t stay in your bunk tonight.”</span> <span id="s1475">So he slept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1476">In the meantime, his wife in Hamburg got notified by police.</span> <span id="s1477">They had to tell her that her husband died or--in camp, the night before.</span> <span id="s1478">In other words, not only did they intend to string him up, but they got word out to--from the--that he was--but he wasn’t, he was very well.</span> <span id="s1479">And later on, when I went to Nuremberg, to the trials, I got him to appear as a witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">NP: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">RB: [Unclear.]</span> <span id="s1482">They only would take deposition from there--they didn’t, it didn’t fit in to have him testify in court actually, but they took depositions from him.</span> <span id="s1483">And I was very pleased.</span> <span id="s1484">And that was, it’s another coincidence there, doing documentation, if you’re interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">NP: Yes, yes, anything that you wish to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">RB: O.K., O.K., anyhow.</span> <span id="s1487">There, in one of those big huts, the Nissen huts they were called, in the British Army, they, we were set up for documentation and people walking from table to table around and giving--and one corporal came to me and said, “The prisoner wants to address you.”</span> <span id="s1488">In fact, he said, well, in German, it’s a very stilted German [unclear] a very stiff [unclear].</span> <span id="s1489">Well, I don’t have to bother you with the German.</span> <span id="s1490">Anyhow, I said, “Give me his records.”</span> <span id="s1491">Then I looked at it and I realized who he was.</span> <span id="s1492">And he came to me and he said, “I would like to be permitted,” in German of course, “...to put a question to the Mr. Staff Sergeant.”</span> <span id="s1493">And I say, which made me chuckle inside.</span> <span id="s1494">Anyhow, this was a--well, he said, “Have you ever been to Berlin?”</span> <span id="s1495">And I said, “Never in my life.”</span> <span id="s1496">And then, so he turned away and said, “Amazing resemblance.</span> <span id="s1497">Amazing resemblance,” and turned away.</span> <span id="s1498">This was a fellow who was at the pharmacist school with me.</span> <span id="s1499">In fact, we were both interested in photography and he was at my house at my apartment once and we set up some stuff to take photographs.</span> <span id="s1500">But he was a bit shifty, that guy.</span> <span id="s1501">So, I didn’t want to know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">NP: And so your work, then, went on to Nuremberg?</span> <span id="s1503">You testified at Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">RB: Yes, and it was a party of British officers, visiting our camp for whatever reason.</span> <span id="s1505">And one fellow said, “Oh, you are here!”</span> <span id="s1506">It was one of the guys who was in Australia with me.</span> <span id="s1507">He was an officer.</span> <span id="s1508">And he said, “We need people like you in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1509">I need you.”</span> <span id="s1510">I said, “Don’t do me any favors.</span> <span id="s1511">I’m comfortable here.”</span> <span id="s1512">I was there and I shared a room with another sergeant.</span> <span id="s1513">I had a former S.S. man for a bat man who polished our shoes.</span> <span id="s1514">In any event, very comfortable.</span> <span id="s1515">And I said, “It can wait till it’s--my time’s up.”</span> <span id="s1516">I said, “No, no, no, no.”</span> <span id="s1517">Anyhow, a couple of weeks later I got orders to go to Nuremberg...</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">NP: And your wife...</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">RB: Which I visited.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">NP: She came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">RB: She was in Oxford.</span> <span id="s1522">So that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1523">And that’s what--and I stayed at Nuremberg as interpreter/translator before the British War Crimes Executives.</span> <span id="s1524">That’s the adminis--I can show you here the pictures and all sorts of stuff.</span> <span id="s1525">And to the end of the trial.</span> <span id="s1526">That was about the last four months of the trial.</span> <span id="s1527">And then my number came up for demobilization.</span> <span id="s1528">I passed the test for courtroom interpreter, which is grueling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">NP: Courtroom interpreter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">RB: Interpreter, yes, because all you have is a microphone in front and the switch.</span> <span id="s1531">You can, red or a yellow light.</span> <span id="s1532">Yellow light means please slow down or red light, stop.</span> <span id="s1533">If you use it more than once, you’re out.</span> <span id="s1534">And no interpreter could serve more than two hours a day because it’s so nerve wracking.</span> <span id="s1535">Because you hear it, you have your earphones, and you have to speak it, hear it in German and speak it in English or the other way around, in English.</span> <span id="s1536">And I passed the test for the subsequent trials.</span> <span id="s1537">But I wasn’t going to stay there any longer.</span> <span id="s1538">I could have gotten a job for Lore too, to stay there.</span> <span id="s1539">But I said, “That’s enough.”</span> <span id="s1540">So I went home, and there ,of course, I saw all our friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">NP: And you were doing this as...</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">RB: Staff Sergeant...</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">NP: Staff Sergeant and the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">RB: And interpreter for the British War Crimes Executives.</span> <span id="s1545">This is...</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">NP: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">RB: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1548">[tape off, then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">NP: Mr. Bryan, when, what were the conditions under which you changed your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">RB: Well, in the beginning it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1551">One thing I would like to say...</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">NP: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">RB: In the American Army, German, former German refugees, joining the American Army, were made citizens within about four or five weeks after joining.</span> <span id="s1554">In Britain, I served in the British Army as a German national.</span> <span id="s1555">I wasn’t, I did not become a British citizen until about two or three months after I got out of the army.</span> <span id="s1556">When I was in the army, and later on, of course, I transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps from the Pioneer Corps.</span> <span id="s1557">I--they--it was suggested those--sooner or later we knew we were going to Europe, so, to the continent.</span> <span id="s1558">And those of German origin are suggested to change their names.</span> <span id="s1559">And they changed all papers and didn’t show place of birth.</span> <span id="s1560">And, although I know of people who joined the fighting forces, who were parachuters and so on, and were killed in fact or taken prisoner and then killed or what, whichever way it was, by the Germans, well, and I changed it then.</span> <span id="s1561">But it was partly because I didn’t--because my name, Britzmann, is not a Jewish name [unclear].</span> <span id="s1562">It’s a German name.</span> <span id="s1563">And I was not keen to keep that.</span> <span id="s1564">And then I changed it, because I’d become of the Royal Photographic Society before, and I made it up as a hyphenated name, Bryan-Britzmann.</span> <span id="s1565">That was even before that mess.</span> <span id="s1566">Anyhow, that’s when we changed our name, when they changed my army papers and so forth [unclear].</span> <span id="s1567">In fact I was married as Roger Bryan.</span> <span id="s1568">So, Lore never had--was never Mrs. Britzmann.</span> <span id="s1569">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">NP: And so, you were about to leave your job as, well, a sergeant of security in...</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">RB: Oh, at the camp.</span> <span id="s1572">Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">NP: At the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">RB: And then I went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">NP: And then you went to Nuremberg and then you were going out of the service at that time, after that, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">RB: After the,--yes, well, of course, here-- are we still on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">NP: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">RB: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">NP: Mr. Bryan is showing me a photograph of the Nuremberg Trials, which took place in 1945 to 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">RB: And here is, you see about Göring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">NP: In the picture are Hermann Göring...</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">RB: Hess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">NP: And Rudolf Hess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">RB: And other--the whole, Keitel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">NP: Keitel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">RB: Streicher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">NP: Streicher [Julius].</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">RB: Eh, all of these, but that’s the British [unclear] and here’s little me.</span> <span id="s1589">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">NP: And Mr. Bryan was there to testify.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">RB: With the British...</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">NP: To interpret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">RB: To interpret, yeah, I was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">NP: Interpret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">RB: On, with this David Maxwell Feif [phonetic] is the British Consul.</span> <span id="s1596">And here is the German defense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">NP: Mr. Bryan is showing me a picture of the German defense, at the Nuremberg Trials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">RB: See, this is a better picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">NP: [tape off, then on] Would you like to add anything?</span> <span id="s1600">After you were out of the service...</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">RB: Well...</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">NP: How did you proceed with your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">RB: Well, that, yes, I joined--first of all, I went back to Glasgow.</span> <span id="s1604">That was where my wife was, too.</span> <span id="s1605">And she had worked for Marks and Spencer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">NP: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">RB: She was as a, what they call, window dresser, you know, decorating the windows.</span> <span id="s1608">But then she changed.</span> <span id="s1609">In fact, she asked me, she went to work for a friend of ours, also a former German, in a photo studio.</span> <span id="s1610">He was a manager and she got a job as a retoucher.</span> <span id="s1611">She asked me if I should do it.</span> <span id="s1612">Well, that was self interest that time.</span> <span id="s1613">Stay in the business.</span> <span id="s1614">And I worked for him, too, for a while.</span> <span id="s1615">And I ran a little studio but it wasn’t--didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1616">And I operated a retail store for him for a while, in photographic equipment.</span> <span id="s1617">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">NP: Did you stay in Glasgow for a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">NP: You had your family there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">RB: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1622">And my daughter was born and then I met a friend of mine, I met a friend, he became a friend, a Jew in Glasgow.</span> <span id="s1623">He was Scottish born.</span> <span id="s1624">And we started a photography business as partners.</span> <span id="s1625">Bryan and Shier [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1626">And [tape off, then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">NP: And when did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">RB: Well, my wife’s brother lived in Philadelphia, because originally he had American, well, yeah, mostly American born cousins here and that’s how he came to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1629">And he was in the industrial thread business in 1952.</span> <span id="s1630">He sent us the tickets because I didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s1631">And he said, “Why don’t you come to visit and see what--if you like it.”</span> <span id="s1632">So we came in ‘52 and spent most of that summer in Atlantic City, which was different then.</span> <span id="s1633">And we went around and saw friends and a cousin in Baltimore and so forth.</span> <span id="s1634">I had a cousin in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1635">And we liked it.</span> <span id="s1636">So the following year, we came, to stay.</span></p>

this morning.</span> <span id="s1667">I know it was lengthy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">RB: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">NP: There was so much for you to tell, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">RB: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">NP: And hopefully this will be used by serious students in the future, and for the purposes of research.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">RB:
