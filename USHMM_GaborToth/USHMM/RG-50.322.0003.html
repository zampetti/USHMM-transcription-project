of Interviews: 9/13/1978</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: It is Wednesday, September 13, 1978 at Werner Joe Becker’s home on Elm Grove Drive in Dayton, Ohio.</span> <span id="s5">Joe, how old are you?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Sixty-three.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: What was your place of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: In a little town in Mecklenburg (this is a German province just east of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s9">Today in East Germany of which very few people have ever heard</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: I see can you give us the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: Webel.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: Is it a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: The population was about 3,500 people, and it had been that way for about 1,000 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Do you know anything, in your family history, how your family came to Webel?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Not exactly.</span> <span id="s16">They, that is both my father and my mother, came from West Prussia.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Now of course that is pretty close to Mecklenburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s19">It is now part of Poland, it became Polish after WWI.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: How many brothers and sisters did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: One brother and one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: They both lived in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: What was your parents’ occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: My father had a store, a clothing store.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: How about your education?</span> <span id="s27">As a youngster?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: In this little place there was a private school, to the eighth grade.</span> <span id="s29">After that I went to another place, called Rostock.</span> <span id="s30">That is where I graduated from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: What kind of a high school was that?</span> <span id="s32">Was it a gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: It was a “Real gymnasium.”</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: How was your religious life at home?</span> <span id="s35">Did you keep kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes, my parents kept kosher, as much as it was possible, in that little town which didn’t have a kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s37">They kept the Shabbat, as best they could.</span> <span id="s38">You couldn’t close the store.</span> <span id="s39">At the High Holy Days, at one time there used to be a Community, a Congregation of some 20 people or so.</span> <span id="s40">While I was growing up there were maybe five Jewish families there.</span> <span id="s41">For the High Holy Days there was the little synagogue, and my father conducted the entire service.</span> <span id="s42">We invited some people from other little towns.</span> <span id="s43">Sometimes we made it to a “minyan” (that means that there were the traditional number of ten men which is required to say certain prayers) and sometimes we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Were the males Barmitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s46">There was a Hebrew teacher who made the rounds of all these little towns.</span> <span id="s47">Even though he didn’t come to Webel, he came to a neighboring town.</span> <span id="s48">I went there on the bus, about once a week, prior to getting Barmitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What was the principal language spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Did your parents speak any other language?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: My parents also spoke Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you feel that you were among the rich or the poor in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I never thought of myself was rich.</span> <span id="s55">Maybe you could call our family average.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did your parents relate socially to non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s58">My father always had excellent relationships with his customers.</span> <span id="s59">After the parents, the children became customers when they grew up.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: That was more of a business relationship than was meant.</span> <span id="s61">Was there anything socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Not really too much socially.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: So you had a small synagogue there.</span> <span id="s64">To what extent was it the center of Jewish life?</span> <span id="s65">Was there anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: No, the synagogue was used for the High Holidays only, because there weren’t enough people to have services and even for those days we had to go out of town to get a minyan, kind of import people.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: What other activities or association did your family participate in?</span> <span id="s68">Such as cultural activities?</span> <span id="s69">Concerts?</span> <span id="s70">Music?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: There was nothing in that little town.</span> <span id="s72">There was one movie house only.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How would you describe your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I would say that I had a fairly happy childhood.</span> <span id="s75">I lived at home only until I was 14.</span> <span id="s76">After that I went to the next town, and from then on I was at home for vacations only.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: The other town had the school in it.</span> <span id="s78">The “Real gymnasium”?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s80">So I came home on vacations only, and then, when I was eighteen and a half, I went to France.</span> <span id="s81">(That was in 1933)</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: So we’ll come to that later.</span> <span id="s83">So you recall any special events in your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Nothing, it was all very uneventful.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Did you attend any religious school during your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No.</span> <span id="s87">After I went to Rostock, there I had Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Something like a Cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: No.</span> <span id="s90">The instructions were given in a public school building.</span> <span id="s91">We had the full public school curriculum and when the others had religious instructions, I just went home.</span> <span id="s92">Instead of that, in the afternoon, I had religious instruction of my own in a public school building built by a rabbi.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did you have any other religious instruction than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I assume the language spoken in school by the majority of your friends was German?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: What languages did you speak, other than German?</span> <span id="s98">Reading and understanding?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: In school we learned French and English and Latin.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: To what extent did you associate with non-Jewish boys and girls?</span> <span id="s101">That is, in school and outside of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: In school I associated with non-Jews to some extent, but not outside of school.</span> <span id="s103">I am talking about high school.</span> <span id="s104">Now in grade school, that was different.</span> <span id="s105">There, in, Webel, I had good relationships.</span> <span id="s106">There were no other Jewish children.</span> <span id="s107">We went to each other’s birthday parties and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Now, prior to when Hitler came to power, were you aware of any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: In the high school, at one time, there was one Nazi in our class, and the strange thing about him was that he would never talk to me.</span> <span id="s110">He ignored me completely, as if I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s111">However, shortly before the end of school, of the school year, he got disenchanted with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s112">This was in early 1933.</span> <span id="s113">(The school year in Germany finished and started at Easter recess.)</span> <span id="s114">Then, all of a sudden, he started talking to me.</span> <span id="s115">An incident which I remember happening in our drawing class.</span> <span id="s116">Every student had a drawing board.</span> <span id="s117">Drawing is not my cup of tea.</span> <span id="s118">I can only draw with a ruler.</span> <span id="s119">All the boards were stored in one room -- that is, the boards of all the different classes.</span> <span id="s120">So, one day I picked out my board and there was a big “Hagenkreutz” (swastika) on the board.</span> <span id="s121">So I showed this to the drawing instructor.</span> <span id="s122">He said, “Well, that is very regrettable,” and he showed it to the principal.</span> <span id="s123">They shrugged their shoulders and said, “That is very regrettable.”</span> <span id="s124">Nobody else said a word with the exception of my homeroom teacher.</span> <span id="s125">He was a conservative.</span> <span id="s126">He had fought in WWI and he was a very fair-minded person.</span> <span id="s127">The drawing teacher said to me, “Well this drawing wasn’t worth anything before, either.”</span> <span id="s128">So this homeroom teacher took this thing and he gave the class quite a lecture.</span> <span id="s129">Around that time, in this last class, everyone had to give a speech.</span> <span id="s130">So I asked him what subject should I choose.</span> <span id="s131">He said, “You talk about Jewish customs.”</span> <span id="s132">I got a few ideas together and I gave a speech on that subject.</span> <span id="s133">There, of course, were some hecklers.</span> <span id="s134">He really told them off, in a very nice way, and explained what I said.</span> <span id="s135">He was really a wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Let’s get back to the hecklers.</span> <span id="s137">Were they malicious?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, they were not malicious.</span> <span id="s139">They were just trying to downgrade what I had said.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: How about that one fellow who ignored you and who later talked to you.</span> <span id="s141">Did you ever find out why he became disenchanted and changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No, I never did.</span> <span id="s143">I did not get into that.</span> <span id="s144">I did not want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s145">I did respect this fellow because he was straightforward and honest.</span> <span id="s146">That was his opinion.</span> <span id="s147">He never, even verbally, attacked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: These were the only instances of anti-Semitism which you personally felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yes, in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How about out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, not really, except on April 1st.</span> <span id="s152">Then there was the boycott of all Jewish enterprises.</span> <span id="s153">Then there was a Nazi standing in front of the store.</span> <span id="s154">Of course there were people who came into the store just to show that they defied the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Defied the system?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes, they did not come in to buy, they just came in to defy these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: How did your family react to this boycott, your father and your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: You mean in the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: In the store and elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Elsewhere than in the store there really was not too much which was involved.</span> <span id="s161">My father was quite respected and there really never was anything personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did he ever show any concern about that boycott?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: There truly wasn’t very much to say.</span> <span id="s164">The thing was there, and personally, I realized at that moment that there was no future for me in Germany.</span> <span id="s165">People, I mean just the older people, could not conceive that, all of a sudden, they’re existence, their working, would have to come to an end.</span> <span id="s166">I didn’t either, I mean that I felt as far as I was concerned I had no future, however I still hoped, at that time, that they would leave the older people to continue their work.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: How old were you when that boycott took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: It was in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Let’s go on now.</span> <span id="s172">What were the circumstances of your leaving Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: After I graduated from high school, the question of college came up.</span> <span id="s174">My parents wanted me to go back to Rostock and enroll there, at the university.</span> <span id="s175">I went there and there was one fellow whom I was very friendly with.</span> <span id="s176">This fellow had graduated the same year.</span> <span id="s177">He was a Jewish fellow.</span> <span id="s178">One of his brothers was enrolled at the university of Rostock.</span> <span id="s179">Naturally, living in town and having a brother at the university, he knew what went on, what the Jewish fellows were doing, and so on.</span> <span id="s180">I heard that everyone, even those people with two or three years of college, were dropping out.</span> <span id="s181">I said to myself, “How foolish can you be?</span> <span id="s182">In the face of this and in the face of the current situation, to enroll.”</span> <span id="s183">So I did not enroll, and when I came home I went to see my brother, he is eight years older than I.</span> <span id="s184">He thought I had messed up because I had received specific instructions to enroll, and I didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s185">About one or two months later the first laws came out which were making it impossible for a Jewish college student to graduate.</span> <span id="s186">That clinched it.</span> <span id="s187">Then my parents agreed that I should leave the country and that is what I did.</span> <span id="s188">The possibilities, at first, were Austria and England, but then these countries charged twice as much for foreign students.</span> <span id="s189">England was considered, but their system was somewhat different, which would make it difficult to adapt to where I was.</span> <span id="s190">Finally France was chosen.</span> <span id="s191">So that fall, I went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: There were two things to be considered about France.</span> <span id="s193">First of all, how about the language barrier?</span> <span id="s194">Were you able to get over that?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: That took me awhile.</span> <span id="s196">I lost one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: The second thing is: who did you stay with?</span> <span id="s198">Relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: No, this other fellow, whom I talked about; we went together.</span> <span id="s200">He went, maybe a few weeks before I did, but we stayed together.</span> <span id="s201">When he went there, he met somebody, and there is always the Jewish community, at least in most cities, and they will help you to find a place.</span> <span id="s202">We shared a room.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: I assume, and I may not be correct in doing so, that it was Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No, we went to Nancy (the former capitol of the province of Loraine) that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So, you went to the university there.</span> <span id="s206">One time you mentioned to me that you got into the Foreign Legion, how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: My friend went back to Germany after the first year, and as I said, I lost that first year.</span> <span id="s208">After that first year, I left from there also and I went to Dijon.</span> <span id="s209">I don’t remember why I went to Dijon.</span> <span id="s210">In Dijon I met some other fellows, there was one fellow we knew, I mean we met there, also a refugee from Germany who was studying medicine.</span> <span id="s211">I stayed in Dijon until, finally, it became more difficult to get money.</span> <span id="s212">It was also difficult to find a job (France allowed foreigners to come in to study or live, but not to work), so finally it got to be too much and I just had to drop out.</span> <span id="s213">After that, through another family, a Jewish family which I met in the meantime, I met a French (Christian) family.</span> <span id="s214">The man was extremely helpful to me.</span> <span id="s215">He got me the working papers which were almost impossible to get.</span> <span id="s216">He also found me a job as an apprentice in upholstering.</span> <span id="s217">There I started to like the situation.</span> <span id="s218">This was in 1937.</span> <span id="s219">Two years later the war broke out.</span> <span id="s220">Shortly before the war broke our a law came out which enabled people, who declared themselves stateless, would be subject to the same laws as Frenchmen as far as military service went.</span> <span id="s221">Since I intended to stay in France, I declared myself stateless.</span> <span id="s222">So, when the war broke out, I went to the police and I signed a paper and now I wanted to know what I had to do.</span> <span id="s223">He said, “Not you, you are German.</span> <span id="s224">That applies to Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s225">You are German, you have to go to an internment camp you are an enemy alien.”</span> <span id="s226">So that is where I went, and after one or two months we were told that we could join the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s227">They said, “You wanted to serve, so here is your opportunity.</span> <span id="s228">You can enlist for five years.</span> <span id="s229">In the meantime you will serve under the French flag.”</span> <span id="s230">So, I figured, “Who knows, the war may be over in three years and I will be sitting there for another two years.”</span> <span id="s231">So I said, “No, but thank you.”</span> <span id="s232">A little later they offered enlistments in the Foreign Legion for the duration of the war.</span> <span id="s233">So I said, “OK.</span> <span id="s234">That will do.”</span> <span id="s235">On Nov. 27, 1939, I enlisted in the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s236">In Jan. 1940, we were sent over to North Africa (France then had Morocco and Tunisia as colonies, and Algeria formed three French departments).</span> <span id="s237">Sidi Bel Abbes in Algeria was the world center of the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s238">This only lasted ten months.</span> <span id="s239">There was the armistice between Germany and France and, under the terms of this armistice, the French army had to be disbanded.</span> <span id="s240">That also affected the Foreign Legion.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So the French army was disbanded, but the Legion continued to exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, but those who had enlisted for the duration of the war were not to be kept, because the armistice was the end of the war, insofar as the French were concerned.</span> <span id="s243">So they had to let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: What did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: At that time the Germans occupied part of France (they occupied all the North and the East and the Atlantic coast, excepting only Vichy France,” i.e. the center of France with Rhone Valley and the Mediterranean coastline).</span> <span id="s246">Those who had lived in the non-occupied part before their enlistment and could prove a means of support either by finding a family to take them in or a job or as certain amount of money could go back to France at that time.</span> <span id="s247">Now, Dijon was in the occupied portion, so this did not work for me.</span> <span id="s248">However, later on, as things got worse, I wrote to my brother, who was here already, about sending me, at that time it was about $100.00.</span> <span id="s249">He did send me $100.00, which allowed me to ask for my release.</span> <span id="s250">Then I intended to go to the non-occupied part of France.</span> <span id="s251">At the same time when this money arrived, there was an incident where one person, having received this money passed it to someone else, who had also asked for money for his release from the Legion.</span> <span id="s252">I don’t really know how many other people were involved, but they were all released, and when they got into this harbor of Oran (the Algerian harbor closest to Sidi Bel Abbes), of course only one was able to produce the money.</span> <span id="s253">Naturally, the whole thing was stopped immediately.</span> <span id="s254">So, here I was, and I can’t be sorry, it may have turned out to be for the best.</span> <span id="s255">I knew of one case where it was unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Yes, I know, my uncle turned up in Vichy France and then wound up in Auschwitz (the notorious death camp in Poland).</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: The brother of a friend of mine, with whom I am still in correspondence, had been in Dachau (the concentration camp on the outskirts of Munich).</span> <span id="s258">He went back to Lyon, which was in Vichy France, therefore unoccupied.</span> <span id="s259">He shared a room with somebody in the French Underground.</span> <span id="s260">They were looking for this other person, they didn’t know anything about him, but they found him and held him.</span> <span id="s261">Three days later he was dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: So you were in Oran then, when you left the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s263">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: That was in October 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What did you do in Oran?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Oran was just a transition port, where we landed in Jan. 1940.</span> <span id="s267">From there we went to Sidi Bel Abbes where all the records were being kept, and from there we went to Saida (that is where we got our basic military instructions.</span> <span id="s268">From there the company went to Morocco.</span> <span id="s269">I didn’t go with them because I was sick at that time.</span> <span id="s270">So I went to Sidi Bel Abbes.</span> <span id="s271">That is where all the legionnaires went back to.</span> <span id="s272">I went nowhere with the Legion since I had lost my company.</span> <span id="s273">I was just wandering around.</span> <span id="s274">Then France went to war with Italy for a while (that was actually for a couple of weeks, just before the French-German armistice).</span> <span id="s275">They were just getting a convoy together to send to Tunisia.</span> <span id="s276">Right at that time I was working in a forest.</span> <span id="s277">There are a lot of forests there except in the coastal regions.</span> <span id="s278">As soon as these convoys were formed everyone came back to Sidi Bel Abbes; but, fortunately the war against Italy was over before we got going.</span> <span id="s279">I mean the war with Italy which was also stopped by the armistice between France and Germany, still in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: What happened after Oct. 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Then some were able to go back to France, as I said.</span> <span id="s282">We, others were placed in “Companies of Foreign workers,’ under the command of former Foreign Legion commissioned and non-commissioned officers.</span> <span id="s283">We were now the “Foreign Workers.”</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Was there any discrimination at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: At that time, no, at that time it was not too bad.</span> <span id="s286">After a few weeks here and there we wound up someplace in the hinterland, in Algeria, just about where the desert (Sahara) starts.</span> <span id="s287">The commissioned and non-commissioned officers had guns and rifles.</span> <span id="s288">There were about 15 or 20 of them, whereas we were maybe 300 “workers.”</span> <span id="s289">Naturally they were not about to start anything with us, even if at times the food was getting so bad, since at the main supply point they took everything they wanted.</span> <span id="s290">We just had to make do with the leftovers.</span> <span id="s291">Even once we refused to eat the food, and they didn’t try to do anything; they just tried to persuade us to eat anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: What kind of work did you do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: We did roadwork.</span> <span id="s294">There was a little road going through the area, which got inundated whenever there was some rain.</span> <span id="s295">The road got literally washed away.</span> <span id="s296">Nobody knew what we should be doing or how to go about it.</span> <span id="s297">We had no tools other than hand tools, such as hammers to “crush” the rocks.</span> <span id="s298">It was make-work.</span> <span id="s299">As a matter of fact, when we finally moved further along South it did rain and all our hard work was washed away.</span> <span id="s300">They had to leave a team behind to make the road passable.</span> <span id="s301">We went further south where there was an abandoned coalmine.</span> <span id="s302">Since the coal from France did not come any longer, we reactivated this mine.</span> <span id="s303">The coal was of very poor quality and, under normal circumstances, no one would use it.</span> <span id="s304">However, now they needed it.</span> <span id="s305">So some people worked in the mine and other people worked in construction.</span> <span id="s306">We put up houses, to house the civilians who worked the mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: By this time you were no longer in the Foreign Legion.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: That is right.</span> <span id="s309">We were considered Foreign Workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: How was the pay for your work?</span> <span id="s311">Did you get paid anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: I don’t believe that we did.</span> <span id="s313">I don’t remember receiving any pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: However, you got paid while you were a member of the Foreign Legion?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes, about a pack of cigarettes every two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: That wasn’t exactly slave labor, but it was close to it.</span> <span id="s317">Did they treat all Foreign Workers that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeas.</span> <span id="s319">There was a very high percentage of Jews, but by no means were they all Jews.</span> <span id="s320">They didn’t treat the Jews differently from the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Let me ask about the high percentage of Jews; had they all been members of the Foreign Legion?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s323">These were all refugees from Germany (and Austria etc.) as I was.</span> <span id="s324">They had lived in France.</span> <span id="s325">They had been interned, the same as I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: I know that you didn’t, but did any of them see combat duty?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I don’t believe so.</span> <span id="s328">Some of them were in different outposts in the Sahara, further south, not far from the Tunisian border.</span> <span id="s329">We were close to the Morocco border.</span> <span id="s330">They had much more hardship there, but otherwise I don’t believe that they were any actual combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did the Foreign Legion see any combat in WWII, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes, they went to Norway, at least some of them did!</span> <span id="s333">(Some Foreign Legion Units also fought in Metropolitan France and in the Far East.)</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: You mentioned that there were a lot of refugees with you, now what was their status?</span> <span id="s335">Were they married?</span> <span id="s336">You were single at the time!</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes, but they were not all single.</span> <span id="s338">A number of them were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: What happened?</span> <span id="s340">Were they in the Foreign Legion also?</span> <span id="s341">What happened to the marriages?</span> <span id="s342">Did they take their families with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: Oh no!</span> <span id="s344">Their families were not along!</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: What happened to their families?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: They tried to manage.</span> <span id="s347">In these parts which were occupied by the Germans, of course they didn’t wait and they got out as best they could and tried to hide someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: You realize that most of the Jews were deported from Vichy France, sooner or later.</span> <span id="s349">I wondered what happened to their families.</span> <span id="s350">Were they deported as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: I know of people who were able to hide.</span> <span id="s352">If, for instance, you found a family which would take you in, you had a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s353">I know several people who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: It depended on these families?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Let us continue.</span> <span id="s357">That is an interesting side point!</span> <span id="s358">When we talked about this project we never realized that any of these people would wind up in the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s359">So you were “Foreign Workers” then?</span> <span id="s360">How did it come about that you came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: At the end of 1942 the Allied landings, mainly of U.S. troops, took place in North Africa.</span> <span id="s362">I don’t recall the details but somebody spoke up in England and got to a Member of Parliament.</span> <span id="s363">This finally led to the formation of an inter-allied commission which was sent to North Africa to disband all the camps.</span> <span id="s364">In one camp there was one German fellow and a fellow who had been our Company Commander, while we were in the mountains, a fellow from Corsica.</span> <span id="s365">They had gotten together and set up a regular concentration camp.</span> <span id="s366">They used that as a model!</span> <span id="s367">There were people there who were beaten to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Let us review that because this is something unusual and unexpected!</span> <span id="s369">You say that in the Foreign Legion there was a German who established…</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No, we are now talking about the years 1941-42.</span> <span id="s371">There were these companies of Foreign Workers and, in one place, I don’t recall the name, in Southern Algeria there was a camp where this German fellow was, as well as this fellow from Corsica.</span> <span id="s372">There were, I believe, between 70 and 80 people in this camp.</span> <span id="s373">I believe that between the two of them they killed about ten or twelve.</span> <span id="s374">In every place there was a high percentage of Jewish people, but they were not all Jewish.</span> <span id="s375">There were people who had been in concentration camps in Germany, and they again got into this situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: But what about the authorities?</span> <span id="s377">Did the authorities permit this?</span> <span id="s378">Did they know about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: They probably didn’t know much and didn’t care much!</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: We are talking about the Free French, aren’t we?</span> <span id="s381">Weren’t the Free French the authorities then?</span> <span id="s382">(The Free French became the authorities after the Allied landings.)</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: The thing is that in Algeria, the Algerians were mostly Arabs and they were more sympathetic toward the Nazi’s than toward the Free French, even though the territory was not occupied (Right after the Allies landed in North Africa, a deal was made with Admiral Darlan.</span> <span id="s384">Darlan had been Petain’s second in command and had been sympathetic toward the Nazi’s.</span> <span id="s385">This deal froze De Gaulle and his Free French out of the leadership.)</span> <span id="s386">The Germans had a Red Cross office in Algiers.</span> <span id="s387">At one time there were people from this office who came down to our company, but they did not bother anybody.</span> <span id="s388">They only talked to these people who wanted to talk to them.</span> <span id="s389">What they were mainly after was to get (non-Jewish) Germans, i.e. German nationals to enlist in the German army.</span> <span id="s390">This was really what they wanted.</span> <span id="s391">They did not bother or care what the others, what we did!</span> <span id="s392">Now, in our company, there was a fellow, I am not certain whether he was Jewish -- I don’t believe that he was -- he was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s393">There was a little incident at the time of the Allied landings in North Africa, in 1943.</span> <span id="s394">At the time when the landings took place, some people put the American flag out in the camp.</span> <span id="s395">This created quite a stir, especially since a company of native soldiers, in the camp, was involved.</span> <span id="s396">The Lieutenant got quite disturbed about it (as well he might have since the U.S. was fighting against the Axis, which included Vichy-- France).</span> <span id="s397">That same day everybody had to come back to camp at noon.</span> <span id="s398">Normally, when we were outside the camp during the daytime, we did not come back until evening.</span> <span id="s399">That day we had to come back and listen to a speech from that man.</span> <span id="s400">When we were getting together to listen to the lawyer, this possibly Jewish fellow, he came out and told us: “These fellows are no longer in charge!</span> <span id="s401">Now we have Roosevelt and Churchill, who are in command and, if you don’t want to listen to these fellows, you don’t have to!”</span> <span id="s402">So several of the people left the camp.</span> <span id="s403">So now the non-commissioned officers came and tried to talk us into listening to them.</span> <span id="s404">So finally we said: “OK, we will listen to you, but these native troops, we don’t want them here!”</span> <span id="s405">They were actually hidden behind the building.</span> <span id="s406">We said: “The native troops have to get out of camp, we don’t want them here!”</span> <span id="s407">They actually put them away, but they kept an eye on the lawyer-fellow.</span> <span id="s408">Later on they put him into another camp, however, after everything was over, he had managed to survive.</span> <span id="s409">After everything was over this fellow got a trial started, for the Corsican and the German.</span> <span id="s410">Each of them got ten years, I believe.</span> <span id="s411">Over there ten years is not like here, that you get out on parole after two.</span> <span id="s412">Ten years means ten years of hard labor!</span> <span id="s413">You don’t get out early, especially not from a North African goal.</span> <span id="s414">I am quite certain that they finished their sentences.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Let me ask you: “How many Germans, about whom you knew, were in your company?</span> <span id="s416">Let me rephrase that to something like: “What percentage of your company.</span> <span id="s417">Or any other company were actually Germans?”</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: I would guess maybe 20 percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: The reason for my question is that it is surprising that they would enlist in the Foreign Legion when they could get out of the military life or serve in the German Reichswehr (Army).</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s421">This depends on the individual.</span> <span id="s422">Some people may not have cared to serve in the Reichswehr, after all these were people who lived in France.</span> <span id="s423">Maybe they weren’t Nazis either.</span> <span id="s424">(In any case they enlisted before the defeat of the French).</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: But if they were professional soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: They were not professional soldiers.</span> <span id="s427">They had enlisted the way I did.</span> <span id="s428">In this company, in which I was, there were no actual legionnaires, they had all enlisted just for the length of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Now, getting back to these camps, whether they were official or unofficial, but in any case they were sanctioned.</span> <span id="s430">Do you know of any other Germans than the one you mentioned?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: This was the only camp of its type that I knew about.</span> <span id="s432">I am quite certain there were no others because, after all, there weren’t that many of us.</span> <span id="s433">So then there was that inter-allied commission, which included an American major, a French major and a British major who went from camp to camp.</span> <span id="s434">For instance, we were given the choice to stay down there (in the south of Algeria) with the same rights as any other civilian or to go back to the Foreign Legion and join the African Corps which was enrolled in the Foreign Legion.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: The Africa Corps was a German outfit!</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Yes; but there was also a French Africa Corps.</span> <span id="s437">The 3rd and last possibility was that we could join the British Engineer Corps.</span> <span id="s438">That was part of the British Army.</span> <span id="s439">About 96 or 97 % of our group chose this 3rd possibility.</span> <span id="s440">I chose this alternative.</span> <span id="s441">This was in April 1943.</span> <span id="s442">Shortly thereafter we went on a train and we got to Algiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: What did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: There was a British major who was in charge.</span> <span id="s445">He was just like a mother.</span> <span id="s446">There was no such thing as punishment.</span> <span id="s447">The people who were in charge just said: “You are not going to do that again!”</span> <span id="s448">They were so nice to us and everything.</span> <span id="s449">You couldn’t ask for better treatment.</span> <span id="s450">Everybody was well pleased.</span> <span id="s451">Later on a number of us joined the “Cadre Remy” (This name is not truly understandable on the tape).</span> <span id="s452">That was a British unit which had been formed during the African war, in the desert, when they lost a lot of tanks and other vehicles and had no means of repairing them.</span> <span id="s453">So the British developed a whole chain of repair shops.</span> <span id="s454">So some of us, who had somewhat of a trade joined them.</span> <span id="s455">They were called the “Royal Mechanical and Electrical Engineers” (REMY might stand for Royal Electrical and Mechanical Unit, so that it should be REMU rather than REMY).</span> <span id="s456">I was detached to that unit in Algiers.</span> <span id="s457">We had a six- door garage, a tremendous thing and there wasn’t a thing which we did not do on a truck.</span> <span id="s458">We didn’t work on many tanks, mainly on trucks.</span> <span id="s459">The engines were completely taken apart and overhauled and everything.</span> <span id="s460">We stayed there until the end of the African campaign, then we ran out of business and went to Italy.</span> <span id="s461">We did the same thing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: That took you to the end of the war, I assume?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Almost!</span> <span id="s464">Then, one day, I came home from work, and I saw that my name was on the list of people to leave, to get equipment and leave the next morning to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s465">We were to fight for the British there, and shoot the Jews.</span> <span id="s466">That was in 1946 so we had an idea if what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s467">My British buddies said: “If you are on the list, you are on the list.</span> <span id="s468">There is nothing you can do!</span> <span id="s469">You just have to go and once you are further, you have to see how you can get out of it.”</span> <span id="s470">I said to myself: “This is my outfit, I have a Company Commander who is in charge of me.</span> <span id="s471">If I go someplace else they will only have one thing in mind; to push these guys out of there -- to push them to the next place.</span> <span id="s472">There were guys coming here every day and we had to get them out as fast as we can, and this fellow is not different.”</span> <span id="s473">So I asked to see the Company Commander.</span> <span id="s474">I explained to him that I am not a British citizen and that, for me, the war started in 1939 and that I had done more service than the average British soldier.</span> <span id="s475">I also said that it was grossly unfair to ship me someplace else.</span> <span id="s476">Of course, I knew why they were sending me.</span> <span id="s477">It was a matter of interpretation of the law.</span> <span id="s478">I had enlisted in the British army in North Africa and the law said that wherever you enlist, that is home service and if you go somewhere else, that is foreign service.</span> <span id="s479">I had not lived in North Africa therefore it was not correct to interpret my service in North Africa as home service.</span> <span id="s480">For me that was foreign service.</span> <span id="s481">On the basis of this foreign service I was entitled to be discharged, not to be sent someplace else.</span> <span id="s482">The Company Commander agreed with me.</span> <span id="s483">He told me that, later on in the morning he was going to go to Division Headquarters and that he would see what he could do there.</span> <span id="s484">He added that he would let me know.</span> <span id="s485">In the afternoon he sent a runner down to where I was and told me that I was off the hook.</span> <span id="s486">So then I said to myself: “I must not wait for the next occasion to get into this kind of a mess!”</span> <span id="s487">So I asked for two weeks of vacation and went to a rest camp in Rome.</span> <span id="s488">In Rome I went to the French Consulate.</span> <span id="s489">Since I had served under the French flag there was no problem.</span> <span id="s490">So I asked to be discharged in France.</span> <span id="s491">That was that.</span> <span id="s492">So five or six weeks later I was on the train to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: How did all of this affect your religious beliefs?</span> <span id="s494">your attitudes?</span> <span id="s495">Did it change anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: I really did not modify my religious beliefs, not really.</span> <span id="s497">I managed to get through it all without too much trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Were there times and places where you could have religious observances like the High Holy Days, and such?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: The little town where we stayed in the South of Algeria was an Arab town.</span> <span id="s500">Right at the entrance you were not allowed into it and I would not have ventured to do it anyway.</span> <span id="s501">Right on the fringe of this Arab town there was a synagogue, with the Jews living amongst the Arabs.</span> <span id="s502">That was earlier, when I was still in the army, in the Foreign Legion, when we were outside that little town.</span> <span id="s503">The Algerian Jews had a regular synagogue, something like a chapel.</span> <span id="s504">However that synagogue was different.</span> <span id="s505">First of all the women were not allowed in at all.</span> <span id="s506">They remained outside!</span> <span id="s507">It was completely different from anything we had been used to.</span> <span id="s508">At the High Holy Days we were causing some problems.</span> <span id="s509">We said that we were not going to go into work, whether they give us a day off or not, it would make no difference.</span> <span id="s510">We were not going to work on Yom Kippur!</span> <span id="s511">So they put us in a prison compound, a place surrounded by fences and a native soldier stood guard.</span> <span id="s512">We said: “You can do whatever you want, but we are not going to work.”</span> <span id="s513">So we went to this synagogue and it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s514">I was amazed how these small children, maybe three or four years old, how they followed the service, including the signing.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Now these were Sephardic Jews?</span> <span id="s516">How did they interact with the other Arab population?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: There I have no idea.</span> <span id="s518">You could recognize them from the other population at a glance because they dressed somewhat differently from the others.</span> <span id="s519">After Yom Kippur, when the service was over, I was going back to camp; but there was this one man who called after me.</span> <span id="s520">So, since I did not want to offend him since he was trying to be hospitable, I let him take me to his home to break the fast.</span> <span id="s521">His home was very dark.</span> <span id="s522">There was hardly any furniture.</span> <span id="s523">There was an old woman sitting in a corner.</span> <span id="s524">At the table there just he, his son and I. His daughter-in-law was just serving, she did not eat with us.</span> <span id="s525">I spoke to him in French.</span> <span id="s526">His French wasn’t all that good, but we were able to keep a conversation going.</span> <span id="s527">He explained to me than an Arab had prepared the meal, so that they could have the meal right after services.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: I imagine that the meal was simple by our standards?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Yes, very simple.</span> <span id="s530">The main part was chicken.</span> <span id="s531">I don’t remember what else.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did he tell you what kind of a place he had?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Was he a merchant?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: No, the merchants were Arabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: So now you are out of the armed forces.</span> <span id="s537">You went to Rome and you went to France.</span> <span id="s538">How did you get to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: My brother offered to send me an affidavit (an affidavit of support was required for immigration).</span> <span id="s540">It took about nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Where did you go when you came over?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: To Dayton, because this is where my brother lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Then you adjusted without any great problems?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I wouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s545">It was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: It was difficult mainly because I didn’t have any true work experience.</span> <span id="s548">I found that things were very different in this country, as you know.</span> <span id="s549">Going from Germany to France was an adjustment, but nothing compared to coming to this country.</span> <span id="s550">Everything was completely different.</span> <span id="s551">One of the main bridges I had to cross was that I was not fully trained for a profession.</span> <span id="s552">I kept this handicap when I got married.</span> <span id="s553">So we were both looking for a way out of this trade situation.</span> <span id="s554">We happened to know the Uhlmans (of NCR, the National Cash Company) who at the time was not yet President of NCR, but he was Vice-chairman, at the time.</span> <span id="s555">He talked to the fellow who later became my boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Then you started to work for NCR didn’t you?</span> <span id="s557">Using your foreign languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Your brother is here also?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes he is here.</span> <span id="s561">He is a patent attorney.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: A patent attorney?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: He is not an attorney.</span> <span id="s564">He is not admitted to a bar, therefore he cannot call himself an attorney, but he is a patent attorney.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: You mentioned your brother several times.</span> <span id="s566">How did he get out of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: He came to the U.S. in 1936.</span> <span id="s568">In 1942 he became a U.S. citizen and served in the U.S. army in WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Did you have any other relatives over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: There was the wife of a brother of my grandfather’s.</span> <span id="s571">This brother died in the very early 1900’s.</span> <span id="s572">His wife died in the 40’s.</span> <span id="s573">She is the one who gave my brother the affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Did your brother come right away to Dayton, also?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: No.</span> <span id="s576">He stayed in New York until he got a job in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Why did Dayton interest him?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: There was some work to be done on patents.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Let me talk to you about the fact that you mentioned that in the U.S. things were so completely different.</span> <span id="s580">We both knew this as a fact because we both came from Europe but please verbalize it.</span> <span id="s581">Where did you feel the difference most?</span> <span id="s582">How did it affect you?</span> <span id="s583">How did you feel it?</span> <span id="s584">In what way did you become aware of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: I had learned the upholstery business.</span> <span id="s586">In this business the whole approach is different.</span> <span id="s587">In Europe things are made to last.</span> <span id="s588">Here things have to be done very quickly because salaries are higher and the prices can only come so high.</span> <span id="s589">You have to do things much faster.</span> <span id="s590">You use anything you can to come up with a finished product, in a very short time.</span> <span id="s591">The way of living also is completely different.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: How did you feel this?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: The cars are an example of this case.</span> <span id="s594">Things have changed in Europe also.</span> <span id="s595">At the time when I came here, which was shortly after the war, in Europe the average person did not have a car.</span> <span id="s596">I came here and everybody had a car.</span> <span id="s597">It may be battered, it may be held together by sheer luck, but it’s a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Let me ask you this: “Suppose the Nazis would never have come, how does your life compare now to the life you might have led otherwise?</span> <span id="s599">You would have gone into a normal profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I would never have left from there.</span> <span id="s601">Compared to the general population, I believe that I would have had a fairly good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Do you think that you have a better life, the same kind of a life, or a worse life in this country, than you would have had in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: I would say that for a good part of the time, I was comparing my life to that of the general population, in Germany, I would probably have had a better life over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Well, thank you very much Joe.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: There is one point I want to make.</span> <span id="s606">There was one fellow who was a Sgt-Major in the Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s607">He was a Hungarian Jew.</span> <span id="s608">He could never become an officer.</span> <span id="s609">This was the only Jew I knew of who had been in the Regular Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s610">He had “Sache”.</span> <span id="s611">His people were always the best.</span> <span id="s612">He was actually a Company Commander.</span> <span id="s613">Although he was not a commissioned officer.</span> <span id="s614">When his company went on morning exercises, for example, before getting back to camp he would let them rest for 15 minutes, or even half an hour, then he would have them march into camp with music and all.</span> <span id="s615">Everybody was standing there and watching.</span> <span id="s616">No one could come close to that company in target shooting, for instance.</span> <span id="s617">He would yell at these people and shout at them, but he never punished anyone.</span> <span id="s618">They all loved him!</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: You say that he was Jewish?</span> <span id="s620">How did you know that?</span> <span id="s621">Did he act the part?</span> <span id="s622">Did he observe the Holy Days?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: I believe that he let it be known.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: But he did not practice Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Not that I knew of.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: He was the only Jew who ever made a career of the French Foreign Legion, that you knew of?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s628">It is actually a contradiction in terms, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Well, thank you again, Joe.</span></p></body></html>
