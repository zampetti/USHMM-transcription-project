id="s12">LB: I have been teaching the Holocaust and writing books about it for many years, so I understand the nature of such an interview very well.</span> <span id="s13">My current book is about returning to visit my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">WH: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">LB: In 1931.</span> <span id="s16">The town I came from was mostly Hungarian and it was not a very anti-Semitic place.</span> <span id="s17">It was called Chamorin.</span> <span id="s18">They had grown up under the democrats in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s19">Some of them tried to help us.</span> <span id="s20">But the town was small, located on a plain, everyone was well known, and it was very hard to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">WH: How did you feel when you returned to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">LB: Suddenly the loss became graphic.</span> <span id="s23">I saw my house still standing and people were living in it.</span> <span id="s24">Eighty percent of our neighbors were gone because of population exchanges that replaced Hungarians with Slovaks.</span> <span id="s25">It looked like another planet.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">WH: What year did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">LB: In 1951, with my mother.</span> <span id="s28">I had survived in Auschwitz and in Plaszow and later in Augsburg.</span> <span id="s29">My brother left in 1947.</span> <span id="s30">He had gotten papers from Yeshiva University.</span> <span id="s31">I had also gotten papers from a school, Esther Schoenfeld, but I didn’t go then because my mother couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s32">So from 1949 to 1951 I was in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s33">I wanted to go to Israel but my mother and brother went to the U.S., so I went too.</span> <span id="s34">HIAS has sponsored us and we came on the General Stewart.</span> <span id="s35">And I volunteered to be an interpreter for Mr. McGregor, second in command of the boat.</span> <span id="s36">I had learned English in Feldafing.</span> <span id="s37">I was young; I was only thirteen when I came to Auschwitz which was quite young.</span> <span id="s38">Mengele picked me out of the line for the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s39">He did it because I was tall and had blonde straight hair, and looked like an Aryan.</span> <span id="s40">He said to me: “You are not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s41">And I said: “I am.”</span></p> <p><span id="s42">WH: Wasn’t there a temptation to say you were not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">LB: No.</span> <span id="s44">First, at that age you don’t know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s45">Second, I had no idea then what Auschwitz was.</span> <span id="s46">Anyway he touched my braids and said: “What beautiful golden hair you have.</span> <span id="s47">How old are you?”</span> <span id="s48">So I said: “Thirteen.”</span> <span id="s49">And he said: “Remember…from now on, you are sixteen.”</span> <span id="s50">And then, he asked if that was my mother and told her to come with me.</span> <span id="s51">And then my aunt started to scream to come with us.</span> <span id="s52">And my mother asked Mengele, saying, her sister needed her.</span> <span id="s53">But he said: “No.</span> <span id="s54">Go with your daughter.</span> <span id="s55">She needs you more.”</span> <span id="s56">And then my aunt was dragged away.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">WH: How did you feel that such a terrible person did something nice for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">LB: He didn’t do it for me.</span> <span id="s59">He did it because I looked Aryan.</span> <span id="s60">Two minutes later I could have been shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">WH: Now; you were translating on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">LB: Yes.</span> <span id="s63">I knew the boat very well.</span> <span id="s64">It was small with several decks.</span> <span id="s65">I organized a kosher kitchen.</span> <span id="s66">When the boat left I spit on the shore, because I wanted to spit on Germany as we left Bremenhaven (She says those who call it Bremerhaven are wrong and don’t know.)</span> <span id="s67">Bremen is the town and the town in the port is called Bremenhaven.</span> <span id="s68">We stayed in an unused military camp in the town before we left.</span> <span id="s69">We stayed several weeks until the boat was ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: How do you feel about the behavior of some Jews during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">LB: Whenever I meet survivors I think to myself: “I wonder how she was in the camps?”</span> <span id="s72">Even without being a kapo, there were so many ways you could behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">WH: You mean like sharing with others?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">LB: Nobody shared.</span> <span id="s75">Nobody shared.</span> <span id="s76">Your piece of bread was really your life.</span> <span id="s77">But you had to stand on line for soup and some would push.</span> <span id="s78">In America my mother always said to me: “Why do you let people get ahead of you?”</span> <span id="s79">That was part of camp life.</span> <span id="s80">So sometimes I look at survivors and I wonder.</span> <span id="s81">A woman, Malvina Graf, came to me because she was doing a Masters Thesis and wanted credit for a book she’d written on Plaszow.</span> <span id="s82">And I helped her and looked at the book.</span> <span id="s83">And I saw that each of her sisters had some kind of a job in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s84">Now for you that means nothing.</span> <span id="s85">But for me it means that it’s very possible she was one of those toughies, but maybe she wasn’t.</span> <span id="s86">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s87">But I live with that.</span> <span id="s88">When I see people pushing I cry because it brings back those memories.</span> <span id="s89">On a tour of the Sinai there was this couple; everywhere we went, they were at the head of the line, getting back to the busses.</span> <span id="s90">The guide said: “Please save your water because we’re going to be in the desert for eight to ten hours.</span> <span id="s91">And this woman took her water and she started to clean her shoes and her hands.</span> <span id="s92">And I said to her, Mrs. So and So” “What will you do when you’ll run out of water?”</span> <span id="s93">And she said: “I’m sure the guide has some more water.”</span> <span id="s94">I turned to Len, (her husband) and said: “This woman would have done this in the concentration camps and wouldn’t have cared.”</span> <span id="s95">I don’t blame only the Nazis because there were other Germans and Hungarians, and the British who closed off Palestine, and the French who informed on people.</span> <span id="s96">This is human nature.</span> <span id="s97">But most people are not cruel or kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: You teach about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s99">Don’t you ask what good is all this education?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">LB: Oh yes, it’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: Did aggressive behavior give one a better chance of survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">LB: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s103">All things being equal, they had a better chance.</span> <span id="s104">Often people helped others because that helped them.</span> <span id="s105">Sisters or friends who banded together had a much better chance of survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">WH: Do you believe that writing about the Holocaust serves as a sort of release?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">LB: No.</span> <span id="s108">I don’t think that anything releases it emotionally, only intellectually.</span> <span id="s109">The longer time passes, the more difficult it becomes.</span> <span id="s110">In fact, having taught the Holocaust, I became more of a spectator, because by writing and teaching, I distanced myself from the experience.</span> <span id="s111">But it’s such a horror that you can’t fully appreciate it if you survived because it destroyed so much of you that you became immune to a large extent.</span> <span id="s112">But slowly the anesthesia is wearing off.</span> <span id="s113">You can no longer fool yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">WH: How do you feel about German reunification?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">LB: I’m not threatened by it.</span> <span id="s116">I don’t think that by being strong and unified gives birth to a Hitler.</span> <span id="s117">It was just the other way around.</span> <span id="s118">I don’t think that unification has anything to do with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: Do you think that education can help prevent a Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">LB: Education strikes at the root of prejudice.</span> <span id="s121">Christianity taught all sorts of things about Jews.</span> <span id="s122">If you can teach Christians about Jews, then they won’t be considered as an obscurantist group.</span> <span id="s123">I believe very much in contact.</span> <span id="s124">As an Orthodox Jew I believe we have a commitment to the survival of Judaism and intermarriage is going to erode the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s125">If intermarriage brings the other side into Judaism, I’m all for it.</span> <span id="s126">I am not against intermarriage if the other partner converts to Judaism.</span> <span id="s127">I’m not sure I want this published but I wasn’t against Schindler’s position on patrilineal descent.</span> <span id="s128">The more Jews are dragged into this “exclusive” group, the better.</span> <span id="s129">And I don’t care about exclusivity.</span> <span id="s130">Many Orthodox argue that it will result in a watered-down Yiddishkeit.</span> <span id="s131">It’s not true because Yiddishkeit has, through the years, always included all kinds of elements.</span> <span id="s132">Otherwise we wouldn’t be here.</span> <span id="s133">I’m very much for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: What if your child married someone not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">LB: If they would convert, what’s wrong with it?</span> <span id="s136">I would be happy.</span> <span id="s137">If the person is sincerely interested in Yiddishkeit…any goy who’s crazy enough to do that.</span> <span id="s138">I would love her.</span> <span id="s139">I had straight hair and could never get it to be curly, and as a child I always used to curse that great-great grandmother.</span> <span id="s140">That mamzer Cossack, what did he do to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WH: But it may have saved your life.</span> <span id="s142">And some Jews take it as a compliment that they’re told they don’t look Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">LB: And you do too.</span> <span id="s144">(She laughs.)</span></p> <p><span id="s145">WH: Where did you obtain your schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">LB: I completed the gymnasium in Munich.</span> <span id="s147">Here I got my B.A. in Brooklyn College at night.</span> <span id="s148">We lived in Flatbush.</span> <span id="s149">I worked during the day.</span> <span id="s150">My mother did piece work in a factory and I taught at Yeshiva Central in Queens.</span> <span id="s151">I had studied Hebrew in the DP camp.</span> <span id="s152">I studied the mishna and Tanach by myself.</span> <span id="s153">When I came here I took the tests in this area.</span> <span id="s154">I was very intoxicated with Jewish studies because I didn’t have anything before.</span> <span id="s155">Everybody thought I wasn’t Jewish because I didn’t look it.</span> <span id="s156">So I walked around with a big Magen David so no one should think I wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s157">I didn’t consider it a compliment.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">WH: But isn’t it often the case that survivors don’t want to be recognized as Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">LB: Yes, but in my case it was just the opposite.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">LB: I couldn’t explain it to you.</span> <span id="s162">I married someone whose last name is Jackson.</span> <span id="s163">So when I meet new people I say: “Oh I love part of the year in Israel.”</span> <span id="s164">I bring it into the conversation.</span> <span id="s165">Or I say: “I teach Jewish studies.”</span> <span id="s166">And I have often heard anti-Semitic remarks.</span> <span id="s167">Once in the subway the craziest thing happened in 1973 in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s168">A husky blond woman who was obviously a nurse was sitting next to me.</span> <span id="s169">She noticed a pregnant woman standing and she turned to me and said in an undertone: “These Jewish women.</span> <span id="s170">They are so brazen.</span> <span id="s171">They have no taste or manners.</span> <span id="s172">Do you see her?</span> <span id="s173">She’s pregnant and she’s flaunting her pregnancy.”</span> <span id="s174">So I thought she’s crazy and I said: “What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s175">And she said: “Don’t you see?</span> <span id="s176">She’s pregnant and instead of standing in such a way as to hide it…when I was a young woman and pregnant, I always wore a coat.</span> <span id="s177">Even in the summer I always wore a coat so nobody should see me, because of good taste.</span> <span id="s178">We were brought up with good taste, but these Jews, heh.”</span> <span id="s179">So I looked at her and said to her: “How do you know she’s Jewish?”</span> <span id="s180">And she says: “ I can tell a Jew anywhere.</span> <span id="s181">I take one look and I can tell them.”</span> <span id="s182">And I couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s183">She looked like anybody, just a young woman.</span> <span id="s184">So I said:” Would you ever take me for a Jew/” She said: “No.”</span> <span id="s185">So I pulled up my sleeve and I said:” Do you see this?”</span> <span id="s186">She looked and she said:” What is this?”</span> <span id="s187">And I answered: “This number was put on my arm at Auschwitz by people like you.”</span> <span id="s188">And by that time I was getting excited.</span> <span id="s189">And everybody’s looking at us.</span> <span id="s190">And I said: “ Are you a German?”</span> <span id="s191">She said: “No, only my husband is a German.</span> <span id="s192">I came here many years ago.</span> <span id="s193">My family came here from Germany.</span> <span id="s194">I was born in this country.”</span> <span id="s195">So I said: “You don’t have to be a German to be a Nazi.</span> <span id="s196">I don’t know, I don’t care if you are German or not, but you are a Nazi.</span> <span id="s197">People like you put six million Jews to death.</span> <span id="s198">You are calling this young woman a Jew and calling her brazen because she’s pregnant?</span> <span id="s199">Are you insane or just prejudiced?”</span> <span id="s200">And everybody was quiet.</span> <span id="s201">And she stood up and the train happened to come into the station, and she ran out.</span> <span id="s202">And everybody was applauding.</span> <span id="s203">Everybody was looking.</span> <span id="s204">I don’t know what they heard.</span> <span id="s205">But they heard me telling her she was a Nazi and they heard her saying: “ Only my husband is a German.”</span> <span id="s206">The tragedy is that she was a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">WH: Where did you get this very strong sense of Jewish pride?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">LB: Part of it was defiance.</span> <span id="s209">Before the war I didn’t know much.</span> <span id="s210">But after the war I felt that I suffered for being a Jew and I wanted to know about it.</span> <span id="s211">First, I believe that the Jews are a special people, not genetically, but anyone who subscribes to this “club” is special.</span> <span id="s212">I also think that the ideals of Judaism and its values are very special.</span> <span id="s213">And I think if everyone would achieve that level of holiness there wouldn’t be Holocausts and things like taking an eleven year old child and burning him.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">WH: What do you think of the relationship of blacks and Jews?</span> <span id="s215">I mean, you teach in a school like mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">LB: As a survivor I have a strong affinity for blacks.</span> <span id="s217">Not just because they suffered but primarily because I know that blacks did not participate in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s218">I look at them and know they or their grandparents couldn’t have done it.</span> <span id="s219">That is a very important thing for me.</span> <span id="s220">The other thing is I believe that blacks don’t have a tradition of anti-Semitism the way whites have had for centuries.</span> <span id="s221">And I believe that what they’re taught is simply propaganda and, of course, as a result, many of them have such attitudes.</span> <span id="s222">Blacks are very important to me because I think they have been terribly misled and it’s a tragedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">WH: What about Hispanics?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">LB: It’s the same thing.</span> <span id="s225">I tell my Hispanic students: You have Jewish blood because in Spain and in places like Recife and Curacao there were large numbers of Marranos who intermingled.</span> <span id="s226">And they think about it and then they know about it---Rodriguez and Mendez.</span> <span id="s227">And the name Bitton, which I have from my first husband, is also Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">WH: How did you get to be a professor?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">LB: I graduated Brooklyn in 1961 and then went on to N.Y.U. And all these years I worked hard, teaching in yeshivas.</span> <span id="s230">I got my Master’s in Jewish history at N.Y.U. and then received a doctorate there in history.</span> <span id="s231">I wrote about the history of Zionism in Hungary during a certain period.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">WH: When were you first married?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">LB: In 1953, two years after I came here.</span> <span id="s234">Part of the tragedy of my first marriage was that the person I married was not a survivor.</span> <span id="s235">I didn’t recognize that this was a bad choice because I didn’t really want to talk about the Holocaust then; I didn’t want it to be part of my future.</span> <span id="s236">And I married someone who came from Morocco, a totally different culture.</span> <span id="s237">And he was a scholar and that was the big thing for me, the Yiddishkite.</span> <span id="s238">He had come here through the Mirrer Yeshiva.</span> <span id="s239">He was a teacher in Yeshiva Magen David.</span> <span id="s240">He became the principal there.</span> <span id="s241">He was a very talented young man.</span> <span id="s242">Everyone knew him.</span> <span id="s243">But he had very different ideas about what a wife should do, He didn’t want me to go to school, or work, or drive, or talk on the telephone.</span> <span id="s244">So I married Len after I discovered that…</span></p> <p><span id="s245">WH: How were you able to last fifteen years?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">LB: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s247">Mentally, It was worse than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s248">Basically I brought up the kids.</span> <span id="s249">And, thank God, I have two wonderful children.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">WH: Well, you seem to me to be a very optimistic and vivacious person.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">LB: Yes I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s253">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0003 PAGE 9</span></p> <p><span id="s254">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s255">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0007 PAGE 2</span></p> <p><span id="s256">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
