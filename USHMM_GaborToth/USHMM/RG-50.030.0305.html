id="s10">Q: If you would please tell me your name, where you were born, when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: My name is Solomon Rodashinksy.</span> <span id="s12">I was born and raised in Poland, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s13">My birthday is May 17, 1910.</span> <span id="s14">All my life I was in Warsaw, the whole family.</span> <span id="s15">I come from eight people, six children, three girls and three boys and my father and my mother and the rest of the family, my father's side was six brothers and three sisters.</span> <span id="s16">My mother's was two sisters and three brothers, so we had a big family.</span> <span id="s17">Over there, I figured out after the war how many people is alive, I never find it to now nobody.</span> <span id="s18">I was looking in papers, conventions, I was going in 1981 and in 1993 the Washington D.C. and then in 1985 in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s19">There was a convention I ever missed, I advertised through the radio, through the television, through the .</span> <span id="s20">Still now I get some papers from the , they ask me to find somebody and until now I never saw a person pointing their finger saying I know you.</span> <span id="s21">There was 78 people including nieces, nephews, all of the family, and I'm the one alive.</span> <span id="s22">I ask myself many times why, why am I alive?</span> <span id="s23">But, maybe God leave it me to be alive to sometime say the way I am and what I am and that's it.</span> <span id="s24">Then in 1940 Yom Kippur day, it comes out they're going to make a ghetto and that ghetto don't take too long from Yom Kippur to November 15, everybody had to come out and where to find a room.</span> <span id="s25">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s26">Some people never let in, but later on they did it because the Jewish section around Warsaw was around and we found a room of less in , the street.</span> <span id="s27">But there was on the one room, six people, my mother, my father, three sisters and I who were the six.</span> <span id="s28">I think one of my brothers there.</span> <span id="s29">We sleep on the floor and the winter time -- and Europe's winter time is not like here, a little day like yesterday morning you say oh it's cold.</span> <span id="s30">I say it's cold too, because I'm already 45 years here in the United States, but the life was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s31">Until they come into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">The ghetto was so terrible, people were laying in the streets.</span> <span id="s33">Mostly the people were coming around from around the small towns behind Balsa.</span> <span id="s34">The Germans throw out and make it the third .</span> <span id="s35">The third means any people can't live around in this town, the third .</span> <span id="s36">People with little children, they're in the street every morning we saw the dead in the corner.</span> <span id="s37">When the Jewish commander , that means people would come and pick up the dead people in little hand trailers and bring that to the cemetery and the cemetery had no place.</span> <span id="s38">They made big, big holes and they put in 100 to 200 people and they covered it.</span> <span id="s39">No food.</span> <span id="s40">So, when I'm talking about, I see the picture from my eyes what happened there.</span> <span id="s41">There was a young guy, his name was Rubinstein.</span> <span id="s42">He was no crazy, he made it crazy.</span> <span id="s43">He was running around in the streets, I have to say a few words in Yiddish what he said , that means we're all the same and the fat get off, so it's no one higher than the other one.</span> <span id="s44">And he knows to who to go and ask for money.</span> <span id="s45">You got a cat, give me money.</span> <span id="s46">Give me five , like you say here five dollars and if you're going to give me I'm going to holler and we got scared.</span> <span id="s47">Everybody give him, he got a full cap with money, he go around in those sections with the poor people laying in the street with their children and take the money and throw it, and they grabbed the money and bring the money again, just money.</span> <span id="s48">He helped those poor people in the street.</span> <span id="s49">This was not help too, of course.</span> <span id="s50">There come a time 1942, July 22, the about 2 o'clock signs in the street who wants to go to work and get two bread.</span> <span id="s51">Our bread at that time, our bread is not like you got it here, a pint, a bread is a kilo.</span> <span id="s52">A kilo is close to two and half pounds.</span> <span id="s53">People pushed one into the other one.</span> <span id="s54">Everybody like to be the first to get the bread.</span> <span id="s55">The first transport as 20,000 people.</span> <span id="s56">They don't know where they're going.</span> <span id="s57">Nobody don't know but the president and the Jewish commander his name was .</span> <span id="s58">He hid a man, a Pollock and he paid him money to follow the trains with 20,000 people and that Pollock took that money and never came back.</span> <span id="s59">The next day he did the same thing.</span> <span id="s60">He gave another Pollock the money and follow it.</span> <span id="s61">He never came back, but Treblinka is not too far from Warsaw, is 120 kilometers is like 80 miles.</span> <span id="s62">The third day comes a young man blonde, he never looked like a Jew and he took off his arm band and put on a cap like the Pollocks used to wear with the leather, and he said 80 years old the guy is, all but 6'2" tall and he said I risk my life.</span> <span id="s63">I'm going to follow that train and I'm coming back.</span> <span id="s64">I don't want no money and I'm coming back and I'm going to see what's going on and he followed and he was coming back and it was told Mr.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">this and this place, Treblinka is a crematorium.</span> <span id="s66">The people coming down in the trains is no selection like they make selections in other camps, it is no selection they tell them to get off their clothes and they tell them they're going in to take a bath, and they cut off their hair, everybody, the men, the women and they shave their heads and they're going in a shed, they close the door, outside in the corner there is a man who brings down the switch.</span> <span id="s67">They bring down the switch and it pumps gas.</span> <span id="s68">He heard that and the people were hollering, children crying and a while later, he said they come in and they're taking out little hand trailers, put it down and bring that to the crematoriums put them in the ovens.</span> <span id="s69">He told this, Mr. , when I speak many times about this, I tell their story.</span> <span id="s70">To me the men did a big mistake.</span> <span id="s71">He's supposed to say for the public what's going on.</span> <span id="s72">There's no where to go any way, what you know.</span> <span id="s73">He did it.</span> <span id="s74">He called his whole family, brothers, sisters, brother- in-laws, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces to his house and closed all the windows, the doors, and put in all the ovens the gas, and they killed themselves.</span> <span id="s75">The next morning we find it out with a note what this is and they're all dead.</span> <span id="s76">They're dead, nobody can take their life.</span> <span id="s77">They come in and take that way and they were going the same way the others were, the same way.</span> <span id="s78">That time, the organizations the communists other , allies got together and seen to protect what they can protect.</span> <span id="s79">but Pollocks used to come in the ghetto, they don't suppose they smuggle in themself.</span> <span id="s80">One bring a few potatoes, one bring a bread, and he asked you want a suit.</span> <span id="s81">We give him our suit and they give us bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Whatever he wanted, we give him.</span> <span id="s83">He asked not for money and the people got clothes and they got in contact with the Polish side only risk was some of them take the money and they bring a gun and they bring a rifle.</span> <span id="s84">They bring some bullets.</span> <span id="s85">Some of them say no send me the money.</span> <span id="s86">How can we send the money.</span> <span id="s87">There was little children, 8, 10, 12 that break the fence from the ghetto, it was a brick fence and the evening as soon as it's getting a little dark those children were going over on the other side smuggling.</span> <span id="s88">They used to buy some bread, potatoes, carrots.</span> <span id="s89">Early in the morning, six o'clock in the morning when we can walk and get daylight, they're coming back.</span> <span id="s90">With their children we're sending all the money and they send the ammunition and they bring ammunition and many times if they send the children through the canals, the drains in the street, the drains in the street was dry because when they used no water, there was nothing to cook so there was no water.</span> <span id="s91">It should have gone through the drains and canals in the street to the other side and bringing in bottles with gasoline, and we make bombs.</span> <span id="s92">Fill a bottle with gasoline and cover it with a piece of rag that's coming out and light and throw and this was a bomb.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Were you involved with this?</span> <span id="s94">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: But you knew about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I know that, but I would have been but I know that.</span> <span id="s97">Not everybody was to know that, but I know that.</span> <span id="s98">I was even maybe three kilometers, three kilometers is over two miles because my shop was in a different street and as so we got organized from bombs, ammunition, hand grenades, rifles, you know, and the time was coming.</span> <span id="s99">I was a .</span> <span id="s100">The Germans got two shops.</span> <span id="s101">One shop was the name Schultz and one shop was Terbantz.</span> <span id="s102">I was in Terbantz, three kilometers away, let's say like three miles.</span> <span id="s103">One day a guy came and said he saw my sister by Schultz.</span> <span id="s104">I say you're sure.</span> <span id="s105">He said you know I know your sister, the youngster.</span> <span id="s106">I said yes, and I say how can I go over and see?</span> <span id="s107">I'm locked up here, I cannot go out on the street.</span> <span id="s108">He said I was coming with a German and I'm going to stay there over night and if you want he's going to take you and he's going to bring you back, but it's going to cost you 500 marks, like $500.</span> <span id="s109">I say okay, I give him the money and he introduced me to the German and the German tied my hand with a piece of string in the bag and I'm in front of him and they're behind me with the rifle and he bring me over there to Schultz.</span> <span id="s110">I come over there and he give me the address and I look and my sister is not there.</span> <span id="s111">I asked people that I used to know and some of them said yes she was working today.</span> <span id="s112">Some said they didn't see her in a few days.</span> <span id="s113">I can never find her.</span> <span id="s114">It's coming five o'clock I have to go back and the German soldier said to me we cannot go back.</span> <span id="s115">I cannot come back.</span> <span id="s116">I said why?</span> <span id="s117">He said you don't know?</span> <span id="s118">I said no what is?</span> <span id="s119">You bring me to the gate, to the fence, he said look out, do you see what there is?</span> <span id="s120">I said yes I see man soldiers there around this is what tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s121">I said what do you mean tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s122">He said all the Juden are going to be dead tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s123">This was the 18th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: 1943, I stayed over night as soon as daylight was coming in the morning we hear a song.</span> <span id="s126">The Germans opened the gate and come in in the ghetto and singing that song all the Jews are going to be dead today.</span> <span id="s127">We looked down there and we see in the meantime comes out three soldiers, officers, the lieutenant, a captain and looking like the Germans were walking with their hands in the boots and their head high and stopping.</span> <span id="s128">They stopped and one from the three asked the leader of the group where are you going.</span> <span id="s129">We're going to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s130">You got a paper to show something.</span> <span id="s131">We don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s132">No, we don't have nothing.</span> <span id="s133">The major is outside.</span> <span id="s134">They turn around and come back they don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s135">They turn around and go back they started to fire.</span> <span id="s136">Fire was coming out where the building I was before, demolished, half from the bombs.</span> <span id="s137">See nobody in that time we killed all but two hundred soldiers inside.</span> <span id="s138">The Jews started the uprising April 19 and I was there because I was not going back.</span> <span id="s139">Hundreds were probably killed but the Germans saw that we be strong, but one thing we never got, we didn't have no airplanes or they're throwing out higher bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">They got that.</span> <span id="s141">They started throwing out the bombs with the fire bombs and this was about six weeks we were fighting.</span> <span id="s142">May 1st was quiet in the morning and I was going out taking a look and I got a shot in my right ankle.</span> <span id="s143">See my right ankle, I got the shot right there, through

id="s174">They were scared to trust, maybe spies, civil spies, Germans.</span> <span id="s175">Even they know me, no we have no place for you to help.</span> <span id="s176">When we need you we'll call you.</span> <span id="s177">There was organized.</span> <span id="s178">They were fighting six weeks.</span> <span id="s179">When the war started German met Poland not even less two weeks.</span>

in a tombstone but it stood where he used to live Street.</span> <span id="s183">My wife used to live on that street.</span> <span id="s184">I saw that tombstone, and it is written in Hebrew and in Jewish and in Polish, his name.</span> <span id="s185">My wife used to know the man.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: How did you know where to hide?</span> <span id="s187">Where did you hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Like I say before, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s189">All my family dead, I'm the one alive.</span> <span id="s190">There were many people that survived the .</span> <span id="s191">There was no place to go.</span> <span id="s192">We go into the bunkers.</span> <span id="s193">There were many bunkers.</span> <span id="s194">There were bunkers made onto the ground.</span> <span id="s195">From one street to the other one for two miles and the Germans found them out and they destroyed the bunkers with the people.</span> <span id="s196">We can never find the people later.</span> <span id="s197">It was to go out .</span> <span id="s198">When I got and that was on the ground, those bunkers from all the way from street to the other one and they find it and they throw bombs there.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">The whole Warsaw is destroyed, 85 percent destroyed.</span> <span id="s200">I was there two years ago and I don't want to go there.</span> <span id="s201">My daughter used to bother me to go and I when I was coming there to Street and I take a look inside.</span> <span id="s202">I didn't want to go no further, not one house.</span> <span id="s203">Everything is destroyed and the barracks the Russians put up barracks four or five floors and the Pollocks come, there never was so many Pollocks there and they got in the millions there not in the thousands, in the millions in the street so many cars, they park in the sidewalk, they park in the cars.</span> <span id="s204">I was coming to Maidenek.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Okay, I was just wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about your life before the war, so can we just go back and then we'll get to Maidenek.</span> <span id="s206">When you were living in Warsaw, I want to know a little bit more about your family life.</span> <span id="s207">You weren't married before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Oh, you were married.</span> <span id="s210">When you went into the ghetto your wife was with you as well?</span> <span id="s211">A: She was, not too long.</span> <span id="s212">She was all the time with me until 1942 to .</span></p> <p><span id="s213">One day it was in September and October was a selection and they took out all the people plus the people that were in the shop.</span> <span id="s214">I was in the shop and that was in the house.</span> <span id="s215">It was supposed to be that people were in the house working the night shift and they want to know who took that evening.</span> <span id="s216">A man, a German officer, he was running the shop and he told the people from the night shift and they said you get us some others and they say I don't have it.</span> <span id="s217">They say that's your problem and took them, all of them to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: So, when you came home for work?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: This was in the same building, they left ten minutes later all the shop we go down there and saw nobody was there.</span> <span id="s220">Even was a lot of children was too.</span> <span id="s221">In Europe the houses are not like here.</span> <span id="s222">The houses are built in the ground a cellar and then build up the houses and we put together a few cellars and we hid over there a woman which worked in the shop with children.</span> <span id="s223">On the other side, we put in some water to see when the commandant says something is broken from the pipes, water on it because you cannot get a plumber.</span> <span id="s224">But somebody who had a big mouth said on the other side there is a woman and children.</span> <span id="s225">We'd like to find it out and we can never find it out who did it there.</span> <span id="s226">Who did it there we just think it was the police.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: The Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: That's right.</span> <span id="s229">The police had a big mouth and that did it and those Germans knocked off that wall and there were people who were going out -- they had to close the water and they got wet and it was a very frozen day, and snow and they have to go through the water and walk through the .</span> <span id="s230">I think many, many was fall down there and it was a far way to walk to the place where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did you have any children at that time?</span> <span id="s232">A: One child, two and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: When you were working at the plant what kind of work were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: We used to make jackets from lambskins like the jackets, the short ones.</span> <span id="s235">We used to make lambskin jackets like that because Europe is very cold.</span> <span id="s236">Some jackets like this we used to make gloves and caps.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Who were you making them for?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: For the Germans.</span> <span id="s239">Everything was for the Germans.</span> <span id="s240">Every day so much had to be ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Do you think because you were a furrier that this bought you time because you could work well for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, that's what saved me.</span> <span id="s243">They never touched the men from the shop, just they look in the houses, the private houses.</span> <span id="s244">We used to live in the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: The same building you worked in?</span> <span id="s246">A: Yes, the same building.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: So you couldn't go back to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No, the same building.</span> <span id="s249">We never saw the street.</span> <span id="s250">In the morning when we're going out to the shop or work at night they come down in the morning, six o'clock, six thirty in the morning I got back in my room, sleep until 3:00, 4:00 in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: I'm a little confused because you say when you first went into the ghetto you lived with your family and there were many people in one room?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s253">They started the ghetto.</span> <span id="s254">This was in 1940.</span> <span id="s255">At that time there were no shops.</span> <span id="s256">In 1941, '42 they organized the shops, before they opened the shops we were scared to walk in the streets because they grabbed people in the street and some of them never came home.</span> <span id="s257">To clean the snow from the railroad tracks, work in the street, this started this was later.</span> <span id="s258">This started in 1942 when Treblinka opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: How did people get chosen for work?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well not everybody can get work.</span> <span id="s261">You have to be -- when you say you're a tailor you have to be a tailor.</span> <span id="s262">There was a tailor shop too.</span> <span id="s263">There was in the same street, but our shop was the furrier shop was a big university, a big building they make a tailor shop.</span> <span id="s264">When somebody registered a tailor is going in and working and he didn't know how to do something.</span> <span id="s265">He never come out, why he never come out was a man, a German.</span> <span id="s266">His name was , and he was coming mostly at night.</span> <span id="s267">He was coming and checking, not in the

that I got a shot when I was running.</span> <span id="s451">The bombs the bullets everything falling.</span> <span id="s452">See, there was nobody to trust.</span> <span id="s453">Nobody to trust, especially you thought them to be the police they want to show off who they are.</span> <span id="s454">This was the trouble.</span> <span id="s455">Maybe it would be a little better.</span> <span id="s456">Maybe it would be better to get something more to eat, but of course the Pollocks were coming in and they wanted to help, only they wanted something.</span> <span id="s457">They were robbed themselves.</span> <span id="s458">When we go out after the -- the 19th of April I saw there's nobody there from our family and then I was coming from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s459">I was coming from Maidonek with my leg and I got a bed, I laid down I see a man comes over to me and asks me the way I came.</span> <span id="s460">He saw the limp and I showed him my leg and I told him he said I can help you but I cannot help you with no medication.</span> <span id="s461">I said well, first do what you can.</span> <span id="s462">First I am a doctor, and he took it out a little pocket knife.</span> <span id="s463">He took it out and he operated on the leg there.</span> <span id="s464">I was lucky they give me a shot, it was a long time, he said this is going to help you and he helped me cut it up and make bandages but I had no medicine, no medication nothing.</span> <span id="s465">But I say I can do it.</span> <span id="s466">Help yourself, I said what can I help myself, excuse me the next person say you and that's going to help you.</span> <span id="s467">The next morning we go out to the appell 5:30 in the morning and I look around and I see a few guys I used to know and they tell me everything and they said how can you walk out of the gate.</span> <span id="s468">When they see you limp they'll take you out.</span> <span id="s469">When they take you out they're going to hold you until the evening when we all are coming back, and you see the kitchen there, yes, they're going to be hanged.</span> <span id="s470">I'm in trouble again.</span> <span

cover you.</span> <span id="s473">And they'll try it, and I walked out and I was coming back the same way.</span> <span id="s474">What was the trouble outside?</span> <span id="s475">Outside was the most trouble than the inside.</span> <span id="s476">We gathered the wooden shoes there, and we come outside we had to take off and got the two holes in the bag, one got a piece of string to pull it back together and put it on the left shoulder, not the right, the left shoulder and walking backward and they grab you.</span> <span id="s477">They grab your coat, the skin -- many people found and they shot them and put them on the side and when we're walking back, we have to bring back the dead, carry back the dead because by the appell in the morning they count out 200 that they are coming back 200 the same way, dead or alive, bring them back.</span> <span id="s478">The end of the day I get better in the leg.</span> <span id="s479">It was nine weeks in Maidonek.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Now were you working every day with this bad leg?</span> <span id="s481">A: Yes, I go to work outside in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Like digging?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Digging and we were bringing out some trash.</span> <span id="s484">It was very, very dirty work.</span> <span id="s485">Dirty work like dirty work, but to be nine weeks not to have my shirt to change, not to get a bath, nothing.</span> <span id="s486">Excuse me for my expression but the lice, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s487">Not just from me, we had 1,500 people in that

id="s491">They were talking yesterday, about Auschwitz and Birkenau, I didn't want to say nothing.</span> <span id="s492">Many people know that.</span> <span id="s493">It was written one time in the papers, in a magazine how Maidonek was the worst concentration camp in the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: They treat people worse than animals.</span> <span id="s496">They didn't need to kill people.</span> <span id="s497">People killed themselves.</span> <span id="s498">Rows and rows of , 29 factory from and they had two boys that were Fins and

and he said Daddy's going to .</span> <span id="s515">That guy and the two twins hanged themselves in barracks, the same night they took out the bells.</span> <span id="s516">Two young boys and an 18 year old boy.</span> <span id="s517">The older three they hanged themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Did you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Yes, they bring them out in the morning to the appell to the counting.</span> <span id="s520">1,500 people in one barrack and dead to live everybody had to be counted out the same day and then we go out to work.</span> <span id="s521">People got killed we had to bring them back and lay down there and they have to come, the dead.</span> <span id="s522">When I was out, when the SS men took the three groups, the 750 people and my group was staying and I didn't make the five and I was in the second 100 and the second 50 the officer there was an appell that come to seek out a big holes.</span> <span id="s523">I remember now when I look at the holes.</span> <span id="s524">A black holes with a white striped nose and the legs have, all of her legs have white and he was lighting the hose around her everyday by the appell.</span> <span id="s525">When the officer took us and we would stay separate, the other two groups he took away the same thing.</span> <span id="s526">One group is gone and digging stones and the other group is gone making ammunition.</span> <span id="s527">Only he was looking and see he comes over and colors dogs, why he colors dogs, because they were wearing metal numbers on a piece of metal with a piece of string.</span> <span id="s528">I remember my number 993, I remember my number and he say do you smoke a cigarette and watch and tell me who smoked a cigarette and if not I'm going to hang dogs and I'll give you three minutes.</span> <span id="s529">We're not supposed to move nothing.</span> <span id="s530">A whole day in summer in July in the heat, no nothing, and we cannot answer nothing for three minutes.</span> <span id="s531">It took not three minutes.</span> <span id="s532">Started the whistle and bring out the bench with the robes and everything and he comes over and he got a whip like this with the silk that you throw on the animals.</span> <span id="s533">He gathered the first two fifths rivals.</span> <span id="s534">Nobody wanted to go first in the bench.</span> <span id="s535">No blind fold or nothing, they have to put on the rope themselves.</span> <span id="s536">I was in the first three.</span> <span id="s537">Turn around and we gathered the ropes.</span> <span id="s538">The rope was hooked in and to kick away the bench and the first three to be hanged.</span> <span id="s539">I muddle by and he hollered, the officer hollered halt, halt,

survived.</span> <span id="s549">He beat us but they come down there but we're supposed to stay the next morning but he took us the same night.</span> <span id="s550">He took us out to the railroad and we stayed in that train there and the next morning we left, a day and a night and we was coming to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s551">We were coming to Auschwitz and we see coming in , the sign is still there.</span> <span id="s552">I saw that two years ago.</span> <span id="s553">Well, the 750 he made the selection and he took it out 300.</span> <span id="s554">What was the 300, the 300 was already, they were not able to work.</span> <span id="s555">There was frozen, the face, the legs, they can't walk.</span> <span id="s556">People run in, he never saw them.</span> <span id="s557">He said 150 they started to go and everybody wanted to get out of Maidonek.</span> <span id="s558">He bring some soldiers with machine guns and it's in Auschwitz they called it the Birkenau.</span> <span id="s559">Over there they killed 300 people.</span> <span id="s560">No gas chamber, no shower, no nothing just like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: How did they kill them?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: With machine guns, and took them away.</span> <span id="s563">Q: Tell me about your arrival at Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Well I arrived at Auschwitz, the first thing I was glad to be over there.</span> <span id="s565">Yes, I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s566">I got other clothes an I was going to get a shower and a shirt and underwear.</span> <span id="s567">A little more in Maidonek, I'd hang myself too.</span> <span id="s568">You can't even get to the toilet in the morning.</span> <span id="s569">Terrible, so that camp I never saw all that many but this one was worse.</span> <span id="s570">When I was coming to Auschwitz I can go in and they cut off my hair and I get shower and wash me up.</span> <span id="s571">Once in nine weeks, ten weeks, I feel like I'm newly born.</span> <span id="s572">But later on, I got some problems.</span> <span id="s573">This was a difference.</span> <span id="s574">I got some problems.</span> <span id="s575">I was the first job was I was digging potatoes from the ground where they cover them for the winter, not to get them frozen.</span> <span id="s576">I had all the bad ones that were frozen were going for us.</span> <span id="s577">The good ones were going for the SS.</span> <span id="s578">That's what they tell me.</span> <span id="s579">If you didn't find one good potato between there, you'd be hanged, that's all.</span> <span id="s580">I was working there a few weeks.</span> <span id="s581">The second a few months, after there from every Sunday I can be shaved.</span> <span id="s582">If I'm not shaved until 12:00 I get no soup.</span> <span id="s583">I have to be shaved, my face has to be shaved until 12:00 and 12:00 they're bringing out the soup.</span> <span id="s584">Any man not shaved cannot get it.</span> <span id="s585">You have to be shaved to get a little bit of soup.</span> <span id="s586">If not I'd have to wait until Monday 12:00.</span> <span id="s587">Sunday evening if you're working you get Sunday evening a little piece of bread.</span> <span id="s588">If you're not working you get nothing, just 12:00 the soup.</span> <span id="s589">The barber was a barber like me.</span> <span id="s590">He says he's a barber.</span> <span id="s591">He got a knife and cut it.</span> <span id="s592">From the water, the water was not clean and I got an infection.</span> <span id="s593">I got an infection but they stopped me and one time took me out of the line and I was going to the hospital.</span> <span id="s594">I stayed in the hospital maybe eight ten days but I was lucky the men there was in the hospital he gave me a little mirror he said that's one thing that can help you.</span> <span id="s595">You're not going to get another one.</span> <span id="s596">You can die here and you're not going to get another one.</span> <span id="s597">Be careful because I want this back.</span> <span id="s598">You pull out of the hair as much as you can.</span> <span id="s599">Pull out and then the infection will be better and take a little water and I was sitting for days and pulling out hair by hair and that's what helped.</span> <span id="s600">I was six or seven days in the hospital.</span> <span id="s601">Then I was coming out, I got another job another block, block six.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Block six, I come out and I see some people coming from work and some young guys where they used to come in 1942 was not finished.</span> <span id="s603">Behind in the 76,000 that number and one comes over to me and asks me where are you from and I told him and they said oh tell me about the Warsaw ghetto uprising and I told him all that I can, how we were fighting in there and he brings another two guys, he brings over and the one asked me

I called them by their name no one believed me.</span> <span id="s606">He said their name, how did you call me, I said yes I tell them how they called them.</span> <span id="s607">I told him when I saw him on the last day in that I told him that guy is going he got the left ear, he was born with that little piece that was hanging down and he said how did they call him by his nick name, I said they call him because of his ear.</span> <span id="s608">When I saw this, I got one in a way in a side and got a piece of bread this size.</span> <span id="s609">One bring me a soup but it was cold.</span> <span id="s610">It was good soup.</span> <span id="s611">One of them ask me one of the piece of paper where they give you you are going to work.</span> <span id="s612">I have to go into block two tomorrow morning 5:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s613">I see the piece of paper, I don't want you going over there.</span> <span id="s614">I said why.</span> <span id="s615">You're going to be going into a coal mine.</span> <span id="s616">Yesterday I met a man who was working in that coal mine.</span> <span id="s617">He was working in a coal mine, and he is -- and they say no you're not going, and I say if I'm not going I'm going to be hanged.</span> <span id="s618">He said nobody is going to hang you.</span> <span id="s619">Give me the piece of paper.</span> <span id="s620">He pulled it down and went away to the kapos and talked to the kapos.</span> <span id="s621">He had the connection with their friends in their own town.</span> <span id="s622">They was working and they can organize something and they bring in the kapos, the kapos they changing, the kapo was for their job was not are criminal.</span> <span id="s623">A young man, 6'6" tall who weighed over 300 pounds.</span> <span id="s624">The face when you look into his eyes you don't know him, he's a murderer.</span> <span id="s625">He was the kapo of us.</span> <span id="s626">But this room where I was and that boy is make him good.</span> <span id="s627">Then he saw something he don't like you he killed that boy right now.</span> <span id="s628">I saw one time he took a guy when they used to come and he took a shovel and hit him in the head and he killed him.</span> <span id="s629">He reported it that somebody ran away and nobody can say that it is lie.</span> <span id="s630">Everybody won't say they were lying.</span> <span id="s631">The kapo is telling, take him, let the commandant in the morning and I was scared.</span> <span id="s632">I was how I can go out to pass the gate when I got my numbers here.</span> <span id="s633">They said you come with us.</span> <span id="s634">We're going to save you.</span> <span id="s635">You going over there eight ten days you'll be dead.</span> <span id="s636">You cannot make it in a coal mine.</span> <span id="s637">They covered me and I passed in the morning and I come back in the evening and I was working the whole time until the end with those guys.</span> <span id="s638">My job was ten people we were digging and bringing it to Birkenau twice a day and we covered the ashes.</span> <span id="s639">When the ashes were coming out from the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s640">The crematorium and in the back there was a little hole there and coming out the ashes and there was a big two holes to get out and we were covering them with the , we were covered with ashes.</span> <span id="s641">I showed my daughter the crematoriums in Maidonek and I showed her the ashes because in Birkenau you can't see, it's demolished everything.</span> <span id="s642">One crematorium is just a little bit there.</span> <span id="s643">You know it's a crematorium but you cannot see nothing.</span> <span id="s644">In Birkenau and Maidonek all the crematoriums and gas chambers is in Birkenau and I was showing her how the gas chambers and the crematorium where the people were going into the ovens and the ashes come out in the back and I was covered in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: This was kind of a unique job.</span> <span id="s646">Can you remember what you were thinking as you did this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s648">When I wasn't going to another job, maybe I was there a long time because I got out of here and the boys were saved me.</span> <span id="s649">They saved me not to go into the coal mine.</span> <span id="s650">I know to myself if I was going to a coal mine I was going to be dead.</span> <span id="s651">The condition that I was, and that helped me.</span> <span id="s652">They gave me some kind of piece of bread.</span> <span id="s653">They give me some time a little soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Were they working with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: The same group, ten to fifteen people that were coming out there in the fields was divided.</span> <span id="s656">One time they come and they say you can make a cape for a kapo.</span> <span id="s657">I said yes, but I have no material, I have no needle.</span> <span id="s658">I need a needle and thread ad scissors.</span> <span id="s659">You go and get everything and when they bring me there and I say to one, look I have to take the measurement to make the cape.</span> <span id="s660">But I was scared to go up and talk to him.</span> <span id="s661">He said don't worry.</span> <span id="s662">I will take the measurement.</span> <span id="s663">I said I have no tape but I can take a piece of paper and take it around and that's what I need.</span> <span id="s664">We come out to work in the morning, they bring me in to the toilet and he was coming in and he looked and me and he whether I hear what he say and I told him to sit down because he was tall, 6'6".</span> <span id="s665">I told him to sit down on the toilet.</span> <span id="s666">I take a piece of paper and I told him to take off his cap and make the measurement.</span> <span id="s667">He said that's it, I said that's it.</span> <span id="s668">I can make the cape in two or three hours but I worked two days, in the same toilet every day.</span> <span id="s669">I was sitting over there for two days and I made him the cape.</span> <span id="s670">He brought me in a piece of bread in the middle of work and I made him the cape and he looked at that.</span> <span id="s671">I hope he still has it.</span> <span id="s672">He was very happy.</span> <span id="s673">Then he don't touch me.</span> <span id="s674">He never beat me, never, for eighteen months I was working for him.</span> <span id="s675">He never put a finger on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Tell me a little bit more about this work, because you were doing the same work for a year and half?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Did you see a lot of people coming and going?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: I see men were coming out of Birkenau.</span> <span id="s680">We saw the transports coming, people coming in transports.</span> <span id="s681">We saw and we saw the selections, left, right.</span> <span id="s682">1944, I think it was April or May was coming a transfer, 10,000 people from Budapest and .</span> <span id="s683">Those people never knew where they were going.</span> <span id="s684">They lie and say they are going some place and it would be changed and for other people they were going to work.</span> <span id="s685">They're bringing with them fur coats and all kinds of things and food and we asked the guard there, bread, we asked you see what there is.</span> <span id="s686">This is not for us, this is for you.</span> <span id="s687">You don't smell the steam that comes out from the chimneys?</span> <span id="s688">Yes, we feel it there, that is not for us.</span> <span id="s689">People said okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">They give us a little piece of bread or crackers, no we need it for us.</span> <span id="s691">Later on when the selections, right, left, they realized the first group is going on and to see who comes out of the shower and who does not come out, they realize that.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">.</span> <span id="s693">That's all from there.</span> <span id="s694">This place is not for us.</span> <span id="s695">This place is for you not for us.</span> <span id="s696">One time I think there came a group a mother with her daughter.</span> <span id="s697">A beautiful girl I see her with my eyes.</span> <span id="s698">Beautiful, young, beautiful and they separate the mother from the daughter, and the daughter started to cry and she run back and the first man grabbed her by the hair and throw her over there.</span> <span id="s699">And she run back to the mother and she cried and she said I want to be with my mother.</span> <span id="s700">Wherever my mother goes I want to be with my mother.</span> <span id="s701">They told her your mother is going to the gas and you're not going.</span> <span id="s702">She said yes, I want to go.</span> <span id="s703">And he grabbed that pistol and pulled it out, he shot her.</span> <span id="s704">The selection was made and they put the ghetto back, the whole 10,000 and they killed them there with machine guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: They killed everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Everybody, all the 10,000, and this girl was the first.</span> <span id="s707">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I saw it from far away.</span> <span id="s709">I was watching.</span> <span id="s710">Q: You knew it was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: I used to know every day what's going on there because I was coming twice a day.</span> <span id="s712">Q: Were you working at the crematorium at the time there was that uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: In 1944 in August or September there were four girls and two boys.</span> <span id="s714">Two boys and one girl got caught and got hanged and the woman I was there and they got hanged.</span> <span id="s715">One boy and two girls he got men in the mornings every day come out and we got a memorial for the six million April 19 every year.</span> <span id="s716">One time it's coming out and a man speaking a few years ago and he got a slide and he showed this is a slide and this and this girl and she got hanged for the uprising.</span> <span id="s717">I said the other girl, I don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s718">I said well, you got the one slide and you don't know -- and I told him all about it.</span> <span id="s719">He said, oh, I have to look it up and see there.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: What were you aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: You see when they were hanging somebody the whole camp cannot go in the barracks until they have seen for themselves the hanging and talk around it why they get a hanging and for what and everything.</span> <span id="s722">The two girls were hanged in the camp for women.</span> <span id="s723">That's in Auschwitz, not Birkenau in Auschwitz because they used to work in the ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s724">They organized some ammunition, but one crematorium, they damaged one crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">They got the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: What were you aware of when this going on?</span> <span id="s727">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Were you aware of what they were doing?</span> <span id="s729">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Before the hanging?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No, we find it out after.</span> <span id="s732">Find out after, see what happened.</span> <span id="s733">Nobody don't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s734">Just the six people the two boys and two girls, nobody else.</span> <span id="s735">Even inside in Birkenau even in there they don't know nothing.</span> <span id="s736">Those four girls and those two boys they organized their own with nobody's help.</span> <span id="s737">There was no nothing before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: Because you were working near the crematorium, did they isolate you at all from other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: But you knew exactly what was going on over there?</span> <span id="s741">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: So they didn't try to keep you from passing information to other people, nothing like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: No.</span> <span id="s744">They were coming out, we used to know the news in the evening and if anything happened any place we used to know in the evenings when we were coming home from work after the appell.</span> <span id="s745">They were coming around to each barrack.</span> <span id="s746">If I knew something I was going over to tell them.</span> <span id="s747">They would give the news to another one.</span> <span id="s748">There was a rabbi in Auschwitz in block two.</span> <span id="s749">Block two was tailors and there tailors all the good clothes they'd look them over and fix them.</span> <span id="s750">People were coming and hiding some gold, diamonds and rubies in the clothes, mostly the shoulders.</span> <span id="s751">When it comes to that tailor shop it was outside in Auschwitz not in where the camp is but on the outside.</span> <span id="s752">They find some gold, diamonds, but from their town this is I talk to people yesterday.</span> <span id="s753">I talked there were even some of them in Auschwitz don't even know what I told them.</span> <span id="s754">There was a rabbi in block two and in English the block manager there, in block two they paid him.</span> <span id="s755">If he was alive, he got enough.</span> <span id="s756">He built a closet with a toilet.</span> <span id="s757">In the morning the rabbis going out to the appell and before we go out to work, he was going in that close and he was sitting inside until we were coming back from work to the appell and at night he was free.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: You were talking about the rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yes, and the rabbi was in the closet the whole day.</span> <span id="s760">In the evening he was coming out in the appell and he get a slice of bread until in the morning, until January '45, the 18th when we were all going to the death march, I was there too.</span> <span id="s761">I saw and another guy was in the same group with me working from Belgium, a young guy 18 or 19 years old and we saw somebody fall there.</span> <span id="s762">Who fall down because it was a blizzard, snow, was hard walking, hard snow and we saw somebody fall down in the snow and we pick him up.</span> <span id="s763">We pick him up and I used to know the rabbi and why I used to know in '43 I was going every morning 5:00 in the morning in the barracks saying after my father.</span> <span id="s764">The young guy picked him up and take him around and he hold on to us and we spoke but in the middle way one soldier stopped us and give us he got us some stuff, how do you call a slice of , I don't know how to say it in English, but a slice and I and the other guy get the ropes and we pulled there a whole day and a whole night and this man hold on to us a whole night and we walked until the morning.</span> <span id="s765">The morning it was getting a little bit day light, they stopped us and put us in I don't where, in a small town and they put us in all over in stables with animals, cows horses, pigs.</span> <span id="s766">Divided, you know, until the evening.</span> <span id="s767">The evening they call us out and they said we're going to and from that time we never saw the rabbi again.</span> <span id="s768">See, many people don't know what was going on there, what we can do to help people.</span> <span id="s769">The boys risked their lives and they helped the rabbi to be alive.</span> <span id="s770">What happened nobody don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: You brought up something that is interesting.</span> <span id="s772">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: In the camps, you were able to at least in some small ways observe Judaism?</span> <span id="s774">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Some of the ritual of Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: In the same block, people were praying every morning.</span> <span id="s777">Q: Were you aware of Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span

me some money?</span> <span id="s787">We're scared to answer.</span> <span id="s788">He said don't be scared who goes out there to Birkenau when there are people coming on the transport, I need some Hungarian money.</span> <span id="s789">I want to send home to my people.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">.</span> <span id="s791">We was working there, the mine was maybe 50 feet away where the barracks were for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s792">Every day about three o'clock I opened up the and I'm going to make a signal I want every day another person to come every day and I'm going to

know.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: I want to comment today.</span> <span id="s803">If you want me, I want to tell that 1944 was when the -- short time before the war was over.</span> <span id="s804">You see, Poland used to know -- they fought in the end, you know, and Germany was different.</span> <span id="s805">You see, the Germans hold it to until the last minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Like, to hold us, Auschwitz until the last minute.</span> <span id="s807">January 18, you know, eight o'clock in the evening, they started to blow the horn, you know, "Everybody out."</span> <span id="s808">You know, without them we go to work, we go home, we don't know.</span> <span id="s809">But seven days later, the 25th, the Russians occupied Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s810">They took us out, more than half, but Auschwitz got 60,000 people, prisoners.</span> <span id="s811">How many was going out that night, I don't know until now.</span> <span id="s812">I tried to find it out before, and I can't find out because I never met no people, you know.</span> <span id="s813">Yesterday, I met some -- a few people who were in the same transport with me there, you know.</span> <span id="s814">It's all -- we don't know, but until 1944, was in and Poland and Lodz was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s815">And they hold the ghetto until the last minute.</span> <span id="s816">Why?</span> <span id="s817">Because the people used to work there.</span> <span id="s818">And the ghetto was in the cemetery.</span> <span id="s819">In the end of the cemetery, they build up some barracks and the people were staying in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s820">And they got -- they got a very, very hard time in the ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s821">It was with children.</span> <span id="s822">When they bring them in, in '44, in of September, was children there.</span> <span id="s823">And -- and the time was short.</span> <span id="s824">It was Russian hold the crematoriums and the gas chambers were working 48 hours.</span> <span id="s825">Little children, they grab by a arm, by a leg, by the hair, in the throat, and they throw them in the oven .</span></p> <p><span id="s826">They throw it in.</span> <span id="s827">So they want the Russians to know that it's the end today.</span> <span id="s828">He -- and this was terrible.</span> <span id="s829">It was, they take a child by the arm or by the hair and throw them in the oven, you know.</span> <span id="s830">But it would have been night, but in the night, you know.</span> <span id="s831">But when I was coming out in the morning, I got all the noise.</span> <span id="s832">I got it, what's happened in the night.</span> <span id="s833">In the night they could do because nobody saw, nobody.</span> <span id="s834">They got nobody, they know there.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Let me ask a naive question.</span> <span id="s836">Sometimes when the bodies are incinerated in the -- in the crematorium --</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: -- are there pieces of bone or does the whole body become ash?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: The whole body become ash.</span> <span id="s840">I never saw no bones.</span> <span id="s841">I never saw no bones.</span> <span id="s842">Maybe they take out the bones in the inside.</span> <span id="s843">Whether they do, I don't know.</span> <span id="s844">I never saw the bones.</span> <span id="s845">I just saw the ashes because I was behind the building, not in the front in the building, you know.</span> <span id="s846">I was behind it.</span> <span id="s847">But ashes was coming out in the back, it was coming out there.</span> <span id="s848">So I didn't see no bones, so I don't -- I'm not going to tell you stories that I never -- don't saw, you know, because I don't know.</span> <span id="s849">See, the truth is natural.</span> <span id="s850">The best way is to say what you know and what you see, there, you know.</span> <span id="s851">See, when I was coming to Auschwitz, I even don't know this Auschwitz, you know.</span> <span id="s852">I just saw the sign sign, you know, but I don't know this Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s853">But everything was , was Auschwitz, , you know.</span> <span id="s854">You see, because the train was stopped in Auschwitz, not in the .</span> <span id="s855">It was coming down, you know, and they give us a number.</span> <span id="s856">They see, right, that the number they give us here.</span> <span id="s857">And they say -- and they say, "That's your name."</span> <span id="s858">You see, "That's your name."</span> <span id="s859">And they call us, " , , ."</span> <span id="s860">And that's it, you know.</span> <span id="s861">And when they name, they give us -- they give us a potato, you know, potato.</span> <span id="s862">You can't eat it, throw it away.</span> <span id="s863">They grab us and bring us right to the camp, to -- you know.</span> <span id="s864">But anyway, I don't work there too long there, you know, , you know.</span> <span id="s865">I wasn't out there.</span> <span id="s866">You know, a few weeks, and they bring me back -- they bring me back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s867">And they bring me back to Auschwitz, and a selection there (ph.).</span> <span id="s868">And when I come to Auschwitz, come in -- 35 people who come with me in Borna.</span> <span id="s869">And, like, they are going to the gas chambers, you know.</span> <span id="s870">This was in November -- in November, yeah -- in November, 1943 -- in November.</span> <span id="s871">And we was -- I think the were about 35 people.</span> <span id="s872">We was already .</span> <span id="s873">And we got our selection and we had to take off their clothes and everything.</span> <span id="s874">He let us in -- in -- in the .</span> <span id="s875">The whole day, you know, I don't know how to call them.</span> <span id="s876">I never saw a place like that.</span> <span id="s877">And then we stayed there over night, in the morning was coming, little trucks in the red and push us in, one on top of the other one, and bring us to Auschwitz, to the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s878">It's in Borna , which is nine kilometers, not too far, you know.</span> <span id="s879">You come down there -- come down a guy in a barrack and call the numbers.</span> <span id="s880">Call -- and call my number and then he asked me, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s881">You see, I was a Pollack, you know.</span> <span id="s882">"Where you from?"</span> <span id="s883">I say, "From Russia, from Poland, from Russia."</span> <span id="s884">"Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">What's your name?"</span> <span id="s886">I say, "Radashinski (ph.)."</span> <span id="s887">They say, "Radashinski?"</span> <span id="s888">He calls me, I never heard in my life.</span> <span id="s889">So it was, you know.</span> <span id="s890">And he put me in and put me in the corner, he put me in.</span> <span id="s891">And he say they'll take me, about ten, 15 minutes he comes out with a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s892">He say, "Come around there," you know, "and take away the last one."</span> <span id="s893">That's when I used to have a few friends -- good friends I used to know from home, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">And they -- they -- I never saw them in my life.</span> <span id="s895">Another soldier then he come back, he bring me into the barrack.</span> <span id="s896">Bring me to the barrack, I lay down.</span> <span id="s897">I turn around, I see a young guy who stay by me and looked at me he say to me, "Oh, I know you."</span> <span id="s898">I said, "You know me?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">From where you know me?"</span> <span id="s900">"I know you from village.</span> <span id="s901">My was close to you," you know, "You see, my name is Edler

id="s905">He said, "Here is just -- it's not a hospital, it's just for people to rest in," you know.</span> <span id="s906">And then he gone out to work.</span> <span id="s907">He said, "It's not too many Jewish people that stay here, but Doctor Mengele (ph.) comes twice a week here, Tuesday and Friday."</span> <span id="s908">Now, today is Tuesday that's how I know it was a Tuesday and not

know."</span> <span id="s911">I said, "How you know?"</span> <span id="s912">He said, "I'm from Krakow.</span> <span id="s913">My grandfather was a rabbi in Krakow.</span> <span id="s914">And here these two doctors, who saved some people -- Jewish people tried to help him, their life, and somebody in the neighbors called the Gestapo and took out the people in the Krakow, is out in the middle --
