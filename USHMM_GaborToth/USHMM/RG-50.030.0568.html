welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: – Mrs. Graber, for coming to speak with us.</span> <span id="s17">Could you tell me a little bit about your early life?</span> <span id="s18">You – when you were born, where you were born, your parents, their names, where they came from, how they made their living.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Well, I – I was born in Berlin in 1925, October 29th, and my parents were Elias Olejer, he was born in August of nine – 1894, and my mother Cesia Abramska(ph) from Warsaw also, born in June of 1900.</span> <span id="s20">Interestingly enough, my mother was the youngest of nine, my dad was the youngest of six.</span> <span id="s21">And one of his older brothers, I have photographs, married one of my mother’s older sisters.</span> <span id="s22">However, on – my dad would go once af – when the f-first World War was over, he went to – he decided he was going to go to Germany.</span> <span id="s23">He didn't want to go to New York.</span> <span id="s24">He did want to go where the weather was – where they would have winter, because he was i-in the fur business.</span> <span id="s25">He ended up as a furrier, and he made his [speaks German], he became a master furrier in Berlin.</span> <span id="s26">I have his diploma hanging on the wall i-in my apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: When they were still in Warsaw, what was the language they spoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: They spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s29">They spoke Polish and Yiddish, and – and also some Russian, because at that – one point, the Russians were there, and that during the first World War, the Germans were in – were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s30">My mother’s father died when she was two years old, in 1902.</span> <span id="s31">Her father was one of three brothers, the Abramski(ph) brothers, Hainoch(ph), Mendel, and Pesach(ph).</span> <span id="s32">Hainoch(ph) and Mendel were the Florsheim(ph) of Poland.</span> <span id="s33">And there was still a – a record of them, who’s who in business in 1939 in Europe.</span> <span id="s34">And they were listed, and they were a corporation.</span> <span id="s35">They brought their machinery in Manchester and in Germany.</span> <span id="s36">They had tanneries, and they had factories.</span> <span id="s37">They also sol – sold out of that – one of the brothers, Mendel Abramski’s(ph) house, my mother worked there, because when her father died, he was a contractor for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: What was their company name?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Of – oh, Abramski(ph) shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Abramski(ph) shoes</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: [indecipherable] in Polish</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Yes, Abramski(ph) shoes and – and – and they were well known, and they had stores in – in Warsaw and in the provinces, and they also had people that went onto the road to sell shoes.</span> <span id="s44">And my mother, as I said, sold for them until she got married.</span> <span id="s45">And – and she’d met my father on one of the trips, that he came – he went twice a year to see his mother and his siblings.</span> <span id="s46">And – and – and I guess they fell in love, and my mother’s papers weren’t ready to go to Germany, so they got married in Danzig, Gdansk.</span> <span id="s47">And then she – her two uncles escorted her there, and they had just a religious ceremony, they did not have the civilian one, so the uncles just whisked her back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s48">And so their marriage wasn’t consummated until she joined him about six weeks later in Berlin.</span> <span id="s49">And that was 1924, and – August 1924, and in October of ’25, I was born.</span> <span id="s50">And I was a very difficult birth and – and I had asthma.</span> <span id="s51">And mom – I th – I wasn’t sleeping and my mother would carry me around all night.</span> <span id="s52">And my father felt very badly for her.</span> <span id="s53">So when, in 1926, there was a well known plastic surgeon, a Dr. Josef(ph), who had practiced medicine during the first World War, and some of his instruments were used throughout Europe.</span> <span id="s54">And she went there to have a – to have a – a nose job, because when she was a little girl, during the summer, and she was the youngest of nine, and she ran into a tree.</span> <span id="s55">And she had a prominent nose, I have my mother’s nose, but she broke the nose, she had a bump on her – o-on her nose, so he said she should go there and have her nose done.</span> <span id="s56">And my mother would tell how she – when she went in there, there were young men with big ears, and they came out with little shells.</span> <span id="s57">And there women and men who went in with huge noses, and they came out with little s-snub noses.</span> <span id="s58">And women went in with humongous breasts, and came – they went in with brassieres and – and it was perfect.</span> <span id="s59">And my mother said her surgery was not a success.</span> <span id="s60">She remembered swallowing blood while they threw chocolate into her mouth.</span> <span id="s61">And professor Jusef(ph) wanted her to come back to do it over, and she said no, she would live with that.</span> <span id="s62">So, I have my mother’s nose, and then in – when we were already in New York, I was 16 years old, and I wanted to have my nose done and my mother would say [speaks German], the nose isn’t that important.</span> <span id="s63">And then when I got married and I suggested this to my husband, I said, I married you not because of your nose, and you don’t have to – so, here I am.</span> <span id="s64">I have – my son has my nose.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Absolutely beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: So, my mother was – had been doing sales, so when she came to Berlin, she – she became his sales person, and he – and he was a – he was a very talented furrier.</span> <span id="s67">And his family had determined that that’s what he should be, you know, they – they – and he’d gone to a ch – what was called a chayder, which was a – a d – a very Orthodox kind of education and he hated it.</span> <span id="s68">And he thought very highly of German education, and that’s how come when I started school in 1931 – of course, I went to a German school, a Volksschule, and in 19 – my brother was born in 1930, and in 1936, he started the Volksschule.</span> <span id="s69">And – and by 1936, I entered the first Bismarck Lyzeum, which was in Berlin, it’s right near where the tennis courts were.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: You know what’s in – sounds interesting – I’m sorry for interrupting at this point, but it sounds like you went from being a Polish Jewish family, to a German Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Because the German Jews really di-did not –</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Accept?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: – n-no, they – they – they – they – they did not accept.</span> <span id="s76">Th-Those eastern European Jews were different, and most of the [indecipherable] east European Jews lived in east Berlin, Grenadierstrasse, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s77">And I – and – and so I never – I was never there.</span> <span id="s78">I – my life w – was around the – the parks, the [indecipherable] park, Olivaer Platz, and every Sunday I went to the zoo with the – with the mädchen and my brother.</span> <span id="s79">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Who did you socialize with then?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Really, no one.</span> <span id="s82">I would a – my brother was lucky, he started school in ’36 and – and my mother was called to school that he wasn’t doing well.</span> <span id="s83">And then they – and when you went to school in – in Germany, the teachers came to you, you didn’t go – you didn't change classes, and yo – the teacher ca – you remained except for gym and – and lunch.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: In the same classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: In the same classroom.</span> <span id="s86">And when the – so the teacher said he wasn’t doing his best.</span> <span id="s87">However, he said to my mother, I had gro – excellent do – [indecipherable] and my mother said, was bedeutet das?</span> <span id="s88">What does that mean?</span> <span id="s89">He says, when the teacher comes in, your son jumps up and yells heil Hitler the loudest.</span> <span id="s90">Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: – the thing he really wanted, the thing he really wanted was to be like those little boys, wear a – wear – wear a uniform, a-and wear boots.</span> <span id="s93">He would take a – take his ice cream money, and bought himself an [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s94">This was to support – this was to support the National Socialist –</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Yes, yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: – he – you see, it – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: This is to – in memory of – on my school days [German] mein kruzheit(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Kreuzheit(ph), yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: And he was how old here?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: He was six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Old.</span> <span id="s104">And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: He was six – Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Peter Leo Olejer.</span> <span id="s108">And – and so my mother yanked him out immediately and put him into a Jewish school, Fasson(ph) Strasse Schule.</span> <span id="s109">And that’s where they ended – ended up having, even though they destroyed the synagogue, but that’s where – where they met, Jüdisch gemeinde would meet there.</span> <span id="s110">And Peter went to that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: The Jewish community, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yeah, until – until we left, ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: It’s quite – I mean, th-there are lots of questions as you’re talking that – that come to mind, and I will come to some of them later.</span> <span id="s114">But right now, one of those that – that strikes me is, that school was allowed – a Jewish school was allowed to exist, and – from ’36 to ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh, they – they existed until I – even in ’39, now they – they threw me out of the Drusen(ph) Bismarck Lyzeum after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s116">I went – I went to that – I was the only Jewish child in that school, and I was permitted to be there because I was considered a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s117">You see, I was never a German ci – my brother and I, we were always Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s118">We’re on my parents’ passports.</span> <span id="s119">I’m on my mother’s, and – and my brother is on my father’s.</span> <span id="s120">And that’s why our – the visas to come to the United States were in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Oh, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Ah – but – and you can see that my parents went regularly back – each one went twice a year home to see their families.</span> <span id="s123">And – and so that presented no problem, but that was fortunate we came out as a unit.</span> <span id="s124">We went – we were on the Polish quota numbers, we – Peter and I were not on the German quota.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So you weren't considered Jews, as much as Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: We were considered Poles, we were considered Polish.</span> <span id="s127">However, interestingly enough, Kristallnacht, thi – that – that happened at night, a-and – and then they said in the morning, the rumor started that they were coming to the apartments.</span> <span id="s128">So my parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did it affect the store, the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Oh, the store di – of course.</span> <span id="s131">And how did they know?</span> <span id="s132">How did they know that it was a Jewish shopkeeper and not a Christian one?</span> <span id="s133">How would they know that?</span> <span id="s134">Because Rosenbach(ph), Greenbach(ph), Silber(ph), Weiss, Brown, Schwarz, Scharzman –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: They could be German names too.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: They – they were German names, they – those were German names.</span> <span id="s137">Zimmerman.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: They were occupation, they were color, they were animals.</span> <span id="s140">And ea – I think in ’37, it was after the Olympic games in ’37, every Jewish shopkeeper had to take a middle name.</span> <span id="s141">If it was a male, his middle name was Israel, so my father was Elias Israel Olejer.</span> <span id="s142">If it was a woman, her middle name was Sarah.</span> <span id="s143">And so it would have been Cesia Sarah Olejer.</span> <span id="s144">That’s how they knew.</span> <span id="s145">And it had to be so and so many centimeters up from the floor, and so ma – in – in certain height of letters, in white.</span> <span id="s146">And that’s – that’s how they knew who was Jewish and who was not.</span> <span id="s147">This was plan – planned a long time ago, but they used the incident in Paris to do that because the mother called – called this a – it is – he was 18 years old, called him in Paris, she said, I’m so upset, they took Daddy away overnight, and I’m so frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What incident in Paris are you talking about, just for our listeners.</span> <span id="s149">Excuse me for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: When – when the mo – what had happened was, my 13th birthday was October 29th, 1938, the night of October 28th or the 29th, they rounded up all Polish Jewish males [indecipherable] because you always listed with the – with the police department.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I mean, you do that throughout Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: They know exactly where you are.</span> <span id="s157">And they shipped them off to no man’s land, the – Pozen [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s158">And the – the Germans wanted them to go into Poland and Poland didn’t want them, cause they were just Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s159">And so for awhile they remained there, in no man’s land.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Your father amongst them?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No, for some reason they overlooked my father.</span> <span id="s162">And all his friends were involved, everybody he knew was am – they overlooked him, because of the name?</span> <span id="s163">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s164">He went to the Gestapo the next day, to say, I have witnesses that I was home.</span> <span id="s165">I did not try to hide.</span> <span id="s166">So he remained.</span> <span id="s167">He was the only man among all my parents’ friends that – that lived in west Berlin.</span> <span id="s168">All their friends lived in west Berlin.</span> <span id="s169">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Can I clarify that though, for a second?</span> <span id="s171">Their friends lived in west Berlin, but you said that they didn't really have friends amongst German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No, they were all Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: So were they Polish Jews?</span> <span id="s174">Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: They were all Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s176">They were from Lódz and they were from some of the smaller cities, Kraków, and – and they were from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s177">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: And my parents had no relatives living in Berlin, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: When – when you were at home, what was your language that you spoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: We spoke German.</span> <span id="s184">And they had befriended – my mother was a horrendous cook.</span> <span id="s185">She’d be – she never learned how to cook because her mother lived with – with a ma – with a married, an older married daughter, and my – and my mother.</span> <span id="s186">And – an-and so my mother never learned how to cook, and she was a very bad cook.</span> <span id="s187">And my mother said that the first six weeks they were in Berlin, every day she made chicken, boiled chicken with – with something, the oats, or what have you, and – and boiled lima beans.</span> <span id="s188">I remember them, I’d – I swear it’s one of the reasons I got married, to get away from that Friday night dinner.</span> <span id="s189">But she made that every day for six weeks.</span> <span id="s190">So my father said, that’s schon genug.</span> <span id="s191">They –</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: It’s enough already.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yeah, and they befriended a German Jewish woman, Tante Lily Finkelstein.</span> <span id="s194">And she was married to a Polish Jew, and the – but a – they were only married like a morganatic marriage, that’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s195">Was only a sib – a religious ceremony, and they had a daughter Margot, and she became my best friend.</span> <span id="s196">And my father was doing quite well in business, in this – in the 20s.</span> <span id="s197">And they – Tante Lily would cook for my parents, and my father maintained her and Margot in an apartment nearby.</span> <span id="s198">And why – why did I tell you this?</span> <span id="s199">And so, my mother –</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: I was asking about who your parents friends were.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Well, they were friends with people they met through business, and – and going to balls.</span> <span id="s202">They were – Berlin in the 20s was – was the in place.</span> <span id="s203">And there’s a very funny story, one of my mother’s cousins from Warsaw, a Tadeusz Abramski(ph).</span> <span id="s204">He was Uncle Hainoch’s(ph) son.</span> <span id="s205">And he came to visit them in Berlin, and they took him to this nightclub, and he was dancing with this woman, and he – he was wining and dining her and buying her champagne and what have you.</span> <span id="s206">And my parents’ friend said to my mother, when are you going to tell him that this is not a woman, that this is a man?</span> <span id="s207">And when Tadeusz heard – found out, he was livid.</span> <span id="s208">He didn't forgive her for many years.</span> <span id="s209">Your –</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: What a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: That was Berlin in the 20s.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Of course it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: But that was Berlin –</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Christopher Isherwood, and</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Well, yeah, a-a-and –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Sally Bowles.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: That’s right, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: – and cabaret.</span> <span id="s220">And – and my mother would go dancing to the – I forget where that was, it was near Café Tso(ph).</span> <span id="s221">Near, near Barnhof(ph) so –</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Kansla – Kransla, something –</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: No, at – at Kansla(ph) we used to go every night when we were in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: We went to the Kansla(ph) to have dessert.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Yes, they have wonderful desserts.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: And – and – wonderful desserts.</span> <span id="s228">And – and – and you would sit at a table, and you had a telephone, and a gentleman would ask her to dance, and she would get up.</span> <span id="s229">And she did that with her girlfriends, you know, she took a couple of hours off from – from the store that way.</span> <span id="s230">And – and that was the way life was i-in – in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did you have any friends who were German Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, no, none, none.</span> <span id="s233">None at all.</span> <span id="s234">I – the only time I dis – they associated with me, I was very good in – in foreign language, I th – my father decided that hopefully, when we left, we would be able to get to the United States.</span> <span id="s235">And so he – he – he determined that I should take English first, and then French.</span> <span id="s236">I started French in 30 – in ’39, April ’39, the school year was always in April, and then we were off for a month during the summer.</span> <span id="s237">And so I – I took English.</span> <span id="s238">And that – and I was good in English, and I was a very good stu – a-athlete.</span> <span id="s239">My dad t – my dad taught me how to swim, he taught me ice skating, taught me to ice skate and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s240">So, that’s the only time I really associated with them.</span> <span id="s241">Nobody talked to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: So this is something I’d like to find out more about.</span> <span id="s243">You started a German school –</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yes, until –</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: – in 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: 1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: – oh – ’31.</span> <span id="s248">And – and you’re the only Jewish girl in 1939 who’s in there, who’s at that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Thi – ’38 [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: In ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yeah, when – when – with Kristallnacht they threw me out, and there was ad – at the ca – at the – the Adolf Hitler Platz, not far from the [German] there was a Jewish school, called the Tiera(ph) Hatzo(ph) schule, and I went to that one, because that was closest to where we lived, and the others were all east.</span> <span id="s252">And then in April of ’39, they decided the German – Jewish school should not be in the Adolf Hitler Platz.</span> <span id="s253">That’s a desecration, so they closed that one, and I went to the Vietsnakaho(ph) schule, which was east.</span> <span id="s254">And I had to go there by subway, and I went there until summer vacation began, June of ’39, and June 20th, 1939, we were called to the American – well, we – in Berlin it was the embassy, not the city’s, it was the consulate.</span> <span id="s255">You no longer waited ti-ti-til you went to Ellis Island, that was closed, for your physical.</span> <span id="s256">And – and – and we were – and – and we – we got our quota, w-we got our visas.</span> <span id="s257">And – and my father in the meantime had wi – he – and his – he kept his business open until April 1st, 1939, that’s when he closed the store.</span> <span id="s258">They used to come through the back, Ch-Christian, his Christian customers.</span> <span id="s259">And – and he was hoping.</span> <span id="s260">And it opened up, we went June 20th, and he had already received an ausweis, he had to leave Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: A passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: – yup, by August 31st, 1939.</span> <span id="s263">And my mother’s wealthy family in Warsaw, they had arranged for us to be smuggled over the border August 31st, 1939, you know, together with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: I mean, unbelievable, but who knew?</span> <span id="s266">And so we were very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: But smuggled in which direction?</span> <span id="s268">If you’re going to the United States wouldn’t [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this was be kick – you know, this was before he knew that we were – our quota number opened and we got visas to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s270">But he had to make arrangements to le – he had to leave Berlin, he had to leave Germany, or end up in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: So, in other words, he was – he went to – to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: He was going to go to Poland, but instead our quota number opened, and we – and we were coming to the – to New York on an American ship.</span> <span id="s273">They had made arrangements right along, that if we were going to leave, we were going to go with the SS Manhattan.</span> <span id="s274">It was the United States line.</span> <span id="s275">The manager of that office in Berlin was a Herr Hauptman.</span> <span id="s276">I forget his first name.</span> <span id="s277">And so – but they wanted to go via – instead of leaving from Hamburg, they wanted to leave from Le Havre.</span> <span id="s278">And I’ll tell you why.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Belgium?</span> <span id="s280">Is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Le Havre is France.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Is France, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Is France.</span> <span id="s284">And it’s Hamburg, Le Havre, Southampton, Cope(ph), New York.</span> <span id="s285">And – and so he needed – they needed – here they had valid visas, Paris – France, new – and then New York.</span> <span id="s286">And my father – my mother went to the French embassy and they would not give them transit visas, because what was happening, people said oh, you know, we’re going on to this place, that place, and they decided to stay in – in – in – in France.</span> <span id="s287">There were too many stateless people in – in France, and they wouldn’t give it to them, so my parents were st – my dad had a reason, and I’ll explain that in awhile.</span> <span id="s288">And so he – he went – he went to Mr. – they went to Mr. Hauptman(ph) and he said, stay here, I have a friend at the embassy.</span> <span id="s289">And he went, in half an hour he came back, four visas to Paris.</span> <span id="s290">And so when we left Berlin –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Now, was he a Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yes, yes, yes, he was – he was a – an American – German American or American German, whatever.</span> <span id="s293">But he was – was Christian.</span> <span id="s294">And – and – and we left July 31st from Berlin and we arrived in Paris, August first.</span> <span id="s295">And we stayed there til August 10th, and then we came – we – we boarded the ship.</span> <span id="s296">I-In Le Havre there was a train that – that went directly to – to the port, and – and all our luggage was – was put on board, and – and that was that.</span> <span id="s297">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: I’d like to step back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: And ask about two things.</span> <span id="s301">They’re different, but I’ll ask them while they’re in my mind.</span> <span id="s302">The first is, your experiences from 1931 til 1938, being in that Lyzeum, and what kind of thoughts you have, if you can remember, what kind of interaction there was with the other kids, or the teachers, or how, after 1933 perhaps, things changed, you know, with Hitler coming to power.</span> <span id="s303">That’s one question.</span> <span id="s304">And the other one, I’d like to concentrate a little bit more on your father’s business and Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s305">What specifically happened there?</span> <span id="s306">How did he rebuild it?</span> <span id="s307">And if he kept it open for so long, was he able to save his assets, sell the business, or did he lose it all?</span> <span id="s308">So those two questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, he – he had a – after awhile, a Christian clientele.</span> <span id="s310">One of them was a woman whose husband had an important position in Goebbels –</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Ministry.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: – ministry.</span> <span id="s313">And she called him the afternoon of November ninth, and she said, Herr Olejer, my husband tells me that such and such is going to take place.</span> <span id="s314">He always had a window well dressed.</span> <span id="s315">He – and the lights stayed on til about 11:30, 12 o’clock and then they automatically went off.</span> <span id="s316">He commandeered a taxi, and he took out – he – he re – he redressed the window with inexpensive things, and he emptied out his stock, and with the taxi, they went back and forth, our apartment was two blocks away, and they got everything into the apartment.</span> <span id="s317">And – and he had a, interestingly enough, he had a gate that was behind the plate glass.</span> <span id="s318">And it had something that you rolled it up, it – very heavy –</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Oh, I remember those types of window shutters.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yeah, yeah, you needed special shears.</span> <span id="s321">And when they – when they broke the glass, they did not have the – the – the shears to cut – to cut the wires, so they went on.</span> <span id="s322">So they were never aware of what was in the back of the store or not.</span> <span id="s323">And – and so – and they didn’t come into our apartment.</span> <span id="s324">Ah – you know, when we thought – the rumor had it that we were going to be – they were going to come into the apartments, they never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: So his losses were glass?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Were glass.</span> <span id="s327">And of course, he had to replace that and – and – and there was a – there was also a special tax for that, etcetera, etcet – whatever he had to do, he did, and he reopened the store.</span> <span id="s328">But he was hoping at some point to get out of New York, so he would go to – he would go to –</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Out of Berlin, you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Out of Berlin.</span> <span id="s331">So he would go to – to travel, and my mother would go to – or he would go to travel agencies, and – and he was looking for – in South America, at – where they have winter and summer, because you know, he was in the fur business.</span> <span id="s332">And the – and you n – you know what happened with the voyage of the damned, you know, that they – they weren’t permitted to land, and they would say Herr Olejer, now it’s 2:15, what’s going to be at three o’clock, I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s333">And my dad said, costs a lot of money to take a family of four, etcetera, etcetera, and without any guarantees, I really don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s334">So, in 1937, remember that after the Russian revolutions, the white Russians, where were they?</span> <span id="s335">They were in Berlin, and they were in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: And they had many, many connections with the – with – among the diplomats.</span> <span id="s338">So my m – my father sent my mother to Paris in 1937.</span> <span id="s339">She had an aunt who – and a husband and family, and they went to Paris from Warsaw, and – right after the first World War.</span> <span id="s340">And they opened a furniture factory.</span> <span id="s341">She had a first cousin from the Warsaw area who went to Paris after the first World War, and she opened a knitting factory.</span> <span id="s342">So my dad sent my mother to Paris to see both relatives, to as – because he didn’t want to have to wait too long to find out if what he was going to send out, when – would the – would – would arrive in New York, because by then we already had a quota number from my mother’s oldest sister who lived in New York, she couldn’t support a d – a – a mouse.</span> <span id="s343">And this is the height of the depression here.</span> <span id="s344">But we had the quota number, the low quota number, that’s – that was our saving grace.</span> <span id="s345">It was somebody else’s papers that enabled us – that he said he would – he was willing to support us.</span> <span id="s346">So he sent my mother to Paris to see both the aunt and the cousin.</span> <span id="s347">And he decided, to the aunt he wanted to send fur.</span> <span id="s348">To the cousin he would send money.</span> <span id="s349">When the dollar was two and a – with the – the dollar was two and a half marks, my father paid 14 marks for every dollar that he sent out.</span> <span id="s350">And that was sent to the cousin, and she was – she opened up a safe deposit box so that when my parents, if they should get out –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: They have –</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: – they could go and have money to get started with.</span> <span id="s353">To the aunt, she – since she had a huge factory, she was to get the furs.</span> <span id="s354">So what he would do is, he would throw together [indecipherable] or Persian lamb, or mink or whatever it was, or fox, almost without destroying it, just it looked like – it – it – it looked like a coat or a jacket.</span> <span id="s355">And – and she would st – and th-the – the relative was gonna come and visit, was a – was a person by the name of Shapsa(ph).</span> <span id="s356">And my mother com – communicated with them in Polish – in Yiddish, that Shapsa(ph) was coming to visit and he doesn’t know his way around, and will you please come and – and – and help him with his luggage and pick him up at – at – and pick him up at the station.</span> <span id="s357">So my dad would buy a train ticket from Berlin to Paris.</span> <span id="s358">That gave him permission to put a suitcase aboard the train.</span> <span id="s359">He would do – and when no one came to pick it up, they put it into storage in Paris.</span> <span id="s360">My mother would send a letter with the receipt and the key to the aunt and say, Shapsa’s(ph) coming, and you know, he doesn’t know his way around, would you help him with the luggage?</span> <span id="s361">And that’s how 14 suitcases were waiting for us when we came to Paris.</span> <span id="s362">And we came – we left August – July 31st, and w-we crossed the border at Aachen.</span> <span id="s363">We went via – via Belgium into Paris, and you could see the Maginot Line and you could see that they were massing on either side.</span> <span id="s364">You had them on the French si – on the – on the Belgian side, and you had them on – on –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: So you were – you sensed war was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Well, that – you could see it.</span> <span id="s367">You could see it, and – and – and so we arrived in Paris August first, and we had dinner that night at my – at my mother’s aunt and uncle, and they wined and dined us, and they were – made arrangements to bring – have all the suitcases brought to the ship – train, when we left August 10th.</span> <span id="s368">And we were at a hotel, and the mam – Monday we saw the cousin, and – and by Tuesday morning my dad said to the cousin’s husband, Monsieur, let’s go, and he said – meantime, the news had been terrible, coming out of – the – you know, they were – they were maneuvering, they were – they were – they – they were getting ready for war, and they had a shortage, they had a cash flow problem, and they didn’t think we’d ever get out.</span> <span id="s369">So it was invested in their business, and there was no money.</span> <span id="s370">And my father said to my mother, you go with the children to New York, I’m not doing this here, I’m – you know.</span> <span id="s371">And my mother said, nothing doing.</span> <span id="s372">We’ve lost so much, we’ll lose some more.</span> <span id="s373">We have our lives.</span> <span id="s374">We’ll learn, and we’ll – and when you – and you have – you have the furs, and you’ll do the best you can.</span> <span id="s375">And she convinced him.</span> <span id="s376">So we – we left – we left as a family and we arrived here.</span> <span id="s377">And interestingly enough, he took out – he took out all his machinery, etcetera, and it was put into a crate.</span> <span id="s378">And in order to fill it up, to – to secure things inside, he used old patterns.</span> <span id="s379">Not a nickel was charged for all those suitcases with furs.</span> <span id="s380">Those patterns, that my dad had to pay for.</span> <span id="s381">And was just funny, but he wa – he –</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Who knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No, who knew is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Who knew?</span> <span id="s385">But what – I mean, what foresight.</span> <span id="s386">What foresight –</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Well, you – you –</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: – to try and –</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: A-And yo – there was a movie called, in “The Gardens of Finzi-Continis.”</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Yes, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: And remember, he was – he was ve – a very assimilated Jew, and he traveled in the highest circles, with – with important people from Italy.</span> <span id="s392">And he did not, whereas there were people in much lower segments of society, and th-the – the young men, in order to protect them, they – they went to Switzerland to see what they could do, because they saw it coming, you know?</span> <span id="s393">To send their families out, to save them.</span> <span id="s394">He didn’t, he was – you know, he – he said, they would never touch me, because look who I am.</span> <span id="s395">And look, I’m traveling in the highest circle.</span> <span id="s396">And that’s what happened to some people.</span> <span id="s397">One of our neighbors in Berlin, he had been in the first World War, he still had hanging over his couch, his a – his sword –</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Iron cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: – a-and – and his helmet, and – and Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s400">And he said to my father, July 1939, I don’t understand it.</span> <span id="s401">You eastern European Jews, you can go to North America, and we German Jews, we can only go to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s402">And he had a 20 year old son, and an 18 year old daughter, and he wouldn’t let them go, and I’m sure they were all destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: So they went – this is July of ’39, and they were still thinking in those terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: How tragic.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: And – and – and with everything else that took place, to go to Shanghai, Stalin permitted Jews to cross Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Siberia, to get to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s409">And they – and the Japanese treated those German Jews, and Jews very well.</span> <span id="s410">My mother – my father had a – had a customer who ended up in – in New York aft – into – after Shanghai.</span> <span id="s411">She had a son in England, so when we stopped in Southampton, he had – he had jewelry for her, that he gave to the son, and a ta – and a – and a bicycle.</span> <span id="s412">And the son came to the shi – came to the ship and took that.</span> <span id="s413">And when Mrs. Turash(ph) ended up in New York, and she came to see my parents to thank them for whatever it is they had done.</span> <span id="s414">She said when she got to – she was a handsome woman, she was a divorcee and she had one son who lived in England already.</span> <span id="s415">And – and she had a – a boyfriend who was a member of the, I guess, Gestapo.</span> <span id="s416">And he helped her get to Shanghai, and she – when she get – and she was a handsome lady.</span> <span id="s417">And she said she was telling the story when the – when the war broke out, what – what he said to her.</span> <span id="s418">I could like you.</span> <span id="s419">Do you sleep single?</span> <span id="s420">That’s how she worded it, that’s what he said to her.</span> <span id="s421">I could like you, do you – do you sleep single?</span> <span id="s422">I’ll never forget that, I thought it was so funny, I was – happened to be there when – when she – when she worded it that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Schule – schulzeit, your school days.</span> <span id="s424">Because the first part, you ha – the second question, I think you clarified for me, how your father was able to at least save something, what he did, how much damage was done from Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s425">And it – it sounded very scary.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: But – but life went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: It went on, and as the German Jews had to – had to reduce their overhead and move into smaller quarters, my father had a friend, a German Jewish friend who was in ant – in ana – in antiques.</span> <span id="s429">And he took him and convinced him to buy two sets of china.</span> <span id="s430">One was a Limoges service for 24, and one was a German Furstenberg tea and coffee service for 20, and he bought that, and he brought that and it came a – some of it that was not broken, and some of – course, some stuff was broken.</span> <span id="s431">And – and I have it here, and I had –</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: It’s from – yeah, it – it – it – th – my – my son already has half, and my daughter, she’s not prepared to take that, because it’s – it’s with 22 karat gold, and you have to hand wash that, you can’t put that into a dishwasher, and then the dryer.</span> <span id="s434">So, that’s here.</span> <span id="s435">The furniture was left there, we didn’t bring any furniture, he just brought his machinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: And what about the business itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: The business he just closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: He just closed the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: He just closed the door, and – and that was that.</span> <span id="s440">And then when we left, everything had to be in quadruplicate, so my mother hired a secretary to do that.</span> <span id="s441">Every handkerchief, every pair of stockings had to be listed in quadruplicate.</span> <span id="s442">And in the middle of the packing, the Gestapo, two guys came from the Gestapo, they wouldn’t even take a drink, nothing.</span> <span id="s443">They – they watched one another.</span> <span id="s444">In the middle of that we had an air raid, and – and everybody had to go down into the basement.</span> <span id="s445">And then they finished packing.</span> <span id="s446">Somebody complained there was a lot of noise, and – and – and – and these two guys, with yelling, you know, [indecipherable] from Himmler, Judens an raus.</span> <span id="s447">And this is one way of getting them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: In order of hit – of Hitler –</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: – Himmler –</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, to g – to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: From the air raid shelter?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: The – the – well, i –</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Oh, from –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: – once the air raid was over, but you know, that’s now brought it into the evening –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: – because it was getting darker, even though it was – it was July.</span> <span id="s458">And – and every Sunday, ma – our favorite place was to go to the Jones beach of Berlin, which was Wannsee.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: And when we went in ’88, I took them there, on the [indecipherable] to show them Wannsee, and it happened to have been a beautiful day, there were people out sailing.</span> <span id="s461">And next day, I think there was some snow.</span> <span id="s462">And – and that’s where, of course, they had the final solution, in one of the villas.</span> <span id="s463">And – and the other favorite place, of course, was the zoo, we went there every Sunday.</span> <span id="s464">That was my favorite place, and there was a very well known gorilla in Berlin, he was known as the gorilla Bobby, Bobby.</span> <span id="s465">And he died in 30-something.</span> <span id="s466">And when we went in ’88, we went to the zoo, and we went in through the [indecipherable] tour.</span> <span id="s467">And then we ended up the last thing we saw were the primates, and my children started yelling, Mom, Mom, come here.</span> <span id="s468">And there was – and I have it – I have – I have a country house that I’m no longer going to because my husband is on a walker now.</span> <span id="s469">And you see me looking at the statue, and they photographed me looking at the –</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Bobby?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: La Bobby, yes, yeah, beautiful, a beautiful statue to him.</span> <span id="s472">I think he died in ’36.</span> <span id="s473">And – and I became furious all over again when I was in the zoo.</span> <span id="s474">It was so clean.</span> <span id="s475">The cages were clean, the animals were well taken care of.</span> <span id="s476">And I said, look at this.</span> <span id="s477">Look what they’ve done for the – an-and they do nothing, nothing for human beings.</span> <span id="s478">So difficult.</span> <span id="s479">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Tell me about school.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well, school was difficult, but my father thought so highly of German education, that he didn’t want to hear about it, and so I stayed, I – you know, I was – I was – I was the firstborn and I did what I was told to do.</span> <span id="s482">My brother was more of a rebellion.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: What was ti – tell me, you were – I mean, but you were a child, you were six years old when it started.</span> <span id="s484">So what are your first memories of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s486">I enjoyed it, I – I enjoyed the structure of it, I – and Tante Lily, the one who cooked for us, she – she – she – she thought I was promising student.</span> <span id="s487">So – and what – what would become difficult, when I was on the – the [speaks German here]</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: The Jews and the communists are –</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Is our worst enemies.</span> <span id="s490">Well, I decide I wouldn’t write.</span> <span id="s491">So I got a – you know, I got a zero for that, but they understood that that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Oh, so it was like a – a [indecipherable] it was li – you – it was a sentence that you had to write down to practice, writing –</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No, no, but you –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: – or you had to write a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: – y-you had to write a composition –</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: – essay.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: – an essay.</span> <span id="s498">And – and, so certain things I did, and other things, I – I did not, I – I just – I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s499">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Were you lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Oh yes, yes, I was lonely.</span> <span id="s502">I was lo – don’t forget, there was just radio, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: I mean in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: – and – and records.</span> <span id="s505">And even at home, you know, I – you know, I would be in the street.</span> <span id="s506">Now [indecipherable] schule that – they came to your house to – to – where you – where you did your – your [indecipherable] the Hebrew, the little Hebrew I – that I speak, I speak with a German accent, to this day.</span> <span id="s507">It’s hilarious, the – the – because I don’t roll – I don’t roll, th – it’s – it’s a th – I can’t.</span> <span id="s508">I should be able to do that because I do it in English, but I – in Hebrew, that’s how I pronounce Hebrew, it’s very funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: At school, did you have any friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s511">I – I had – I went to a – I went to Jewish sleep away camps.</span> <span id="s512">My mother s-sent me every year.</span> <span id="s513">So I started going the year my brother was born.</span> <span id="s514">And I was very young.</span> <span id="s515">And – and I went through 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Oh, very much.</span> <span id="s518">And I learned to eat foods that I never ate at home.</span> <span id="s519">And I was – I was very active child, so I – I was always thin.</span> <span id="s520">And somewhat underweight, and that – and I promised I would gain weight, and I ate like a horse, but I never – I never – I never gained any weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: So, what were those conversations like with your father, when you said, school is difficult, and he said, you still have to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s523">Th-That – that was – you just didn’t – you – you did not –</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Did you give him examples of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: He – he didn't want to hear that.</span> <span id="s526">He didn’t want to hear that and I was an obedient child, and I did what my parents asked me to do, and that’s – that</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: Tell me those – some of those examples.</span> <span id="s528">What are those things where you would – what – what would happen that you would come home and say, I want to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: He – he – he just – he wouldn’t hear of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: I know, but what happened at school?</span> <span id="s531">What are some of the examples?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh, I was just very lonely.</span> <span id="s533">They didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s534">Those youngsters didn’t talk to me.</span> <span id="s535">They had their own friends, and they – they – they – don’t forget, they – they belonged to those groups, and – and they told stories about their parents, that was one of the things, these children were sent – were sent to the country.</span> <span id="s536">They – you know, Kraft durch Freude.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Strength through joy.</span> <span id="s539">They – they did things for them that they hadn’t had, because in the 20s, whatever they’d had, disappeared.</span> <span id="s540">So, for them this was great.</span> <span id="s541">And heh – we went to some Hatorah, my brother and I and the maid.</span> <span id="s542">And she sat upstairs and Peter and I were downstairs, and we had, in order to cross, to get to this particular synagogue, Mussolini had come to visit, and there was a parade, and we had to wait so we could cross.</span> <span id="s543">And – and they handed us the flags, so my brother starts yelling [speaks German].</span> <span id="s544">Well, they grabbed him, and [indecipherable] up on top, she wouldn’t acknowledge that she had anything to do with him, and I was ashamed and embarrassed, and they finally read him the riot act, and he calmed down.</span> <span id="s545">And the leading chocolatiers were all Jews, so we had wonderful, wonderful candies.</span> <span id="s546">I remember being there in ’88, and I walked into the store and I saw this – that I used to be wild about, it was a walnut englazed in – it – it was pro –</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: In chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No, sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Oh, sugar.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: [indecipherable] in sugar.</span> <span id="s551">I bought – when I saw that I went crazy, I wouldn’t even share it with my family.</span> <span id="s552">I bought everything he had.</span> <span id="s553">The next day he – we went back and we bought – I bought more.</span> <span id="s554">I broke, I think, I think I broke a bridge that time.</span> <span id="s555">And – and going into [indecipherable] upstairs, the food, I think [indecipherable] can – can – can –</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Exactly, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: It was fabulous, absolutely fabulous, we had such a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s559">So it – it sounds, from a child’s perspective, if we take – if we take everything that’s political out of it, extraordinarily bittersweet.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Yes, it is, it is.</span> <span id="s561">I remember once – once they already had the – you could rent a chair by the hour, and they were yellow with a yu – with a J, Jude.</span> <span id="s562">And you could – or – or you’d sat on a bench that was yellow, and it said, J, Jude.</span> <span id="s563">You sat – you had to sit on those benches.</span> <span id="s564">We just would sit down, the kids that I hung around with in Olivaer Platz.</span> <span id="s565">And I remember being in Olivaer Platz, and a – an-and a [indecipherable] went over to – to two men, they were sitting on a green bench.</span> <span id="s566">And now the axis had begun, you know, and Italy and Germany were like this.</span> <span id="s567">And they assumed that they were Jewish, but they were Italian.</span> <span id="s568">And they took out their passports to show that they had made a mistake.</span> <span id="s569">And then there was a very well known ice cream parlor around the corner from where Olivaer Platz was known as Ballza(ph), they had delicious ice cream.</span> <span id="s570">They ended up in Tel Aviv, having – but their children were no longer interested in it, so when the parents died Ballza(ph) went off the air.</span> <span id="s571">They have an ice cream group there called Dr. Lek, l-e-k, that’s very funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Lekka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: [indecipherable] delicious –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Just a Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: In this time, there’s so many Berlin memories, but you say that every year, your parents would go back to Warsaw to visit family.</span> <span id="s577">Did you ever join them?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s579">I went – I went several times.</span> <span id="s580">I was in Warsaw – the last time I was in Warsaw was Christmas of ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And how did you feel being in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Well, I – I had cousins, and that’s was wonderful.</span> <span id="s583">And one of my mother’s favorite cousins from – from the – from the Abramski(ph) family, they took me to a restaurant a-at – I never saw pious Jews with the – with the beards, and what have you, an-and special kipas.</span> <span id="s584">So, she wanted them to have Yiddish German – what would I like to eat, and I pointed there, and it was der Weihnachts-Mann ist.</span> <span id="s585">And that – that be – and everybody knew that this is what I’d said, I’m – I’m – I must have been, you know, maybe it was 1933 - 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: And you asked for the Christmas man.</span> <span id="s587">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Yeah, whatever the Christmas man was eating, that’s what I wanted.</span> <span id="s589">And whether it was roast duck, or roast goose.</span> <span id="s590">And – and I enjoyed being – I enjoyed being, you know, that that was family.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Did you feel – did you – if you compare the – did you feel at home in Berlin, or feel at home in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I felt at home in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: That is – so that’s – you know, that’s – that’s where I – that’s where I lived, and I didn’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s595">So that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Did you speak Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No.</span> <span id="s598">My parents spoke Polish in order for my brother and me not to understand what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s599">So, my mother had a stroke in ’74.</span> <span id="s600">My dad died in ’65, he was 70.</span> <span id="s601">And my mother turned 74 in the hospital, and the few words that came back, she – she could swallow, she could eat, but she couldn’t speak.</span> <span id="s602">The few words she babbled were in Polish, and my brother and I stood by like two dummies, and we didn't know what she was talking about, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: It was her – it was the first language of her childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yeah, absolutely, and that’s what comes back.</span> <span id="s605">For me to count and be accurate and fast, I count in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s607">So.</span> <span id="s608">Is there anything that I haven’t asked, that you would like to add to this, or that you think is important to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Well, not really.</span> <span id="s610">I’d – I’ve – I’ve come here from New York, and I went to the Charles E. Smith school to talk to them what it was like to grow up in Germany as a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s611">I did that one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: What were some of the questions the kids asked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: You know, how did I di-da – did ha – what it was – it – it – it’s hard for them to understand that – even that such a thing even exists.</span> <span id="s614">And it’s – for me, it’s difficult that – having met survivors and – and some of them are – are not telling the truth, either.</span> <span id="s615">They – they – th-they – they’re – the – they’re just not, they’re a – they’re imagining things, to a degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: What kind of things would you more –</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: They’re – they’re willing to testify that they were in particular places, when be – they – they admitted to me they were not.</span> <span id="s618">There are people that don’t have numbers on their arms, that I met in 1949 - ’50, and you couldn’t have been to that many camps, and not have a number.</span> <span id="s619">So, it’s – and th-then – then also, I we – I went to the early Yom HaShoahs, so the first ones that were in New York, and – and everybody wanted to be, you know, the first – well – well, if you come very late, you can’t sit in the first row, and they liked to be where famous people were.</span> <span id="s620">But that’s human nature.</span> <span id="s621">And among – among those that – that [indecipherable] and that they were part of, you know, controlling the sums of money that Switzerland was willing to give, and Germany, and they don’t want you to ask any questions.</span> <span id="s622">And that’s human nature, because look at some of these people, look at these Orthodox Jews from New Jersey, that go to – that go to Israel and approach poor people to sell them a kidney for 10,000 dollars and then peddle it off back home for 160,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s623">They’re not ashamed [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s624">And – and this Mr. may – Madoff, Woody Allen wrote a one page story in “The New Yorker” called “Tails of Manhattan,” t-a-i-l-s, where these two guys, these two guys are – have coronaries and they come back as lobsters.</span> <span id="s625">And they are lobsters in this fancy restaurant in New York.</span> <span id="s626">And in comes Madoff, and he wants two lobst – these two lobsters for himself and his wife, he wants to give her a nice dinner.</span> <span id="s627">And what happens, a – it’s – he has such an imagination, it is so funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: I gotta look it up.</span> <span id="s629">I’ve gotta look it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes, it – it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So it sounds like, you know, you experienced – experienced the real thing, and got out just in time, but also have seen how, years later, decades later, sometimes it’s used in not quite the right ways, whatever the experience was.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s633">Un – now, when – when they said they’d come to the apartments, so my parents got a taxi, and the four of us went to the Polish embassy.</span> <span id="s634">And it’s octo – it’s November, and it’s north.</span> <span id="s635">And – and boots had just come out.</span> <span id="s636">They were boots with a – with a combination of leather and – and suede.</span> <span id="s637">And in the afternoon we arrived there, and they tell my parents, you’re Polish Jews, you’re not Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s638">And they permitted us, behind the wall, to walk.</span> <span id="s639">And it was quite cold.</span> <span id="s640">Then they permitted women and children to go inside.</span> <span id="s641">And one woman didn’t have any children, so my mother gave her my brother.</span> <span id="s642">And she went and – with Peter and I – I went with my mother and my dad and the men remained outside.</span> <span id="s643">At six o’clock they permitted the men to come in also.</span> <span id="s644">And at eight o’clock somebody came out to say that Goebbels ministry called, that it was safe to go back home.</span> <span id="s645">So there you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Yeah, it was [indecipherable] that’s just how it was.</span> <span id="s648">And – and yet, you know, Peter and I, to a degree we – we witnessed certain things, but we didn’t question it, and – and – and that’s how it was until – until we left.</span> <span id="s649">And we really, it was like the last train out of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: It sounds like –</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: One of the last ones out.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: It sounds like it.</span> <span id="s653">Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: It was fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Oh, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Let’s look at some pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: So that’s Peter.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Now, this is my parents, smoking.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Wow, she –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: This my father, with his older brother, Moritz(ph), who was married to my Aunt Regina, my mother’s sister.</span> <span id="s665">This my mother and me, fur coat.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Oh, how lovely.</span> <span id="s667">Very lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Now, here’s Peter in school, first year.</span> <span id="s669">And this is [indecipherable] –</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: – you know, when you go to school –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: – and you –</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: – and the first day of school, yo-you’re taken to the photographer, with your new school bag, your lunch bag, and here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Oh, how darling.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Absolutely darling.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Thank you.</span></p>
