<p><span id="s6">00:00:00 Robert Braun: Not in front of the kids, but -- Interviewer: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Robert Braun: Eleanor told us that later.</span> <span id="s8">I didn't learn about this until 20 years after the fact, you know, after she was -- Interviewer: That's why the interview with you, Bob, is so pivotal because none of these other kids -- Robert Braun: Well they were there for, at the most, two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Interviewer: None of them had any history with the Krauss.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Robert Braun: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Interviewer: And you did.</span> <span id="s12">And since this is their story and they're not here to tell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">[Director's comments] Interviewer: Simply start by saying who you are and spelling your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">00:01:06 Robert Braun: Well, my name is Robert Braun, spelled B-R-A-U-N.</span> <span id="s15">And, uh, I'm one of the 50 children brought to this country by Mr. and Mrs. Kraus.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Interviewer: Bob, tell us when and where you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Robert Braun: I was born in Vienna on July 11, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Interviewer: Let's start in Vienna.</span> <span id="s19">Before we start talking about your memories, I want to know a little bit about your parents.</span> <span id="s20">You had mentioned before we started rolling about your father's family's long storied presence in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">00:01:51 Robert Braun: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Interviewer: So tell me a little bit about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Robert Braun: Well, as I mentioned, my father's family, as far as we could tell by the genealogical research of an uncle of mine, has lived in Vienna for probably about 600 years and been involved with the life there, including the, uh, Turkish siege of Vienna.</span> <span id="s24">And he always felt very much 100 percent Viennese and Austrian patriot.</span> <span id="s25">As a matter of fact, I might describe him as a super patriot.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">00:02:22 He, uh, uh, was in the army for universal military training in 1889, I believe.</span> <span id="s27">He had to spend, I think, three years in the military because he was the youngest son in the family and there was, I think, a regulation that one member of each family had to serve in the military.</span> <span id="s28">So they picked him because he was the least necessary being the youngest.</span> <span id="s29">Those where the days when they still wore comic opera uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">00:02:51 We have some pictures of him sitting on a café table with the shako on his head and red and blue uniform, presumably.</span> <span id="s31">And, uh, his business was, uh, wine.</span> <span id="s32">He and his brother, older brother Alexander, had a little vineyard in Baden, which is a small town outside of Vienna.</span> <span id="s33">And they also bought wine from the surrounding vintners.</span> <span id="s34">And my father's job was to run the office in Vienna at, at, uh, District 1, Schulof 2, was the address.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">00:03:25 And, uh, he had an office there and a cellar underneath where wine was stored in bottles and in barrels.</span> <span id="s36">The cellar was made, in part, of the, uh, old, uh, uh -- I'm trying to think of the name.</span> <span id="s37">[Laughs] I had it before.</span> <span id="s38">The, uh, catacombs that were under Vienna where they buried people hundreds of years ago.</span> <span id="s39">And they simply walled off a part of this and turned it into a wine cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">00:03:55 It has a steep stairway going down.</span> <span id="s41">I remember going down there and the aroma of wine permeating everything.</span> <span id="s42">And, uh, altogether I had an extremely happy childhood.</span> <span id="s43">In the summertime my parents rented two rooms in the second floor of a farmhouse in a little village called Piesting about 25 miles from Vienna -- 25 kilometers from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">00:04:20 And, uh, we spent the summer going barefoot and playing with the farm kids; going with the cows up into the hills to graze every day and then riding them back down with the bell clanging.</span> <span id="s45">And each cow would go to its own separate yard.</span> <span id="s46">Uh, in the wintertime, of course, we went to school.</span> <span id="s47">Uh, I went to a grammar school called the Schubert Schule because it was the grammar school where Schubert had taught as a teacher before he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">00:04:51 And I know it was right around the corner from where we lived in an apartment building, Number 22A, Porzellangasse in the ninth district.</span> <span id="s49">And my two older sisters and I all went to that same school for four years.</span> <span id="s50">Uh, my older sister, Martha, ended up going to the Gymnasium afterwards, uh, on academic course.</span> <span id="s51">My next sister and I weren't old enough to change schools yet.</span> <span id="s52">Uh, all together it was a very happy existence as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">00:05:21 My mother frequently took us almost every day in the summer and the spring and fall.</span> <span id="s54">We went to a park and I played with marbles and my sister played with other little kids.</span> <span id="s55">And, uh, I had just had no bad memories whatsoever.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, we secretly hang -- hung out our bedroom window in this apartment building.</span> <span id="s57">We lived on the second floor.</span> <span id="s58">Because right next to it there was the outside, uh, dining area of a café, uh, which, uh, had dozens of tables underneath a, a network of wires supporting, uh, an, uh, uh, vines growing over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">00:06:00 You peek through the vines and see the men playing chess and reading the newspaper and drinking coffee and talking.</span> <span id="s60">Uh, it was a pretty typical existence, uh, which changed very abruptly, of course, with the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s61">In March 1938 very abruptly, uh, everything changed.</span> <span id="s62">Uh, I think the details are well known by anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">00:06:27 Uh, the first thing we noticed in terms of change, that I noticed, was that the -- I went to the classroom about three weeks after the Anschluss and a yellow line was painted in front of the last row of seats in my classroom.</span> <span id="s64">And the teacher announced with a very serious face, not a cheerful face, and says, "The authorities have ordered that we rearrange the seating in the room."</span> <span id="s65">And he called out the names of all the Jewish kids, boys, and we had to go sit behind this line and the other boys sat in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">00:07:01 And that was the beginning of things getting rather unpleasant.</span> <span id="s67">Uh, some of my fellow students behaved as they always had.</span> <span id="s68">Some didn't.</span> <span id="s69">A lot of them started wearing their Hitler Youth uniforms to class and it was best to stay away from them.</span> <span id="s70">Sometimes it wasn't successful and a few times I got chased.</span> <span id="s71">I still have a little mark in my hair that the barber notices where a rock bounced off my head.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">00:07:28 Uh, and then that even changed at the, uh -- November 10th, or rather November 11th at Krystallnacht when, uh, the teachers -- actually I skipped something.</span> <span id="s73">In the fall -- this was the spring of, uh, of 1938.</span> <span id="s74">In the fall of 1938 all the Jewish boys and girls were sent to one school each in Vienna.</span> <span id="s75">They called it, uh -- it was an old, uh, Jewish school called the Chajes Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">00:08:00 And we were packed in there, about 50 or 60 boys in one classroom standing around because we didn't have enough seats.</span> <span id="s77">I didn't know what was going on because a lot of the instruction was in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s78">It was an orthodox Jewish school or had been.</span> <span id="s79">So for several months I went there totally befuddled as to why, until the Krystallnacht occurred on November 10th.</span> <span id="s80">After that, they closed the schools altogether and, and Jewish kids didn't go to school at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">00:08:28 And, uh, some -- a couple of weeks after the Krystallnacht I recall my father took me with him to his wine cellar.</span> <span id="s82">He, of course, uh, didn't go back after that.</span> <span id="s83">It had been totally trashed.</span> <span id="s84">The cellar reeked of wine because all the bottles were broken.</span> <span id="s85">It was about, it looked to me, ankle deep in wine.</span> <span id="s86">And that was the last time I saw that.</span> <span id="s87">Uh, after that 10th of November, 1938, I just stayed home and so did my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">00:09:01 Soon after that my older sister went with a youth group to British Mandate of Palestine.</span> <span id="s89">My younger sister, who was two years older than I and I just simply stayed in the apartment and off the streets because it wasn't really safe to go into the streets.</span> <span id="s90">And I did a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s91">And among some of the books I read morning, noon and night was a series of really poorly written, ridiculous adventure stories by a German author called Karl May, who specialized in writing fanciful novels of Wild West America.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">00:09:36 Indians, cowboys, trappers and basically they're all the same.</span> <span id="s93">You know, the terrible Indians and the, the galloping buffalo and the heroic frontiersmen and mountaineers.</span> <span id="s94">And I was just fascinated by these images and I kind of dreamed about it constantly for months and months and months, until we finally left, uh, Austria.</span> <span id="s95">And it never left my mind and it came in rather useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">00:10:02 Because when it came, when it came time, uh, for my sister and I to, uh, leave the country, to leave our parents, my father would tell me about the wonderful things we were going to do in America.</span> <span id="s97">[Crying]</span></p> <p><span id="s98">00:10:31 Well, anyway it turned out, uh, it really happened because, uh, many years later, uh, after I finished college I went to work for the National Park Service at Yellowstone Park and another park in South Dakota called Wind Cave National Park.</span> <span id="s99">And I actually had to shoot some buffalo for the local Indian tribes and, uh, ended up trapping bears in Yellowstone that, uh, bothered campgrounds.</span> <span id="s100">And it was a real Wild West sort of an existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">00:11:02 And, uh, it always struck me that, uh, because, uh, my parents encouraged me to think about this when we were leaving, that the leave-taking wasn't sad at all.</span> <span id="s102">It was -- I was looking forward to a wonderful adventure and actually it turned out that way in the long-run.</span> <span id="s103">And also in the short-run because, uh, my sister and our life coming to the United States was really extremely pleasant.</span> <span id="s104">Now, I don't know if I should go on at this time beyond that.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Interviewer: Let's stop for just a second.</span> <span id="s106">Go back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s107">I also wanted to ask you, Bob, when you were growing up in Vienna did you grow up in an observant Jewish household?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">00:11:48 Robert Braun: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Interviewer: What was the --?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Robert Braun: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s111">The background was, uh, my father and mother got engaged before the First World War in 1914.</span> <span id="s112">She was technically a Catholic.</span> <span id="s113">Her family had originally come two generations earlier from a small village in Bohemia called [Chernikov], which I've never been able to find on a map.</span> <span id="s114">And they moved to Vienna.</span> <span id="s115">And, uh, her father, however, was a rather militant atheist.</span> <span id="s116">He was involved in founding the first shoemaker's union in Vienna.</span> <span id="s117">All the, all the Czechs in Vienna were shoemakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">00:12:19 And my mother, actually, before she was married worked in a big shoe factory as an office manager called [Chopik] Shoes.</span> <span id="s119">And, uh, uh, the war intervened, so they didn't get married.</span> <span id="s120">So four years later my father survived the First World War, came home and they wanted to get married, but, uh, in Vienna, or at least in Austria you could not marry outside of religious denomination.</span> <span id="s121">So it was a question which denomination would they pick.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">00:12:49 I don't know if they flipped a coin or not.</span> <span id="s123">I'm not -- I really don't know.</span> <span id="s124">But anyway, my mother converted to Judaism and they got married.</span> <span id="s125">And we were not religious at all.</span> <span id="s126">Once a year my father would go to a large hall where they had a Yom Kippur service and he'd drag me along with him.</span> <span id="s127">And I didn't like it at all, mostly because there were a lot of older men there with horrible breath because they hadn't eaten for 24 hours.</span> <span id="s128">Anyway, that was about the extent of my Jewish upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">00:13:17 However, my mother did have special dinners and celebrated Passover, for instance.</span> <span id="s130">She cooked all the right dishes and the matzo ball soup and everything else that went with it.</span> <span id="s131">And so we celebrated in a, in a cultural way, I would say.</span> <span id="s132">I would say culturally we were Jewish, but not, uh, religiously.</span> <span id="s133">And, uh -- Interviewer: I'm sorry; I just want to make sure, are you picking up the --?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">00:13:45 Robert Braun: The sniffing?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">[Director's comments] Interviewer: Just because it was interesting before, I wanted you to also mention the anecdote about your parents.</span> <span id="s136">You had told me about the officers coming to the door and her showing the -- Robert Braun: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">00:14:12 Well, the reason my parents survived, especially my father, he was one of 180 Jews alive in Vienna when the Russians broke in at the end of the Second World War in Vienna.</span> <span id="s138">There had been 180,000 Jews in Vienna.</span> <span id="s139">There were 180 living and every one of them was a mixed marriage that survived.</span> <span id="s140">And my mother was able to protect him.</span> <span id="s141">She was a very outspoken person.</span> <span id="s142">Uh, she did not, uh, hesitate to raise her voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">00:14:40 And, uh, as soon as the racial laws came into existence, uh, she wrote home to that little village, [Chernikov] in, in what was then, uh -- I don't know what the Germans called it, the Czech Protectorate or something -- and, uh, to the priest there, the village priest, and he sent back she told me within a couple of weeks, uh, certificates showing the birth, marriage and death of all her ancestors going back three generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">00:15:09 And on the basis of these she was able to get what was called in German an [Ehreanschein], which means a certificate of your area and ancestry.</span> <span id="s145">And, uh, it was fully printed out with all the proper swastikas and signatures in the right place, except on the bottom was written, "gattin Jude," which means spouse Jew.</span> <span id="s146">And when troubles arose my parents never had to leave the apartment where they lived.</span> <span id="s147">Other people had moved in with them, but they stayed there the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">00:15:36 But anytime, which happened several times apparently from what she told me afterwards, uh, that an SS man or a policeman came in looking for my father, she would fly into an outrage and wave the Aryan certificate in the officer's face, holding her thumb over the notation "gattin Jude" on the bottom and start screaming at him, "How dare you insult a good Aryan woman.</span> <span id="s149">The Fuehrer should hear about this.</span> <span id="s150">This is an outrage."</span> <span id="s151">She carried on quite loudly and she was able to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">00:16:04 I spent many, many hours listening to her stories.</span> <span id="s153">And the guy would leave and that's one of the ways my father survived.</span> <span id="s154">Uh, also because she was able to get a, uh, ration card she was able to buy food, which he, of course, couldn't.</span> <span id="s155">And also she had a childhood friend who had a pastry shop in Vienna and my mother went to work there when my father couldn't leave the apartment.</span> <span id="s156">He had to stay low.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">00:16:31 And she was able to, uh -- like all business people they cheated like heck on, on the rationing system and everything else and she was able to bring extra food home to feed my father, as well as herself.</span> <span id="s158">And then finally the war ended for them.</span> <span id="s159">The Russians broke into Vienna and my father was the first one out of the rubble of the, uh, cellar that served as an air raid shelter and went looking for a Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">00:17:01 And sure enough, he said he encountered a, uh, a Russian soldier driving what was called a gulasch [canolia], a gulasch can -- an field kitchen; one horse and a wagon behind with, I don't know, a pot of stew or something on it, smoking.</span> <span id="s161">And my father was an inveterate smoker and I think that's the one thing he missed during the war years more than anything else, cigarettes.</span> <span id="s162">And he saw the Russian soldier smoking on the -- driving the horse and he said, "Hey Tovarich, cigarette?"</span> <span id="s163">And the Russian said, "Da," and he threw him a whole package of Russian cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">00:17:30 So my father, happy as a clam, grabbed the cigarettes and ran -- and walked as fast as he could back to the apartment building and told my mother, "Look, look!</span> <span id="s165">The Russians are here, the Russians are here.</span> <span id="s166">Look what I got from them, cigarettes."</span> <span id="s167">And she said, "What kind of a Russian?"</span> <span id="s168">"He was driving a field kitchen."</span> <span id="s169">She says, "You fool!</span> <span id="s170">We're starving to death here.</span> <span id="s171">You get to a Russian field kitchen and you ask for cigarettes?"</span> <span id="s172">From that day on she refused to buy him cigarettes.</span> <span id="s173">She never would buy him cigarettes at the store again.</span> <span id="s174">But he got his cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Interviewer: That's a good story.</span> <span id="s176">Let's move to the kindertransport.</span> <span id="s177">I'd like to ask you if you remember how you or your family first heard about the opportunity for you and your sister to come to America, whenever that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">00:18:23 Robert Braun: Well, uh, apparently, uh, the Americans, Mr. and Mrs. Kraus and Dr. [Schleis] the pediatrician, uh, posted a notice at what was called the Jewish [Kultur] [unintelligible], which is the Cultural Center office, which was a quasi-official agency -- it wasn't just a social office.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">00:18:42 Announcing the fact that there were Americans here who would take 50 Jewish children, 25 boys and 25 girls, back to the States.</span> <span id="s180">And to get an application form, I assume at that office, and fill it out and then, then bring it back.</span> <span id="s181">And my mother got the form and, uh, they filled it out and brought it back.</span> <span id="s182">And then, uh, they received word that they should report to the, uh, a particular office again to be interviewed.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">00:19:11 And I remember going back there and I vaguely remember a long line of people, parents and children, waiting to get in and eventually our turn came.</span> <span id="s184">We came in and, uh, uh, we had to bring our school certificates, report cards, birth certificate and, uh, citizenship papers.</span> <span id="s185">And on the basis of that we eventually went in one at a time and spoke with Mr. Kraus.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">00:19:42 He didn't speak German.</span> <span id="s187">He had a few words of German, but very little.</span> <span id="s188">And apparently, Mr. Kraus had hired a, a young Austrian woman or Viennese woman to act as an interpreter who spoke English as well.</span> <span id="s189">And through that he asked us a lot of questions, uh, I think on a level with the child's age and school grade so we could communicate.</span> <span id="s190">And he talked about this and he had a map of Europe and he asked me to point out where's Paris and where's Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">00:20:12 And, uh, you know, we pointed to where we thought it would be and, uh, just asked simple questions in general.</span> <span id="s192">And, uh, then Dr. [Schleis] saw us.</span> <span id="s193">I'm speaking about myself.</span> <span id="s194">I went into to see Dr. [Schleis] and, uh, he gave me a physical examination, as I recall.</span> <span id="s195">And he also showed me some weird blotches on paper, which in retrospect, you know, 50 years later I realized were probably a Rorschach test.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">00:20:43 But he said, "What is, what is this?</span> <span id="s197">What is this?"</span> <span id="s198">And I said, "Geez, this is kind of stupid.</span> <span id="s199">You know, it looks like a butterfly or, I don’t know, maybe a beetle or a bug or a star."</span> <span id="s200">And, uh, asked some other questions; quite a, quite a bit of questioning, both by Mr. Kraus and Dr. Schleis and then we went home.</span> <span id="s201">And then eventually my parents got notification that my sister and I had both been chosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">00:21:12 And incidentally, Mr. Kraus had promised parents that if siblings were chosen they would not be separated.</span> <span id="s203">Because the parents were told that we would go to a good, healthy place to live and he would, uh, find homes for us.</span> <span id="s204">If there were relatives in the United States, he would eventually bring us to the relatives to live.</span> <span id="s205">And if not, then they would find nice people to take care of us until such time as the parents could be reunited with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">00:21:40 At that time, it wasn't at all clear that there was going to be a mass extermination.</span> <span id="s207">This was in, uh -- long before the, uh, actual murder started.</span> <span id="s208">So there was that constant idea that well sooner or later, eventually either perhaps maybe the children would go back or perhaps the parents would come to the States.</span> <span id="s209">And on the basis of that, uh, promises were made by Mr. Kraus to the parents that they would be taken care of no matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">00:22:08 And subsequently I found out that he personally signed affidavits -- [Crying] -- guaranteeing that, uh, he would be responsible for -- [Crying] -- did I complete that question?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Interviewer: Yes you did.</span> <span id="s212">At that time, Bob, were your parents themselves looking to leave Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">00:22:42 Robert Braun: They tried, but they had no connections.</span> <span id="s214">They had no relatives close enough in the States that they could call on for an affidavit and it looked quite hopeless.</span> <span id="s215">There was no question of them being able to leave.</span> <span id="s216">Of course, there were rumors around.</span> <span id="s217">You could, you could buy a visa to get to Cuba, I think, or to China or to Shanghai or things of that sort.</span> <span id="s218">But my parents were not wealthy.</span> <span id="s219">We were strictly lower middle class and, uh, my father lost what little business he had, so there was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">00:23:13 I don't think they had any hope of being able to leave, at least not in the foreseeable future.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Interviewer: And also during that time when you were visiting with Gill Kraus and Dr. [Schleis] and going through this process of hopefully being chosen to be one of the 50, along with your sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Interviewer: I'm curious; what kinds of things did you and your sister talk about while --?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Robert Braun: We were excited about going to America.</span> <span id="s225">First, we hoped we could go.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">00:23:44 And our parents talked it up right from the beginning.</span> <span id="s227">"Oh, there's a wonderful opportunity.</span> <span id="s228">You can see America.</span> <span id="s229">You can, you can, uh, climb mountains.</span> <span id="s230">You can, uh, hunt buffalo," things of that sort.</span> <span id="s231">I guess my sister responded to other things.</span> <span id="s232">I'm sure they told her similar enticing vistas of the future.</span> <span id="s233">So we weren't the least bit sad.</span> <span id="s234">Nobody cried.</span> <span id="s235">My parents didn't cry.</span> <span id="s236">We didn't cry.</span> <span id="s237">And we were kind of surprised when we got to the train station eventually -- I think it was at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">00:24:15 As a matter of fact, it was a major event.</span> <span id="s239">It was the first time in my life I ever road in a car because my parents engaged a taxi to bring us there because we didn't want to be -- I think in retrospect they didn't want to be seen walking the streets with suitcases.</span> <span id="s240">It wasn't safe, so they splurged for a taxi.</span> <span id="s241">And that was impressive riding in a car.</span> <span id="s242">And on the platform some kids were crying and some parents were crying and hugging and, and, uh, my parents didn't do any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">00:24:44 Uh, it was a, it was like going, I suppose -- we didn't have summer camp in Vienna, but subsequently it must have been like going off to summer camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Interviewer: What were you allowed to bring with you?</span> <span id="s245">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Robert Braun: It seems to me we could have one small suitcase, but no -- nothing valuable.</span> <span id="s247">Uh, I don't even know if we were allowed to bring books.</span> <span id="s248">But all we had -- I'm sure my parents packed as much in as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">00:25:13 I had clothing and, uh, yes I had one other thing.</span> <span id="s250">I had something, a really expensive toy my parents bought me before we left, which I thought it was great.</span> <span id="s251">It was something called a Schuco Fernlenkauto.</span> <span id="s252">It was a little mechanical windup toy, which is very well made.</span> <span id="s253">And there was a wire coming off the roof to a little steering wheel up high.</span> <span id="s254">And you could wind it up and you could actually steer it; no batteries.</span> <span id="s255">As a matter of fact, a few months ago I saw the same toy on, on Antiques Road Show and it was auctioned off.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">00:25:46 The expert said it's worth at least $500.</span> <span id="s257">However, I brought this with me.</span> <span id="s258">I took good care of it, but one summer -- you don't want to hear all this detail [surely].</span> <span id="s259">[Laughs] One summer I was playing with it on the roof of, of, uh, the Kraus' summer home on Long Beach Island.</span> <span id="s260">It had a flat roof and there were vent pipes sticking up through it.</span> <span id="s261">And another boy named [Amram], who eventually became an author, I think.</span> <span id="s262">I'm trying to remember his first name.</span> <span id="s263">His last name was [Amram].</span></p> <p><span id="s264">00:26:14 They were neighbors and friends of the Kraus'.</span> <span id="s265">He was playing with it and he picked it up by the wire and the doggone thing slipped off and fell down one of the vent pipes.</span> <span id="s266">And to this day somebody is having trouble with their plumbing there if it's still standing.</span> <span id="s267">So that was the end of that.</span> <span id="s268">Uh, I'm sure my sister also had some special thing that she took along with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Interviewer: So off you went on a train from Vienna to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Robert Braun: Berlin, yes.</span> <span id="s271">It left in the evening.</span> <span id="s272">I remember it was dark.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">00:26:45 And, uh, the -- somehow we were told that once you were in that seat you have to stay there because the doors are going to be locked.</span> <span id="s274">And I don't know if they locked them for our protection or to keep us from escaping.</span> <span id="s275">I'm not -- but it didn't concern me particularly.</span> <span id="s276">And we slept, at least I slept and my sister slept.</span> <span id="s277">I was fortunate because my sister was two years older than me and she kind of mothered me.</span> <span id="s278">You know, I was not quite 11 and she was 13.</span> <span id="s279">And, uh, so I didn't feel at all unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">00:27:15 We got to Berlin and, uh, we were brought to a, uh, some kind of a camp or barracks that was run by a Zionist youth organization, which was still in affect at that time in Berlin in, uh, in, uh, May of 1939.</span> <span id="s281">And, uh, all the boys slept in one big room in bunk beds and the girls in another.</span> <span id="s282">And we ate there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">00:27:42 They brought food in and the young people running this camp, encampment were very pleasant.</span> <span id="s284">They taught us Yiddish songs, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s285">I can still think of some of them.</span> <span id="s286">It's the only place I ever heard a Yiddish song because I never heard anyone speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s287">We always spoke German and my parents didn't have any acquaintances that spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s288">So they taught us these songs and I realized that gee, it sounds a lot like German, but not quite.</span> <span id="s289">And to this day, I still remember them quite well.</span> <span id="s290">I won't sing them now.</span> <span id="s291">I have a terrible voice.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">00:28:11 Uh, and we ate there.</span> <span id="s293">And then the next, uh -- I had one interesting experience there.</span> <span id="s294">Naturally, like boys will, the older boys -- I was, I guess, one of the medium-aged boys, maybe, I don't know, fifth or sixth from the eldest in age.</span> <span id="s295">We peeked around what was going on and at one point I have a distinct memory of Mr. Kraus sitting in a kind of an anteroom to this big room with bunk beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">00:28:37 There was a table there and he was talking to an SS officer in this black uniform loaded down with his pistol and his authority.</span> <span id="s297">And Mr. Kraus was yelling at him in English.</span> <span id="s298">I said, "Geez, he shouldn't yell that.</span> <span id="s299">That's dangerous," you know.</span> <span id="s300">If in Vienna when we were on the street, if you saw an SS man coming you made sure you got way out of the way and made believe you were invisible.</span> <span id="s301">And here was Mr. Kraus yelling at this officer and the SS officer was talking back in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">00:29:03 Mr. Kraus had very few German words and there was a paper there and he kept pointing at it and banging his fist on the table.</span> <span id="s303">And we were terrified.</span> <span id="s304">I don't remember who the other boys were with me because I thought this SS man is going to shoot him.</span> <span id="s305">Instead, he picked up a pen and he signed it.</span> <span id="s306">And to this day I have no idea what it was all about.</span> <span id="s307">Some permit or something of that sort that had to be signed.</span> <span id="s308">But I was really frightened because I thought that, uh, Mr. Kraus was going to get shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">00:29:34 And he was a very husky man.</span> <span id="s310">He had tremendously sized fists, I remember.</span> <span id="s311">And when he banged down it really made a noise.</span> <span id="s312">Uh, that's what I remember about Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">[Director's comments] Interviewer: Mrs. Krause; was she visible during --?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">00:30:19 Robert Braun: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s315">She was there.</span> <span id="s316">I don't recall if she interviewed children, but she was certainly present because she smiled at us.</span> <span id="s317">And I think, I think she led us by the hand into the room where Mr. Kraus talked to us.</span> <span id="s318">I have a memory of that because I knew what she looked like long before we ever got to the United States.</span> <span id="s319">And of course, once we got onboard ship we saw her constantly.</span> <span id="s320">She was always with the children.</span> <span id="s321">And, uh, that was actually the next thing that happened, is we boarded ship in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">00:30:49 I think we took a train from Berlin to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s323">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s324">It could have been a bus, but I think it was a train.</span> <span id="s325">And we got onboard the SS President Harding and, uh, we were assigned the cabins.</span> <span id="s326">And, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Kraus and Dr. Schleis were on the same ship also.</span> <span id="s327">I think we were either two or four to a cabin.</span> <span id="s328">Some were two, some were four.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">00:31:15 And I was and all those kids were terribly impressed, at least the ones I spoke to, because you could order your meals off a menu in the dining room.</span> <span id="s330">You had a choice of eight different things for breakfast and there were several courses.</span> <span id="s331">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s332">I mean, uh, you know, we used to -- when we went out on a Sunday somewhere with the family at home in Vienna, you know, we'd go to a, a place out in, in the, in the, uh, uh, in the hills where they had, uh, taverns, outdoor seating.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">00:31:46 And I'd get a soda pop and my father would have a beer and my mother would have a beer and, and that was the extent of our going out.</span> <span id="s334">And here was a menu with three choices of meat; unbelievable.</span> <span id="s335">I said, "Well this is America.</span> <span id="s336">This is how America lives."</span> <span id="s337">And the ship was a delightful experience.</span> <span id="s338">I didn't get seasick.</span> <span id="s339">But there was one hilarious episode.</span> <span id="s340">I don't know if it's hilarious, but an interesting episode on the ship because two of the boys came from a very religious home, apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">00:32:16 And they kept strictly kosher at home and the parents were afraid they wouldn't be able to get kosher on ship, which is true.</span> <span id="s342">They didn't have a kosher kitchen that I know of.</span> <span id="s343">So they apparently packed food for them in their suitcase.</span> <span id="s344">And I have a memory partway out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean of seeing Mr. Kraus and a steward, each one carrying a, a small suitcase at arm's length, running through the railing and dropping it in the ocean.</span> <span id="s345">And I subsequently found out apparently the food had started to smell and the steward complained there was something terrible going on in that stateroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">00:32:47 And Mr. Kraus checked and he found the decaying food; I think fish and things like that.</span> <span id="s347">Uh, that was hilarious because I had never saw Mr. Kraus run so fast.</span> <span id="s348">Uh, other than that, uh -- well, the trip had one scary experience, which I didn't find out about until, oh, probably 30 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">00:33:13 Uh, when, uh, when my sister and I used to visit Mrs. Kraus when she was widowed, she lived in a very nice apartment near Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s350">And about every several months we'd go down and pay a visit for the day.</span> <span id="s351">And at one of these visits she told us something which she had never mentioned before, we knew nothing about.</span> <span id="s352">It seems that the ship docked in South Hampton briefly, perhaps for a day and the, the children were not permitted off the ship, but visitors could come onboard ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">00:33:44 And I guess several of the children had visitors.</span> <span id="s354">And, you know, they took pictures and they greeted each other and talked about the family, I suppose.</span> <span id="s355">I don't know; we didn't have a visitor.</span> <span id="s356">And then the ship left and we went on to America.</span> <span id="s357">And, as I said, maybe 30 years later Mrs. Kraus once told us when we visited her in Philadelphia that a terrible thing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">00:34:10 It seems that Mr. Kraus discovered that one of the children had been carrying some valuable jewelry and turned it over to the visitor in South Hampton.</span> <span id="s359">And he was simply outraged.</span> <span id="s360">She said he was practically violent.</span> <span id="s361">He says, "That could have cost every one of those kids incarceration or their lives or whatever, and they risk it for that lousy bit of jewelry."</span> <span id="s362">And he said he's going to send that child back.</span> <span id="s363">I got the impression it was a much younger child.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">00:34:39 I had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s365">And she said she calmed him down and she calmed him down and she finally convinced him that you can't punish a child for the sins of their parents.</span> <span id="s366">But apparently, he was just outraged because it would have totally destroyed the whole enterprise if it had been discovered.</span> <span id="s367">Otherwise, the voyage was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s368">As I said, I didn't know about it at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Interviewer: When you mentioned ordering off the menu, I've read some amusing accounts here and there about foods that none of you children were even familiar with.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">00:35:17 Robert Braun: Yes, I'm sure there were quite a few, but, uh, I always had a good appetite and I tried everything I could.</span> <span id="s371">I really did, except the fish.</span> <span id="s372">They had fish choices and fish dishes and we never ate fish at home because being in a landlocked country it wasn't on the market.</span> <span id="s373">The only fish that was available, usually, I think was carp out of the Danube and it was pretty awful.</span> <span id="s374">[Laughs] So we did not eat fish at home and we never got used to eating fish, except sardines.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">00:35:47 But otherwise, I thought the food was wonderful.</span> <span id="s376">I mean, to have, to have pancakes for breakfast, what I now know as pancakes, with sweet syrup on top and butter and jam, it was just unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Interviewer: Staying on the ship for just another second or two, what kinds of things would you do during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Robert Braun: Oh, uh, during the day we'd have English lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">00:36:14 Mr. and Mrs. Kraus would get us into groups and then they'd, they'd hold up pictures and say, "Das, this, uh, [buh], bye," simple words.</span> <span id="s380">And then, uh, that was kind of fun because, uh, you know, it changed the routine and there was nothing to see on the Atlantic Ocean.</span> <span id="s381">Uh, so we did that everyday, I think.</span> <span id="s382">I don't know how often, once or twice a day.</span> <span id="s383">And there were little exciting things like lifeboat drill.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">00:36:42 And, uh, basically that was [about it].</span> <span id="s385">Then, you know, kids roam around the ship.</span> <span id="s386">We roamed all over the place and the crew would sometimes have to say, "No, you have to go back over there," because we went up the wrong stairways and climbed here and there.</span> <span id="s387">It must have been a bit of a headache for the crew, uh, with the large number aboard.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Interviewer: Who was watching out for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Robert Braun: Mr. and Mrs. Kraus, Dr. [Schleis] and there were nurses onboard ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">00:37:10 And, uh, they kind of kept an eye on us, too.</span> <span id="s391">And, uh, you know, they'd caution us.</span> <span id="s392">You know, you can't lean over the railing and things of that sort.</span> <span id="s393">They kept a very close watch on us, the crew on the ship as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Interviewer: And I think the voyage was about 10 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Robert Braun: I think it was longer.</span> <span id="s396">Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s397">I really don't know the date exactly.</span> <span id="s398">I can't even tell you the exact date when we landed.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">00:37:36 Uh, but when we landed, uh, we didn't see anything of America because we immediately -- well, we didn't have any checked luggage.</span> <span id="s400">You know, I guess there must have been such a thing as checked luggage onboard a ship; maybe not.</span> <span id="s401">We each carried our own little suitcase and we quickly got on buses.</span> <span id="s402">I think there were two buses.</span> <span id="s403">And, uh -- because everything was different, new and -- we didn't land in, uh, in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">00:38:05 We landed, I think, I think in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s405">There was a, a port.</span> <span id="s406">But, again, I'm not certain.</span> <span id="s407">And, uh, then we drove all the way to Collegeville, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s408">And, of course, we looked out the windows constantly.</span> <span id="s409">And that was before interstate highways, so you went right through the middle of towns and cities and the most amazing thing we saw -- I guess it's a normal reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">00:38:34 None of those kids as far as I know ever saw a black person.</span> <span id="s411">And suddenly we saw people out the window and that was amazing to us because it was like an exotic apparition, you know.</span> <span id="s412">Uh, that's, I think, what impressed the children more than anything else.</span> <span id="s413">Perhaps not the very older ones who were more sophisticated, but everybody else certainly was impressed.</span> <span id="s414">Uh, well and then we got to Collegeville and disembarked.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Interviewer: Before we get to Shalomville in Collegeville, there is that somewhat iconic photograph of the children looking at the Statute --</span></p> <p><span id="s416">00:39:17 Robert Braun: Yes, the Statue of Liberty, that's right.</span> <span id="s417">That was taken by the ship's photographer I believe at the behest of, uh, Mrs. Kraus.</span> <span id="s418">And there were other pictures taken onboard ship, too, by the ship's photographer, posing all 50 children with the Captain and then 25 boys alone and then 25 girls alone.</span> <span id="s419">And then, uh, I think several pictures of lifeboat drills and things of that sort.</span> <span id="s420">I guess the ship company thought it would be interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">00:39:43 And, uh, Mrs. Kraus obtained, or the Kraus family obtained the original prints, or some of the prints, at least.</span> <span id="s422">And she kept a very good scrapbook it turns out.</span> <span id="s423">And many years later she gave us her scrapbook with those photographs and a lot of newspaper clippings describing the event.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Interviewer: At this point, Bob --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">[Phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s426">[Pause] Interviewer: Let's go back to the ship for a second, Bob.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">00:40:30 Robert Braun: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Interviewer: Because I'm interested in your recollections of the ship, both in terms of two things.</span> <span id="s429">What do you remember about other passengers, if anything?</span> <span id="s430">And also, just your memories of the physicality of the ship itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Robert Braun: Uh, well, I thought the ship was, I thought the ship was huge.</span> <span id="s432">I had never seen such a large ship before because the Danube didn't have big ships of that sort.</span> <span id="s433">And, uh, we didn't have much contact with the other passengers.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">00:41:00 I remember, uh, talking to a Spanish boy who was a little older than I not in our group.</span> <span id="s435">And, uh, he said a variety of things about Franco and I didn't know anything about Franco.</span> <span id="s436">[Laughs] So, uh, that puzzled me because we were not informed about the political situation in Europe; not at age, uh, 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">00:41:29 And we really had no -- I had no contact with the other passengers.</span> <span id="s438">Maybe the older children may have.</span> <span id="s439">Uh, most of the time, too, I stayed close to my sister.</span> <span id="s440">She was kind of my guardian angel and kept me out of trouble and told me not to climb the ladders and that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Interviewer: Do you remember who your bunkmate was or roommate was on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Robert Braun: Frankly, no, I don't.</span> <span id="s443">It was another boy -- I don't even know if there was another boy or three more boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">00:41:57 I don't remember if there were two or four in that particular cabin.</span> <span id="s445">It was so-called third class, but I thought it was real luxury because I couldn't get over ordering off a menu.</span> <span id="s446">That was just overwhelming.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Interviewer: Uh, and then, uh, when you first arrived at the camp, did you already know then that you and your sister were going to go to live with the Kraus'?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">00:42:27 Robert Braun: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s449">And after we kind of worried because every weekend, following a weekend when people would come out to look at the children and see them, you know, more and more would disappear.</span> <span id="s450">And pretty soon by the end of the summer, I think in September [unintelligible] we were the only ones left.</span> <span id="s451">And I said, "My God, nobody wants us.</span> <span id="s452">What's going to happen?"</span></p> <p><span id="s453">00:42:48 But, uh, I found out subsequently when my mother came to this -- with my father came to this country in, uh, 1947, she told me that when we were first interviewed by Mr. Kraus -- and Mrs. Kraus spoke to us, too, I guess, spoke to my parents -- they said, "We are going to take your children into our home, but do not tell them please, because they'll talk about it and the other kids will be jealous."</span> <span id="s454">So we never knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">00:43:17 I didn't know about it until 30 years later.</span> <span id="s456">No, no, until my parents -- my mother told us.</span> <span id="s457">Uh, I'm wrong; it was 1947, 1948 that I found that there was a previous arrangement.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Interviewer: Do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Robert Braun: Well, I suspect it was because they had two children, a boy and a girl, and the boy, Stephen, was about two years older than I. And the girl, little Ellen, was, uh, uh, two years younger than my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">00:43:49 And we shared bedrooms with them.</span> <span id="s461">I mean, we -- at the Kraus family's home we were treated identically with their own children.</span> <span id="s462">We got the same clothes.</span> <span id="s463">We went to the same school, a private school, Friends Select School; a wonderful school.</span> <span id="s464">Uh, all in all it was no difference in the, in the way they behaved towards us.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">00:44:20 I remember every, uh, every so often, maybe once a month Mr. Kraus would give each of the children, Stephen, Ellen, my sister and me a whole handful of nickels and we'd go to the automat and we could eat anything we wanted to.</span> <span id="s466">And I thought that was just the, the biggest thrill in the world to pick your own food and just have nothing but cake and pie.</span> <span id="s467">It was great.</span> <span id="s468">It was really a, a marvelous experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Interviewer: Steve and Ellen were pretty much the same age as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">00:45:03 Robert Braun: No, Ellen was two years younger than I, I think.</span> <span id="s471">And Stephen was one or two years older than my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Interviewer: And what do you remember about their reactions to the two of you showing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Robert Braun: They were very pleasant.</span> <span id="s474">I mean, uh, Stephen had other interests, you know.</span> <span id="s475">There's a big difference between an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">00:45:29 Uh, but I think, uh, Ellen and, and my sister -- she was called Hanni, H-A-N-N-I, not H-O-N-E-Y; short for Johanna -- uh, they seemed to get along very well like sisters, I think.</span> <span id="s477">And, uh, you know, we played board games together and, uh, went visiting other people together as a family.</span> <span id="s478">I remember at Christmastime, uh, it was traditional then, I guess, in, in their circle to visit other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">00:46:00 And, uh, usually the other people they visited would give the children some small gift.</span> <span id="s480">And I remember getting numerous Esterbrook fountain pens.</span> <span id="s481">[Laughs] They were all the rage.</span> <span id="s482">Uh, and the Kraus' were not religious.</span> <span id="s483">I mean, they celebrated Christmas, had Christmas trees, gave Christmas presents.</span> <span id="s484">Uh, nobody went to Hebrew school and, uh, that always interested me that -- [Crying].</span></p> <p><span id="s485">00:46:33 It's getting [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s486">Totally irreligious Jews did that.</span> <span id="s487">Even though various Jewish organizations, I subsequently found out from Mrs. Kraus and also from reading her memoir, opposed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">00:47:02 They said, "Don't do it.</span> <span id="s489">You're making trouble.</span> <span id="s490">You're going to call attention.</span> <span id="s491">We'll take care of it."</span> <span id="s492">But they went ahead on their own and they did it, together with B'rith Shalom Fraternity.</span> <span id="s493">And, uh, did a lot more than a lot of the Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s494">And it's, it's always impressed me that, uh, they on their own went ahead, even though they had absolutely no Jewish traditions at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">00:47:29 I think Mr. Kraus' family came to this country from Germany in around 1846 when there was a big exodus of Germans through the revolutions there.</span> <span id="s496">And I suspect that at that time from what I've read in history, uh, they were considered Germans, rather than Jews.</span> <span id="s497">And, I don't know, a lot of them went to New York.</span> <span id="s498">A lot of them went to Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s499">Some went down South.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Interviewer: And you lived with the Kraus' then for what, two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">00:47:58 Robert Braun: Two years, yes.</span> <span id="s502">And then it became obvious that the war was on and, uh, there wasn't going to be any possibility of parents coming.</span> <span id="s503">And so I don't know how the arrangements were made, but we were informed that my cousin Rudolph and his wife in Bridgeport, Connecticut would take over our care or live with them.</span> <span id="s504">He was, he was also a refugee.</span> <span id="s505">He was a doctor in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">00:48:25 And he came here a year before we did because he was -- he had a, a, he had, he had some relatives here that got him an affidavit.</span> <span id="s507">And he was doing quite well by that time because, uh, he was practicing medicine and had a pretty good income as a result.</span> <span id="s508">And so we moved in and lived with them.</span> <span id="s509">Uh, uh, it was a big difference, a big difference.</span> <span id="s510">No chauffer to take us to school.</span> <span id="s511">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s512">00:48:57 I remember one time, uh, I went to [Friends] Select School, which was an unbelievably great school.</span> <span id="s513">They, they even, uh, had a special young teacher stay with us after school to teach us English for an hour everyday.</span> <span id="s514">Uh, but at one time -- you know, we got all American clothes, of course, but I still had my old leather pants with me.</span> <span id="s515">And one time, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s516">I don't know, maybe I couldn't find my -- those awful corduroy knickers that everybody wore that went brup-brup when you walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">00:49:30 So I put my leather pants on.</span> <span id="s518">I didn't think anything of it and went to school.</span> <span id="s519">And apparently, uh, Mrs. Kraus got a phone call from the school, "Robert has inappropriate attire."</span> <span id="s520">So the chauffer came and picked me up and I went home and I changed my clothes and went back to school.</span> <span id="s521">But I still have those pants in my bottom drawer.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">[Director's comments] Interviewer: Bob, you mentioned going to Friends Select for, I guess, a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">00:50:40 Robert Braun: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Interviewer: Two years.</span> <span id="s525">Why was that school such a great school?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Robert Braun: Well, it was altogether different from the Austrian schools I went to.</span> <span id="s527">Austrian schools are strictly dictatorial.</span> <span id="s528">I learned my multiplication table by holding my hands up like this, backside up in front of the class.</span> <span id="s529">And the teacher stood there with a 30 centimeter ruler and you recited it.</span> <span id="s530">And if you made a mistake, whack across the knuckles.</span> <span id="s531">And to this day I can do mental arithmetic faster than an adding machine, but I have to do it in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">00:51:11 I have to think in German.</span> <span id="s533">Uh, it was not fun.</span> <span id="s534">I mean, facts you learned, but not much else.</span> <span id="s535">But Friends Select was just, uh, uh, pleasant.</span> <span id="s536">You looked forward to going to school everyday.</span> <span id="s537">The teachers were pleasant.</span> <span id="s538">Uh, I was impressed by once a month we went to meeting and sat in silence.</span> <span id="s539">Occasionally, one of the bona fide Quakers would stand up -- excuse me, Friends would stand up and say a few words, sit down again.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">00:51:40 There was no one in front, uh, and then we went home.</span> <span id="s541">Uh, not home; went back to school.</span> <span id="s542">Uh, it was simply extremely pleasant.</span> <span id="s543">And the, the teaching was easy.</span> <span id="s544">I mean, there was -- it was a friendly atmosphere.</span> <span id="s545">And it was easy for my sister and myself because the, the dictatorial part, the memory part of teaching of school in, in Austria was much advanced than here.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">00:52:09 So we were way ahead in math and geography and things of that sort that were taught in both places.</span> <span id="s547">And the other ones, the teachers helped us quite a bit with the English language, composition.</span> <span id="s548">Writing we were superb in because the kids here don't write, they scribble.</span> <span id="s549">And again, if you didn't write exactly the right way, you got whacked in, in, uh, Vienna.</span> <span id="s550">So I loved the school and my sister did, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">00:52:38 Oh, and they, they had plays.</span> <span id="s552">Nobody ever heard of kids putting on plays and operettas in a public school in Vienna.</span> <span id="s553">That was considered frivolous.</span> <span id="s554">It wasn't -- didn't happen.</span> <span id="s555">I remember my sister Johanna's class put on, uh, Hansel and Gretel and, uh, she, of course, had to play Gretel.</span> <span id="s556">And, uh, that went off very well.</span> <span id="s557">I don't remember what play I was in.</span> <span id="s558">Anyway, it was a delight, that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Interviewer: It sounds as if you acclimated yourself culturally to life in America fairly quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">00:53:19 Robert Braun: I think so.</span> <span id="s561">I really do.</span> <span id="s562">I've never had a problem of not feeling at home.</span> <span id="s563">But I think there is something else behind it, too.</span> <span id="s564">Uh, when I got older and I realized that I was rejected by my home country, I decided well, I'm going to be 110 percent American.</span> <span id="s565">And I did.</span> <span id="s566">I joined the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s567">Uh, I got enough merit badges for an Eagle Scout, but I didn't get Eagle Scout.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">00:53:50 And the reason why is because my cousin Rudolph that I lived with was too busy.</span> <span id="s569">I never went to Hebrew school or attended temple or anything else.</span> <span id="s570">But technically, I guess his family was a member of a conservative synagogue in Bridgeport and, uh, when it came time for me to get my Eagle badge -- I guess I was 15 at the time -- I had to have a letter from your minister attesting to your good moral character.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">00:54:18 So I went back to the Rabbi at that particular synagogue that he was technically a member of and I asked him for the letter.</span> <span id="s572">Now, I had joined a Boy Scout troop sponsored by the First Methodist Church in Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s573">The reason was that my first friend in Bridgeport when I went to school here was a kid who belonged to that troop.</span> <span id="s574">And he said, "Hey, why don't you come down to a meeting."</span> <span id="s575">So I did.</span> <span id="s576">And there were a lot of Jews, Catholics, Protestants in that troop.</span> <span id="s577">It was interdenominational.</span> <span id="s578">It was just sponsored by that church.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">00:54:48 So I joined that Troop 46.</span> <span id="s580">When it came time three years later to get that letter, I went back to the Rabbi at that temple on Hancock Avenue in Bridgeport and he said, "What troop do you belong to?"</span> <span id="s581">I said, "Troop 46, the First Methodist Church."</span> <span id="s582">He said, "Why didn't you join our troop?"</span> <span id="s583">They had one there, too.</span> <span id="s584">And I said, "Well, you know, I made a friend there and one thing led to another."</span> <span id="s585">He said, "Why don't you go ask the minister for a letter."</span></p> <p><span id="s586">00:55:15 I was just -- [Crying] -- that son-of-a-bitch.</span> <span id="s587">It didn't do much for my religious convictions.</span> <span id="s588">Anyway, so I never got Eagle Scout.</span> <span id="s589">I was too embarrassed to go to the Reverend [Alderson], the minister for a letter, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">00:55:42 As a matter of fact, many years later I had his, some of his children as patients, or grandchildren, rather.</span> <span id="s591">But I digress.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Interviewer: Bob, when did you graduate high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Robert Braun: 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Interviewer: The war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Robert Braun: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Interviewer: While the time the war was on, of course, you were still too young to -- Robert Braun: Well, I tried.</span> <span id="s597">In, uh, June 6, 1944 we learned of the landing.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">00:56:14 And I had the idea well, it's a landing, [unintelligible] landing [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s599">It must be the Marines.</span> <span id="s600">So I was determined, I think for revenge more than anything else, to join.</span> <span id="s601">And I hitchhiked to New Haven where there was a big Navy recruiting station because they wouldn’t possibly know me and I had heard or knew that at age 17 you could enlist in the Marines if you got your parents' signature.</span> <span id="s602">So I went there and I figured, you know, I'll forge my cousin's signature; no problem, and I tried to enlist.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">00:56:44 And they looked at me and they laughed and they said, "Come back when you're shaving."</span> <span id="s604">[Laughs] I was really crushed, absolutely crushed.</span> <span id="s605">But that's what happened, so I didn't get in.</span> <span id="s606">But then I applied for the -- when I finally, uh, uh, got through dental school, uh, I didn't want to be a dentist.</span> <span id="s607">So I got a job with the National Park Service and I worked -- I had worked there one summer before already and I was stationed at Yellowstone Park.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">00:57:18 And then some much later in the fall I got a letter from the War Department; report to Fort Sam Houston, Texas December 31st.</span> <span id="s609">So off I went into the Army as a dentist.</span> <span id="s610">I tried hard to get out of the Dental Corp, but, uh, they said, "No."</span> <span id="s611">Uh, by that time I had a good girlfriend, my present wife, who was in the Army Nurse Corp and she ended up being stationed at, uh, Fort Benning, Georgia, which was the jump school for the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">00:57:52 And I was in Korea right on the front line in the medical company, 15th Can-Do Regiment and I found out that the Airborne needed doctors and dentists, because in the Airborne Division everybody jumps, no matter who; general down to private.</span> <span id="s613">So I applied for jump school and I figured I'll get to Fort Benning.</span> <span id="s614">So they accepted me and I filled out the forms and just before I finally committed it, I had learned that that's fine, but when you complete jump school you're still going to have to do another two years in the [war].</span> <span id="s615">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s616">00:58:25 I got my papers back so I didn't go to jump school.</span> <span id="s617">But I digress again; sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Interviewer: I want to ask you a couple of questions about your parents during the war years.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Interviewer: Starting with did you have any word from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Robert Braun: Well, at first there was correspondence through the mails.</span> <span id="s622">The letters were censored, the ones that came from Austria -- or from Germany rather by then.</span> <span id="s623">They were opened by a German censor and then sealed again.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">00:58:54 However, my parents never wrote anything that needed censing.</span> <span id="s625">Nothing was ever erased or cut out.</span> <span id="s626">But they did have a censored sticker on the outside.</span> <span id="s627">And then, of course, uh, when, uh -- it got poorer and poorer and then, of course, Germany declared war on the United States, uh, right after Pearl Harbor and that was the end of the postal.</span> <span id="s628">And then we had no more contact whatsoever; none, zilch.</span> <span id="s629">The Red Cross claims that they could get word through to people; 25 words, I think, once every three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">00:59:27 So I used to bicycle out to the Red Cross headquarters in Bridgeport and give them my 25 words and they'd demand a contribution.</span> <span id="s631">At that time I was making, I think, $4.00 a week on my paper route and I gave them a dollar.</span> <span id="s632">But my parents never got a message.</span> <span id="s633">The first word we heard from them that they survived was before the Russians occupied Vienna, they apparently somehow ran into an Italian Army deserter and they gave him a brief note and he said he was going to get through the lines somehow back home to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">01:00:00 And he actually mailed that letter to us.</span> <span id="s635">And that's how we found out before Vienna was liberated that, uh, my parents were alive.</span> <span id="s636">Until then we didn't know.</span> <span id="s637">We could only assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Interviewer: Please tell me the circumstances under which your parents then made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Robert Braun: Well, then they waited for two years until my sister turned 21 in, in 19, uh, 40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s640">01:00:29 well she was born in, in -- oh, let me think, uh, 1926, so 1947.</span> <span id="s641">She was able to write out an affidavit and claimed enough adequate income.</span> <span id="s642">She was working for my cousin after school and nights earning some money in his office and she filed the affidavit and they were able to come then.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">01:01:02 They finally got here Christmas Day 1947.</span> <span id="s644">And, uh, that was nine years later after we saw them.</span> <span id="s645">And it was remarkable.</span> <span id="s646">I recognized them, of course, but they were so small.</span> <span id="s647">Uh, it was strange.</span> <span id="s648">Uh, but it was interesting because my mother lived on to 102.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">01:01:29 And, uh, every lunch I'd take my lunch from my office on Stratford Road and Fairfield down to where she lived with my sister, which was only a few blocks away and I'd have lunch there.</span> <span id="s650">And she'd talk about her experiences during those nine years.</span> <span id="s651">And if you ever read a book by [Otto] Klemperer called This I Remember, two volumes, he similarly was a mixed marriage in Dresden and he went through everything my parents went through.</span> <span id="s652">His wife was a, a convert.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">01:01:58 And the stories she told me were identical to those two volumes.</span> <span id="s654">I have them here on the shelf.</span> <span id="s655">Uh, fascinating about what went on in their apartment building.</span> <span id="s656">The neighbors, the air raid shelter in the cellar where they weren't allowed to go into the proper place, but had to sit somewhere else during the air raids.</span> <span id="s657">And then one day a, a police inspector came to check up on air raids, air raid shelters and he said, "You people are crazy.</span> <span id="s658">This is the best place to be," where my parents were.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">01:02:27 But they wouldn't let them into the other one.</span> <span id="s660">So they all packed up and then they all sat together after that.</span> <span id="s661">And once the bombs started falling and the Russians got closer, people got a lot friendlier, very friendly.</span> <span id="s662">She had some interesting adventures, but you don't want to hear that.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Interviewer: Not that she necessarily would have, but given the fact that your mother was a certified Aryan --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Interviewer: Could she have left Vienna at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Robert Braun: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">01:02:55 Well, yeah, she could have moved to Germany, but she couldn’t come to the United States because somebody in the United States had to -- besides, once the war started that was the end of immigration.</span> <span id="s668">And, uh, uh, yeah.</span> <span id="s669">As a matter of fact, unfortunately there were many, many instances where the, the Aryan partner in a mixed marriage would simply go to a local police station and says, "That Jew has been living with me," and he'd disappear within two hours.</span> <span id="s670">And unfortunately, it did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">01:03:24 Again, you can get a detailed history of that from Klemperer's two volumes in Dresden.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Interviewer: When your parents did arrive on Christmas Day 1947, where did you first see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Robert Braun: In Hoboken.</span> <span id="s674">They landed -- their ship landed in Hoboken.</span> <span id="s675">I think they came on a freighter.</span> <span id="s676">I remember we bought the ship's tickets for them.</span> <span id="s677">No, no, it was a regular passage ship because I remember my mother said she never ate so much in her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">01:03:53 And she put on, I don't know, 10 kilograms on that long voyage across the Atlantic.</span> <span id="s679">And, uh, then we went back, drove into Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s680">My brother-in-law -- my sister was married by that time -- drove us and, uh, my parents lived with them in an apartment that they rented.</span> <span id="s681">And technically I lived there, too, but I was never -- you know, I really didn't -- once I got out of high school I didn't spend any time home.</span> <span id="s682">I worked in the summertime at a resort hotel.</span> <span id="s683">In the winter I was away at school.</span> <span id="s684">I was pretty much self-supporting.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Interviewer: What was your contact like with the Kraus' in those first few years after you moved in with your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">01:04:30 Robert Braun: We had contact with them.</span> <span id="s687">We went to visit them, even after, you know -- uh, especially at Christmas we visited them and, uh, we made the rounds of their friends and we got more Esterbrook pens.</span> <span id="s688">[Laughs] And, uh, we felt like, uh, you know, I suppose kids feel away at a college going home.</span> <span id="s689">It was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s690">And in the summertime, uh, we visited at Harvey Cedars on Long Beach Island.</span> <span id="s691">They had a wonderful summer home there right on the beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">01:05:00 Uh, it was like family.</span> <span id="s693">And it gradually petered out, you know, slowly.</span> <span id="s694">I mean, everybody got older.</span> <span id="s695">We got other interests.</span> <span id="s696">I saw them occasionally when I went to dental school in Philadelphia at temple.</span> <span id="s697">I remember once, uh, Mr. Kraus took me to see the, uh, farm he bought in Bucks County in Doylestown, where he was going to raise purebred cattle.</span> <span id="s698">And he was a fascinating man.</span> <span id="s699">He was really fascinating.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">01:05:30 He was an expert, a wonderful piano player, a superb musician, artist, athlete.</span> <span id="s701">The other interesting thing I noticed about the Kraus' when we went to visit them after the war started, they were absolutely rigid about rationing.</span> <span id="s702">Now, Mr. Kraus was a very prominent person.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">01:06:00 He had a lot of influence and connections and so on.</span> <span id="s704">He could have gotten anything he needed; gasoline, sugar, you name it.</span> <span id="s705">Not an ounce, never, which was quite different from some of my relatives in Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s706">But I was impressed.</span> <span id="s707">It was, uh, strictly a matter of honor.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Interviewer: It's interesting you raise that Bob, because not long ago Liz found the family's ration cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">01:06:32 Robert Braun: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Interviewer: She has the ration cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Robert Braun: That's fascinating.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Interviewer: And I have to say until you just mentioned this, I could never understand why they had ration cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Robert Braun: Believe me, people in his position -- well they were issued ration cards, but they didn't bother using them.</span> <span id="s714">I mean, uh, you know, people who had influence unfortunately used their influence.</span> <span id="s715">And he certainly had influence.</span> <span id="s716">I mean, somebody who can get, uh, 50 visas from the State Department has influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">01:06:59 Nothing; I mean, whatever -- it was strictly according to the ration laws.</span> <span id="s718">We were there some several days and, you know, we knew what was going on, saw what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Interviewer: Did Mr. Kraus ever tell you at any point the story of how he got these visas?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Robert Braun: No.</span> <span id="s721">The best indication I got was from a newspaper article written by an investigative reporter.</span> <span id="s722">I sent a copy.</span> <span id="s723">And he theorized that Mr. Kraus was a law school classmate of Biddle, uh, Francis Biddle.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">01:07:33 And I think he subsequently -- he was high up in the Administration and close to Roosevelt and subsequently became Attorney General, I think.</span> <span id="s725">And he thinks that somehow -- they weren't extra visas.</span> <span id="s726">They were ones that simply hadn't been used.</span> <span id="s727">They had been issued and charged against the quota, but not used.</span> <span id="s728">But nobody ever told us exactly for sure.</span> <span id="s729">Mr. Kraus didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Interviewer: Along those similar lines I'm also interested in the years that followed this episode and the war, was this something that he and his wife talked about much in your recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">01:08:16 Robert Braun: Not really, no, no.</span> <span id="s732">They, uh -- well I didn't have a chance to talk with him very much because if we visited he was busy.</span> <span id="s733">Mrs. Kraus was home.</span> <span id="s734">And subsequently when she was widowed, she would talk about it, but she considered it more like a, a kind of a pleasant, nice interlude, you know.</span> <span id="s735">Nice and, and emotionally satisfying.</span> <span id="s736">But, uh, I think that was her main attitude towards the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">01:08:44 It was a pleasant, good experience.</span> <span id="s738">And I'm sorry she never completed her memoirs.</span> <span id="s739">It ends rather abruptly and, uh, it's a pity somebody didn't interview her.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Interviewer: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Interviewer: There's a paucity of accounts directly from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Robert Braun: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Interviewer: Other than -- Robert Braun: Well, they didn't brag about it.</span> <span id="s745">They didn't talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">01:19:13 You know, they considered it something natural that you didn't wear on your sleeve.</span> <span id="s747">They were -- [Crying].</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Interviewer: And as the years passed I know that your interactions with them tailed off a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Robert Braun: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s750">It was more and more time between visits and so on.</span> <span id="s751">And then unfortunately, Mrs. Kraus went to a, a home in West Chester County.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">01:09:44 She sold her apartment and moved out.</span> <span id="s753">It was a beautiful apartment right near Rittenhouse Square.</span> <span id="s754">And, uh, that's when she turned over her scrapbooks to us, which I have out there, because she couldn't take them with her to this home.</span> <span id="s755">And I think she as very unhappy in that home.</span> <span id="s756">We visited her, my sister.</span> <span id="s757">I drove.</span> <span id="s758">It seems to me it was in White Plains, but I'm not certain.</span> <span id="s759">And, uh, I think she was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s760">She cried sometimes.</span> <span id="s761">She was going blind.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">01:10:15 Her teeth were in terrible shape and I tried to talk to the home and they said, "Well, no we can't do anything.</span> <span id="s763">You know, we can't take her to a dentist."</span> <span id="s764">And it was very sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Interviewer: She was a very cultured woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Robert Braun: Yeah, extremely.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Interviewer: My wife tells me that not formally educated, but very, very cultured.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Robert Braun: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s769">Well, they moved in very cultured circles, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">01:10:44 Memorized culture isn't the same as the one you acquire by living.</span> <span id="s771">Uh, they had, uh, a large circle of friends.</span> <span id="s772">They went out every Thursday night visiting.</span> <span id="s773">And Thursday nights in Philadelphia, uh, uh, their children's childhood nurse came to stay with us and she always cooked the same thing.</span> <span id="s774">We always had lamb chops and spinach.</span> <span id="s775">[Laughs] And I hated the spinach.</span> <span id="s776">[Laughs] And Stephen would eat my spinach for me.</span> <span id="s777">He also loved milk and I couldn't stand milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">01:11:15 We never drank milk in Vienna.</span> <span id="s779">So at the dinner table I must admit we cheated a little bit.</span> <span id="s780">When nobody was looking I'd slide my milk glass to him and he's slide his empty one to me.</span> <span id="s781">And he drank milk and I didn't.</span> <span id="s782">The other impressive thing about the dining, I mean, I said, "Well that's how Americans live."</span> <span id="s783">You know, there was a butler who comes in and waits on you individually.</span> <span id="s784">And what always puzzled me is how does he know when to come in?</span> <span id="s785">And once I figured it out.</span> <span id="s786">I saw Mrs. Kraus move her foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">01:11:44 And then later that night I sneaked in the dining room and I felt around and there was a little bump under the rug, the bell.</span> <span id="s788">[Laughs] Interviewer: I have to say, I didn't quite realize that they lived at that high a level.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Robert Braun: Well, there was a cook fulltime and her husband, or presumably her husband, a black couple.</span> <span id="s790">And they lived on the third floor in a room in that house on 2125 [Cypress] Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">01:12:10 And he drove Mr. Kraus to work and he drove, uh, on errands and he did the housecleaning and so did the cook.</span> <span id="s792">And, uh, Mrs. Kraus did the shopping every day.</span> <span id="s793">And then, uh, the cook would prepare everything.</span> <span id="s794">No, we considered well, that's how Americans live, you know.</span> <span id="s795">This is -- after all, that's all we knew.</span> <span id="s796">You know, we went to Friends Select School, which was very genteel.</span> <span id="s797">And, uh, at home, what we considered home, that's how people lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">01:12:41 And the people we visited and we, they knew lived in a similar way.</span> <span id="s799">As I said, we went to school driven by the chauffer and picked up by the chauffer; 17th on the Parkway in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s800">So it was an abrupt change when we moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s801">Oh boy, I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Interviewer: No more chauffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Robert Braun: No.</span> <span id="s804">I quickly got a paper route.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">01:13:12 Yeah, it was a very interesting and formative experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Interviewer: Did you stay in touch with the family, with Steve and with --?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Robert Braun: Not very much, no.</span> <span id="s808">Well, I did again with, uh -- no, no, because unfortunately, young Ellen died in her 20s and left a baby.</span> <span id="s809">And that, uh, was kind of -- and Stephen moved away.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">01:13:40 We went to his wedding.</span> <span id="s811">That's right, I remember, in New York.</span> <span id="s812">He married a girl, a woman -- I don't know if he's still married or not -- anyway, named [Strauss], right?</span> <span id="s813">And, uh, they lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s814">I think it was a penthouse on a huge skyscraper in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s815">And there was a private express elevator up there and my sister and her husband, Sidney, and I were invited and we went.</span> <span id="s816">And it was a very nice reception, pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">01:14:11 Uh, and then unfortunately, brother-in-law Sidney did not -- couldn't tolerate alcohol very much.</span> <span id="s818">Even though he spent three years fighting in the Army in Europe and so went through all the campaigns and got a bronze star, nonetheless he drank a little too much and he got sick in the elevator going down.</span> <span id="s819">And it was a high speed elevator and he turned green and I heard strange noises.</span> <span id="s820">And it was an elevator operated by a man, a person, an elevator operator.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">01:14:40 And he stood there with his back to us and we're in the back and my sister panicked I could see.</span> <span id="s822">Sidney took his hat off and used it and we marched out through the lobby and there was a wastebasket and he dropped it.</span> <span id="s823">[Laughs] That's my memory of Stephen's wedding.</span> <span id="s824">You don't have to include that.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Interviewer: I can tell you that they're still married.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Robert Braun: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Interviewer: In fact, Sue, his wife, was just visiting with us in San Francisco.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">01:15:10 Robert Braun: Oh, really?</span> <span id="s829">Good, nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Interviewer: Sue Strauss became Sue Strauss Kraus.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Robert Braun: That's a mouthful.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Interviewer: It sure is.</span> <span id="s833">She's a terrific woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span> <span id="s835">I, of course, don't remember anything about her.</span> <span id="s836">She was the bride and there were a lot of people there and it's the only time we ever met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Interviewer: I have to ask, because we're now talking a little bit about my wife.</span> <span id="s838">You did know Liz when she was growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">01:15:39 Robert Braun: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">Because when she got to be about 11 or 12 or so, uh, her father brought her here.</span> <span id="s841">They lived in Rowayton, which is part of Norwalk not far from here.</span> <span id="s842">He brought her here for her braces and I took care of her braces for her.</span> <span id="s843">I don't know if she remembers it, but, uh, I saw her -- about once a month we saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Interviewer: She still has the teeth to prove it.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Robert Braun: Are they holding up?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Interviewer: They sure are.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">01:16:09 Robert Braun: Are you sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Interviewer: I'm quite sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Robert Braun: I'm always worried to see ex-patients.</span> <span id="s850">Sometimes I see them in the line at the supermarket.</span> <span id="s851">Some post-middle-aged woman says, "Oh, look, look," and she shows me her teeth.</span> <span id="s852">I have to check them out, you know, and hold up the line.</span> <span id="s853">[Laughs] And the girl at the register gets goggle-eyed.</span> <span id="s854">[Laughs] Oh, well.</span> <span id="s855">But I digress once more.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Interviewer: And this is the part where the film gets very personal for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Robert Braun: Uh-huh, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Interviewer: I didn't know Gill or Ellen.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">01:16:40 Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Interviewer: They were long gone by the time Liz and I met.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Interviewer: But, of course, Liz has told me all of these stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Robert Braun: There is a certain amount of Greek tragedy to that family.</span> <span id="s864">You know, Gill had a very sad end.</span> <span id="s865">He had a severe brain disease that's related to that, that prion caused mad cow disease; awful.</span> <span id="s866">I didn't see him then.</span> <span id="s867">He was in an institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">01:17:06 And Eleanor became blind; was lonesome, sad.</span> <span id="s869">Her daughter died young.</span> <span id="s870">There ain't no justice, you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Interviewer: I know that we've been talking about this now for a couple hours, but why do you think they did what they did?</span> <span id="s872">Why do you think the Kraus' did what they did?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">01:17:45 Robert Braun: I think about it a lot.</span> <span id="s874">I think they were just plain, decent people.</span> <span id="s875">And they felt they have some power, they have some influence and they should use it and they did it.</span> <span id="s876">I mean, why did the B'rith Shalom spend all that money, I mean, to ship tickets?</span> <span id="s877">Feeding kids, 50 kids for two months, perhaps?</span> <span id="s878">Hiring people?</span> <span id="s879">You know, and without publicity.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">01:18:14 And some of these organizations -- that's why I'm rather down on professional organizations like the Shoah Foundation.</span> <span id="s881">I'll give you a piece of my mind about them if you want to hear it.</span> <span id="s882">But, uh, they talked a lot.</span> <span id="s883">They do a lot of fundraising.</span> <span id="s884">They send out endless literature, but they don't do anything.</span> <span id="s885">Or what they do is minute, miniscule and, and they toot their horn.</span> <span id="s886">And people like Eleanor and Gilbert do something and B'rith Shalom does something.</span> <span id="s887">Whoever heard of B'rith Shalom?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">01:18:43 As a matter of fact, one of the clippings in Mrs. Kraus', uh, scrapbook is an article pointing out that -- or something written about, about, uh -- what's that other big Jewish organization?</span> <span id="s889">B'rith, uh, B'nai B'rith brought 50 Jewish children here.</span> <span id="s890">And so fortunately, somebody wrote an article -- I don't know how much circulation it got -- saying, "No, it's wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">01:19:11 It's not B'rith Shalom" -- "It's not B'nai" -- whatever, the other one, which is a big organization well financed, very prominent.</span> <span id="s892">I often wonder why that happens.</span> <span id="s893">Individual people make a big difference.</span> <span id="s894">Well, I think I learned that from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">01:19:44 Uh, yeah, those two years did me a lot of good.</span> <span id="s896">They, uh -- it felt real good when I worked at Yellowstone and was able to do things without getting paid for it.</span> <span id="s897">Well -- Interviewer: Let me ask you just a couple of questions about your sister, Bob.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">01:20:19 Robert Braun: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Interviewer: Because I don't know much about what she did in her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span> <span id="s901">Well, excuse me; I've got to blow my nose.</span> <span id="s902">Honk.</span> <span id="s903">[Laughter] Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Interviewer: We won't include that either, don't worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Robert Braun: I don't care.</span> <span id="s906">Include it.</span> <span id="s907">At this age, at this age there's a saying, "I hope I live long enough to embarrass my children."</span> <span id="s908">Be that as it may, my sister being a middle child in the family was the one who was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">01:20:50 She was the nicest person I ever knew.</span> <span id="s910">She -- you couldn't insult her.</span> <span id="s911">She forgave everybody anything.</span> <span id="s912">She wasn’t vindictive like I am.</span> <span id="s913">Uh, I think she would have forgiven the Nazis even, if she'd had a chance.</span> <span id="s914">Uh, but she worked very hard.</span> <span id="s915">She worked, uh, all the time she was in high school, living in Bridgeport, in my cousin's office until maybe 10 o'clock at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">01:21:13 And then she went to pharmacy school and did all her studying on the train going to New Haven where the school was located.</span> <span id="s917">And she, uh, worked again in my cousin's office afternoon and evening.</span> <span id="s918">He had evening hours.</span> <span id="s919">And then, uh, she married a fellow student, Sidney [Gitlin], who was a war hero.</span> <span id="s920">He was in, in the European combat.</span> <span id="s921">He was a medic.</span> <span id="s922">He rescued wounded under fire, being [unintelligible] by American Air Corp planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">01:21:45 And he ran out and pulled them free and got them out and he got a bronze star for that.</span> <span id="s924">The one with the V on it, not the M.</span> <span id="s925">You know, there are two kinds of bronze stars.</span> <span id="s926">And, uh, she had three children.</span> <span id="s927">The oldest one is, uh, Lois.</span> <span id="s928">She became a physician.</span> <span id="s929">The second one is Ellen.</span> <span id="s930">She became a Ph.D in geology.</span> <span id="s931">And she, incidentally, was named after Ellen.</span> <span id="s932">And, uh, the youngest one is Jane who lives here in Fairfield and she's an architect.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">01:22:15 And, uh, Ellen has this fabulous porcelain statute.</span> <span id="s934">I have a photograph of it.</span> <span id="s935">And the reason she has it is because my sister named her after Ellen Kraus.</span> <span id="s936">And that was the porcelain figurine that the 50 par -- 50 sets of parents of those children bought in Vienna and gave to Mrs. Kraus as a gift.</span> <span id="s937">I think you have a picture of it and a little card that goes with it.</span> <span id="s938">Uh, and all those -- all her children, they have grandchildren, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">01:22:46 So that's why there's so many picture -- so many people in that Fourth of July picnic picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Interviewer: And the oldest sibling who --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Robert Braun: Martha.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">[Director's comments] Interviewer: I want to make sure I have the family story.</span> <span id="s943">The oldest sibling who --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">01:23:36 Robert Braun: Martha.</span> <span id="s945">She was three years old -- five years older than me and she went to Israel to British Mandate of Palestine with a youth group and they founded a kibbutz there called Kfar Blum in Galilee.</span> <span id="s946">And, uh, she eventually married a fellow [kibbutznick] there.</span> <span id="s947">And they were involved in the '48 war with the Arabs and, you know, some of the subsequent ones.</span> <span id="s948">And she's a totally different personality, much more forceful than my sister, Johanna.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">01:24:08 And eventually I think, uh, after my parents came here, but I think after my father died she moved with her family to the United States and he went to the University of Connecticut and got a doctors degree in civil engineering; the first one that the University ever offered, as a matter of fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">01:24:34 And he subsequently started, uh, together with another man a, uh, civil engineering firm in Auburn in New York.</span> <span id="s951">And eventually they sold that and he went to work for the Bureau of Standards in Washington.</span> <span id="s952">And that's where he was until he retired and eventually passed away a few years ago.</span> <span id="s953">They have three children, two of them doctors.</span> <span id="s954">The third one -- what was the third one?</span> <span id="s955">Oh, he's also an architect.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Interviewer: Your father passed away when, Bob?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">01:25:11 Robert Braun: Uh, at age 76 and that would be -- again, he was born 1879.</span> <span id="s958">Whatever year that -- I can't remember the exact year.</span> <span id="s959">It's not in my mind.</span> <span id="s960">But, uh, he passed away here in, in Bridgeport, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s961">And, uh, as I say, my mother eventually in the last couple of years she couldn't stay at my sister's home anymore and she went to the Jewish home for the elderly.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">01:25:41 And she died there just before her 102nd birthday.</span> <span id="s963">But her mind was clear until the last year or two.</span> <span id="s964">So she had a lot to remember and a lot to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Interviewer: Remarkable.</span> <span id="s966">I'm pretty much out of questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Robert Braun: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Interviewer: I'm going to ask if there is anything in particular you want to mention that I didn't quite get around to asking you.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">01:26:12 Robert Braun: Well, I used to sneak into Mr. Kraus' bedroom when we lived there in, uh, the first two years here, because at one time he used to go big game hunting in Alaska.</span> <span id="s970">And he had oh, three or four massive rifles leaning in the corner of the bedroom in cases, zipper cases.</span> <span id="s971">And when nobody was looking I'd go in there and I'd unzip them and I'd play with them.</span> <span id="s972">Nobody ever found out.</span> <span id="s973">This is the first time anyone knows.</span> <span id="s974">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s975">01:26:43 But, uh, that was kind of fun.</span> <span id="s976">Uh, well, there are endless things you could talk about, but, uh, I don't know if anything is significant.</span> <span id="s977">All I can say is that I'm sure that my personality was molded by the Kraus' and my own parents, too.</span> <span id="s978">Because my mother was a -- my father was a happy guy.</span> <span id="s979">He told stories, he entertained people, he knew a million and one jokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">01:27:13 And my mother was, uh, the mathematician and kept things in order.</span> <span id="s981">She also sang all the time.</span> <span id="s982">She used to sing endless Viennese songs.</span> <span id="s983">You know, some of the ribald, some of the humorous.</span> <span id="s984">And she knew them all and she had a very, very good voice.</span> <span id="s985">She could hit -- she was precisely on tune and she had the ability when there was any, anyone else singing she could harmonize automatically.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">01:27:40 And, uh, the last, uh -- we took this voyage down the Danube on one of these [unintelligible] cruises and the ship's doctors were a couple from Austria, two Austrian physicians considerably younger than I. And, uh, so eventually I got to know them and they seemed -- you know, as I said, I don't blame the children for the sins of their parents, so we got fairly chummy.</span> <span id="s987">And they were fascinated because I used to sing these songs to them that I remember from when I was a kid and heard my mother singing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">01:28:11 And they never heard them.</span> <span id="s989">They didn't know they existed.</span> <span id="s990">It went out of style.</span> <span id="s991">And they kept egging me on to sing more and more of them.</span> <span id="s992">And if they had had a dictating machine they would have taken them down.</span> <span id="s993">Some of them were a little on the shady side, which amused them no end.</span> <span id="s994">Well, I could, I could ramble on for a few hours if you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Interviewer: Well, I'll tell you there was something I wanted to ask you and you just reminded me of it with your reference to the trip down the Danube.</span> <span id="s996">You did return to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">01:28:40 Robert Braun: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Interviewer: Tell me a little bit about what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Robert Braun: Well, I'll tell you.</span> <span id="s1000">One interesting -- we went back and we -- my mother, not having been Jewish, she has a nephew still living there and she -- when they left Vienna in 1947 they turned their apartment over to her brother, who is much younger than she, uh, 30 years younger.</span> <span id="s1001">She kind of raised him.</span> <span id="s1002">And, uh, he lived in that apartment with his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">01:29:08 And they had a child and that son, who is named Robert after me for some strange reason, still lives in that apartment.</span> <span id="s1004">And, uh, so we went to visit him.</span> <span id="s1005">But he has some interesting problems.</span> <span id="s1006">He believes in the unemployment policy and getting unemployment compensation, which he takes full advantage of.</span> <span id="s1007">So we visited with him and, uh, it was still the same, except it was filled up with odds and ends.</span> <span id="s1008">Now I forgot the question you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Interviewer: You were recollecting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">01:29:39 Robert Braun: Oh, I went -- oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1011">Okay.</span> <span id="s1012">Then, of course, I wanted, wanted to go see my father's old place of business, the wine cellar.</span> <span id="s1013">And it is now the Viennese Clock Museum, former clock museum operated by the City of Vienna.</span> <span id="s1014">It's a two-story building.</span> <span id="s1015">He had a -- before he was married he had a small apartment on the second floor and his office, uh, where his desk and telephone were on the ground floor in a small part of this, but the whole building is now the clock museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">01:30:06 And the cellar, the catacombs where he stored wine and so on had a very steep wooden stairway going down to it and a trap door and that was below.</span> <span id="s1017">So when I went to the, uh, clock museum I said, "You know, many years ago my father had a wine" -- I said, "How long has this been a clock museum?"</span> <span id="s1018">He said, "Always."</span> <span id="s1019">I said, "Well, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1020">You know, before a certain year my father had a wine business here and there was a cellar underneath formed out of the old catacombs where he stored wine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">01:30:37 And do you think I could possibly go down to look at it just to see what I remember as a child?"</span> <span id="s1022">He said, "Well, it's locked and the guy who has the key isn't here and you have to get, you have to get permission."</span> <span id="s1023">I said, "How can I get permission to go down there?"</span> <span id="s1024">She said, "Well, you have to call the director of the Vienna museums."</span> <span id="s1025">There's a chain of, I don't know, seven or eight different small museums scattered all over Vienna and, uh, one director for all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">01:31:04 A big shot because after all there must be 40, 50 people working in these museums and it's a major establishment.</span> <span id="s1027">And I said, "Well how can I reach him?"</span> <span id="s1028">"I will give you his telephone number and you call him up exactly 12 o'clock tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1029">Precisely 12 o'clock and he'll be available and we'll get him on the phone and you can talk to him about getting permission to go into the cellar."</span> <span id="s1030">So we'll see how that turns out.</span> <span id="s1031">So sure enough, the next day I telephoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">01:31:33 On the first ring the head director picked it up.</span> <span id="s1033">He was sitting there waiting for the call.</span> <span id="s1034">And he knew all about it and he said, "I'm very sorry, but it would be impossible to let you go down there because, uh, it's dangerous and, uh, uh, besides we'd have to get approval from the director, board of directors of the Vienna museums."</span> <span id="s1035">I said, "Come on, all I want to do is peek in it.</span> <span id="s1036">What's wrong?</span> <span id="s1037">I'm not going to touch anything.</span> <span id="s1038">I'm not going to fall down."</span> <span id="s1039">"Impossible," and he hung up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">01:32:03 Now, I know that they tipped him off that this guy is going to make trouble.</span> <span id="s1041">I wasn't going to make trouble.</span> <span id="s1042">I just wanted to see.</span> <span id="s1043">And he knew the call was coming.</span> <span id="s1044">He had it all prepared and he decided there was no way we're going to let some ex-patriot come down here and give us a hard time.</span> <span id="s1045">So as far as they're concerned, it doesn't exist, it's not there, there was never a wine cellar there.</span> <span id="s1046">That was my reaction to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1047">And I found that reaction in all the places we stopped in Austria.</span> <span id="s1048">They're like oblivious, nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">01:32:33 It was an unfortunate episode.</span> <span id="s1050">Those two doctors were very nice people.</span> <span id="s1051">They said, "Das waren schwierige zeiten."</span> <span id="s1052">That was the only comment.</span> <span id="s1053">It was, "Those were difficult times."</span> <span id="s1054">Zip.</span> <span id="s1055">In Germany on the other hand, every time we got off the boat at a town or a village we had a guide.</span> <span id="s1056">Same in Austria, but in Germany the guide, the first thing they would do is take the group to the Holocaust memorial in every single little town.</span> <span id="s1057">Invariably, it was a place where some temple was burnt down and there was some kind of a memorial there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">01:33:02 And they talked about it to all the tourists.</span> <span id="s1059">And these were not -- it was not a Jewish tour group.</span> <span id="s1060">I mean, there were maybe five percent Jews in it.</span> <span id="s1061">In Austria it was completely different.</span> <span id="s1062">Nobody remembered anything.</span> <span id="s1063">Nobody remember a thing.</span> <span id="s1064">It was really funny.</span> <span id="s1065">I mean, it was humorous actually.</span> <span id="s1066">Okay, that's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Interviewer: A couple of minor little points.</span> <span id="s1068">When did you become an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Robert Braun: As soon as I turned 21 I was eligible and I applied and I took the oath and I got a piece of paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Interviewer: And the related question is when did you first feel like you were an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">01:33:46 Robert Braun: Very early, because I went -- frankly, I think -- in thinking back, I went out of my way.</span> <span id="s1072">I said, "They kicked me out of there.</span> <span id="s1073">I'm going to be 110 percent American."</span> <span id="s1074">That's why I joined the Boy Scouts.</span> <span id="s1075">That's why I participated in all the parades.</span> <span id="s1076">That's why I got interested in American history.</span> <span id="s1077">That's why I collect American historical prints.</span> <span id="s1078">I can show you a few hundred more.</span> <span id="s1079">We’re going to walk down that hallway where you see some more.</span> <span id="s1080">And I decided, uh, I'm as good as anybody else here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">01:34:17 And the way to do that is to be that, not to, you know, stand on sides and throw stones and, uh -- I never had a problem.</span> <span id="s1082">Occasionally, you know, you run into anti-Semitic cracks and comments, at Boy Scout camp, for instance.</span> <span id="s1083">But I just yelled back at them.</span> <span id="s1084">You know, there'd be, uh, an all Catholic troop full of micks from Saint Augustine's Cathedral and they'd say, "Hey you Christ killers."</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">01:34:45 And I'd say, "You god damn stupid mick."</span> <span id="s1086">It was fine, no problem.</span> <span id="s1087">As a matter of fact, one of the micks who had a severe protrusion, Francis Flynn, once beat me up.</span> <span id="s1088">He broke my glasses in a similar episode.</span> <span id="s1089">Fast forward; he brought his kid into my office to get his teeth straightened.</span> <span id="s1090">The kid had the same teeth this far out.</span> <span id="s1091">And he said, "Hey, Bob!</span> <span id="s1092">Remember we were at Boy Scout camp together."</span> <span id="s1093">"Yeah, I remember.</span> <span id="s1094">You broke my glasses you stupid mick."</span> <span id="s1095">Ha-ha, it was very funny.</span> <span id="s1096">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">01:35:15 But I never let it bother me when there were -- I mean, there were plenty of cracks, you know, here and in school and various places.</span> <span id="s1098">And, uh, I became a member of the Board of Directors of the Connecticut Audubon Society and, uh, there was no hint of anything of that sort.</span> <span id="s1099">I mean, under the surface probably, because those people were mostly retired, uh, executives from General Electric.</span> <span id="s1100">And so, you know, I didn't pry into it and they -- it was all very collegial and congenial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">01:35:44 And one -- every -- once a month we had a board meeting at the headquarters up in Fairfield and there was a new member there who was a retired Vice President from the General Electric Company, which has its headquarters in Fairfield.</span> <span id="s1102">And before the board meetings for about half-an-hour we'd have wine and crackers and cheese and stand around and socialize and talk.</span> <span id="s1103">You know, all very, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1104">And this guy in a rather loud voice started cracking some kind of a Yiddish accented joke like that song, Sam you made the pants too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">01:36:17 The suit is fine.</span> <span id="s1106">But obviously, you know, humorous.</span> <span id="s1107">I ignored it and nobody said anything.</span> <span id="s1108">And a few weeks later I bumped into him on the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1109">He was all over me; arm over the shoulder, hugging, "Oh, hey, how you doing?"</span> <span id="s1110">And occasionally I'd bump into him and he was always the friendliest, outgoing guy imaginable.</span> <span id="s1111">Somebody got to him and tipped him off and he behaved after that.</span> <span id="s1112">[Laughs] It was kind of funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">01:36:48 Sorry, I digress.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Interviewer: That's okay.</span> <span id="s1115">The trip to Vienna was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Robert Braun: Well, there were two, actually.</span> <span id="s1117">The first one was, uh, two years ago.</span> <span id="s1118">What's this, 19 -- in the fall.</span> <span id="s1119">This will be fall of, uh, oh, fall of, uh -- what are we talking about?</span> <span id="s1120">Uh, uh, 2010 -- 2009, yeah.</span> <span id="s1121">And it went up, up the Danube and then through a canal into the Rhine and to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">01:37:22 Uh, so, uh, that's -- Interviewer: So just last year.</span> <span id="s1123">So the anecdote of the clock museum -- Robert Braun: Was the second one, a year ago.</span> <span id="s1124">Because the first one, uh, they were quite open about it.</span> <span id="s1125">They said, "Geez, we don’t have a key."</span> <span id="s1126">And the boat left the next day and I couldn't wait, so I said, "If we ever get back."</span> <span id="s1127">And sure enough we got back the next time because the second trip we took went in the other direction.</span> <span id="s1128">It went all the way down to the Black Sea.</span> <span id="s1129">So we spent -- had more time in Vienna and I still couldn't get in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">01:37:55 But the same experience with the tour guides and stopping at places and so on.</span> <span id="s1131">It was all just a difficult time.</span> <span id="s1132">End of story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Interviewer: Austria has a difficult time dealing with this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Robert Braun: They don't deal with it.</span> <span id="s1135">They ignore it.</span> <span id="s1136">When I was in -- did I tell you the story about the flags issue?</span> <span id="s1137">I was in the stamp club at the junior high school I went to in Bridgeport.</span> <span id="s1138">We had a stamp club.</span> <span id="s1139">I collect everything, as you can see by looking around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">01:38:24 You name it, I collect it.</span> <span id="s1141">I had a stamp collection and I was in the stamp club.</span> <span id="s1142">And about 1942 the United States Post Office started issuing commemorative stamps, one a month for each of the overrun countries, so-called; Holland, France, uh, Denmark, Norway, on and on and on and on.</span> <span id="s1143">And each stamp that came out once a month had the, just the picture of the flag in color on the stamp.</span> <span id="s1144">And one month, boom, out pops the Austrian flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">01:38:56 I said, "Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1146">They made a terrible mistake."</span> <span id="s1147">And the teacher in charge of the stamp club, the counselor, the advisor, I said, "Look, look, they made a mistake.</span> <span id="s1148">Somebody should tell them."</span> <span id="s1149">He said, "No, no.</span> <span id="s1150">It's one of the overrun countries."</span> <span id="s1151">I said, "It's not.</span> <span id="s1152">It's not an overrun country.</span> <span id="s1153">They joined them."</span> <span id="s1154">I was shocked, absolutely shocked.</span> <span id="s1155">But that's been the reaction.</span> <span id="s1156">That was the American Postal Department, for God sakes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">[Director's comments] Interviewer: This is one of those funny questions and it has nothing to do with the story.</span> <span id="s1158">What was your Scout project?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">01:39:38 Robert Braun: Project?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Interviewer: Did you have an Eagle Scout project?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Robert Braun: Uh, yes I did, as a matter of fact, but I'm trying to remember what it was.</span> <span id="s1162">You know, you're going back 70 years almost.</span> <span id="s1163">Uh, I remember there was a project -- wait a minute, no.</span> <span id="s1164">We didn't have projects.</span> <span id="s1165">We had to get 40 merit badges and some of them were difficult.</span> <span id="s1166">The bird watching merit badge was the hardest one to get.</span> <span id="s1167">You had to identify 50 birds in the field.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">01:40:07 You had to go with the merit badge counselor and find 50 birds, which was not easy, but I did it without any trouble.</span> <span id="s1169">There was no project at that time.</span> <span id="s1170">I know I've read about where they have to build a trail or do something of that sort.</span> <span id="s1171">But this was way back in 1944, '43 and I'm pretty sure that we had no projects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Interviewer: Okay.</span> <span id="s1173">Switching gears, you mentioned LBI.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Robert Braun: LBI?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Interviewer: I think, Long Beach Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">01:40:38 Robert Braun: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Interviewer: Oh, Harvey Cedars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Interviewer: You mentioned something happened -- Robert Braun: Long Beach Island, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Interviewer: So this kind of ties in with where were you when and --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Robert Braun: Okay.</span> <span id="s1181">Well, the two years we actually fulltime at the Kraus family home, every summer we went to Long Beach Island and on nice weekends, fall and spring, we also drove there in their nice wooden-sided station wagon.</span> <span id="s1182">And it was regulated because there wasn't enough gas to go often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">01:41:08 So Mr. Kraus was very careful to save gas in such a way so that there was enough to get to Long Beach Island and back.</span> <span id="s1184">He wouldn’t take a gallon of extra gas beyond his ration.</span> <span id="s1185">And then after -- and then my sister went down there to visit for almost the whole summer during the war and that's when the Coast Guard patrolled the beach on horseback.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">01:41:34 And, uh, she -- the neighbors, the Amram family -- God, I can't remember the boy's first name.</span> <span id="s1187">He became an author.</span> <span id="s1188">I've got one of his books.</span> <span id="s1189">Had a daughter my sister's age and they were good friends and they did a terrible prank once, which fortunately Mrs. Kraus or Mr. Kraus never found out.</span> <span id="s1190">They turned the chairs in the Kraus home upside down and they rearranged the furniture and did all kinds of things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">01:42:00 Because my sister was staying with the Amram family next door, but they got in there and they thought that was very funny.</span> <span id="s1192">It wasn't funny as it turned out because when Mr. Kraus came out there the next time he saw that and he reported it to the police.</span> <span id="s1193">So the police called the Coast Guard and they came and investigated and they thought there might have been a surreptitious landing here.</span> <span id="s1194">You know, that was after the 10 saboteurs landed, uh, off the coast of, was it Long Island somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">01:42:30 Uh, but she was so afraid of telling what they had done.</span> <span id="s1196">The two girls, they never admitted that they did it and the whole thing was just finally just, well, it's a mystery what happened.</span> <span id="s1197">So I have to admit, I didn't do it, my sister did it, may she rest in peace.</span> <span id="s1198">Uh, and what, what was her name?</span> <span id="s1199">[Luigi] -- [Wigi] Amram.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">01:42:59 Well you can look up Amram on, on, on Google and you'll find all about the Amrams and the younger brother and dropping my car down a ventilating tube.</span> <span id="s1201">[Laughs] Interviewer: I'm assuming that you and your sister always lived in the main house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Robert Braun: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Interviewer: But what do you remember about the camp and all the other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Robert Braun: Oh, the camp.</span> <span id="s1205">Oh, well, we were at that camp longer than anybody else because by the time we left they closed, by the time we left they closed it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">01:43:32 Uh, what do I remember?</span> <span id="s1207">It was very new.</span> <span id="s1208">We were two children to a room.</span> <span id="s1209">There were two wings and a central building with a dining room and kitchen facilities.</span> <span id="s1210">There were several women who worked there fulltime taking care of the kids.</span> <span id="s1211">I don't know if they were nurses or volunteers or paid help.</span> <span id="s1212">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s1213">The food was different, but very good, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1214">The first meal we had there had a dessert of, of sliced bananas embedded in Jell-O, which was a mystery, because in Vienna bananas were kind of like a candy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">01:44:05 You'd buy one at a time from an Italian peddler on the street and it was treated like a candy bar, a special treat.</span> <span id="s1216">And here we saw these little pieces of banana in this strange packing material.</span> <span id="s1217">And all 50 kids started to scrape this odd, reddish stuff away so that we could get at the bananas.</span> <span id="s1218">Nobody knew you were supposed to eat it.</span> <span id="s1219">And the women -- I remember this very clearly.</span> <span id="s1220">The women taking care of us, serving us and so on were trying to tell us, "Eat it," and we wouldn't eat it because it was different from anything we'd ever seen before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">01:44:35 Nobody had ever heard of Jell-O.</span> <span id="s1222">Uh, it took quite a while.</span> <span id="s1223">To this day, I can't eat Jell-O.</span> <span id="s1224">But the bananas were good once you scrapped all that pink stuff off, the red stuff.</span> <span id="s1225">But the care was excellent there.</span> <span id="s1226">Uh, doctors came to visit.</span> <span id="s1227">Uh, the two boys who were ultra, ultra orthodox drove everybody crazy for the first couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">01:45:00 Because Friday night before sunset they'd try to make all the kids tear off pieces of toilet paper and prepare it for the Sabbath so you wouldn't have to tear up paper on the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s1229">This went on for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1230">Then Mr. Kraus found out about it and he put a stop to it.</span> <span id="s1231">He said, "No, you don't have to do that.</span> <span id="s1232">If you want, do it, but you don't have to do it."</span> <span id="s1233">So we all stopped doing it, except for those two boys.</span> <span id="s1234">[Laughs] Interviewer: There was a bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1235">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">01:45:28 Robert Braun: No, I don't recall that at all.</span> <span id="s1237">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1238">We -- I -- Interviewer: I had heard that one of the older boys was just turning 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Robert Braun: Oh, well it may have been, but I stayed away from religious observances as much as possible.</span> <span id="s1240">Uh, and do to this day.</span> <span id="s1241">We joined a temple when, when, when, uh, our children were young.</span> <span id="s1242">Park Avenue Temple here, which is a very liberal outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">01:45:57 But I quit that in a huff when, uh, I didn't approve of the Rabbi's sermon one time.</span> <span id="s1244">It happened after Rockefeller ordered the storming of the prison in Upstate New York.</span> <span id="s1245">And this Rabbi, may he live in infamy, brings into the sermon, he said, "The people --" -- what was the name of the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Interviewer: Attica.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Robert Braun: Attica.</span> <span id="s1248">"The people of Attica are just as guilty as the Germans that smelled the smoke coming out of the smokestacks and didn't ask about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">01:46:26 Why didn't they rise up against this brutal murder of all those poor prisoners?"</span> <span id="s1250">And I said, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s1251">And my son was next to me, Tom.</span> <span id="s1252">He pulled at me, "Don't make a fuss."</span> <span id="s1253">He's shy.</span> <span id="s1254">He doesn't like to make no -- he forced me to sit down again.</span> <span id="s1255">And the next day I told him, "Forget us.</span> <span id="s1256">We're through.</span> <span id="s1257">We're done with that temple."</span> <span id="s1258">It was outrageous for him to make a comment like that.</span> <span id="s1259">As you can see, I don't have much nachus for rabbis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Interviewer: Well, it is interesting Bob that here you have Gilbert and Ellen, which as you know quite well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">01:46:59 Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Interviewer: And as I have learned were completely irreligious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Robert Braun: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Interviewer: And yet, doing what they did -- Robert Braun: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1265">That's what impresses me so much.</span> <span id="s1266">And that's what makes me look with suspicion at, uh, the ultra-relig -- well, no, they can do what they want.</span> <span id="s1267">But as far as their behavior is concerned, uh, no religious organization did anything like they did.</span> <span id="s1268">Not one.</span> <span id="s1269">Now, they had influential people in their board of directors, I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Interviewer: Just to follow-up quickly on what David asked, while you were at the camp were the kids taking outings outside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">01:47:41 Robert Braun: No.</span> <span id="s1272">We were on the campgrounds and, uh, we, we were kept active.</span> <span id="s1273">We had outdoor games, uh, tag.</span> <span id="s1274">They tried to teach us baseball.</span> <span id="s1275">That was pathetic.</span> <span id="s1276">If you can imagine Mr. Kraus or some other volunteers be out there speaking English, trying to teach kids that had never heard of baseball before how to play baseball; unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1277">The most confusing thing I ever went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">01:48:04 And then on weekends we were supposed to really be, you know, energetic and athletic and play games because people came from Philadelphia and New York and other places to perhaps provide a home for some of these children.</span> <span id="s1279">And it was, it was a madhouse.</span> <span id="s1280">[Laughs] I, I don't imagine how they ever placed those kids, but they did place them all eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Interviewer: What was that process like?</span> <span id="s1282">What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Robert Braun: Well, I don't -- I didn't know because we just were told by Mrs. Kraus, "Well, now you're coming home to stay with us."</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">01:48:35 And I don't know how the other kids responded to it.</span> <span id="s1285">I do know that, uh, they would say, "Oh, so-and-so went to live with this nice family in, in Doylestown," or in Philadelphia or in New York or in Pittsburgh or something.</span> <span id="s1286">And, uh, there weren't any sad partings.</span> <span id="s1287">I mean, we didn't say farewell or have parties.</span> <span id="s1288">It just -- it was like, uh -- well, uh, it seemed normal somehow.</span> <span id="s1289">We knew that sooner or later we would live with somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">01:49:05 We wouldn't be there forever.</span> <span id="s1291">We sang songs.</span> <span id="s1292">It was called -- they called it Camp Shalom.</span> <span id="s1293">And we sang, "We're the boys of Camp Shalom you hear so much about.</span> <span id="s1294">The people stop to look at us whenever we go out.</span> <span id="s1295">We're noted for our winsomeness and clever things we do.</span> <span id="s1296">That everybody likes us, we hope you like us to.</span> <span id="s1297">As we go" -- you don't want to -- shall I go on?</span> <span id="s1298">"As we go marching and the crowd begins to play -- no, and the band begins to play, you can hear them shouting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">01:49:36 The boys of Camp Shalom are on their way."</span> <span id="s1300">Stuff like that.</span> <span id="s1301">One interesting coincidence; you know, I became a great aficionado of Audubons, as you may have guessed.</span> <span id="s1302">As a matter of fact, in the past I used to go -- when the New York Historical Society sent their original Audubon paintings on tour to various museums; to Detroit, to San Fran -- Los Angeles and so on, I had a slide talk, a two projector talk, uh, on, on how to identify Audubon originals, as opposed to reproductions, fakes, restrikes and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">01:50:12 And they asked me if I'd be willing to give this talk at different museums and I said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s1304">So I talked at, I don't know, a number of museums, Detroit and Los Angeles and I think, uh, Portland, Oregon.</span> <span id="s1305">They paid for my ticket, but I didn't take any money for it.</span> <span id="s1306">I said, "No, I don’t want to get paid.</span> <span id="s1307">This is fun."</span> <span id="s1308">And, uh, it so happens that Camp Shalom, B'rith Shalom's establishment, was on the banks of Perkiomen Creek.</span> <span id="s1309">Perkiomen Creek is the creek that ran through Audubon's farm when he first came here from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">01:50:44 His father owned what they called a plantation.</span> <span id="s1311">And his father was a -- you don't want to hear about Audubon.</span> <span id="s1312">Anyway, his father owned it and in Napoleonic times he sent his son, who was draft eligible and Napoleon grabbed everybody, everybody who moved, sent him to his plantation in North America to get him away from Napoleon's armies.</span> <span id="s1313">And Napoleon lived there and became fascinated by birds on the banks of Perkiomen Creek.</span> <span id="s1314">It's the same place where this Camp Shalom was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Interviewer: Wow!</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">01:51:14 Robert Braun: See, destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Interviewer: I don't think that facility is even there anymore.</span> <span id="s1318">I asked somebody -- Robert Braun: Oh, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Interviewer: If the camp -- yean.</span> <span id="s1320">Because I was hoping to just go visit it and walk around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Robert Braun: Well, there are pictures of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, there certainly are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Robert Braun: But I remember Perkiomen Creek.</span> <span id="s1324">It wasn't a big river.</span> <span id="s1325">Geez.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Interviewer: The thing I'm still trying to get; there's kind of the group, you called them the syndicate.</span> <span id="s1327">That basically when they came over to get you guys they were kind of representing a syndicate of people.</span> <span id="s1328">Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">01:51:56 Robert Braun: I don't know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Interviewer: I mean, in a way.</span> <span id="s1331">In terms of -- Robert Braun: Syndicate sounds sinister somehow.</span> <span id="s1332">Group, organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Interviewer: Right.</span> <span id="s1334">But I'm just wondering did they ever come and visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Robert Braun: Yes.</span> <span id="s1336">Some men and women visited and talked to us.</span> <span id="s1337">And they didn't -- they were not necessarily to pick a child to take home with them, but just to see what was going on and -- wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1338">The president of the B'rith Shalom was -- we called him Uncle -- I can't remember his first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Interviewer: Louis [Levine].</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">01:52:30 Robert Braun: Uncle Louis, yeah.</span> <span id="s1341">He came frequently and talked to the children.</span> <span id="s1342">And gradually the children learned more and more English.</span> <span id="s1343">A lot of our time was spent learning English, that's right.</span> <span id="s1344">Volunteers, I presume, would come out and in little groups and they, they would point to things and teach us words.</span> <span id="s1345">We picked it up very fast, I think.</span> <span id="s1346">I didn't think there was a problem with language by the time we left.</span> <span id="s1347">Uh, there wasn't any other school type of education.</span> <span id="s1348">I mean, no math or things of that sort, but English and American history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">01:53:02 Mrs. Kraus used to lecture us.</span> <span id="s1350">There is a great photograph of her pointing to -- standing in front of a picture of President Roosevelt, uh, over a fireplace I remember with little kid -- with some of the children standing around there.</span> <span id="s1351">No, they certainly taught, uh, patriotism.</span> <span id="s1352">Of course, during the war everybody taught it.</span> <span id="s1353">[Laughs] It wasn't that unusual.</span> <span id="s1354">All in all it was a very happy experience, those two months we spent there or three months; I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1355">We even got used to the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">01:53:33 I don't think we ever ate Jell-O, though.</span> <span id="s1357">To this day I won't eat Jell-O.</span> <span id="s1358">[Laughs] Interviewer: But ice cream.</span> <span id="s1359">I heard ice cream -- Robert Braun: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1360">Oh, ice cream; that was terrific.</span> <span id="s1361">As a matter of fact, that was particularly favored because in Vienna they didn't have ice cream.</span> <span id="s1362">They had Italian ices, which were good, but it wasn't like ice cream.</span> <span id="s1363">It wasn't rich.</span> <span id="s1364">It wasn't with cream.</span> <span id="s1365">You know, we could never get enough ice cream.</span> <span id="s1366">Uh -- Interviewer: As a 10-year-old or 11-year-old, what do you remember being the biggest just sort of cultural or just the biggest distinction between your life in Vienna?</span> <span id="s1367">Aside from the obvious of not being --</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">01:54:12 Robert Braun: Well, I'll give you something obvious.</span> <span id="s1369">Right on the bus going from I guess Hoboken to, uh, Collegeville where the camp was located, Stephen Kraus came along with his parents.</span> <span id="s1370">I don't think Ellen did.</span> <span id="s1371">I think there were two buses.</span> <span id="s1372">Maybe she was on the other bus.</span> <span id="s1373">And, you know, in America people are relaxed, especially young men and they put their feet up on things.</span> <span id="s1374">And Stephen Kraus sat in the seat right behind the driver.</span> <span id="s1375">I was several seats back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">01:54:42 But we all stared because Stephen Kraus got on the bus and he put his feet up on the railing.</span> <span id="s1377">We said, "My God, look at that."</span> <span id="s1378">It was shocking.</span> <span id="s1379">I mean, if you did that in Austria you're parents would clobber you or the conductor would throw you off the bus.</span> <span id="s1380">But it seemed very relaxed.</span> <span id="s1381">Eventually, I got used to that's how Americans are.</span> <span id="s1382">They don't care about putting their feet up.</span> <span id="s1383">But I have that picture in my mind; the back of his head.</span> <span id="s1384">He had some kind of tweed slacks on and I remember he had big feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">01:55:15 And the shoes were right up behind the driver.</span> <span id="s1386">There was a chrome rail.</span> <span id="s1387">That was a shock.</span> <span id="s1388">Don't tell him.</span> <span id="s1389">Oh, he's going to hear this.</span> <span id="s1390">Oh, geez.</span> <span id="s1391">[Laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Interviewer: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Robert Braun: As my wife says, I talk too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Interviewer: No such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Robert Braun: No such thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Interviewer: No such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Robert Braun: Well you can always chop it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Interviewer: I'm going to see Steve in about six weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Robert Braun: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Interviewer: In April.</span> <span id="s1401">We're going to do this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">01:55:46 Robert Braun: Oh, good.</span> <span id="s1403">I wonder what -- I wonder how his memories coincide with mine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Interviewer: Bob, I've never talked to him about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Interviewer: Neither Liz nor I know what he's going to remember.</span> <span id="s1407">We've never talked to him about this until the film project came up.</span> <span id="s1408">We never had a conversation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Robert Braun: I remember I spoke to him several years ago when Liz told me that he had a copy of -- he had the original memoir.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">01:56:13 And I wanted a copy and I asked him about that.</span> <span id="s1411">And he said, "Okay," uh, he'll send it.</span> <span id="s1412">And I said, "I promise I am not going to" -- he said -- well, you know, he was concerned that this might be some commercial enterprise, which would have been abhorring.</span> <span id="s1413">This was her personal memoirs.</span> <span id="s1414">And I said, "No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1415">I just want your permission to make copies to give to the children of my sister."</span> <span id="s1416">She has three daughters.</span> <span id="s1417">So they each have a copy and I have a copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">01:56:41 But, uh, that's as far as they ever went.</span> <span id="s1419">As a matter of fact, I got my copy just, uh, when I was in the hospital with cancer surgery.</span> <span id="s1420">And I was in a fog most of the four weeks and my daughter Betsy read it out loud to me.</span> <span id="s1421">I was lying on a gurney.</span> <span id="s1422">It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Interviewer: She read the whole manuscript?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">01:57:10 Well they screwed up my operation.</span> <span id="s1426">My intestines came apart afterwards.</span> <span id="s1427">[Laughs] For a week, gastric contents were spilling into the abdominal cavity.</span> <span id="s1428">It was a -- anyway they managed to pump me full of this and that and the other thing and finally they patched me up again.</span> <span id="s1429">But, uh, Betsy came and stayed there for hours and hours and, uh, she had the -- she had this.</span> <span id="s1430">I couldn’t read and, and she read it out loud to me.</span> <span id="s1431">It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Interviewer: It's quite a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">01:57:43 Robert Braun: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Interviewer: That Ellen committed to paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Robert Braun: It kept me breathing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Interviewer: Do you remember any of the other kids coming back and visiting while you were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Robert Braun: Yes, one person, uh, Irvin [Tipper].</span> <span id="s1438">I think he's a radiologist.</span> <span id="s1439">And, uh, it turns out I first met him at the reunion I went to in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">01:58:13 And then he called me and he lives in New Jersey somewhere.</span> <span id="s1441">And he said, uh, you know, he'd like to come up and visit.</span> <span id="s1442">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s1443">And he came up.</span> <span id="s1444">And, uh, he had some information I didn't.</span> <span id="s1445">Uh, and he said -- he told me something.</span> <span id="s1446">But anyway, uh, he was here for several hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">01:58:45 And he gave me some of the data he had and I gave him whatever copies of whatever I had.</span> <span id="s1448">And, uh, ever since then I get a, a greeting card from him on, on, on, on the Jewish New Year.</span> <span id="s1449">I'm not really an anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1450">Honest to God, I'm not.</span> <span id="s1451">[Laughs] My children -- my grandchildren went to Sunday school at this reform temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">01:59:15 And it was funny because my -- that son in a house next door married a Korean nurse that he met in a hospital he was interning in in Connecticut.</span> <span id="s1453">So his children are half Korean, but Jewish.</span> <span id="s1454">They all had bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs.</span> <span id="s1455">The mother insisted on this.</span> <span id="s1456">And, uh, when they went to the temple, uh, reform temple in Bridgeport -- no, in Fairfield, I guess it is -- they had pageants and every Thanksgiving, of course, they had a Thanksgiving pageant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">01:59:43 Invariably, one of my children played the role of the Indian because they looked like an Indian.</span> <span id="s1458">And it was a big hit.</span> <span id="s1459">They said, "Gee, where'd you get that Indian for the Jewish pageant?"</span> <span id="s1460">[Laughter] Interviewer: That's great.</span> <span id="s1461">So there have been a couple of bar mitzvahs in the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Robert Braun: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1463">No, everyone.</span> <span id="s1464">All my grandchildren had bar mitzvahs.</span> <span id="s1465">Not the one out in Oregon, no.</span> <span id="s1466">He did not because -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1467">Well -- although there is something interesting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">02:00:12 My son the arborist who is a tree doctor, found a, a, a gravestone, a flat one in the weeds outside a Christian cemetery back in the woods somewhere near an abandoned village in Oregon where he was working in the trees.</span> <span id="s1469">And he scraped away the leaves and it had Hebrew lettering on it.</span> <span id="s1470">And, uh, below it said in English the name.</span> <span id="s1471">His first I don't know it, but the last name was Brown, B-R-O-W-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">02:00:42 And the first name was, I think, Adolph or something like that.</span> <span id="s1473">And there was a Hebrew inscription above it and it said born -- no, it said died 18 -- I think 1856.</span> <span id="s1474">Born a certain year in Posenon, Prussia.</span> <span id="s1475">And Posenon is a town where one part of my family came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">02:01:10 My Uncle [Yatchov] when he tried to bring a case against -- claim damages against the [Hepsburgs] it was kicked out of court.</span> <span id="s1477">He traced some of the ancestors down to Posenon, Prussia, which is at that time was called Posen, P-O-S-E-N.</span> <span id="s1478">I'll betcha the guy is related somehow, because Brown, of course, is the English translation of Braun, B-R-A-U-N.</span> <span id="s1479">And I often wondered, uh, if we had some early ancestor in the Oregon territory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">02:01:42 Probably an itinerant peddler or something of that sort.</span> <span id="s1481">[Laughs] Interviewer: We have friends named Posen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Robert Braun: Named Posen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Interviewer: Posen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Robert Braun: Well, they probably originally came from Posen.</span> <span id="s1485">Because see, in the Napoleonic era everybody had to take a name so he could tax them.</span> <span id="s1486">And Jews picked names.</span> <span id="s1487">That's why they have some strange names; quite often the name of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Interviewer: He was in the silver business in Germany before the war, Posen Silver.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">02:02:11 Robert Braun: I suppose, yeah.</span> <span id="s1490">I don't know much about Posen.</span> <span id="s1491">But it changed nationality.</span> <span id="s1492">One time it was part of Prussia and then Germany and then Poland.</span> <span id="s1493">They changed the spelling, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Interviewer: It went back and forth, yeah.</span> <span id="s1495">Anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Interviewer: Well, I guess I'll
