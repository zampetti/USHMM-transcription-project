you to first tell me a little bit of your background as a Jewish child in Vienna and how you came to be baptized.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Oh.</span> <span id="s13">Eh, I was born uh in Vienna in November, 1908.</span> <span id="s14">My father was Jewish, my mother was Jewish.</span> <span id="s15">My grandparents on both sides were Jewish.</span> <span id="s16">And uh, in 1914, I became, I got a sister.</span> <span id="s17">My mother had another child, and when the war was breaking out (phone rings in background).</span> <span id="s18">Uh oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Okay, start with how you were born in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Yeah, I was born in Vienna in 1908, and my parents, and both of my grandparents were Jewish.</span> <span id="s21">In 1914, I became uh, I got a baby sister, and we both uh lived with my mother because my father had to go to war, World War One.</span> <span id="s22">When the war was over, and he came back, on the way back, somehow, he met another woman, and he wanted a divorce.</span> <span id="s23">So my mother gave him a divorce, and both of us, my sister and myself, stayed with my mother.</span> <span id="s24">Till I was 11.</span> <span id="s25">At that time, my mother just couldn't make it, raise both of us, so she made my father take me, and his new wife to him.</span> <span id="s26">He was, he was uh in another state a house there.</span> <span id="s27">And so she packed me a little suitcase and sent me off to him.</span> <span id="s28">He uh, in the meantime he married that woman.</span> <span id="s29">She was Lutheran.</span> <span id="s30">When he married her, he switched his religion to Lutheran., and when I came there to live with them, he made me take on Lutheran religion, and they both said it was in a way good, because there was a lot in that city where we lived was a lot of antisemitism, and it was better to say I'm Lutheran, and I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s31">So anyway, I stayed with him uh from 11 , when I was 11 till I was 14.</span> <span id="s32">When I was 14, he tried to get me eh a job.</span> <span id="s33">And he was uh, travelling all over Germany.</span> <span id="s34">He wanted me to become a nursery man, that means not in a children's nursery, but nursery with uh greenhouses, and ---- flowers.</span> <span id="s35">So, when I was 14, he found me a job in Germany close to the city of Munich, and um, in the meantime when I was there, a half a year or so, his co transferred him and his new wife, my stepmother, back to Vienna, and uh I was, I had to learn this craft for 3 yrs, and I got room and board.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Can you describe how different things were in 1938 when Hitler came, can you describe the change in everyday life?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Well, when Hitler came, everybody was getting Heil Hitler, nobody wanted to be against it, and my real mother was living in Vienna too with my sisters in another part of Vienna.</span> <span id="s38">She, uh, managed to marry a, a guy that was from Russia ----------------------- to the United States was not open anymore, but they coming in uh cities in of Russia, she was able with him and my daughter to go, uh, my sister to go to, to United States.</span> <span id="s39">Over here, they went each, each own way, they was -----------------------, and my mother, my sister, uh, lived in New York, and my sister got married there to a guy that also came from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Back in Vienna, how did people feel about Jews at the beginning of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Well, they were sometimes worse than the term where when Hitler came to power in Germany.</span> <span id="s42">And when they saw uh the Jewish people getting picked up, and that was a certain scourge?</span> <span id="s43">Where they uh collected them, they standed, they were standing on the street just laughing at them, and snickering at them.</span> <span id="s44">Were very, very bad.</span> <span id="s45">It was very bad for, for to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s46">They had to wear a, a star.</span> <span id="s47">You couldn't work nowhere and the people of Vienna, at least 90% were all for Hitler.</span> <span id="s48">So, my mother uh was gone then in 1939 she went to the US with my sister.</span> <span id="s49">I myself, yeah my father died in 37, so he didn't know anything about the whole thing, and I stayed with my stepmother for the time being, and I had a job in, in, in a nursery in Vienna, which I could hold until, until the end of 38.</span> <span id="s50">Hitler came in March.</span> <span id="s51">The people I worked for never had any idea what, where I came from, that I was Jewish before, and they could, they were swearing that I was, uh, Lutheran, so they kept me, and the 2 sons of that guy that owned the nursery belonged to the party, Nazi party, and sooner or later, it came about that I'm from Jewish parents, and I have to go.</span> <span id="s52">So, they had to let me go, and that was in the, in the end of, of uh â€˜38.</span> <span id="s53">In the meantime, uh with this command in Vienna, there is a Israeli -----------, the place where all the Israelites were uh registered.</span> <span id="s54">They had my birth certificate, and they were trying to get people to Palestine, but before it came to that, you had to go in a camp, and learn how to work on a farm, doing this and that, make the cause???</span> <span id="s55">and so on.</span> <span id="s56">But I was acc--they didn't know that I had another certificate that said I was Lutheran.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">When you talked before with Linda, you talked about, you described an experience you had being with people as they packed to be transported.</span> <span id="s58">Can you tell me how it happened that you came to be doing that and how you felt about it, what you thought was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">I was in that uh camp in the Jewish camp to learn uh farming.</span> <span id="s60">In the meantime, my stepmother in Vienna got a postcard.</span> <span id="s61">I was registered in a Swedish mission that was trying to get Jewish uh people out of ----------.</span> <span id="s62">And they were writing me that I should come uh to this, it was a, a priest, ---------, that was the director of the mission ???</span> <span id="s63">for an interview.</span> <span id="s64">So, I went uh back from that camp, from that farm, and came to Vienna , and had that interview with that director, and he said that they uh are trying to get young people from Austria to Sweden, and he registered me, and found out what my profession was, and he said, "Well, right now is no transport going, but we need somebody.</span> <span id="s65">Outside of Vienna, they had uh home for the elderly, Jewish people, and there was a huge garden, and fruit trees and everything there.</span> <span id="s66">If I could go there and help out till the time comes that I could go on a transport, that would be a big help to them.</span> <span id="s67">So, I, I quitted farming, came back to Vienna, and went out to that home for the elderly, and I had my, my room, board and everything, and I worked there.</span> <span id="s68">Then the, the time went by and I never got assigned that I am ready to go.</span> <span id="s69">I know they needed me and they didn't want to let me go till the last minute.</span> <span id="s70">In the meantime, the first woman that opened the gate in that big estate there was my future wife.</span> <span id="s71">She was working there too.</span> <span id="s72">They promised her the same thing.</span> <span id="s73">Help us out there, and we will try to get you out.</span> <span id="s74">Well, months went by and, and nothing happened.</span> <span id="s75">In the meantime we became good friends, and we engaged.</span> <span id="s76">Then in the fall of 42, forty...two I think, 41, 41, the people of that little city where that home was insisted that that home has to be closed, they don't want any Jews living out there anymore.</span> <span id="s77">So this uh, Swedish mission had a huge apt building in Vienna where they had uh, apartments for people that got uh kicked out of their apartments, and they had some, it was, it used to be a like a huge uh place downstairs where they had beds for the sick ones.</span> <span id="s78">They had a little chapel there, and we had to close up, out there in that home for the elderly, and we all moved in that apt bldg.</span> <span id="s79">I worked there and my wife worked there.</span> <span id="s80">I mean this, at that time we were not married yet, and we, we, we had a room to live there, 2, 3 rooms, a kitchen and 2, and we stayed until the Austrian government wanted the Swedes to leave, to leave, go home.</span> <span id="s81">They had to close the whole thing.</span> <span id="s82">And uh, the Jewish uh, the sick ones, they got in hospitals uh Jewish hos--there was a Jewish hospital still there, and, and we uh rented a, a room in an ap, big, in an apartment.</span> <span id="s83">There was a certain section in Vienna where the Jews could still stay and live.</span> <span id="s84">We were in that apt there, and I got acquainted with a a Dutch uh mission that, which were doing the same thing--feeding people, taking them out of -----------.</span> <span id="s85">They were still uh working.</span> <span id="s86">And through them, they worked with the, with the SS in Vienna, and in order to be able to stay, they took some of us, we had to go out at night, and pick up certain people for deportation.</span> <span id="s87">We had to put them some suitcase full of stuff, whatever they could carry, and uh, in the morning they were loaded up in trucks, and, and taken to a place where they then were tra, get transported to Poland, and that went on for a while, until almost no, no uh Jews were left in, in Vienna, and that was um, â€˜42.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Where did you think they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Well, they promised them labor camps, you know.</span> <span id="s90">But then after a while it uh, the truth came through that they uh killed them there, and they buried them in mass graves.</span> <span id="s91">I had an uncle.</span> <span id="s92">He lived with his wife in an apt, and the SS man came and said, "I like that apt, and I'm going to take it, and my uncle said, "You can have it but I want to take my bathtub with me," somehow, I don't know how he carried it, I..</span> <span id="s93">.</span> <span id="s94">he didn't want to move until he can get this in.</span> <span id="s95">And a week later he was going to Poland, so we, we, we never saw them again, and uh, anyway, it came, the time came uh when the Dutch people had to close too, and that was when I had to go and leave Vienna.</span> <span id="s96">My wife, future wife, stayed with her mother and father because the mother was catholic, she could, she didn't have to go, and I left with that transport uh, uh Vienna, it was, I think it was October, â€˜42, and uh, the, -------us with a um, with boxcars to Theresienstadt, that was a, a, a former military camp for, for us and so it's just, and they made a ghetto out of this uh, of this city, just like they did in Poland, made these ghettos.</span> <span id="s97">And, uh, they had these huge buildings where men were living.</span> <span id="s98">The other buildings where women were living.</span> <span id="s99">We even had our own money, and we had our own stores, and uh, first of all, when we got there everything had, they took everything off, gave us this, or gave us something, our suitcase belongings, everything was, shoes, everything was con-confiscated.</span> <span id="s100">And uh Stop now.</span> <span id="s101">We have to put another roll of film in.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Why don't you pick up with describing Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Uh, so we were separated in different buildings, but we could see each other during the day.</span> <span id="s104">And we got fed in, in uh all to one place where we get our food, and uh, it wasn't too bad.</span> <span id="s105">It was really like a ghetto, had our own so to speak government, but uh, oh it was controlled by SS, -------------all over the places.</span> <span id="s106">I was lucky, they, they, they gave you to certain uh working groups, and I was with a group of people that uh, went out to the railroad station, unloaded the coal, or unloaded the uh potatoes or whatever it was, and bring it back into the ghetto back and forth.</span> <span id="s107">In the meantime, because we did this almost every day, we got acquainted with some of the Czechoslovakian railroad personnel, and they got letters for us out home you know, so we actually got corresponding with our people at home, telling â€˜em how it was and so on.</span> <span id="s108">And uh, my ...wife's father was still in Vienna.</span> <span id="s109">I was there 42 and in 43 he had to go to my wife, you know, my fiancÃ©, wanted to go with him and come and see me, so she went with him on her own.</span> <span id="s110">She didn't have to, she could have stayed with her mother all the way through the war.</span> <span id="s111">She came.</span> <span id="s112">I was standing there unloading coal, and she comes to boxcar, and she comes out, and I almost fainted.</span> <span id="s113">Ha ha.</span> <span id="s114">So, anyway, we were together uh, for uh, quite a while.</span> <span id="s115">â€˜40, â€˜43, she came in â€˜43, and we even got married there.</span> <span id="s116">Not officially married but like a ghetto marriage.</span> <span id="s117">And...then uh, in the beginning of 44, they said they need people to work in Germany in factories, and whoever wants to go out of the ghetto can go.</span> <span id="s118">So a bunch of us, my friends and me, we volunteered to go.</span> <span id="s119">It was, I don't how many cars full of people.</span> <span id="s120">And, uh, instead we ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s121">We came, uh was my friends, his wife, and his wife's little bro, two brothers, little one and uh ----17.</span> <span id="s122">We came on at night, all the lights on, we got us out of the cars.</span> <span id="s123">Here was the officer, you go this way, you go that way, you go this way, you go that way.</span> <span id="s124">All of, most of the women and kids and young people vanished???</span> <span id="s125">That would be going that way.</span> <span id="s126">Whoever looked halfway decent to work went the other way.</span> <span id="s127">And now, then we were, uh, but my wife was still in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s128">And the next day we look around.</span> <span id="s129">Half of the people that we, that came with us, we didn't see, we know they were gassed.</span> <span id="s130">And the next day, all the women that looked elderly or the kids that couldn't, young, uhhh, working age, you never saw â€˜em again.</span> <span id="s131">Over there they stripped us again of everything we had, and gave us this uh prison clothes.</span> <span id="s132">And uh we were in barracks, and oh there's a bed here and a bed here, all the way through, and we to sleep.</span> <span id="s133">A couple days later, our women came.</span> <span id="s134">They told them in Theresienstadt: Your husbands are working in factories in Germany.</span> <span id="s135">If you want to join them, you can.</span> <span id="s136">--------and registered and, and -------.</span> <span id="s137">A couple days later we saw them through the fences.</span> <span id="s138">Couldn't talk, we couldn't, just saw that they were back here too.</span> <span id="s139">So we didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s140">We, a group of us, we stayed only a little more than a week.</span> <span id="s141">We didn't get no stamps, we were sorted out, said you go to, you have to go to another uh labor camp uh where you can where we can put you to work.</span> <span id="s142">So, our group went to a place that was called Towfering(ph), was a small labor camp next to a railroad station between Munich and Towfering?</span> <span id="s143">And there we were put in bunkers, you know, the roof is grass, and you go steps down, and here is some wooden boards, where we sleep on, so uh from up high you wouldn't probably not realize what's going on there, it looks like grass all over.</span> <span id="s144">So we were there, and we didn't know where our wives were.</span> <span id="s145">But later on ---------------found out that they took them to another camp in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s146">So we were in Poland, they were in Czechoslovakia, we found that out.</span> <span id="s147">After the war you know.</span> <span id="s148">So we, we stayed in the camp, get our ration of bread and cabbage soup and whatever they feed us.</span> <span id="s149">And I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s150">I got to a uh um company, a small group.</span> <span id="s151">They went out in the fields, digging out the potatoes, bringing back the cabbage, and all this stuff.</span> <span id="s152">And we had huge coats, overcoats, you know, and we would uh, we inside sacks, we put, put potatoes here, potatoes here, we marched in the camp, and in each of these bunkers was a little stove.</span> <span id="s153">We heated it up at night and put the potatoes in the ashes, and I think that's what kept us alive, we sacked the food we got you know.</span> <span id="s154">But others were not so lucky.</span> <span id="s155">I came with people, friends of mine, there's nobody in your group as strong and as------strong as strong as these friends of mine were.</span> <span id="s156">And a week later I saw them as skeletons.</span> <span id="s157">They became diarrhea and they just run out.</span> <span id="s158">And it was uh it was wintertime, it was the winter of uh from â€˜44 or â€˜45.</span> <span id="s159">So uh what happened, they didn't last a week, two weeks, and it was so cold, we uh, we had to bury them.</span> <span id="s160">They were only skeletons, only bones and skin.</span> <span id="s161">Laying there on the ground.</span> <span id="s162">We recognized our friends of course.</span> <span id="s163">We had put â€˜em in a two-wheeler, in a big........and take them out in the fields with soldiers with us.</span> <span id="s164">We had to dig these frozen grounds deep enough so that we could get in.</span> <span id="s165">Soon there was no more room.</span> <span id="s166">So we had to carry them to another camp, and ...........</span></p> <p><span id="s167">beep beep beep beep Let's go back a little bit, and maybe you can tell me about, you told about your transport in your other interview of strong men who came like ghosts and you tried to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">I uh, there was uh, a rumor in that camp that we need some, so many men, and uh in another camp for work.</span> <span id="s169">Whoever wants to go can go.</span> <span id="s170">So they loaded up several boxcars full of people.</span> <span id="s171">And I don't think it was more than 4 weeks when they came back, and they were, when they left they were......</span> <span id="s172">like Hercules, you know, Hercules.</span> <span id="s173">They came back and I looked at these guys, they came in rows of 8, 8, 8, and they looked like skeletons too.</span> <span id="s174">And they couldn't walk, they were just swaying like this, against us, and when they were close enough to us, they fell on their knees begging for food and water.</span> <span id="s175">I had to give them water, you know.</span> <span id="s176">And, and then they, they got uh, in their barracks, and I think half of them uh didn't make it...up again, you know, to live through.</span> <span id="s177">And we had to go um, on that railroad station where they came from and make sure that they all get out, and there was straw on the bottom of the cars, and already dead people laying around dead that we had to carry out and the rest had to march to the camp.</span> <span id="s178">Anyway, it was not only German or Austrian Jews, there were people from France, and the Red Cross finally was sending packages, and these guys were fighting for these packages, ripped it open and there was only, there was red beans in there.</span> <span id="s179">But they didn't, who can just, they just ate â€˜em as they were stone hard.</span> <span id="s180">But anyway, there were close to extinction, you know, I don't remember whether they made it or not, but, I think more that 50% didn't make it.</span> <span id="s181">So, one day came a commander.</span> <span id="s182">We have to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s183">The camp is going to be closed.</span> <span id="s184">He gave us each a piece of bread, get your clothes, and start marching.</span> <span id="s185">And, we had to march towards Dachau... But, in the meantime, some weeks before there were alarms you know, airplanes come, Ameri, Americans were very close at that time already.</span> <span id="s186">And we had ducked?</span> <span id="s187">in the barracks and so...and eh, so we, we get on that march, it was um supposed to be several days to go to Dachau by foot.</span> <span id="s188">And uh, we had some soldiers escorting us.</span> <span id="s189">And every move I made ??</span> <span id="s190">were less, less of these guys.</span> <span id="s191">And the other ones to go ----------what they had on their uniforms, took everything off, marched with us.</span> <span id="s192">And we came, I think we were pretty close to Dachau, maybe a days.</span> <span id="s193">Uh, and we were about 6 of us, good friends.</span> <span id="s194">We said, we were afraid when we get to Dachau they're going to kill us there, finally.</span> <span id="s195">So we were going this uh roads, and it came to a bend, and the soldiers didn't pay no attention anymore.</span> <span id="s196">So we said, as soon as the last ones are gone, there was a big side dump, we jump.</span> <span id="s197">So, we left the whole troupe and jumped in that hole, waited till everybody is gone.</span> <span id="s198">Then we got out and we marched.</span> <span id="s199">We didn't know where to go, but we marched.</span> <span id="s200">And we came to a, um place where they stored the hay, and everything.</span> <span id="s201">We went up there and slept that night.</span> <span id="s202">In the morning came the people from that village or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s203">With the guns, come down!</span> <span id="s204">come down!</span> <span id="s205">come Down!</span> <span id="s206">And my friend was saying, "Don't shoot!</span> <span id="s207">Don't shoot!</span> <span id="s208">Don't shoot!"</span> <span id="s209">So they have a, we came down, they took us to the police station, and they let us go.</span> <span id="s210">Go ahead.</span> <span id="s211">So we went, marched and marched and in the afternoon there came a ---woman on a bicycle.</span> <span id="s212">ohhhhhh.</span> <span id="s213">Going like crazy.</span> <span id="s214">Said, what what's the matter?</span> <span id="s215">What's going on?</span> <span id="s216">She said, "The army are coming!"</span> <span id="s217">They called the Americans armies, you know.</span> <span id="s218">The armies are coming!</span> <span id="s219">The armies!</span> <span id="s220">And she drove on.</span> <span id="s221">And we said Well, the armies are coming.</span> <span id="s222">Good for us.</span> <span id="s223">So we walked towards that little village.</span> <span id="s224">It was actually not a village, it was a bigger city, it was called Firstenfeltbrook.</span> <span id="s225">It was a German airfield next to it.</span> <span id="s226">And we went into that little village.</span> <span id="s227">We still heard shooting------And we, we come to the middle of the village, and here were these Americans sitting on the tanks smoking cigarettes and laughing and Oh my God, I said, That must be it then.</span> <span id="s228">So, only one of us could speak English, a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s229">And there were others too, uh, ----where it was------and we told them what happened, and she said, "Put 'em in the hospital!</span> <span id="s230">Put 'em in the hospital so they get taken care of."</span> <span id="s231">They put us in the hospital, and we were surrounded by wounded German soldiers there, laying with us in that hospital.</span> <span id="s232">And the nurses come in, in screaming and crying, "The armies are here, there, they are here, they coming!"</span> <span id="s233">Oh my God.</span> <span id="s234">They were crying because a lot of these guys got shot and or got arrested.</span> <span id="s235">Oh we were...but they took good care of us.</span> <span id="s236">They gave us food and everything.</span> <span id="s237">We didn't have no hair.</span> <span id="s238">They know, they must have known who we are, you know.</span> <span id="s239">On our clothes and our weight and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Did you, when you were in the camps, were you friends with Jews?</span> <span id="s241">Were they your good friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">My friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Yes.</span> <span id="s244">In the camp.</span> <span id="s245">Were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s247">The most of them, yeah.</span> <span id="s248">Except for this group of French people that we saw in that other, in that last camp.</span> <span id="s249">But the most of them were Jewish, were all Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">And what kinds of things did they do?</span> <span id="s251">Did you see them ever, or did they ever practice their religion?</span> <span id="s252">Did you ever see spiritual?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Yeah, in Theresienstadt, they, you could get married Jewish style.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">But what about in Auschwitz or in....</span></p> <p><span id="s255">No, no, no, no, oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Did people pray?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s258">The funny thing was, this, they called them Kapos.</span> <span id="s259">These were Polish, Jews, that were there a long time, in charge of us from the SS, and they hit us more than the SS did, these guys.</span> <span id="s260">Yeah, they had these things, when we had to go in these bunks beds, they hit us more than the SS.</span> <span id="s261">But the SS â€˜em, I got one</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">You were going to tell me about the SS, you were talking about the Kapos, you were going to say something about the SS.</span> <span id="s264">Why don't you go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Yeah, they, they were pretty rough too.</span> <span id="s266">One time, they, on the railroads unloading the coal, and the guy that was with us, uh I think I didn't give him the red???</span> <span id="s267">And so, he slipped me, fell head on into the coals.</span> <span id="s268">But otherwise, I really didn't get hurt too much.</span> <span id="s269">I mean, the, I know they hit people, that they had to go to the hospital, and that, but I, personally, went through the whole thing pretty unscathed.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">What kinds of choices did people have in those circumstances.</span> <span id="s271">Could you make choices that helped insure that you would live instead of die?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Actually we didn't have any choices.</span> <span id="s273">We had to believe what ------they told us you go in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s274">We had to believe this.</span> <span id="s275">The funny thing was, then, they told us in Auschwitz, we going to that labor camp in Kalfering, we actually, the train actually went through Vienna, I donâ€™t know how come.</span> <span id="s276">And we looked out these windows, and we just, we could jump, we would have be free.</span> <span id="s277">And it went uh from Theresienstadt thru Vienna to Poland.</span> <span id="s278">We went to the inner city, and then out and then out and to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Did having been baptized as a Lutheran help you at all once you were in the camps?</span> <span id="s280">Did it make it easier for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">No.</span> <span id="s282">No.</span> <span id="s283">There was nothing we could do.</span> <span id="s284">I, I, I don't remember anything.</span> <span id="s285">A Jew was a Jew.</span> <span id="s286">There was no difference.</span> <span id="s287">There was no priest or anything.</span> <span id="s288">And I know, when like when I said we were in that hospital, and at the end of the journey, uh, they kept us, then we finally got out, and they had schools where we, where, taken care of and sleeping, they had restaurants there we could go to, to eat and everything.</span> <span id="s289">They took care of us.</span> <span id="s290">And then there were trains coming, going from there to Munich, and from Munich to wherever you wanted to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Back during the war, did you, were there people who tried to help you or other people that you saw?</span> <span id="s292">Did you see any people who tried to help in any way.</span> <span id="s293">Or particular soldiers or kapos who tried to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">No.</span> <span id="s295">The only people that really helped us were these uh, these railroad personnel, some of â€˜em in eh Theresienstadt, you know, when we got on the outside to unload, unload, whatever, they took our letters, we gave them money or cigarettes you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">In Auschwitz, I know you were there only a short time, but tell me a little more about what it's like.</span> <span id="s297">What were sort of the standards if you arrived at Auschwitz, what would happen if you were, say, 45 or you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Well, anybody that was not able-looking to work, got gassed.</span> <span id="s299">That we know for sure because we never saw anybody again.</span> <span id="s300">And the ones that are still, were still in good shape, were in barracks, but we didn't work on anything.</span> <span id="s301">We just, in the morning we get our soup, or whatever it was, and then we stayed in the open, and we made a big circle, one next to the other and moving around like this just to keep us warm, and we didn't do any work, until after that week they put us in a row and said you and you and you, you can come, and uh, they were left for the other camp.</span> <span id="s302">So, I don't know what happened to the rest, but, I assume, whoever didn't get lucky enough, I know a fellow that went with us, strong, witty, he never came back.</span> <span id="s303">He must have died somewhere, I don't know where, either in Auschwitz or in another camp.</span> <span id="s304">A lot of, so I couldn't say how many got gassed and how many made it, I mean from the group that I knew, several hundred, I think I know only 20 or so came back that I know.</span> <span id="s305">And when I, when we met in Vienna again you know, and uh, my wife was, we were actually liberated by the Americans, my wife was in a camp in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s306">She got liberated by the Russians, and she came home ------with a train full of Russians, but they didn't do didn't do no harm to her.</span> <span id="s307">But she was uh, she was close to not naked you know, she was sick all the time.</span> <span id="s308">She had two holes here and big hole here, and she had no stomach.</span> <span id="s309">And uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">So people could make no choices under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s311">Even to die when they wanted to, you couldn't kill yourself...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Well, they could.</span> <span id="s313">Like, when I was in that little camp after Auschwitz, that Kalfering was the name.</span> <span id="s314">We went to bed in the evening, and one of the guys, he was a lawyer, strong guys, he was hanging, hung himself overnight in the in the bunker.</span> <span id="s315">We woke up, and here was...so, if you wanted to kill yourself, you probably could.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">So how do you think some people survived, and some didn't survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">I really don't know how it happened.</span> <span id="s318">I wasn't very strong.</span> <span id="s319">There were guys there twice my weight and a head taller, and couldn't make it, if they got...diarrhea or something.</span> <span id="s320">Couldn't hold it anymore and they just were running out.</span> <span id="s321">Uh, how, how I came back is, for me, still a miracle, how it happened you know.</span> <span id="s322">I don't know.</span> <span id="s323">I was close enough several times, but, I got lucky, I never got sick.</span> <span id="s324">I think I was in the hospital once, one day, that's all.</span> <span id="s325">That's all.</span> <span id="s326">And, how it...how this gets elected I don't know.</span> <span id="s327">There are better guys, and stronger guys, they should live now instead of me, you know.</span> <span id="s328">I just got lucky.</span> <span id="s329">Mmm.</span> <span id="s330">We had -----and we had laborers, we had doctors, we had lawyers, we had, you name it.</span> <span id="s331">You know.</span> <span id="s332">And a lot of â€˜em didn't make it.</span> <span id="s333">So, I don't know.</span> <span id="s334">I also said somebody up there must have liked me.</span> <span id="s335">Ha ha ha ha ha.</span> <span id="s336">Because I can't figure it out...that, that I'm here, still here, uh huh.</span> <span id="s337">I had so many close calls, and still.</span> <span id="s338">I, I don't know.</span> <span id="s339">My wife recuperated.</span> <span id="s340">And, in 1947, our daughter was born, and she was so tiny, 2 lbs I think, that my wife is was afraid to hold her, she cried, "Take her, take her!"</span> <span id="s341">Ha ha, I had to take her.</span> <span id="s342">And, and now she is strong, 5'9" or something.</span> <span id="s343">We always said, you know, when we came over here she was 4 years old, and she was so skinny, she didn't eat very much.</span> <span id="s344">.</span> <span id="s345">We always said Wonder Bread made her grow.</span> <span id="s346">That's what got her up.</span> <span id="s347">And now she has 3 of her own.</span> <span id="s348">So, Well, that's all we need.</span> <span id="s349">Thank you very much.</span></p>
