id="s84">Q: Do you remember the names?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, it was all the European battles.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We just followed General Patton from the start of after he took over, and went through Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Until we got to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s91">And then you arrived in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: What was your first what's your first recollection, your first memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Hah.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: I mean, here you were a Jewish soldier coming to Germany.</span> <span id="s98">Do you remember what your feelings were at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: You know, everything we didn't know too much about what was happening.</span> <span id="s100">And that was one of the things that was so shocking when we arrived in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s101">But we weren't told in those days really what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Now, we had heard rumors of what was happening; that they were killing Jews and so forth.</span> <span id="s103">Even before I went into the Army, we had gotten rumors of that, things like that happening, but nobody was really sure, you know.</span> <span id="s104">There was no everything was kept quiet.</span> <span id="s105">So when we got into Germany, of course, it was a matter of just getting through and fighting and going through these battles.</span> <span id="s106">There was no time to think of things like that until we until we got to the camp of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: What was first impression?</span> <span id="s108">What's the first thing you saw</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: In Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Well, I guess we were one of the first units into Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s112">And I remember standing just inside the entrance, and having the feeling of not only horror, but utter desolation.</span> <span id="s113">What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet high, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards.</span> <span id="s114">The bodies had been soaked kerosene, ready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it.</span> <span id="s115">On my right, there were several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling.</span> <span id="s116">Some weighed 80 pounds.</span> <span id="s117">Some looked half dead to me.</span> <span id="s118">One of them was crawling towards me, and I said something in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s119">I can't remember for sure, but "Vus Kenneth Tuin Zick Sehelthen, (ph)" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet.</span> <span id="s120">The feeling of helplessness and not believing was very prevalent.</span> <span id="s121">The gentile soldiers who were with me were almost in tears and shaking their heads.</span> <span id="s122">And I remember one of the survivors coming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the camp, and they were getting away.</span> <span id="s123">And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there, said that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed.</span> <span id="s124">The scene that I described to you has never left my memory.</span> <span id="s125">And when I hear some of these groups that are now prevalent in the United States, around the world, that say that this never happened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">We left this area soon after.</span> <span id="s127">I guess we had another assignment.</span> <span id="s128">And it was a long time ago, 50 years or so.</span> <span id="s129">I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me.</span> <span id="s130">But that scene that I saw at the entrance will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Do you know what day you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I wouldn't know the date, but I know that Patton was 20 or 30 miles ahead of us.</span> <span id="s133">He had come through, and then gone on.</span> <span id="s134">He was always ahead of the other units.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">And so that was really probably the exact date that Buchenwald was liberated.</span> <span id="s136">Because the fact that the SS troops that were still there, and they had tried to, you know, get rid of that evidence, so it was not more than one or two days difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: And you said you had no preparation for what you would be seeing here?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No preparation.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: You were a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No preparation.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: You were in your early 20s</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: with no preparation?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No preparation of this at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">And not it was a situation that we really didn't believe.</span> <span id="s146">Not only me, but everybody that walked in with me, you know, at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Were you with other Jewish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No.</span> <span id="s149">There were Jewish soldiers in our outfit, but I think I was the only one at that point that had walked into this.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How big a group were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Oh, there must have been 10 or 12 of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: And you walked into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: We went into that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Are there any other experiences that you had besides talking in Yiddish to the one survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, because after we did survey this area, we were told we have to get out; that other people were coming in to do something to</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Would</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: work with the survivors, and</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: How long were you actually inside Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Maybe not more than a half hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: So what was the purpose of you going?</span> <span id="s161">What did they tell you the purpose was for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: They just wanted to...</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Witness it?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Witness, as witnesses, right, to see what was going on.</span> <span id="s165">And then we our whole outfit moved out after that, and then that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: And you had described one young man's reaction.</span> <span id="s167">Any other reactions that you remember from the other soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Just disbelief.</span> <span id="s169">I think nobody ever would have thought of seeing things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Now, I remember our outfit had gone through five battles, so we had seen many things.</span> <span id="s171">But this was the horror of it and the immensity of it, you know, was hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How much of the camp did you see?</span> <span id="s173">Did you walk around?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Not maybe we went in 40 or 50 yards, and then returned, went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: And do you feel that because you were Jewish, that your reaction was different than your fellow soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s177">I think that they were also in shock; that they didn't believe this could happen.</span> <span id="s178">Man's inhumanity to man.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Did you see any of the living quarters, the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: We saw barracks.</span> <span id="s181">We didn't go into them, but they were</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Can you describe what you saw; what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: They were like wooden barracks, but they were run down if I remember correctly, and it was small areas where they were living.</span> <span id="s184">I did see that.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Tiny, tiny areas where they had lived, little probably not even beds, you know, but probably on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So you just walked around on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s189">We walked in on our own, and then we were told let's go, we're moving out, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Did you talk about what you saw with the other men that you were with, the ten other men?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No.</span> <span id="s192">We went into another assignment, and we had we were spread out, so I didn't get to talk to too many people.</span> <span id="s193">Later, we talked about it, you know, and really, what I'm telling you, we talked among ourselves, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Did you discuss any of this with any of the officers in the camp, in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: One of the officers, if I remember, was with us when we went in, but we didn't discuss that afterwards, because things were still popping, as you know, because that wasn't the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: And you said you spoke Yiddish to one of the</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And did you speak to any of the other survivors, or just that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: No.</span> <span id="s202">It seemed to me if I remember correctly, that was the one.</span> <span id="s203">The others were couldn't speak.</span> <span id="s204">They were mostly I was thinking afterwards, I wonder if they really survived, because they looked in such bad shape that probably many of them didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: So you then left, and can you just briefly tell us what happened after?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, we would we had to go on.</span> <span id="s207">And after that, it's hard to remember what happened.</span> <span id="s208">I remember carrying one message to a Russian general in Lavesig that, and forgetting to shake his hand, and he was left hanging there as I left the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">And finally, after a few months, the war was did finish.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: And then you</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: But I did write about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Well, let's</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: So then you how much longer were you in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Probably not more than a few more months.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: And</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Before I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And then you came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Came back to</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Michigan?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: To Michigan.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: And what did you do then?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s224">Then I went to I decided that I would go and really take music more seriously, and I went to college, and became a music teacher and a music performer.</span> <span id="s225">Met my wife, Betty, who is also a musician, and that's what we've been doing since.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Uhhuh.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: To this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about how this experience that you went through in Buchenwald as a young man, a young soldier affected you.</span> <span id="s229">Does it still affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Hmm.</span> <span id="s231">I would imagine it does, 'cause the immensity of what I saw, and the fact that I was there, of course.</span> <span id="s232">And I had been telling not only my family, but other people, whoever I saw, or whoever was interested of these things that I had that it was hard to talk about.</span> <span id="s233">But when I first came back, people wanted to know.</span> <span id="s234">I remember writing to my family even from Europe of what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Describing</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Describing what I saw.</span> <span id="s237">And I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Do you still have those letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s240">What happened was my mother used to read those letters, and finally and cry whenever she read them.</span> <span id="s241">So finally, I decided that get rid of them.</span> <span id="s242">And now I realize that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s243">I shouldn't have.</span> <span id="s244">But I did.</span> <span id="s245">I got rid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Did you take any photographs of what you saw when you</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s248">We had some photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: That you yourself</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: But those photographs were included in some of the letters, and so I got rid of those, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Uhhuh.</span> <span id="s252">But you yourself had a camera?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: No.</span> <span id="s254">We had I had a camera, but I didn't take all those.</span> <span id="s255">There were other soldiers that did take photographs, and they gave me some of the prints that they got.</span> <span id="s256">That's where I got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: You had said you had written or was that the letter you're talking about, the letters that you wrote home?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: You didn't write anything formal?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, no, I didn't write anything formal.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Formally?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: How did that experience that you went through affect your feelings about being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Did it change the way you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: No, I don't think it changed.</span> <span id="s267">Our family has you know, is a family that had many Jewish clergy in it.</span> <span id="s268">My mother's family, on her side, there were Rabbis that went back as far as four generations.</span> <span id="s269">I think we came from Spain, and then to Poland, and so I remember stories about, you know, great, great, great grandfather being Rabbis and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">So I've always felt Jewish.</span> <span id="s271">I don't think it had any affect on it.</span> <span id="s272">But it sure opened my eyes about what had been going on, and why, and why this happened was a big question; why it was allowed to happen.</span> <span id="s273">Because I think now as we read books and go back into history that many people knew what was going on, and nothing not enough was done to save these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Did the Army have any mechanism for the soldiers to talk out their experiences of what they saw</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: at places like Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: No, not not that I know of.</span> <span id="s278">Perhaps, you know, other units that moved in to try to work with these people may have had that, but we were not given that, you know, responsibility; or nobody ever talked to us about it after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Were most of the other men that you came to the camp with young like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yes, just about my age, maybe a little bit older.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: And you said that you did talk about it with them a little bit after?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Do you remember any of the exchanges that you've had; any of their comments?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Same thing that I that I talked told you.</span> <span id="s285">First of all, there was disbelief.</span> <span id="s286">And nobody ever said that they would have imagined the immensity of this terrible horror that we saw.</span> <span id="s287">And to think that these people and in every contact that we had with German people, they always said that it wasn't us that did these horrible things.</span> <span id="s288">We were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s289">But it turns</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: When you say contact, when was this contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Well, if we talked to a German person.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Over you're talking about when you were</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah, as we went from, you know</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Towns?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Citytocity, towntotown, and we naturally would say did you know about what was happening.</span> <span id="s296">Your town was right next to this; the ovens there.</span> <span id="s297">They all said, oh, no, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s298">We were not Nazis.</span> <span id="s299">But it turned out [many|am] times, they were.</span> <span id="s300">We found evidence of Nazi materials in their attics and so on.</span> <span id="s301">Everybody denied it.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: What kind of what did you do after you left Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s303">You said you went to different towns and cities.</span> <span id="s304">What was your role?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s306">Since I was a Jewish soldier, I knew a little Yiddish, I sort of became the billeting person.</span> <span id="s307">In other words, I would go around talking to people to allow soldiers to stay in different places.</span> <span id="s308">And that's what I mean when I had contact with the regular persons in these towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: And what was their reception to you knowing</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Oh, fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: No, it didn't matter.</span> <span id="s313">They were just glad to see Americans, you know.</span> <span id="s314">Oh, we're glad to see you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And they knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Sure, because I talked Jewish.</span> <span id="s317">I'm sure German people</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: The German people could tell the difference between German and</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: You were speaking Yiddish and</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I was speaking Yiddish, and they were answering in German, right.</span> <span id="s322">And usually I would go to the Bürgermeister, because he was the one that went, tell us, tell us where we could find a billeting, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Well, is there anything else that you wanted to add; that you wanted to say</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: it was heartrending, as you can hear, and I just I hope that I what I've said, you know, can verify what, you know, what has what happened over there.</span> <span id="s327">And as an eyewitness, I thought that I should have some evidence, you know, to that effect, and tell that this did happen, and it wasn't a hoax.</span> <span id="s328">And it was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Well, thank you very much for telling us your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s331">I'm happy I'm able to do that.</span> <span id="s332">It wasn't easy, but I felt we felt it was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: As you said, this is something that has stayed with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span> <span id="s335">Especially the scene in the entrance of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Were there any special signs that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: There was a sign above the camp, but you know, I can't remember what it said now.</span> <span id="s338">Some of the movies I've seen, there had been different slogans, Arbeit?</span> <span id="s339">You know about that.</span> <span id="s340">Means what was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Arbeitsdorf?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s343">But I don't really remember if it said that in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s344">It might have.</span> <span id="s345">It might have.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: And that was the only camp that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: That was the only camp we went to.</span> <span id="s348">We were near I had heard that we were passing by different ones, or there were, you know, as we went through, because we had just followed the line of the tanks, but we didn't we didn't go to another camp.</span> <span id="s349">That was it.</span> <span id="s350">So I don't know what happened in Dachau, for example, or others.</span> <span id="s351">Just what I saw in Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s352">One thing I do remember is that upon entrance into Buchenwald, not only was it the visual horror, but we had that terrible odor of dead bodies and kerosene, and it was it was an odor that made us all nauseous.</span> <span id="s353">A terrible feeling of nauseousness and utter desolation.</span> <span id="s354">And this happened, again, at the entrance of this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: And the other soldiers felt the way you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s357">The other soldiers felt the way I did.</span> <span id="s358">And as a matter of fact, now that I think back, I remember one of the other soldiers not being able to stay there.</span> <span id="s359">He had to leave immediately.</span> <span id="s360">But I did not do that, because I wanted to see as much as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Because I'm Jewish, and I didn't want to, you know, forget what I was seeing.</span> <span id="s363">I thought maybe some day in the future, I'll be able to describe this, or I would have to describe it, which I am now doing.</span> <span id="s364">Another experience that I had later in our area, area of Southfield, Michigan at the time, is we met a survivor of that camp.</span> <span id="s365">He happened to be a jeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were trying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time.</span> <span id="s366">Now, this was over 30 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">But when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I was a survivor of Buchenwald, too.</span> <span id="s368">And the only way I survived was I finally cut off some toes in order to get to a hospital.</span> <span id="s369">And he was very emotional.</span> <span id="s370">We hugged, and he cried.</span> <span id="s371">And he said you, you saved us.</span> <span id="s372">And this happened, the meeting happened 30, over 30 years ago.</span> <span id="s373">And we see each other once in a while, and memories come back, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And this was</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: On both sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And this was an emotional experience for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, as you can tell, it was very emotional, because he started to talk a little bit about his experiences in the camp, although not much.</span> <span id="s378">So I met in other words, I did meet a one of those people who was there when I walked into that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Thank you for telling us that very moving story.</span> <span id="s380">This concludes the interview of Jerome Stasson.</span> <span id="s381">It was conducted on March 21, 1994 at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Conclusion of
