Okay, I’m going to just -- for the sake of summarizing on tape, say that we’re -- we’re going to start out by going back into some of the Holocaust era and pre-war experiences that weren’t discussed in the first interview.</span> <span id="s16">So -- and then we’ll -- and then we’ll focus on the post Holocaust material, after we’ve done some of that.</span> <span id="s17">And we’re going to try not to repeat what was already said in the video interview, just -- just to do new stuff.</span> <span id="s18">So, why don’t we start out Bella, by you stating your -- your name today and -- and your name at birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Answer: My name is Bella Mischkinsky.</span> <span id="s20">I was born September 9th, 1922 in Lódz, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: And we know from the first interview that you were born Bella Berger.</span> <span id="s22">How -- ho -- and -- and then you -- how -- how did you get the name Mischkinsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: After marrying my husband, Ike Mischkinsky, I adopted his name, Mischkinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And then later you married Hank Bermanis.</span> <span id="s25">How did you decide to keep the name Mischkinsky?</span> <span id="s26">Was that an issue at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: It was a matter of convenience.</span> <span id="s28">It’s too much hassle to go through all the papers and changing names and whatnot, so I decided to officially go by Mischkinsky and whether I was referred to as Mrs. Bermanis or Mischkinsky or Bella, was of no importance or difference to either of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: We -- will you describe something about -- you -- you had said in the first interview, a few things about you childhood in Lódz and how you were sort of a happy go lucky young girl and -- and you weren’t really a -- a joiner, or a member of groups or anything.</span> <span id="s30">And you mentioned a little bit about your -- your family and their political interests.</span> <span id="s31">Or -- your father was a Bundist and they weren’t particularly religious.</span> <span id="s32">I wanted to get more of a sense of your relationships within your family and if you could state your father’s name and your mother’s name and say something -- and -- and your sister’s name and say something about your early relationships as a child before the war, with each of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Well, my mother’s name was Gitla Voidaslavsky -- was her maiden name and she married my father, Natan Berger and she adopted -- adopted his name, so she was Gitla Berger.</span> <span id="s34">My sister is my junior.</span> <span id="s35">She was born in 1930, her name is Irene, known at that time as Irene Berger.</span> <span id="s36">My relationship with my parents was -- it wasn’t close, but it wasn’t antagonistic.</span> <span id="s37">My mother was busy working.</span> <span id="s38">She was a terrible housekeeper, hated housework, loved to be with people, loved to work.</span> <span id="s39">Also, that was not the common standard at that time in Poland.</span> <span id="s40">But she was the happiest when she was among people and when she was working.</span> <span id="s41">My father had a job, not a very strict one.</span> <span id="s42">He was much more educated than my mother.</span> <span id="s43">He liked different things than my mother.</span> <span id="s44">I could never find a common bond why they ever got married, except the custom in Poland at that time was that -- what do they call?</span> <span id="s45">Thedushetimeshat.</span> <span id="s46">Some family introduces a man, other family introduces a woman and they decided that they would make a couple and they get married.</span> <span id="s47">There was no courting, dating, or any of that.</span> <span id="s48">And I imagine that’s why they got married.</span> <span id="s49">I never found them very competitive to each other.</span> <span id="s50">My father pretty much went his way.</span> <span id="s51">He was a terrific mathematician.</span> <span id="s52">He loved politics.</span> <span id="s53">He loved cafés, good life.</span> <span id="s54">My mother was just devoted to work, work, work.</span> <span id="s55">So I was pretty much left on my own.</span> <span id="s56">I would say that my home base was rather my grandmother’s home, where there was somebody there, than my parents home.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Now, which grandmother was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: My father’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Hiya.</span> <span id="s61">Hiya Berger.</span> <span id="s62">And my grandfather was a just -- a terrific Hassidic man, but very astute, very educated, very respected and he belonged to the -- I think you could call it sect, of the gedda rabbin -- rabbins -- rabbins -- whatever the name is.</span> <span id="s63">Because the Jews were kind of separated by belonging to different rabbis -- who was next to God.</span> <span id="s64">Leaders.</span> <span id="s65">But the religious life never interested me.</span> <span id="s66">I had no special feelings towards God or even religion, except knowing that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s67">Couldn’t describe what it meant.</span> <span id="s68">Probably because I was born to Jewish parents and was surrounded home with the Jewish tradition, but it did not affect me at all.</span> <span id="s69">Politically my father’s -- he had four brothers, two sisters and I had a slew of cousin and inevitably, every one belonged to a different part of the political organizations at that time.</span> <span id="s70">I was not a joiner, but I was listening, cause I loved to discuss things.</span> <span id="s71">I guess that’s something the Jews had, discuss issues to death.</span> <span id="s72">So they were talking about Zionism, Bundism and all shades of Zionism.</span> <span id="s73">Hammish -- hammish hatiyere and the revers in this groups and many other ones.</span> <span id="s74">So I was exposed to it, but not a participant.</span> <span id="s75">I never joined any organizations.</span> <span id="s76">I am just not a joiner.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Did you have any Zionist sentiments at all as a result of that, or did you feel completely uninterested in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, I had no Zionist interests at all.</span> <span id="s79">The concert of Palestine and our homeland, that was not something my mind was preoccupied.</span> <span id="s80">I was probably more Polish than Jewish, except being Jewish definitely.</span> <span id="s81">I had no interest in the Jewish life at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did your parents have any kind of religion that they -- that they were bringing you and Irene up with, that they were -- you know, that they -- did they -- did they bring you to Temple on high holidays or was the -- it really -- pretty much secular Jewish household?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, my parents didn’t -- my grandparents, that are Orthodox, so I observed the Jewish holidays and attitudes towards religion through them, but not through my parents.</span> <span id="s84">My parents never gave me a Jewish education and I never showed any interest in it.</span> <span id="s85">But I do have a sentiment and terrific memories of my grandparents home, who were real true believers.</span> <span id="s86">So, Friday night was a big holiday.</span> <span id="s87">My grandma got -- put the best chaidel on and the long dress and that hose.</span> <span id="s88">Set up a white tablecloths and candles and holly.</span> <span id="s89">And my grandpa -- father came back from Shul and took the honored place at the table and was -- had all the respect of the children and grandchildren and -- so that it was always a feeling of religion in their house.</span> <span id="s90">On Passover, was a tremendous holiday, joy for us children.</span> <span id="s91">Had to change dishes, you have to burn homitz and all those things.</span> <span id="s92">But I really -- I was not a participant, but I was an observant and I had no objection to it, as long as I did not have to do anything about it, but enjoy the atmosphere of my grandparents home.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So you attended a public s-school then, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Yeah, I attended the public grammar school and then I went to a private high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Would that --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Public schools were compulsory.</span> <span id="s97">High schools were private.</span> <span id="s98">But I attended a private high school, which was very much influenced by the Bundist movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Was it a secular high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s102">Okay.</span> <span id="s103">What did you think of -- of the Bundist movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Of the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: The Bundist movement?</span> <span id="s106">What -- what kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I couldn’t care less.</span> <span id="s108">Well -- but I know they did not believe in a homeland like Israel.</span> <span id="s109">They were anti-Zionist.</span> <span id="s110">They believed in peace on earth wherever you are.</span> <span id="s111">They were more a s-socialist movement Certainly not a religious one.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Where did your real interests lie?</span> <span id="s113">Was there anything that -- that you -- that really excited you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I didn’t have any special interests.</span> <span id="s115">I was a very happy young girl.</span> <span id="s116">Had lots of friends, was going to school.</span> <span id="s117">I wanted the world to be wonderful, everybody should love everybody else.</span> <span id="s118">And I really felt a part of Poland.</span> <span id="s119">I considered Poland my home.</span> <span id="s120">Unfortunately I found out differently in ‘39.</span> <span id="s121">But until then, I really felt very Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: You mentioned in the first interview that your friends were both Jewish and Christian and that, you know, that there was a very open feeling, or atmosphere and then -- and then the anti-Semitic incidents started happening and you described the -- the escalating laws and decre-decrees and so forth.</span> <span id="s123">Were there any personal experiences that you had, say with friends who -- who -- you know, non-Jewish friends who sort of turned on you after the war started or experiences like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No, I don’t know of anybody -- my personal friends to turn on me, but they stopped being friends by sheer not being able to be together.</span> <span id="s125">So, it was nothing personal.</span> <span id="s126">They did not turn away all of a sudden because they found out I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s127">It was never a secret to them.</span> <span id="s128">And some of my friends went to a very, very prestigious Polish high schools.</span> <span id="s129">And their contact with the Jews was not tremendous, but it never made any difference to me and I don’t think to them.</span> <span id="s130">We were never discussing religion or the influence on -- we were just friends.</span> <span id="s131">Young people finding a lot of things in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: But they just stopped talking to you after the -- after the German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Well, we were separated.</span> <span id="s134">We no longer could go out on the streets.</span> <span id="s135">We no longer had the same rights.</span> <span id="s136">So a lot of my acquaintances, Jewish acquaintances, were shu -- cut off too.</span> <span id="s137">Because we no longer could visit, we no longer could do the things we did before which bound us together.</span> <span id="s138">Schools were closed.</span> <span id="s139">So there was really being cut off from the rest of society.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: What about your relationship with Irene?</span> <span id="s141">I realize she was much younger than -- she wa -- was she eight years younger than you?</span> <span id="s142">Something like that.</span> <span id="s143">So when the war started, she’s -- she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s145">My relationship to Irene was different.</span> <span id="s146">I just loved her.</span> <span id="s147">She was a sweet, young girl and since we were left alone so much, we developed a very close relationship.</span> <span id="s148">A close relationship, me being so much older and she being so much younger, but she was cute, adorable, loving and I was just crazy about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Even as -- even as a young girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Even as a youngest girl.</span> <span id="s151">Also I had to take her sometimes on a date with me, but I never resented it.</span> <span id="s152">I had a devotion -- to me, never disappeared in all those years of separation.</span> <span id="s153">As a matter of fact, for some reason, she stills feels that feeling of -- not only love, but it goes further than love.</span> <span id="s154">That feeling of responsibility for me, since I lost my husband and I no longer am the same person I was.</span> <span id="s155">She feels doubly responsible.</span> <span id="s156">She cannot be happy if I am not happy.</span> <span id="s157">And I cannot just press a button and say, “Hey sis, be happy even if I am not happy.”</span> <span id="s158">It just doesn’t work with her like that.</span> <span id="s159">She is stubborn.</span> <span id="s160">She gets an idea to her head and shortly of splitting her head and taking the idea out, you cannot change it.</span> <span id="s161">Was it hard for you to leave?</span> <span id="s162">I mean, when you and you father left Lódz -- Lódz, looking for a place in the Russian zone that -- that your family could relocate, did you -- did you have any idea at all or any sense that you would be split u -- your -- your family would be split up the way that it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s164">We both, father and I and mother and Irene felt it is just a temporary resettlement.</span> <span id="s165">At that time you just didn’t pick up and take your whole family.</span> <span id="s166">You were always thinking of providing for them.</span> <span id="s167">So we were like scouting out the territory.</span> <span id="s168">The borders were still opened.</span> <span id="s169">We send for Irene and mother and then we’ll live happily for ever after.</span> <span id="s170">It didn’t work that way, but those were the feelings at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: And I’m interested in hearing your -- about -- more about that moment that you had been betrayed by the maid of the family and -- in that -- at the farm, that -- that you arrived at and the Germans arrived to arrest you, and you and your father escaped and then you dis -- running away and you discover that you’re separated from your father.</span> <span id="s172">What did you -- what -- what did you feel in that moment of -- of realizing that you were alone and that your father wasn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: It was a frightening feel-feeling.</span> <span id="s174">I had no -- I didn’t know how I’m going to act or react or what the future is going to bring.</span> <span id="s175">But I just knew that all of a sudden, I’m in a strange place, all by myself.</span> <span id="s176">I don’t know where I am.</span> <span id="s177">I don’t know what I am going to do, but here I am.</span> <span id="s178">Until some woman, who was outside, looked at me and said, “Hey little girl, you don’t belong here.</span> <span id="s179">And anyway it’s scary for you, what are you doing outside?</span> <span id="s180">Come with me to my house.”</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did you have any ideas or thoughts about what might have happened to your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: No, I had no idea, but I figured out just -- I ran in one direction and he ran in another direction.</span> <span id="s183">I didn’t know which direction he went to and he didn’t know which direction I went to.</span> <span id="s184">It was night, it was the forest.</span> <span id="s185">I had no idea where we were.</span> <span id="s186">We just put our trust in the people who were going to bring us over to the Russian occupied part of Poland.</span> <span id="s187">And we left it at that.</span> <span id="s188">There was no alternative plan, there was no in case we separated.</span> <span id="s189">It didn’t enter our mind.</span> <span id="s190">So I was fully unprepared for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And you describe going on to Bialystok from there and there was a -- was it in Bialystok that there was a woman who -- who -- I mean approached you on the street and took you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Yes, it was in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s193">That was a very, very hard experience, getting to Bialystok.</span> <span id="s194">Now we no longer had Germans, but I no longer belonged any place.</span> <span id="s195">I had no money, no clothes, no documents, no place to go.</span> <span id="s196">And that was a very frightening experience.</span> <span id="s197">What next?</span> <span id="s198">Probably go back to Lódz was one of those thoughts -- after Lódz -- Lódz was home.</span> <span id="s199">That it’s changed, we don’t visualize those things until we experience them.</span> <span id="s200">But that still meant home, so I was toying with the idea of maybe get back to Lódz.</span> <span id="s201">But then I met that woman and she said to me, “Hey, you’re all by yourself, you want to go to school.”</span> <span id="s202">I always wanted to go to school.</span> <span id="s203">One of those ideas.</span> <span id="s204">She says, “Why don’t you come with me?</span> <span id="s205">I live in that small town of Oashmiani and I am sure you will be able to go to school there and kind of make a comfortable life.”</span> <span id="s206">Since I had nothing to lose, whether I go back three days later or a week later, it didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did you -- did you try to get in touch with your mother and -- and Irene?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, there was no way of getting in touch.</span> <span id="s209">There was no post office, there were no telephones, there was no ways of communicating, shortly of going back and being lucky to find them there.</span> <span id="s210">And I had no thoughts that I wouldn’t find them there.</span> <span id="s211">After all, I left them in our home, why should I find them someplace else?</span> <span id="s212">So our knowledge of what Germans had -- what the future they mapped out for us, was not very extensive, except knowing that they hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s213">But that as far as my imagination went --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: What was the name of the -- of the woman who you met in Bialystok, who offered you to go to Oashmiani?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: I can’t think of her name right now, but I am sure it will come back to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: I was interested in -- in -- well, there -- there was a theme that you mentioned that you didn’t want to -- that you were always very careful not to put yourself under a f -- one family’s control.</span> <span id="s217">That -- that you didn’t want -- that there was that sense of reserve as far as trusting people.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: The Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: The Poles, in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s221">And I heard -- I made many friends, Polish friends, in Oashmiani, especially the bookkeeper of that place I worked, an elderly man who was very kind and very nice and it’s ahead of time, but when he found out the ghetto’s going to be liquidated, he met me in front of the gates and said, “Bella, don’t let them send you out.</span> <span id="s222">I place you with my niece on a farm and you going to be safe there.”</span> <span id="s223">He -- I knew him from before, he was very sincere and very honest.</span> <span id="s224">I really loved the guy.</span> <span id="s225">He was a elderly gentleman.</span> <span id="s226">And I say, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s227">And then I got cold feet.</span> <span id="s228">I say, “No.</span> <span id="s229">I cannot put myself in a place where I am completely at the mercy of the people I am with.”</span> <span id="s230">That just wasn’t something I felt comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s232">It seems like it must have been so difficult to -- I mean when you describe yourself before the war, and you describe yourself as being Polish and thinking of yourself as Polish and I’m just trying --</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Jewish - Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: But I’m trying to -- to grasp how that shattered because, it -- did it shatter so -- so completely after the German occupation that you realized that -- that you -- that you really -- that there was such a -- an irreconcilable distance between you and the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yes, I did realize that.</span> <span id="s236">I realized how much the Poles hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s237">I mean, they’re was always anti-Semitism in Poland.</span> <span id="s238">But it was blatant, it wasn’t obvious.</span> <span id="s239">And I was always accepted by my Polish friends, without giving it a thought, whether they Polish or Jewish or whatever.</span> <span id="s240">I was never concentrating on those issues.</span> <span id="s241">And then, when the Germans came in and I saw that all of a sudden, there is such a difference, it no longer became ble -- it was quite obvious they hated the Jews, for many reasons.</span> <span id="s242">First of all, the church was instilling in the Poles -- and that was a Catholic country, the Jews are the killers of Christ.</span> <span id="s243">Well, that’s a unforgiven sin committed by the Jews.</span> <span id="s244">They killed Jesus, their most believed in person, so there is no love for the Jews.</span> <span id="s245">Then there was a certain amount of envy.</span> <span id="s246">Not all Jews were rich, but they were comfortable, most of them.</span> <span id="s247">And the ones who weren’t were taken care of by the Jews who were more comfortable.</span> <span id="s248">Getting rid of the Jews is a big opened field of taking over their possessions, taking over their business.</span> <span id="s249">I guess the Jews presented the Poles of giving them a feeling of superiority.</span> <span id="s250">And that wasn’t very pleasing to the Poles.</span> <span id="s251">I don’t know whether they did or they didn’t.</span> <span id="s252">I didn’t -- couldn’t judge.</span> <span id="s253">But the Jews lived pretty much their own life.</span> <span id="s254">They were -- they had their clubs, they had their cafés.</span> <span id="s255">They had their shows.</span> <span id="s256">They were very intellectual, much more than the Poles were.</span> <span id="s257">And I’m not giving statistics, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s258">But the majority of the Poles were just working people, farmers, whatever.</span> <span id="s259">So I think the Jews felt a little superior.</span> <span id="s260">Sort of standed off attitude towards other people.</span> <span id="s261">They felt they were more righteous, they were more -- but they were separate from the Poles.</span> <span id="s262">There was never a togetherness.</span> <span id="s263">They maybe worked hand in hand on working places, but there was no special bond of relationships.</span> <span id="s264">I never felt it, but then I was a young girl.</span> <span id="s265">And I wasn’t that intellectual to dwell in those political things going on.</span> <span id="s266">I know that Peelshinsky, who was a leader of Poland, hey, I loved him.</span> <span id="s267">He was like -- we called him our daddy.</span> <span id="s268">When he died, we stood, saluted the flag, saluted his portrait.</span> <span id="s269">Tears were running down our cheeks.</span> <span id="s270">But that was a skol -- school attitude.</span> <span id="s271">And I really wasn’t that interested of what happens in the adults minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So did you really stop thinking of yourself as being a Pole and -- and just think of yourself of being a Jew after the war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: No, I didn’t stop thinking wh -- of anything of that kind.</span> <span id="s274">I know that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s275">I don’t know, th-there is a difference between being Jewish and being a Jew.</span> <span id="s276">But I knew that I am being rejected by the rest of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: I wanted to skip ahead then, to when you were in Oashmiani and you were making the decision that you wanted to get out and go to-towards Vilna.</span> <span id="s278">I -- how did you -- what made you decide that Vilna was where you wanted to go or what made you even consider Vilna as the pla -- as the destination?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Had it -- here again, it wasn’t quite from Oashmiani.</span> <span id="s280">Oashmiani was liquidated.</span> <span id="s281">The ghetto of Oashmiani was liquidated and then -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky.</span> <span id="s283">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: When we got to Melagarni, we were put into a building -- very clean, without any knowledge what we going to be doing -- doing there or not.</span> <span id="s285">But I found it confinding.</span> <span id="s286">In Vilna was a big place, a big ghetto.</span> <span id="s287">So I decided to leave Melagarni and go to Vilna.</span> <span id="s288">I only based it on those terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: You thought there would be more freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Freedom of move -- freedom of movement, whatever I thought.</span> <span id="s291">I’m not sure what I thought, I just thought it’s not going to be that confinded that -- you cannot be surrounded in one building or any such thing.</span> <span id="s292">So that’s what I decided to do and that’s what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s294">And then, from Vilna, you were -- you went to Kaiserwald [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: And I wanted you to describe -- you met your -- your husband at Kaiserwald and I’m interested in hearing how it was that you met him and then how it was that you -- that you came to marrying him and more -- and did -- how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Well, I can understand that you have difficulties with that concept.</span> <span id="s298">Because, if you read about concentration camps and if you read about how the Jews were treated -- to me, Kaiserwald was a little different.</span> <span id="s299">How did I meet my husband?</span> <span id="s300">My husband had a lot of freedom in the camp.</span> <span id="s301">He really wa -- he really build that camp.</span> <span id="s302">And he had freedom of movement.</span> <span id="s303">So, how does boy meet girl in those circumstances?</span> <span id="s304">I can’t explain it, but there is a way.</span> <span id="s305">Young people always will seek out young people.</span> <span id="s306">So, since I was not working outside the camp, but I was working in camp and he was moving freely in camp, he spotted that cute little girl and somehow, some way, we started talking, holding hands.</span> <span id="s307">Nothing else but.</span> <span id="s308">We still were separate -- I mean, equal or not equal.</span> <span id="s309">We decided to get married, just not too long before Kaiserwald was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: How long had you known him by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: For about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: He was called Booby.</span> <span id="s314">I found out it’s kind of a silly nickname, but that’s what he was called by everyone.</span> <span id="s315">His name was Isaac Mischkinsky and when he got wind of the idea that Kaiserwald is going to be liquidated, we both decided we didn’t have a better chance staying together whatever happens, as a married couple, than just [indecipherable] ghetto and whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Had you -- but, at some point it had become clear, during that year that you were getting to know -- know each other, that it was very serious, that you were -- that you were in love, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, I guess so.</span> <span id="s318">It wasn’t just, “Hey, would you marry me, because it might be better for both of --” No -- no, we cared for each other.</span> <span id="s319">So that’s where we decided to get married.</span> <span id="s320">And that’s when I changed my mi -- my name, from Bella Berger to Bella Mischkinsky.</span> <span id="s321">It didn’t really save my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Would you describe Booby a little bit.</span> <span id="s323">What -- what -- what interested you in him and what -- what kind -- [indecipherable] what kind of discussions did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: First of all, he was the most handsome man in camp.</span> <span id="s325">He was tall, well built, very well educated.</span> <span id="s326">He was older.</span> <span id="s327">He already had a degree from a co -- from [indecipherable] college in Germany.</span> <span id="s328">He comes from a higher up family, very well [indecipherable] in Riga, before the war.</span> <span id="s329">It all was a snob appeal to me.</span> <span id="s330">Hey, a guy like that is [indecipherable] me, what do I know?</span> <span id="s331">I don’t even have high school.</span> <span id="s332">So that was kind of tried.</span> <span id="s333">And he was a wonderful human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Did he share -- did he have any particular strong beliefs?</span> <span id="s335">I mean, you mentioned that you were not a -- you know, a -- a joiner, but was he religious or was he -- did he have political beliefs or --</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No, he was not religious.</span> <span id="s337">I was not aware of any political inklings.</span> <span id="s338">He was not involved in any political underground fights or anything like that.</span> <span id="s339">It is -- suited my temperament.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Do you remember what you would talk about together?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Oh God.</span> <span id="s342">No.</span> <span id="s343">Well, first of all you talk a little about your family, about what happened here and what happened then.</span> <span id="s344">What was your life before, what -- you know, the usual, get-acquainted talk.</span> <span id="s345">Don’t forget, we didn’t have dates, that you come to my house and let’s spend five hours talking and I take you out to dinner or any -- it was a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s346">And we broke quite a few rules of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s347">But we always were in a position that we could afford to do it.</span> <span id="s348">He was very well liked by the commandant of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s349">I don’t know that the commandant, no matter how much he liked him, would let him get away with lots of things, but there was a certain feeling of respect towards him.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Did that make it easier when he wanted to marry you?</span> <span id="s351">To -- to actually [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: No, the commandant had nothing to do with it, that was none of his damn business.</span> <span id="s353">Pardon my language.</span> <span id="s354">But no, he had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s355">The Germans did not have to know about everything what was going on and they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So there was a rabbi in camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Well, she was -- she was a rabbi from before, but -- I would call it a civil ceremony rather than religious ceremony.</span> <span id="s358">Oh, we had witnesses, we signed papers.</span> <span id="s359">It really had not special meaning for the Jews who were considered in the eyes of Germans as nothing.</span> <span id="s360">But it had a meaning to us.</span> <span id="s361">So we had some witnesses.</span> <span id="s362">I remember one of the girls name was Hilda Shpalter.</span> <span id="s363">And I think Maya Mensh-Menshenfront.</span> <span id="s364">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s365">And it was a 10 minute affair and we said yeah, I declare you husband and wife and we changed papers and names and I imagine people don’t visualize weddings of that kind of -- that way, but that’s way you got married.</span> <span id="s366">That’s how we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: Were there others in the camp who got -- who got married that way too?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I think so, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: How long before you were the -- Kaiserwald was to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Liquidated.</span> <span id="s372">Was that -- you got married --</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: I think about a month or something like that.</span> <span id="s374">Just enough to get all the papers in order and make it legal for the German records.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Were you able to -- did you -- did anything change after you got married, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: We just felt more concerned about each other.</span> <span id="s379">What happened here, what happened then, you know, but now, nothing changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: So you weren’t really able to find much time to be alone together or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No.</span> <span id="s382">Didn’t pick a honeymoon place, what can I tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did you ever take a honeymoon, much later in life with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: All our life was one big honeymoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Well, then it’s worth it… You mentioned that you had close friendships in Kaiserwald that lasted for so many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: They still exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Why Kaiserwald -- how did -- what -- what a -- was it about Kaiserwald that made that possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Well, I had no way of comparing concentration camp, Kaiserwald to other concentration camps.</span> <span id="s389">That was my first concentration camp.</span> <span id="s390">But I found that I personally had a lot of freedom.</span> <span id="s391">I don’t mean freedom of going into town and doing all this things, but I had free time.</span> <span id="s392">I had a very good job.</span> <span id="s393">I met my girlfriend, Trudy Schloss, who too was all alone at that time, separated from her family.</span> <span id="s394">And Trudy Schloss -- at that time Omand, was a girl my age.</span> <span id="s395">She came from Germany and we just took long walks around and round and round the per-perimeter of ours barracks, and talked our heads off.</span> <span id="s396">I had a sister, “Oh, my sister Irena --” She had a sister, “Oh, my sister --” And we talked about parents, about how we got here, what we did.</span> <span id="s397">And we be-became very, very, very close friends and are very close friends til today.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Where does she live?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: She lives in Jersey.</span> <span id="s400">She is married to a man she met in the camp.</span> <span id="s401">They got married after the war.</span> <span id="s402">She has two children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s403">And we were always together.</span> <span id="s404">If we weren’t together, we were always in touch with each other and still are.</span> <span id="s405">That’s my extended family.</span> <span id="s406">She is not the only one, I have other friends, which became extended families.</span> <span id="s407">And that’s -- we are as close to each other as a family could be.</span> <span id="s408">It was a family by choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Were there other people -- were there people from Oashmiani who you stayed in touch with after the war, or -- I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I did meet two people from Oashmiani after the war, but it was a very short-lived contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Was that during one of your visits?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s413">It was when I lived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Was it accidental that you bumped into them or did you intentionally --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Neither or.</span> <span id="s416">When we got a lawyer who was working with the German government after the war, to reward some compensation for the people who were in camp and are survivors.</span> <span id="s417">And you had to find someone who knew you -- who didn’t -- and he had the whole list and you had to find someone who knew you, that you were in camp.</span> <span id="s418">And he was the one who had the name of the people from Oashmiani.</span> <span id="s419">So that’s how I got in touch with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Okay, well [inaudible] I didn’t know that you had done -- had gone through the restitution process.</span> <span id="s421">So, we should talk about that later, but let’s -- let’s stay in --</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Oh, you can talk about it now.</span> <span id="s423">It’s -- it’s a very simple thing.</span> <span id="s424">It’s up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s426">Well, go ahead, then and tell me a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Well, after the war, long after, a organization was formed and said, we were slave labor.</span> <span id="s428">We were labors in camp and we should get some restitution.</span> <span id="s429">So somebody had the name of somebody had the name of somebody and it was a guy in New York who used to take care of it.</span> <span id="s430">So we got in touch with that man, his name is Waxberg [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s431">And you submitted papers saying from there to there, I was here to here and he was providing you with names of people who applied too, so he could match.</span> <span id="s432">And that was presented to the -- I think German consulate or German organization and you had to go through a examination, mental examination.</span> <span id="s433">What did the concentration camp do to you and how much damage was done to you?</span> <span id="s434">And he had a list of names of doctors who were signing papers.</span> <span id="s435">So I eventually was awarded 25 percent of whatever the figure was, I don't know.</span> <span id="s436">My husband got 65 percent, because he got in touch with the lawyer who worked in Germany, who was from Riga and knew their family, and he signed the paper [indecipherable] Mr. Ike Mischkinsky came from a very high class of Jews in Riga and was used to a very high standard of living.</span> <span id="s437">So he got 65 percent and I got 25 percent.</span> <span id="s438">That’s equality.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Did that -- I mean, did -- did it make you angry in any way that -- that you had to go through a mental test in order to have any kind of restitution?</span> <span id="s440">And that -- and that there wa -- and that you -- he was being paid based on how wealthy he was before the war, or -- what did you think of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Well, I don’t get angry very easy.</span> <span id="s442">I can understand injustices of laws and regulations.</span> <span id="s443">They weren’t built for me.</span> <span id="s444">It’s a way of doing things.</span> <span id="s445">So -- and those pensions stopped with the life of the survivor.</span> <span id="s446">So his 65 percent went tsshoop when he died.</span> <span id="s447">I still get my 25 percent.</span> <span id="s448">Hank never got anything.</span> <span id="s449">Partially it was his doing.</span> <span id="s450">He was working for the intelligence of the American government and he did not feel that he can give them all the facts of where he was, what he did.</span> <span id="s451">So that he did forego the application.</span> <span id="s452">I supported him with my 25 percent.</span> <span id="s453">I’m only joking.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: When you were in Kaiserwald, at some point you and Ike were separated.</span> <span id="s455">And it sounds like Ike was -- Ike left Kaiserwald before you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No.</span> <span id="s459">I don’t think I ever said that.</span> <span id="s460">We were let out of Kaiserwald at the same time.</span> <span id="s461">It was September ‘43, I think -- ‘44?</span> <span id="s462">44.</span> <span id="s463">That’s when Kaiserwald was liquidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And you went to Magdeburg from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: We went to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Stutthof.</span> <span id="s469">Okay.</span> <span id="s470">I’m sorry, I’ve got -- I’ve got my chronology wrong.</span> <span id="s471">And -- but it was at Stutthof that -- that Ike had -- and you -- there was a point when Ike and you were separated and he had --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Well, we were separated in Stutthof period, there were women’s camps and men camps, separated by just distances and there were no contact.</span> <span id="s473">Official contact.</span> <span id="s474">Unofficially the Jews always found a way.</span> <span id="s475">And we did kind of send each other letters.</span> <span id="s476">And he knew that there is a transport to Magdeburg plant.</span> <span id="s477">And he said to me, “Get on that transport.”</span> <span id="s478">And my answer to him was, “No way can I do it.”</span> <span id="s479">So he fixed it up.</span> <span id="s480">So we did, eventually leave Magde -- Stutthof together.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: You were on the same transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s483">There was only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: And you were actually together during the -- during --</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: During the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: To -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s489">Did you have a sense at that point that you were -- that you going to be able to stick together, for --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No, but I had a sense that if he would not get me out of Stutthof, I could not survive it much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: When did you meet Hank?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: I met Hank in Kaiserwald for a short while.</span> <span id="s493">And then we went to Magdeburg together, eventually, from -- we got to Stutthof together, we got to Magdeburg together.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: And Ike m -- played some role in -- in Hank being together with you and -- and him too, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Well, we were always friends.</span> <span id="s498">Hank was an adorable youngster.</span> <span id="s499">Ike was a man with distinction.</span> <span id="s500">Hank would shoot his [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s501">But Hank did not stay in Kaiserwald very long.</span> <span id="s502">He was sent on an outside commando, whereas Ike and I stayed in Kaiserwald all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: And when -- when was it that you really started spending time with Hank or getting to know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Ike and I always were spending some times with Hank.</span> <span id="s505">He was our favorite person.</span> <span id="s506">And we were in Germany together and Nungvede.</span> <span id="s507">We spend six weeks together.</span> <span id="s508">He was like a member of the family.</span> <span id="s509">And Nungvede was in a French zone.</span> <span id="s510">And it was so pretty there that we s -- figured hey, why not find -- why not stay here for awhile?</span> <span id="s511">And it was under the French occupation.</span> <span id="s512">So we went to the French consulate and they gave us orders and brilliant Hank figured out he is going to register as a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s513">Which he did.</span> <span id="s514">And we spent six weeks in Nungvede until Hank was told, “Hey, Frenchman, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s515">Get back to France.”</span> <span id="s516">And Hank said, “No way.”</span> <span id="s517">So we all picked up and left together for Frankfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Had you split up -- when did you split up with your friends from Kaiserwald?</span> <span id="s519">Like Trudy?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Well, Trudy went to her hometown in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: When -- when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: From Kaiserwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: No.</span> <span id="s525">No, she too went to Stutthof at the different time.</span> <span id="s526">And then she was -- she was working on a different place.</span> <span id="s527">And after the war she and Louis, her husband, went back to Germany, where they got married.</span> <span id="s528">And then we all met again in Salzheim, because that was a zone which took care of the immigration to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: So, when you went to -- Sa-Salzheim, did you just meet up with a lot of people that you had been with before?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Did you all know -- had you talked during the war that you would want to go to America once the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: [indecipherable] the war, we didn’t talk about what we will do when we -- because we really didn’t believe that we could survive the war.</span> <span id="s533">On the other hand, I guess in the back of our mind was, but if.</span> <span id="s534">Well, but if would be a struggle to become a decent human being again, after the experiences of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s535">Anyway, I made myself a promise that if I ever, by any chance get out of the concentration camp, I am not going to carry my education from concentration camp to the outside world.</span> <span id="s536">And even then I was aware of the fact -- or I thought I was aware of the fact there’s a outside world is not going to adjust to my experiences of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s537">I didn’t think they owe me something.</span> <span id="s538">Cause the only way I can make it, if I ever survive, is through my own strengths and belief what a human being should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Was it hard to live up to that ideal after the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No, because it never stopped being my understanding of it.</span> <span id="s541">I never believed of anything else.</span> <span id="s542">I did not ever believe that if I ever come out, the world is going to open their arms and say, “Ah, you are the survivor.</span> <span id="s543">We owe you so much.”</span> <span id="s544">I never had that delusion.</span> <span id="s545">So it wasn’t hard to get rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And what about feeling the desire for revenge or anger at the perpetrators or something [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Well, I guess it’s against my nature, so -- I knew what it was.</span> <span id="s548">I knew that the world knew it.</span> <span id="s549">I knew that I am helpless in punishing them, the laws were not something I controlled or had an input.</span> <span id="s550">So I just felt that I have to make a new life within my own strengths and not the help of the outside world.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: And did that -- you mentioned -- in the first interview, you were asked about whether you were involved in resistance and you said that you weren’t, because your concern was more just with survival and -- and in surviving without harming others, as much as possible.</span> <span id="s552">And -- so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I -- I just told you, whether I was scared, or whether I just wasn’t a joiner, but I never fought for anything, so I did not join it, I did not join the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: What I was trying to get at was that -- that same -- that same feeling it sounds like motivated you after the war of just not -- not -- not taking on responsibility in -- for something bigger than -- than what was within your sphere of control, in a way.</span> <span id="s555">Does that make sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: No, I don’t think it’s a matter of responsibility.</span> <span id="s557">It was just a matter of believe in all those existing organizations.</span> <span id="s558">And that’s why I -- I guess I never joined any.</span> <span id="s559">But it was never the fear of responsibilities.</span> <span id="s560">And it wasn’t quite selfishness that I have to take care of myself, to protect my life, because there really wasn’t much protection.</span> <span id="s561">Because your life wasn’t worth much and you had no assurance that if you don’t take care -- if you don’t take apart the resistance, you’re going to be saved.</span> <span id="s562">As a matter of fact, I sensed that the chances of being saved belonging to the resistance was greater than being a loner.</span> <span id="s563">I might be wrong.</span> <span id="s564">I don’t know, I never tested it.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: You were just following what?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: My instinct.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What felt right to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: You -- how did you -- how did you know that you wanted to come to America or why did you choose this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, I was never a Zionist.</span> <span id="s571">I certainly did not want to go to Israel and build a country and live in a kibbutz and have that -- again -- pattern of life -- barracks and follow the crowd.</span> <span id="s572">I just wanted to be an individual.</span> <span id="s573">So I figured well, I let the other people do the fighting for me, but I did not think I would be a good material -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky.</span> <span id="s575">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: First of all, I was not a Zionist.</span> <span id="s577">I did not think I am a type of a person Israel needs to build their country.</span> <span id="s578">I did not want to live in a kibbutz in a joint kind of communal living.</span> <span id="s579">I wanted my individual life.</span> <span id="s580">And I think that the United States could give it to me.</span> <span id="s581">That’s why I picked United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: And you didn’t have any interest at all in going back to Poland and looking for relatives or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, I had no interest to go back into Poland.</span> <span id="s584">As far as I was concerned, the life I lived in Poland was dead.</span> <span id="s585">So there was no reason for me to go to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Did you -- were you searching for members of your family at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: No, because I was reunited with Irene and with mother and we -- were no other members of the family left.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: We -- tell me about how -- I -- I know how you were reunited with Irene, because you talked about it a little bit in the -- in the first interview, but I was curious to know whether -- how Irene knew where you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: She didn’t.</span> <span id="s590">She went to a few DP camps to search for me.</span> <span id="s591">That’s how she found me.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Was she -- and she wasn’t with your mother at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Well, she left mother in Poland.</span> <span id="s594">Mother had a boyfriend in Poland and Irene figure out she is going to go to the DP camps, find her sister, go back to Poland and educate the Poles how to be better human beings.</span> <span id="s595">I’m not being funny.</span> <span id="s596">Those were my sister’s ideas.</span> <span id="s597">Took me a long time to change her views.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: So she wanted to stay in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: Oh, she had to educate the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: So she thought she was going to be bringing you back to Poland and that you would all live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: No.</span> <span id="s602">She is going to go back -- whatever she thought, but she -- she’s going to educate the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Will -- will you describe that moment that you saw Irene again?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Well, I didn’t quite see her.</span> <span id="s605">She was pointed out to me.</span> <span id="s606">After all, she was a little girl when I last saw her.</span> <span id="s607">And it was so far away from my mind that I am going to just meet her on the grounds of Salzheim camp and silly as it sounds, I went to camp -- we had a [indecipherable], my husband and I, but I went to camp to get some hot water to have my hair done.</span> <span id="s608">You used to bring your own hot water to the beauty parlor.</span> <span id="s609">So I was stopped by some people and we were talking for awhile and I say, “Hey fellas, I have to go, I have an appointment.”</span> <span id="s610">And then one guy says, “Well, would you mind to say hello to your sister before you go?”</span> <span id="s611">And if I didn’t drop dead then, then I probably never will.</span> <span id="s612">I will die of different causes.</span> <span id="s613">And here was a little four by four young girl standing far away and he says, “That’s Irene.”</span> <span id="s614">So I took a step towards her and she took a step towards me until we met and we embraced and said, “Oh, Irene, Irene.”</span> <span id="s615">“Bella.”</span> <span id="s616">And that was the end of my beauty parlor and a wonderful life mixed with Irene’s since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Did you -- how di-did you spend the rest of the day talking about what had --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: No, because I had to bring her home and introduce her to my husband, who knew a lot about Irene, because I was yak, yak, yak about her all the time.</span> <span id="s619">But I had no idea where she was or what she was and he was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s620">So I just walk into the room and I say, “Oh, by the way honey, here is my sister, Irene.</span> <span id="s621">You thought you married a girl without a family?</span> <span id="s622">Here she is.”</span> <span id="s623">And it was love at first sight between the two of them.</span> <span id="s624">So, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: How long after that did you -- when did you see your mother again after that and how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Well, we had a lot of connections, my husband and I. Depending where you work and whom you know and so on.</span> <span id="s627">Now, we knew where mother lives and we said now we have to bring mother from Poland to the United States.</span> <span id="s628">So we tried to get in touch with her and she didn’t answer and make a long story short, we finally succeeded getting -- telling her that she is coming to be united with her daughters.</span> <span id="s629">And made arrangements for her to get to Berlin, which was a collection point of people who were coming to the States from Poland.</span> <span id="s630">Now we worked for the highest -- at that time, for the unrah, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s631">So we had American uniforms.</span> <span id="s632">Both Ike and I were -- were wearing American uniforms.</span> <span id="s633">We also had a young French soldier who fell in love with his girlfriend, a Russian girl, who had to be in the American zone in order to be able to immigrate to the United States.</span> <span id="s634">He came from the United States.</span> <span id="s635">So he happened to be visiting.</span> <span id="s636">He was visiting her, she lived with us.</span> <span id="s637">And I said to him, “Hey, Booby is going to Berlin, to bring his secretary -- our boss was away, in France, I think.</span> <span id="s638">I said, “Would you mind just writing us an affidavit that Ike Mischkinsky’s bringing his secretary from Berlin to --”, so he just sit down, typed, put the stamp, made it official.</span> <span id="s639">Everybody was very conscious of official letters and stamps.</span> <span id="s640">So, my husband took one of my uniforms and went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s641">He now had official papers that he’s bringing his secretary from Berlin.</span> <span id="s642">Now, he didn’t know mother, but he knew what people read, that’s what he [indecipherable] pass and he told her, “Look, don’t open your mouth, period.”</span> <span id="s643">Puts an uniform -- well, my mother was heavier than I -- just put the scarf around it and the boss, Ike Mischkinsky and his secretary went through the -- all post checks and finally got through.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So Ike was pretty gutsy, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s646">It was funny when he went there, she had to go through the posts of Russians and French and English, you know, to enter.</span> <span id="s647">So the English guy said, “Oh, you’re going to bring some of ours.”</span> <span id="s648">He says, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s649">He says, “Remember, don’t speak German -- er, Russian, when you go through the Russian post.”</span> <span id="s650">So since -- after all, we had experience for five years how to fib and do certain things.</span> <span id="s651">So he did bring her back to Salzheim and she stayed with us three weeks and I hear a repetition of Irene’s song, “I am going back to Poland, because Saul is there.”</span> <span id="s652">Her boyfriend.</span> <span id="s653">I say, “Oh, God.”</span> <span id="s654">Anyway, make a long story short, we brought Saul back to Salzheim from Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Was it hard to convince Irene and your mother that they should leave home?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Well, [indecipherable] she is going to have her Saul, she doesn’t care what it could be.</span> <span id="s657">Irene was different.</span> <span id="s658">And they got married in Frankfort.</span> <span id="s659">Yeah, I mean my mother and her boyfriend and her name became Mrs. Rothberger.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Was that difficult for you, Bella, that -- to meet up with your mother again and to have her have this boyfriend and your father just had disappeared?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No.</span> <span id="s662">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Was there any effort made to find out what had happened to --</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Oh, I know my father was killed in one of the little towns in -- I would say ‘42, when the Germans liquidated small towns.</span> <span id="s665">Am I sure?</span> <span id="s666">Did I witness it?</span> <span id="s667">Do I have papers?</span> <span id="s668">No, but I know th-that whole area was killed.</span> <span id="s669">Oh, I had the visions.</span> <span id="s670">My father all of a sudden appearing in the United States.</span> <span id="s671">My mother would drop dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: You did have --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: That’s not kind, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: You did have visions of your father [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Well, you know, your mind sometimes say you never know.</span> <span id="s676">After all, there were some people who -- who crawled out of the mass graves and appeared.</span> <span id="s677">So [indecipherable] this possible.</span> <span id="s678">Not probable, but possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Well, you really weren’t very attached to your father, personally, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Well, I was more attached to my father than to my mother.</span> <span id="s681">Said, well, she found someone else, you find somebody else.</span> <span id="s682">Maybe he did, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s683">Doesn’t matter to me.</span> <span id="s684">Or didn’t matter to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Were you grieving for him or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I don’t know, it’s very hard to say whether you’re grieving for the [indecipherable] at that time.</span> <span id="s687">After the war, you mean?</span> <span id="s688">Too long a time passed to -- you accept it.</span> <span id="s689">I -- I saw too much of it.</span> <span id="s690">Thousands and thousands of people being sent to death.</span> <span id="s691">I saw children being knocked in the walls.</span> <span id="s692">It’s -- you just get some -- kind of hardened to the whole -- because they --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did you ever reach a point when -- when you felt a personal loss -- felt a particular loss of your father, as [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: As a father?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Not as a father, as a person.</span> <span id="s697">As someone who was my father.</span> <span id="s698">We were never close, but hey, he was my father, he was kind, he was nice, he was bright, intelligent.</span> <span id="s699">Was probably selfish -- you know, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s700">It wasn’t that loving -- loving union of father, mother, child.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: And was Irene -- did Irene have a different kind of relationship with your parents than you did, or was the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Well, she was so much younger.</span> <span id="s703">My father adored her.</span> <span id="s704">My mother adored me, so -- adored -- she really liked me.</span> <span id="s705">You see, my mother was a very beautiful woman and when she looked at me and I was younger, she says, “I looked just like my Bella.”</span> <span id="s706">That was her pride.</span> <span id="s707">[indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s708">I wouldn’t take time to analyze this, it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s709">She was what she was and that’s the best she knew how to do it.</span> <span id="s710">I couldn’t fix her life just like she couldn’t fix my life, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: You described how you were working with the -- the unrah and hiya and helping with -- with the immigration process.</span> <span id="s712">Did you get a sense through that work of the overarching policy issues involved with -- with Jewish immigration and some of the -- I mean some of the things that were going on on national levels, like this, the United States having very strict quotas and having a lot of [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Oh yeah, I was aware of that -- by the way Ike and I got the job, through Henry.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Henry?</span> <span id="s715">Hank?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Hank.</span> <span id="s717">Henry - Hank.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s719">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: Our Hank.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: You told that story in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: In the first interview, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: He was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Funny guy.</span> <span id="s727">Well, we were fully aware that the United States has a quota system and the largest quota was for the German Jews.</span> <span id="s728">The smallest quota -- or one of the small quotas was for the Poles and the Russians.</span> <span id="s729">But then, with the Truman’s doctrine of letting people in, we knew that that wasn’t that strict any more.</span> <span id="s730">They still would let in a certain amount of Jews and the guy they send from hiyas to take care of the immigration, came here before the immigration was opened.</span> <span id="s731">And he was very well versed in the laws of immigration.</span> <span id="s732">That’s when he paired off with Hank and he said, “I need some help.”</span> <span id="s733">So we were elected to help him.</span> <span id="s734">And he wanted to have papers ready when the immigration starts.</span> <span id="s735">And he knew there is going to be just a very short time before the year ends -- I don’t know, just a month or two, whatever, time.</span> <span id="s736">So he worked very hard and he worked us very hard to try to get some documents ready, so when the consul -- and his name was Hoffman -- who came from the States, when he opened his office here, we had stacks of applicants ready.</span> <span id="s737">But it was hard work, because Germany had nothing.</span> <span id="s738">No documents, no paper, no pencils, no photographs, no -- we had to [indecipherable] so we really worked, day and night.</span> <span id="s739">And since we worked for the hiyas, we had access to the PX.</span> <span id="s740">So we were getting cigarettes and that was a value which people respected, not money.</span> <span id="s741">Couldn’t buy anything.</span> <span id="s742">But with our cigarettes, we used to get the photographer, we used to get papers, pencils, whatever was needed.</span> <span id="s743">And we would transport these people back and forth, to have the papers ready.</span> <span id="s744">So when the immigration opened, hiyas had 90 -- oh, I don’t remember what the percentage, but the largest percen-percentage of refugees were going to the States.</span> <span id="s745">Joint came after them and they -- there were other organizations, but we had it all ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Did you have any connection with hiyas when you were heading over to the States?</span> <span id="s747">You mentioned that you were still --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Well, we were in -- we escorted the immigrants or the refugees, so -- the survivors -- whatever you want to call.</span> <span id="s749">We were [indecipherable] on the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: You and Ike and Hank?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s752">No, Hank wasn’t on it.</span> <span id="s753">It was a small [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: So you were really -- that gave you -- that basically gave you your ticket to come here, the fact that you worked with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: We worked for them and we’re getting paid, but we did not collect the money.</span> <span id="s758">We collected the money when he -- we got to the States, from the hiyas.</span> <span id="s759">And theoretically -- excuse me -- people were supposed to pay eventually, for the voyage.</span> <span id="s760">Well, nobody did.</span> <span id="s761">But we felt, anyway, Ike and I felt, we make the money, so we pay the voyage.</span> <span id="s762">For myself, for Ike and for Irene.</span> <span id="s763">See, that’s what our salary for working in Germany went to.</span> <span id="s764">We probably one of the few ones who ever paid for the voyage.</span> <span id="s765">I don’t know, I didn’t check the statistics, but I would assume so.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: What about your mother and Saul?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Oh, they came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: But all -- were all of you able to come because of --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Through my --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: -- sponsorship through s-someone in Ike’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Well, no, I think that the first ones were through affidavits of relatives who were sending the people to the States.</span> <span id="s774">And Ike had a sister here.</span> <span id="s775">I think she sponsored us.</span> <span id="s776">Or, he had an uncle.</span> <span id="s777">Well, sponsoring did not cost you any money, you know.</span> <span id="s778">And then lots of people came, I think, later -- or even that time.</span> <span id="s779">I don’t quite remember, because the Truman’s declaration, that he’s letting in that many survivors into the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: There was a mention in -- in the first interview also, of just -- of knowing that you didn’t want to be in an area that was going to be under Soviet control.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Oh, that was in Germany.</span> <span id="s782">That’s when we got to Mande -- to Frankfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: And was that -- did you have any sense of -- how did you know that -- that there was a -- that you didn’t want that, that you wanted to be [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Well, we knew what the Russians stood for, from before the war.</span> <span id="s785">We know what the Communist regime was all about.</span> <span id="s786">And we certainly didn’t want to be under their jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s787">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s789">I -- I wanted to ask you about how you reali -- when you realized that the war was over and that you were free and how that -- how that knowledge came to you and what your feelings were.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, when -- when we were in Magdeburg, one day an SS woman came to the gates of the Magdeburg camp and said the Americans are in town.</span> <span id="s791">And all of a sudden, the SS disappeared, the guards disappeared.</span> <span id="s792">And the survivors were standing there, realizing that they free.</span> <span id="s793">Well, it’s a very hard concept, after five years, saying, “You free.”</span> <span id="s794">You free what?</span> <span id="s795">You free where?</span> <span id="s796">You free -- we were in a strange city.</span> <span id="s797">We never ventured out.</span> <span id="s798">We didn’t know what to do with ourselves.</span> <span id="s799">So the majority went back home, to camp, without the supervisement of the Germans.</span> <span id="s800">And they had a ball, they stormed the food supplies, they had a party, they were free.</span> <span id="s801">My husband and my girlfriend, her boyfriend [indecipherable] said, “I didn’t see the Americans.</span> <span id="s802">I am not going back to camp.”</span> <span id="s803">So we left the camp and we wandered around a little bit.</span> <span id="s804">And the Germans had those huts or homes they didn’t live in.</span> <span id="s805">Because they heard the -- the Germans are going back, we occupied one of those homes.</span> <span id="s806">We went down to the basement and we’re waiting to see what happens.</span> <span id="s807">My girlfriends says the next morning, “I want to go to camp.</span> <span id="s808">Hey, that’s where all the life is.”</span> <span id="s809">So Bessie and her boyfriend went to camp and came back within 10 minutes saying that the camp was surrounded during the night, because the Americans did not appear.</span> <span id="s810">And the people were sent out of camp on a march towards Berlin.</span> <span id="s811">So we stayed there for about two weeks, hidden in the basement, until one day we hear the Germans civilians coming into the house and chasing us all out.</span> <span id="s812">So my husband, who again, had a lot of freedom in Magdeburg and the camp, knew some Russian women who were working in polter too.</span> <span id="s813">And they said, “He’s not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s814">And they pulled him out of the column the Germans surrounded.</span> <span id="s815">Well, he wouldn’t go without me, so he pulled me out.</span> <span id="s816">So I was with him and all of a sudden one of the meisters, for whom I was working, pointed at me, he says, “She works for me, she’s Jewish.”</span> <span id="s817">So I had to go back.</span> <span id="s818">And he wouldn’t go without me, no matter how much I pleaded.</span> <span id="s819">So he came back too.</span> <span id="s820">And we were on the march towards Berlin.</span> <span id="s821">So we crossed the river and found ourselves on the other town -- part of town -- of Magdeburg.</span> <span id="s822">Elba was the dividing part -- divided the part in two things, so we found ourselves on the other part.</span> <span id="s823">There was a lot of shooting, all night long.</span> <span id="s824">It was a miserable night and every time the shooting started, the guards which were sending -- leading us out, made us lie down on the ground and wait until the shooting went over.</span> <span id="s825">At one point my husband said, “Next time when they tell us to get out, it’s so dark, we stay put.”</span> <span id="s826">Which we did.</span> <span id="s827">So the column continued, we stayed behind.</span> <span id="s828">We went in the other direction, we didn’t know where we going.</span> <span id="s829">We all spoke perving -- perfect German.</span> <span id="s830">So we did see some German soldiers, motorcycles and they were ep -- talking to us in German, just complaining about the weather, the shooting and we answered in German like we one of them.</span> <span id="s831">And we finally found a place in a house where we hid.</span> <span id="s832">We were there for about three days, but we always hid in the basement, just to be sure that we not spotted immediately.</span> <span id="s833">Comfort of life was not our priority.</span> <span id="s834">And then we hear some people coming upstairs and saying.</span> <span id="s835">“I know there are Jews here.</span> <span id="s836">We going to come and we going to find them.”</span> <span id="s837">Didn’t occur to them to get down to the basement.</span> <span id="s838">So we decided it’s time to leave.</span> <span id="s839">So, during the day, early in the morning, we, the four of us left.</span> <span id="s840">We didn’t know where to go, so we saw a name of a street, passa -- Pashall was the name.</span> <span id="s841">So we [indecipherable], that’s in the direction of Pashall, now we know where we going, we going to Pashall.</span> <span id="s842">So that’s what he did and there were lots of other people who were walking the streets.</span> <span id="s843">We get to a certain part and all of a sudden we see a German installation.</span> <span id="s844">But it was too late to turn back without saying, hey, why are they running away -- so we just continued.</span> <span id="s845">And a guy from that installation approached us and said, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s846">Now, we had a name, so that’s where we are going and he says, “Why you going there?”</span> <span id="s847">And we says, “Well, we have our place there, we used to work there and we going back to our position.”</span> <span id="s848">And he says, “Well, I have a problem.</span> <span id="s849">The Germans left the installation at night and I came over and there is a beautiful desk I like to take home.</span> <span id="s850">But my [indecipherable] broke down.</span> <span id="s851">If you not in a hurry, if you can help me bring that home, I would appreciate it.”</span> <span id="s852">So we said, “Hey, we have no place to go anyway.”</span> <span id="s853">So we offered -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: This is tape number two, side B, of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: So we went to his house.</span> <span id="s856">He was living in a basement with his girlfriend and her niece and two little boys and some chickens and whatnot.</span> <span id="s857">So we stayed with him for awhile, started talking to him and we said to him, “Hey, there are such beautiful things in that installation.</span> <span id="s858">Why don’t you bring some more to your house?</span> <span id="s859">We help you.</span> <span id="s860">We don’t mind staying.”</span> <span id="s861">So, make a long story short, we stayed there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s862">In the meantime, his girlfriend’s niece was dating German soldiers.</span> <span id="s863">So they were coming for a visit at -- in the evening.</span> <span id="s864">So we all socialized.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: But this is before the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: That was before the war ended.</span> <span id="s867">Just shortly before the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: So we’re in maybe April --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: A day.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: -- May, early May.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah it was Ap -- end of --</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: April.</span> <span id="s874">As a matter of fact, when we were brought over the other side of the Elba, we -- all of a sudden, here’s Americans.</span> <span id="s875">Loudspeakers -- American loudspeakers.</span> <span id="s876">They did enter that part of Magdeburg which we just left.</span> <span id="s877">But we were on the other side.</span> <span id="s878">So anyway, we stayed there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s879">She was bringing her German boyfriends and we started talking and they say, “Hey.”</span> <span id="s880">They didn’t know who we are.</span> <span id="s881">We didn’t tell them that we’re Jews.</span> <span id="s882">And he said, “Hey, why don’t you come to our quarters, we have so much food left.</span> <span id="s883">You can take it home with you.”</span> <span id="s884">Say, “Oh, my God.”</span> <span id="s885">But his girlfriend was very insisting.</span> <span id="s886">So I made two trips there and I brought some food and she introduced me to the leader of the town and said, it’s my cousin, we should get food rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: So we stayed there for two weeks.</span> <span id="s889">And one day, the German soldiers who were coming to visit her -- her niece, said that they got orders to march out and they are furious.</span> <span id="s890">The country is abandoning them.</span> <span id="s891">They are not going to go to the Russians.</span> <span id="s892">They want to go to the amies -- which was a term for the Americans.</span> <span id="s893">So we had an offer for them.</span> <span id="s894">We want to go there, too.</span> <span id="s895">At that point, we all found German uniforms in that bunker -- that installation.</span> <span id="s896">So we all were dressed in German uniforms.</span> <span id="s897">So we said, “We want to go there, too.”</span> <span id="s898">So we made a date with them for the next day to meet.</span> <span id="s899">They going to desert their unit, they going to come with us and we all going to go to the Americans.</span> <span id="s900">Sounds ridiculous.</span> <span id="s901">My husband and the owner of the place where we stayed with, went for a walk, and they found a boat.</span> <span id="s902">It didn’t have oars, but it was a boat.</span> <span id="s903">So my husband went back, he was very handy.</span> <span id="s904">They made oars and they were all ready to go to the amies.</span> <span id="s905">So sure enough, next day, we met with the German soldiers, we had a white flag and we all marched to the boat to go over on the other side.</span> <span id="s906">As we were doing all that, some civilians come over and he said they use the boat a day before.</span> <span id="s907">They went over to the Americans, but they were wearing civilian clothes, so the Americans send them back.</span> <span id="s908">They were only taking prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s909">So at that point, we had the uniforms, we were seven German soldiers.</span> <span id="s910">Two women in German uniforms.</span> <span id="s911">We took the boat, a white flag and they were all -- the German soldiers had all their guns ready, if the Hitler yugen will stops them, they going to shoot.</span> <span id="s912">We got to the other side of the Elba, we pushed the boat into the water so they couldn’t send us back.</span> <span id="s913">And now we were waiti -- wait -- waiting for the Americans.</span> <span id="s914">It took quite awhile until we saw any patrol.</span> <span id="s915">But finally a patrol comes and stop and search for ammunition.</span> <span id="s916">We didn’t have any and they were taking us to the headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Let’s pause that.</span> <span id="s918">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Well, by May first, we found ourselves under the American -- I don’t know what to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Juris --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: American zone or American jurisdiction and to us the war was over, also officially the war did not end until May seventh or eighth I think.</span> <span id="s922">But we felt free.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Did you start getting news at that point, that you hadn’t had before, about what was going on in the w --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s925">We had no radio, but we just were in touch with the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s926">They used to come and visit us and so we knew that the war is coming to an end.</span> <span id="s927">But they were still the fighting troops.</span> <span id="s928">And [indecipherable] the war ended May seventh or eighth, officially.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Do you remember finding out about the -- the official end of the war, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: It was just one of those transi-transitions.</span> <span id="s931">Not only are we free, but Germany was defeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Were you seeking out news of -- of what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: There was no way of seeking out.</span> <span id="s934">From whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: The American soldiers, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Well, the American soldiers were telling us what they knew and they just said the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: How did -- how did -- was that a -- an ex -- an exhilarating moment, an exciting --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Oh, it certainly was, because hey, the Germans are defeated, and we are not under the Russian jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s939">Both of those things was thrills.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And so we -- we went back a little bit to that, and then you -- you were telling me before we talked about that -- about your boat trip over to the -- to the States and being an escort and you mentioned that -- that you had been very ill on the boat --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: -- ride.</span> <span id="s943">What was your role as an escort?</span> <span id="s944">Were you just -- were you supposed to do -- just ride along --</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: And did you have any idea what you would be doing when you arrived in the States?</span> <span id="s947">Would you -- di -- were you going to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: No, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s949">I was still a young girl with no profession, no education, no -- no, I had no idea what we will be doing, or -- we just knew that we will have to build some kind of a life.</span> <span id="s950">We did know that eventually we will have to go to Peoria, Illinois, where my husband’s sister lived.</span> <span id="s951">So we stayed in New York for about two weeks and then we headed to Peoria, Illinois.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Was there a sense that hiyas was going to help you in some way once you got to --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: No, we were finished with hiyas.</span> <span id="s954">We were finished, we were on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Do you remember arriving, the moment -- the moment that you -- that you saw the shore, or did you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Oh, the Statue of Liberty and it was just, hey, we made it.</span> <span id="s957">We not only free from the Germans, we free from Europe and now we are in the United States.</span> <span id="s958">But we had no plans of whatever life is going to be.</span> <span id="s959">One thing at a time, that was enough -- feeling of, great, we here.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Where did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Where?</span> <span id="s962">We stayed with my husband’s cousins in their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: And how did you get to Illinois?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Do you remember seeing -- your first images of the -- of the countryside, looking out the window?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Oh, it was great.</span> <span id="s967">Not any special, memorable thing except New York City.</span> <span id="s968">I mean that view at night in Central Park and having all the tall buildings and lights in the buildings and knowing that they are families and life and whatnot, that was terrific.</span> <span id="s969">It’s the first time I met my sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s970">Peoria was a small town, with very pretty -- with a very affluent Jewish population.</span> <span id="s971">We were the first survivors they ever met and were very nice to us, offered us money and this and that.</span> <span id="s972">Well, we really weren’t interested in getting money, we were interested in establishing a life, which was very difficult, because we didn’t speak English.</span> <span id="s973">My husband was a civil engineer.</span> <span id="s974">Couldn’t get very far without English.</span> <span id="s975">I had no trade, no profession, so things were difficult.</span> <span id="s976">My sister-in-law was not the most pleasant person.</span> <span id="s977">She just lost her husband, she was very jealous of Irene, because she had a son pretty much Irene’s age and we showered Irene with our love.</span> <span id="s978">She was a part of our life.</span> <span id="s979">So things were not easy.</span> <span id="s980">I finally got a job at Princess Peggy.</span> <span id="s981">They were making casual housedresses.</span> <span id="s982">But I didn’t know anything about the sewing machine, couldn’t communicate with the girls -- they were very nice to me, so they put me with a bunch of fabric to put together.</span> <span id="s983">I never accomplished anything, so towards the end of the day, the supervisor came over, ripped what I did, took her five minutes, she put it together.</span> <span id="s984">It was not a pleasant way of life.</span> <span id="s985">And then we got letter that my mother and her boyfriend are arriving to New York.</span> <span id="s986">So my husband said, “Fine.</span> <span id="s987">I am going to pick them up and you stay with Irene here.”</span> <span id="s988">So that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s989">He got to New York, he writes me a letter saying, “I want you to meet me in New York.”</span> <span id="s990">And the responsibility of telling to my sister-in-law that we are leaving her was up to me.</span> <span id="s991">It wasn’t very pleasant.</span> <span id="s992">She was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s993">So Irene and I just bordered the train and left for New York.</span> <span id="s994">He had no intentions of coming back to Peoria.</span> <span id="s995">So now we are in New York --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Before you go on, I was interested in hearing whether any of his family asked you about what had ha -- whether she asked you about what had happened or any of his family asked you about what had happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: No, we did not have too much conversation.</span> <span id="s998">We didn’t communicate too well.</span> <span id="s999">She was one of those princesses from Riga and I was just a girl from Poland, which she kind of resented that her brother married below his level, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So she had been -- had she emigrated from Riga?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: They immigrated from Riga in ‘41.</span> <span id="s1002">They left the last -- he was a correspondence for a London newspaper.</span> <span id="s1003">And they left Riga with the last boat, which was carrying the gold of Latvia.</span> <span id="s1004">So they made it through and they came to the States, before.</span> <span id="s1005">So anyway, we got to New York and a cousin of my husband’s had a beauty parlor.</span> <span id="s1006">So he offered me a job as a receptionist.</span> <span id="s1007">I was as miserable as could be.</span> <span id="s1008">Every time I heard the phone ringing and me having to answer the prima donna’s asking about the beauty parlor, appointments.</span> <span id="s1009">My English was so poor, that it really was tough.</span> <span id="s1010">And one day a girlfriend of Irene’s, whom I also kno -- knew from Salzheim said, “Bella, I work for my uncle.</span> <span id="s1011">I am going to get you a job.”</span> <span id="s1012">So that was great for me.</span> <span id="s1013">And I took a job with -- in her uncle’s factory and I stayed there for 30 some years.</span> <span id="s1014">I got promoted from doing manual work, to becoming a supervisor and -- so I stayed with them for 31 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: What was the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Well, they manufactured watchbands.</span> <span id="s1017">The mo -- the only one in the States of very specialized watchbands.</span> <span id="s1018">So the girls like me and Bella -- that was her name -- brought a lot of her friends to that and we were sitting and wrapping the watchbands in packages to be shipped out.</span> <span id="s1019">But then the boss pulled me out of there and he gave me a job in the office -- as -- in a supervisory job and -- so that was pretty good.</span> <span id="s1020">My husband had it much tougher.</span> <span id="s1021">He was a civil engineer.</span> <span id="s1022">And there was no job for civil engineers in the United States -- for Jewish civil engineers.</span> <span id="s1023">He got a job, they were delighted with his work.</span> <span id="s1024">He build their office in Manhattan and he’s direct -- the boss said, “I am going to try to get you as a permanent member of our company.”</span> <span id="s1025">But there was a lot of opposition because he was Jewish and he did not get the job.</span> <span id="s1026">So he finally found work as a carpenter in a factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Was that explicitly stated, that he couldn’t -- that the opposition was because he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: You mean did he get a letter stating so?</span> <span id="s1029">No, but he was given to understand that unfortunately, there was a lot of opposition on the board, to hire a Jewish civil engineer.</span> <span id="s1030">And at that point we didn’t have laws, discrimination and whatnot, so they were free to do as they choose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Was that shocking to you, that -- that in America --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: A little bit, yes, it was.</span> <span id="s1033">So anyway, he worked as a carpenter in the factory for many years.</span> <span id="s1034">And life was pretty hard.</span> <span id="s1035">I was making little money, he was making little money.</span> <span id="s1036">We had a furnished apartment.</span> <span id="s1037">Irene was living with us.</span> <span id="s1038">I insisted on sending her to school.</span> <span id="s1039">So that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Did you -- did you meet up with any of your friends at this point from -- from -- during the war, who you’d been with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1042">We -- you know, they all congregated in New York and we were getting together.</span> <span id="s1043">The problem was that my husband was older.</span> <span id="s1044">When he got to camp, he already was used to certain recognition and respect.</span> <span id="s1045">He had that education, he had a degree.</span> <span id="s1046">Whereas -- the rest of our friends, who were so much younger, got out of concentration camps still being very young, with no education, very ambitious.</span> <span id="s1047">My husband was not ambitious.</span> <span id="s1048">So he kind of felt, I guess, sorry for himself or whatever.</span> <span id="s1049">He did attempt -- he enrolled to college, but dropped out.</span> <span id="s1050">It was just something he wasn’t used to.</span> <span id="s1051">And he really was not that ambitious to do something about it.</span> <span id="s1052">Life was not unhappy, but it was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: When did that change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: I’m trying to think.</span> <span id="s1055">We eventually, from that one room apartment -- and it -- housing was very hard to come by at that time, we got an apartment through my girlfriend Trudy, who was working in a hospital, we got -- we -- her patient was moving out and we got an apartment in Astoria and that’s where our son was born.</span> <span id="s1056">And we lived there for one year and then we bought a house.</span> <span id="s1057">And I figured out, hey, that’s going to be my palace.</span> <span id="s1058">We stayed there for about maybe a year -- a year and a half and one of the people we knew from Germany came to the States and his cousin came from Uruguay to visit him.</span> <span id="s1059">That guy, Mr. Kussman, was living in Schenectedy, New York.</span> <span id="s1060">And he was a builder.</span> <span id="s1061">But he needed someone to build a plan for water supply.</span> <span id="s1062">Well, my husband had that qualification and he said, “I give you a job in Schenectedy.</span> <span id="s1063">It’s going to be your field, but you have to make up your mind.”</span> <span id="s1064">So over the weekend, my husband approached me and he says, “What do you think if we move to Schenectedy?”</span> <span id="s1065">Well, that was the last thing I wanted to do in my life.</span> <span id="s1066">“What’s Schenectedy?</span> <span id="s1067">I don’t know a living soul, my friends are in New York, we have a house, my sister is here.”</span> <span id="s1068">She was already married, you know.</span> <span id="s1069">And then I thought it over.</span> <span id="s1070">He is working as a laborer in a factory.</span> <span id="s1071">That gives him an opportunity to go -- get back to his trade, so I said okay.</span> <span id="s1072">So within two weeks he quit his job, he went to Schenectedy.</span> <span id="s1073">I stayed with Jeff, trying to sell our house here.</span> <span id="s1074">Took about three months and then I moved to Schenectedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: What year was it -- what year was it that you moved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Oh, it must have been ‘56.</span> <span id="s1077">Jeff was about four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: He was born in ‘52?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: ‘50 - ‘51, so -- some-something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: And a few questions about your -- your very first years there.</span> <span id="s1081">You had -- you had reunited with some of your friends from -- from the war.</span> <span id="s1082">Did you have other friendships too that you were able to form during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Some, but not very close ones.</span> <span id="s1084">There was a language barrier.</span> <span id="s1085">There was a different of upbringing and culture.</span> <span id="s1086">So we mostly associated with people we knew from during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: Did you feel that your Holocaust experiences in some way distanced you from people who had not been through that and not known.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: No, because the Holocaust was not spoken about at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Even among your friends who were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Oh, among our friends, yes, but we always said, remember this, remember that.</span> <span id="s1091">And always try to go back to the funny parts of our life in camp and not the horrors or distractions or whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: So you weren’t dwelling on what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: You were moving on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Just trying to fit in to the society.</span> <span id="s1096">I knew society is not going to change for me.</span> <span id="s1097">So I have to fit in to society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Were there any peculiarities about American culture -- society, that -- that surprised you or things that you noticed that you thought were distinctly American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Well they didn’t surprise me, but there were a lot of things which were distinctly American.</span> <span id="s1100">European lived differently than the Americans.</span> <span id="s1101">Their interests were different, the -- but then, I belonged to the European society, I didn’t quite belong to the American society, not at that time.</span> <span id="s1102">But it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1103">I made friends with the baker, with the meat supplier, whatever.</span> <span id="s1104">It never bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Was there a point at which you felt you did belong to American society [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Eventually, but many years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Was it -- is there anything that you can identify that -- that sort of was a moment that you -- that you recognized, yes, I belong here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Well, it wasn’t a moment, but the things I got involved with, things I was doing, I wasn’t necessary seeking out Jews from concentration camp or Jews period.</span> <span id="s1109">So that we kind of fitted in -- made our feese -- when I got to Schenectedy, there was entirely different story.</span> <span id="s1110">In the beginning I hated it.</span> <span id="s1111">It was lonely, it was dreary , it was unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1112">I didn’t know anyone.</span> <span id="s1113">But then I made very good friends with my neighbors and after that many years, we still are friends.</span> <span id="s1114">It seems that when I do finally make friends, they for life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Was there a Jewish community there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: If there was, I was not involved in it.</span> <span id="s1117">But some of my neighbors were not Jewish, but I still correspond with them, we still talk to each other.</span> <span id="s1118">And that’s -- my God, 40 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Was anyone interested in your experiences, or asked you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: I didn’t talk about them, so they didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s1121">I did not have a single out -- I am a survivor.</span> <span id="s1122">So they didn’t know and if they did know they would be hesitant to approach me, thinking that it would be painful.</span> <span id="s1123">So we really didn’t touch on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Did you want to touch on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: I didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Did it -- did you feel that there was any importance to -- in -- on a grander scale, the American public understanding what had happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Not at that point.</span> <span id="s1128">Because there really was no communication for about 10 years between the survivors and the American public.</span> <span id="s1129">They didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1130">We didn’t want to talk about it, there was just no common ground or no reason.</span> <span id="s1131">Their -- Holocaust was not something you spoke about.</span> <span id="s1132">So yes, that was not a part of conversations.</span> <span id="s1133">But I have to tell you that the friends I made in Schenectedy, they weren’t all Jewish.</span> <span id="s1134">As a matter of fact, the majority was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1135">But Schenectedy was a transitoim -- it was a GE town, so a lot of young, upcoming engineers were located in Schenectedy for their training.</span> <span id="s1136">So they were always out their home base, so it was easy to make friends and their children were the same age my son was.</span> <span id="s1137">The unfortunates thing, after we were about a year and a half in Schenectedy, my husband comes home one evening and said, on a Friday night, “I no longer have a job.”</span> <span id="s1138">The guy who offered him the job -- it was someone -- we were very instrumental of bringing him to the States, because first of all, there was a lot of hatred towards him among Jews in camp.</span> <span id="s1139">So we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Hatred towards whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Towards that guy.</span> <span id="s1142">You know, he was a capo, all that bit.</span> <span id="s1143">So we fixed an affidavit for him and we were instrumental in bringing him over to the States.</span> <span id="s1144">So he -- oh, in the beginning he was offering us gold and diamonds and -- as a token of appreciation what we did for him.</span> <span id="s1145">Which we didn’t take from him because I didn’t think it was right.</span> <span id="s1146">He doesn’t have to pay us for a job we supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1147">Anyway, he comes home one -- my husband comes home one Friday night and he says, “Darling, I no longer have a job.”</span> <span id="s1148">The plant was finished.</span> <span id="s1149">That was the purpose of bringing him to Schenectedy and once the job was finish, he did not feel obliged that he should give him another position.</span> <span id="s1150">So we sold our house in Bayside, we moved to Schenectedy.</span> <span id="s1151">My husband gave a -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Sold the house in Bayside, we parted from our friends.</span> <span id="s1154">We moved to Schenectedy, we bought a house there and after a year -- or shortly after that, my husband was out of a job.</span> <span id="s1155">There were no other jobs available in Schenectedy, it was a GE town.</span> <span id="s1156">Also the economic situation in the States was not very hot -- hot.</span> <span id="s1157">He could not get a job for about eight weeks.</span> <span id="s1158">Trying all cities, whoever we had friends.</span> <span id="s1159">Boston, other places, until finally he got a job -- read in the paper that someone needs a supervisor of construction, he got a job.</span> <span id="s1160">He moved in with Carl and Irene in New York and I stayed with Jeff in Schenectedy until I was ready to sell the house there.</span> <span id="s1161">In the meantime, Andy was born, Irene and Carl’s son.</span> <span id="s1162">They came to visit often.</span> <span id="s1163">So my husband was in New York, I was in Schenectedy and after Andy was about eight months old, Carl and Irene said, “You know, it’s time for us to look for better quarters for our son.”</span> <span id="s1164">They had a furnished apartment in Astoria.</span> <span id="s1165">So they went on a search for a house.</span> <span id="s1166">We had very little money.</span> <span id="s1167">Irene and Carl had very little money.</span> <span id="s1168">Carl was going to law school.</span> <span id="s1169">Irene was working a little bit until Andy was born.</span> <span id="s1170">Anyway, to make a long story short, we found a house in Beachhurst.</span> <span id="s1171">It was a old house which needed an awful lot of work.</span> <span id="s1172">But the price was good.</span> <span id="s1173">We took a 3000 dollar mortgage from my parents.</span> <span id="s1174">We bought the house and we moved in.</span> <span id="s1175">And we spent five years of fixing it, because we didn’t have enough money to fix all of it and my husband was the only one who could do things.</span> <span id="s1176">So we spent five long years, weekend and weekend out, building walls, tearing up ceilings and so on.</span> <span id="s1177">And we lived in that house.</span> <span id="s1178">Well, I just sold it two months ago.</span> <span id="s1179">So it was not occupied for the past 10 years, because Carl got promoted, he went to bigger things.</span> <span id="s1180">The house was no longer presentable enough for a big executive of Pete Mullerg.</span> <span id="s1181">They moved to Cleveland, we stayed in New York.</span> <span id="s1182">And my husband literally did not have a permanent job.</span> <span id="s1183">He could not get a permanent job.</span> <span id="s1184">He was promised a partnership with a boss who was building houses in Brooklyn and he did build a few houses.</span> <span id="s1185">And the Sunday, they were meeting, his boss dropped dead.</span> <span id="s1186">That was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: You mean he -- he had a heart attack, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: I -- I think he did have a heart attack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: So that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: So this is when you -- when your husband lost his job in Schenectedy, this is late 50’s, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And he’s -- when he’s getting -- he’s looking for another job and -- and -- you had mentioned that he had had -- originally had trouble finding work as a civil engineer because he was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1194">Did you start to feel like that had -- was changing?</span> <span id="s1195">I mean the -- the country is going through starting to look at civil rights issues and discrimination --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Not at that point.</span> <span id="s1197">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s1198">It was just a fact of life here.</span> <span id="s1199">There are certain professions which are closed to Jews, what else is new?</span> <span id="s1200">Jews are not welcome everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: When did you see that start to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: Oh, much, much later, but I really didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: How long do you think it took?</span> <span id="s1204">I mean when -- when did -- when did you really --</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Well, that was 60’s -- when did it change?</span> <span id="s1206">I don’t know, late 70’s?</span> <span id="s1207">At that point it didn’t matter, because my husband got very sick with cancer.</span> <span id="s1208">He was sick for seven years.</span> <span id="s1209">I was working.</span> <span id="s1210">Jeff, at that time was out of the house, he went to college.</span> <span id="s1211">Was very important to both of us that he get the best possible education available.</span> <span id="s1212">So he went to -- he was very bright, he went to Dartmouth and I remember when we enrolled him to Dartmouth, my husband, who was much more practical than I was, he says, “How you going to pay for his college?”</span> <span id="s1213">I say, “Look, we have enough money to pay one year of college.</span> <span id="s1214">I worry about it when the year is up.”</span> <span id="s1215">Well, we made it.</span> <span id="s1216">He did graduate Dartmouth.</span> <span id="s1217">But Booby got sick.</span> <span id="s1218">He was sick for seven years.</span> <span id="s1219">The job he had, as all his jobs, were a fly by night things.</span> <span id="s1220">His boss, a religious Jew, was building nursing homes and was cutting corners everywhere he could.</span> <span id="s1221">And my husband comes home, thi says, “Look hon, I know we don’t have money.</span> <span id="s1222">I won’t have a job.</span> <span id="s1223">I am not going to be part of that scheme.”</span> <span id="s1224">So he quits that job, he got another job, but then he got sick.</span> <span id="s1225">He had no health insurance, he had no benefits, he had nothing.</span> <span id="s1226">But I had insurance through my plant and that’s how we lived.</span> <span id="s1227">Was I unhappy?</span> <span id="s1228">No.</span> <span id="s1229">Was I bitter?</span> <span id="s1230">No.</span> <span id="s1231">All our friends were progressing, became richer and richer, bought business, got education.</span> <span id="s1232">He who had the most ability just took it -- I don’t know, maybe I was a wrong wife for him.</span> <span id="s1233">Maybe I should have been more pushy.</span> <span id="s1234">Maybe I should be more demanding, but that wasn’t my style.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did he resent -- did he resent this -- this country and the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: No, he did not resent his country.</span> <span id="s1237">He was just unhappy with his position.</span> <span id="s1238">Our friends became richer -- richer and richer and -- but that was okay with me.</span> <span id="s1239">So it was rather me who was easily satisfied with what I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Were there other ways that you personally ran into anti-Semitism after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: You didn’t -- did you feel that it -- that it was a particular problem in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: I didn’t, but then I never paid attention to that issue.</span> <span id="s1244">So, after seven years, Booby died.</span> <span id="s1245">He was bedridden for seven years.</span> <span id="s1246">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Do you want some water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: And I was -- no -- I was working and kind of kept -- Jeff was a very independent kind of guy.</span> <span id="s1249">My son, Jeff.</span> <span id="s1250">He finished college, he wanted to go to graduate school and I say, “Jeff, I’ll pay for it, pick a good school.</span> <span id="s1251">You have enta -- your marks are -- you know, Phi Beta Kappa and all that.</span> <span id="s1252">Unfortunately, he pick -- he picked Santa Cruz, California.</span> <span id="s1253">It was not my choice.</span> <span id="s1254">Eventually he realized it was a mistake, after two years.</span> <span id="s1255">He came back to the Boston University, what’s the name?</span> <span id="s1256">I forgot it [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1257">He never did get the Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1258">He was that much from Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1259">At that time he was living with a girl and she was very ambitious and she was going to be just every bit as good as Jeff.</span> <span id="s1260">So they left for California, for Davis, where she got enrolled to her favorite subjects and that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1261">They stayed there.</span> <span id="s1262">They eventually married and after 10 years got divorced.</span> <span id="s1263">But she got her Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1264">But Jeff, I guess he’s -- he has his father’s trend of not being terribly ambitious.</span> <span id="s1265">He loves to work, he loves to do what he is doing.</span> <span id="s1266">He does not like to be a supervisor of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: In his jo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: But he’s doing great.</span> <span id="s1269">She’s doing okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: In his childhood, did he -- did you make any effort to teach him about what your experiences had been or to tell him about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Well, he claims no.</span> <span id="s1272">I claim yes, because when he was much younger, we used to get together with people who were in camp.</span> <span id="s1273">And in-inevitably we were talking about camp.</span> <span id="s1274">It bored him.</span> <span id="s1275">I mean, he heard the stories [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s1276">Now he says, “You didn’t tell me.”</span> <span id="s1277">I said, “Jeff, you weren’t listening.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Did you feel willing to tell him anything?</span> <span id="s1279">Would you be willing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Anything he wanted to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Anything he wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1283">I never suppressed the Holocaust experience.</span> <span id="s1284">So I didn’t have to dig it out.</span> <span id="s1285">So it was not terribly hard for me to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1286">Most of my friends just suppressed it.</span> <span id="s1287">Hank was one of them.</span> <span id="s1288">But I had nothing to suppress, because it was always there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Did you rem-remember everything clearly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s1291">Like my ghetto friend Trudy says, “I forgot most of the things, but you want to know?</span> <span id="s1292">Ask Bella.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Was there a point where people in general started really being interested in -- in what had happened and started asking you?</span> <span id="s1294">Or that you felt the need to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s1296">Like one of my friends from Schenectedy, they Catholics.</span> <span id="s1297">And she says, “Bella, you never told us.”</span> <span id="s1298">I say, “You never asked.”</span> <span id="s1299">You know.</span> <span id="s1300">I was not on a educational tour of enlightening people about the Hol-Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1301">That was not the trend of the country.</span> <span id="s1302">You have to remember that the Holocaust became a big issue, what -- how many years ago?</span> <span id="s1303">10?</span> <span id="s1304">12?</span> <span id="s1305">That’s about [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Were -- were you thinking about it a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Whether I was thinking?</span> <span id="s1308">Well, you have nightmares.</span> <span id="s1309">You can’t help it.</span> <span id="s1310">[indecipherable] they just come there.</span> <span id="s1311">The nightmares I don’t think are brought up by you dwelling or thinking about, they just there.</span> <span id="s1312">Those are things you can never forget, except if you make a conscious effort to suppress it, which I did not.</span> <span id="s1313">Once my husband passed away, I had a job and then I enrolled to Queens College.</span> <span id="s1314">I had to take a equivalency test because I had no papers and then I enrolled to Queens College and I eventually got a degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: In what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Political Science.</span> <span id="s1317">So I think that we became -- when I say we, I mean the survivors, a good -- good citizens of the United States, with a lot of contribution.</span> <span id="s1318">We became doctors, lawyers and professionals and whatnot, you know.</span> <span id="s1319">We did not say, hey, give me welfare.</span> <span id="s1320">Every one of my friends got a excellent education and most of them became professional or businessmen.</span> <span id="s1321">Quite affluent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: When you were getting your education in political science, was -- were there any courses being taught about --</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q: -- Holocaust, that were available to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: No, not at that time.</span> <span id="s1326">I mean, if they would be, I wouldn’t be taking that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: I was w-working towards a degree.</span> <span id="s1329">I was going -- took me 10 years to get my degree.</span> <span id="s1330">I went at night.</span> <span id="s1331">It wasn’t easy after a day’s work, get to college, get your courses, get homework, papers and -- but I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: What year was it that you started?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: ‘77.</span> <span id="s1334">I got my degree in ‘88.</span> <span id="s1335">Slow learner.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Why did you choose political science?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: It interested me.</span> <span id="s1338">I mean, I really did not enroll to get a degree, because I felt at that stage of my life, I don’t need a degree.</span> <span id="s1339">It was just -- I guess, knowledge for the sake of knowledge and also to fill my time, because I was living all alone.</span> <span id="s1340">So I picked and choose courses which interest me.</span> <span id="s1341">They mostly were political science courses.</span> <span id="s1342">And until one day one of my professors calls me and he says, “Bella, how long you going to go to college?</span> <span id="s1343">Forever?</span> <span id="s1344">To what extent?</span> <span id="s1345">You going to apply for a degree?”</span> <span id="s1346">I said, “No, Professor Ludane, I have no intentions.”</span> <span id="s1347">I say, “Well I have intentions.”</span> <span id="s1348">And he really kind of took me by my hand and directed me of getting a degree.</span> <span id="s1349">So yes, a professor or a teacher can make a difference in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Did you -- what were -- what was it that you were learning, was it -- was -- and were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Oh, politics, all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s1352">Oh, I took a course of Islam.</span> <span id="s1353">This interested me, so I was the only white face in the classroom.</span> <span id="s1354">Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: You talked a little earlier about having the ideal before you came here of American -- America possibly being able to nurture that -- your independent spirit more than any place else.</span> <span id="s1356">Did you find that that was true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1358">I think it’s the greatest country.</span> <span id="s1359">I don’t know everything about every country, but from whatever I know, I wouldn’t like to live in any other country but the United States.</span> <span id="s1360">I get very upset when I hear the Americans knocking the country.</span> <span id="s1361">I think they really don’t appreciate what they have.</span> <span id="s1362">You don’t have to agree with everything, but you do not have to mock it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: So even though you have been critical of how they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: -- how they received the refugee -- or didn’t re -- open their arms to refugees [indecipherable] during the Holocaust, you felt -- you felt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: It’s -- so, I was widow for seven years.</span> <span id="s1367">We were on -- always in touch with Hank.</span> <span id="s1368">He used to come and visit Booby, he used to come and visit me.</span> <span id="s1369">We’re on -- always friends.</span> <span id="s1370">Hank was married, he lived in Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1371">Then his wife died of cancer.</span> <span id="s1372">She died, I think after Booby died.</span> <span id="s1373">And anyway, she was dead five years and my husband was dead close to 10 years before we married -- against my wishes.</span> <span id="s1374">He said, “Hey Bella, let’s get married.”</span> <span id="s1375">I said, “Come on, don’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1376">Why do you want to get married?</span> <span id="s1377">What [indecipherable] marriage at that stage of the game?”</span> <span id="s1378">But I can’t put my finger on it and describe it -- whether it makes a difference.</span> <span id="s1379">Whether you married or you just live together.</span> <span id="s1380">If you live together and you really care about each other, you have a commitment.</span> <span id="s1381">You don’t need a judge or a rabbi or a priest or whoever to reinforce it.</span> <span id="s1382">And that was my feeling.</span> <span id="s1383">I mean what do I need that piece of paper from [indecipherable] in eyes of God?</span> <span id="s1384">Who cares.</span> <span id="s1385">But I must say, it does make a difference and I am not quite sure how.</span> <span id="s1386">There is more freedom of interacting with your spouse.</span> <span id="s1387">It’s not live together separate but equal, but live together.</span> <span id="s1388">And I think marriage will do that.</span> <span id="s1389">I don’t think you have to mold your spouse.</span> <span id="s1390">I don’t think you should demand of him.</span> <span id="s1391">But there is just something which is -- I -- I can’t explain it, but I do know it makes a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: When was it that you started to form the kind of relationship with Hank that -- that you could feel that there was some -- a possibility of that kind of relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: He was a pain in the neck.</span> <span id="s1394">He bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: He pursued you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: That’s -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1397">Well, he used to come and visit, I used to come and visit him in Washington.</span> <span id="s1398">We can -- always had something to talk about.</span> <span id="s1399">He introduced me to his friends, I introduced him to my friends.</span> <span id="s1400">But it was like a weekend relationship.</span> <span id="s1401">Not every weekend, but -- but he was always kind, he was always nice.</span> <span id="s1402">I liked the way he approached life and humanity.</span> <span id="s1403">I had no difficulties with that.</span> <span id="s1404">I wasn’t going to educate him any different than what he was.</span> <span id="s1405">And I liked what he was.</span> <span id="s1406">I always liked what he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Had Hank and Booby been friends since --</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Since camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: -- befor -- oh, since camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1411">Hank knew Booby’s mother, because she was a very charitable person, involved in all the Jewish organizations and he once meet -- met her on one of those occa -- at one of those occasions.</span> <span id="s1412">I never [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Did you experience any -- during the -- during the 50’s, there -- there was a -- there was a lot of paranoia about the -- the Soviets, going on, of course, with McCarthy-ism and I wonder, being from Poland and being from some country that had associations as being now a Communist country, did you -- was there a feeling of being sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I hated it.</span> <span id="s1415">I hated it.</span> <span id="s1416">I felt that really does not represent the whole country, but how can people of that little volume, get so much power?</span> <span id="s1417">It was unfair, it was unjust, it was all of the above and I -- since I wasn’t working at that time, Jeff was small, I was glued to the television set.</span> <span id="s1418">And that was an awful time for the United States, politically, I think.</span> <span id="s1419">That anything like that was permitted to take place and so many lives ruined because of some bigot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Did you feel it particularly strongly because of your experiences of being from the area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: No, I felt strongly as a human being with some decency.</span> <span id="s1422">It had nothing to do with my Holocaust experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Or being from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Or being from Poland.</span> <span id="s1425">But as a decent human feeling -- being, I felt strongly that that should not be allowed, just like I feel strongly about lot of things which should not be allowed today -- without mentioning them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: And what about -- were you -- were you aware and following issues during the civil rights era of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: I certainly was.</span> <span id="s1428">I told you, politics and events and what was going on always interested me.</span> <span id="s1429">I became an American.</span> <span id="s1430">I did not consider myself a European any longer.</span> <span id="s1431">I was much too young to -- at that time, when I was in Europe to think of anything that great or that big.</span> <span id="s1432">But I was an intelligent human being and I was certainly following politics of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: What was your -- what was your view on what was going on with the civil rights movement and sit ins and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: It’s a way to fight to get what you want, I guess.</span> <span id="s1435">And if there is a in-injustice done, there are very few other ways of as -- achieving it.</span> <span id="s1436">And I not always approved of it, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Did it remind you in any way -- I mean the kind of persecution that blacks were experiencing in America, did that remind you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: No, I never compared it.</span> <span id="s1439">I don’t think the issues are the same.</span> <span id="s1440">I think the United States was a different country, brought up on their own values or events or whatever.</span> <span id="s1441">I never compared it to Europe.</span> <span id="s1442">Maybe I should -- maybe I’m not that bright, but I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: What about the general idea of someone judging someone else for their race or religion or you know, the -- did -- yo-you weren’t necessarily thinking about how -- that was what -- that was what the Nazis were doing with the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: No.</span> <span id="s1445">I wasn’t comparing the Nazis to whatever happened here.</span> <span id="s1446">It’s just -- should not be -- prejudiced and persecution are just not the right ways.</span> <span id="s1447">Not because they led to the Holocaust of the Jews, but they should not be a part of a country.</span> <span id="s1448">[indecipherable]do you want every human being to feel the same way?</span> <span id="s1449">I feel you’re entitled to your ideas and your principals, but you are not entitled to look down on any other human being.</span> <span id="s1450">Just like you should not go overboard admiring and catering to someone you think is so wonderful.</span> <span id="s1451">He’s wonderful because that’s his mindset.</span> <span id="s1452">That’s the way he conducts himself.</span> <span id="s1453">So you admire people who are -- in your mind, have a proper mindset and you dislike people who don’t.</span> <span id="s1454">But it’s all on a personal basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Were there any political issues that you were particularly fascinated with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Almost everything what was taking place.</span> <span id="s1457">Except the financial market and I wasn’t very well versed in that.</span> <span id="s1458">But politically almost every issue is an exciting issue.</span> <span id="s1459">And some of them are -- have a everlasting result.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Now, I don’t know whether you realize and that’s neither a plus or a minus to my personality as far as I’m concerned, but I’m not fighting for the issues.</span> <span id="s1462">And maybe that’s not the proper approach if you want some issues to come to being, but I’m just not.</span> <span id="s1463">I guess I’m too cynical to do that.</span> <span id="s1464">So I can only fight it in my own way, with my own action and my own attitude.</span> <span id="s1465">If everybody would be like me, we would have no progress or regress.</span> <span id="s1466">But that’s my personality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: If you could -- if you -- do you think that it’s possible to just -- let me see if I can formulate this question.</span> <span id="s1468">Before the -- before the war, you -- you were saying you didn’t have -- you didn’t have any par -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: This is tape number three, side B of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky.</span> <span id="s1470">And I was just going to ask -- so, before the war, you -- there was no -- there was no particularly strong interest or one thing that -- that really got you going or that grabbed you or that you can say, this is what I believe in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Oh, I can see what I believed in, but there was no special issue I was involved in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: What -- what -- wh-wh -- what -- what’s -- what do you believe in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: This sounds corny.</span> <span id="s1474">I want people to get along with each other, without pushing their ideas.</span> <span id="s1475">Without saying, “If you don’t feel like I do, you’re wrong.”</span> <span id="s1476">And since I am not a part of any political organization or civic organization, I can only do what I can do as an individual and that’s how I conduct myself.</span> <span id="s1477">Towards my friends, towards my neighbors, towards my associates.</span> <span id="s1478">Towards everyone I know.</span> <span id="s1479">Hank and I did not always see eye to eye.</span> <span id="s1480">He had certain ideas about issues and people and I had certain ideas about issues and people.</span> <span id="s1481">But we could always discuss it without getting angry, without trying to convince each other that’s different.</span> <span id="s1482">But we could always, always express it.</span> <span id="s1483">There was just such a unbelievable harmony between the two of us.</span> <span id="s1484">I am usually not a person -- I wasn’t -- to really express my deep feelings to anybody.</span> <span id="s1485">Hank probably was the only person I could do it.</span> <span id="s1486">There was nothing I felt I should hold back and not say it because it might not sound good or nice or he might agree or disagree.</span> <span id="s1487">It was just such a open relationship that I wish it on every married couple and I think people would be much happier, instead of always fighting each other for some stupid principle.</span> <span id="s1488">Express your principle and let it go -- if it’s not harmful.</span> <span id="s1489">If your spouse wants to do something harmful, that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s1490">But it -- just a matter of feeling or attitude towards issues.</span> <span id="s1491">Everyone has it’s freedom to feel the way they feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: What year did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: ‘85.</span> <span id="s1494">‘86?</span> <span id="s1495">‘85?</span> <span id="s1496">We were married 10 years.</span> <span id="s1497">But it was just such a unbelievable bliss of two people living together.</span> <span id="s1498">From really quite different backgrounds and different upbringing.</span> <span id="s1499">But he was just such a wonderful guy that no matter whom he would be married to would feel the same way, I think.</span> <span id="s1500">No prejudice in me, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: You’re supposed to be prejudiced with -- with your husband.</span> <span id="s1502">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: But that’s true, he was a wonderful human being.</span> <span id="s1504">It’s not very hard to love someone, a person, I think, but it’s hard to love mankind and he did.</span> <span id="s1505">It didn’t deprive me of anything.</span> <span id="s1506">I’d kill -- I would kill him.</span> <span id="s1507">But -- but he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1508">He was just the kindest person.</span> <span id="s1509">Many times he would say, “Do you think I’m gullible?”</span> <span id="s1510">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1511">And I said, “No, you’re not gullible.</span> <span id="s1512">You just don’t look at things in the proper light.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: The two of you traveled a lot together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1515">Well, we traveled a lot because of his job.</span> <span id="s1516">And when we were sent to Europe, made up our mind within 15 minutes.</span> <span id="s1517">He did a lot of traveling and he wouldn’t dream of going without me.</span> <span id="s1518">It was great to be so wanted and needed.</span> <span id="s1519">And I was always game, no matter what.</span> <span id="s1520">I remember I was in New York, I get a phone call from Hank, “How would you feel going to Russia?”</span> <span id="s1521">I said, “When?”</span> <span id="s1522">“Two days from now.”</span> <span id="s1523">You know.</span> <span id="s1524">I said, “Fine, I’m ready.”</span> <span id="s1525">We did travel a lot.</span> <span id="s1526">It was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1527">It was educational.</span> <span id="s1528">It was just great.</span> <span id="s1529">Some trips were more exciting than others, for different reasons, but all of it was great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: What was his job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: He was a nuclear engineer.</span> <span id="s1532">So he was involved with nuclear development and the plans and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1533">So we traveled a lot in the States together and then we traveled a lot in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: I -- I should say for the record that -- about Hank’s papers that are in the archives at the Holocaust museum, which you donated a couple of years ago and he’s written a few sort of memoirs of your travels overseas and I think they’re just so wonderful to read.</span> <span id="s1535">He’s -- he’s got a beautiful, playful writing style.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: And -- and very evocative and full of detail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: I used to love his writings, but I must say, I had a tough time with him, because at one point I said to him, “I think you owe your daughter Betty.</span> <span id="s1539">Tell her what your life was before she was born.</span> <span id="s1540">Tell her about her grandparents.</span> <span id="s1541">Tell her about what life was for you, your background, your all -- and what you did [indecipherable] through camp.”</span> <span id="s1542">So, I finally convinced him to do it and he let me read it.</span> <span id="s1543">And I remember the first time he showed me what he wrote and I said, “It’s a wonderful paper.</span> <span id="s1544">It’s so scientific.</span> <span id="s1545">It should be in a science department.</span> <span id="s1546">Did you have any feelings?</span> <span id="s1547">Did you have any impressions?</span> <span id="s1548">You’re not writing to your boss [indecipherable] pager, that you give him facts.</span> <span id="s1549">How did you feel about your mother?</span> <span id="s1550">How did you feel about your father?</span> <span id="s1551">Don’t you think it’s important for Betty to know?</span> <span id="s1552">How did they feel about you?</span> <span id="s1553">It’s not a scientific paper.</span> <span id="s1554">Should be an emotional paper.”</span> <span id="s1555">And he did rework it.</span> <span id="s1556">I was never criticizing what he wrote, I just said hey, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: And then he says -- and, in the version that’s in the archives -- maybe I should just read a little.</span> <span id="s1558">I’m going to read the first paragraph of hi -- of the letter that he writes to his daughter because it -- it fits in so well with what you were just saying.</span> <span id="s1559">He opens the letter, it’s dated in August of 1992 and he says, “My Darling Betty, I told you that I would do this to -- for yo -- to da -- to slash for you someday and here it is, here I am.</span> <span id="s1560">I really started to write a bunch of short vignettes for you.</span> <span id="s1561">I called them anecdotes from hell and I began them in 1983 in Washington.</span> <span id="s1562">But I wrote in longhand and the images of old crashed in on me so hard that I sought support from my exercise, in booze.</span> <span id="s1563">When I next picked up my notes, I broke up laughing.</span> <span id="s1564">I would start an episode nice and level and within a couple of pages, they became illegible and fell off the pages.</span> <span id="s1565">Then I began to see Bella and under her influence, I started to face my devils, to confront them.</span> <span id="s1566">To see them rationally, soberly.</span> <span id="s1567">To be able to speak about the war years, unforced.</span> <span id="s1568">Don’t get me wrong, my soul is between these pages.</span> <span id="s1569">What is new is that I could handle it.”</span> <span id="s1570">So you really had quite an -- an impact on Hank’s being able to speak about his experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Yeah, Hank never spoke about his experiences.</span> <span id="s1572">He felt that Wilma, his first wife, could not understand it.</span> <span id="s1573">I didn’t know her, though, I just met her.</span> <span id="s1574">I don’t know whether he is right or not.</span> <span id="s1575">She probably would have made an effort to understand it.</span> <span id="s1576">I think to shut her out of it was unfair for Hank -- the way I see it -- but then, I don’t know Wilma too well.</span> <span id="s1577">She must have felt segregated from him.</span> <span id="s1578">And I think he could have taken the time and I felt -- to explain it to her.</span> <span id="s1579">To make her a part of his life, instead of saying, “Oh, well.</span> <span id="s1580">She wouldn’t understand it, I better bury it.”</span> <span id="s1581">To me, that’s not a nice approach.</span> <span id="s1582">Now, he might have been right.</span> <span id="s1583">I don’t know the woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Wh -- I would love to hear some details from you about your trips with Hank, like your trip to Vilnias and your revisiting -- your revisiting Vilna, your -- the place where you had spent some time in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: The -- I spent the time in Vilna in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1586">And I was very exposed to the trips to Ponary.</span> <span id="s1587">It wasn’t a part of Hank’s life.</span> <span id="s1588">But Hank was too glad to go to Vilna and see those things.</span> <span id="s1589">So we got to Vilna and there was no sign of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1590">It’s completely like it never existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: What year is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Must have been ‘92, something like that.</span> <span id="s1593">And then I said I would like to go to Ponary.</span> <span id="s1594">So we hired a cab driver, who happened to be familiar with that.</span> <span id="s1595">And it was a unbelievable experience for me, seeking out the road I tried to avoid during my whole stay in Vilna.</span> <span id="s1596">Seeking out the road to Ponary.</span> <span id="s1597">That was a unbelievable experience.</span> <span id="s1598">And when we got there, is very nicely kept, again, very quiet and very peaceful.</span> <span id="s1599">There are a few monuments built by survivors and families of people.</span> <span id="s1600">It was just strange, because I said, “My God.</span> <span id="s1601">All those people you knew who are buried here something -- someplace.”</span> <span id="s1602">So that was very touching, but it was just such a wonderful feeling -- of Mrs. Mischkinsky having her private driver driving the roads to Ponary like a big shot.</span> <span id="s1603">You know, wearing a fur coat or whatever -- dressed, looking around.</span> <span id="s1604">What a strange feeling.</span> <span id="s1605">It just -- a feeling of hey, your whole system of destroying the Jews wasn’t fully, completely accomplished.</span> <span id="s1606">Here I am, like Mrs. Big Deal, visiting that place.</span> <span id="s1607">It was different when we went to Riga.</span> <span id="s1608">See, Riga was not my hometown.</span> <span id="s1609">The Latvian Jews, I only met some of them in camp.</span> <span id="s1610">Hank was brought up there.</span> <span id="s1611">His family lived there.</span> <span id="s1612">It was his hometown.</span> <span id="s1613">So it was different.</span> <span id="s1614">And we went to Salaspils in Torumbally, where his mother, his sister, who were killed.</span> <span id="s1615">It’s a different feeling for him, like it was for me in Vilna.</span> <span id="s1616">But then, I knew a lot of people who eventually were shot and killed in Riga, too.</span> <span id="s1617">And it’s a peaceful looking place, with nice, full bloom trees and underneath are hundreds of thousands of Jews, killed cold-blooded.</span> <span id="s1618">Taken in the middle of the night and just shot.</span> <span id="s1619">Crime?</span> <span id="s1620">You’re Jewish.</span> <span id="s1621">That was hard.</span> <span id="s1622">And then we made a trip to Minsk, which is a different story.</span> <span id="s1623">And we went to a place, Katyn.</span> <span id="s1624">It’s a place designated for people who were shot by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1625">Whole villages of people shot by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1626">By the white and -- it’s White Russia, all right?</span> <span id="s1627">So they were White Russians were being shot by the Russians because of partisans and -- and they took village after village after village, destroyed it.</span> <span id="s1628">And it’s a beautiful monument.</span> <span id="s1629">I mean, you have each city, each town has a little mount of earth and a cross and the eternal life and all that and bells.</span> <span id="s1630">And every half a minute, the bells are chiming in unison, to remember that.</span> <span id="s1631">And it was very touching.</span> <span id="s1632">I could not quite get rid of the feeling, I am so touched, it’s so horrible, but those were White Russians.</span> <span id="s1633">How many of them participated in killing the Jews and what kind of monuments do you have to memorize the Jews?</span> <span id="s1634">Well, when I expressed it to Hank, he wasn’t very happy with me.</span> <span id="s1635">But I felt that way.</span> <span id="s1636">Yes, and I am not substituting one to another -- one murder doesn’t justify another.</span> <span id="s1637">But I just couldn’t get rid of the feeling that those were White Russians and how many of them had their hands soiled with Jewish blood, just because of hatred of unknown people, that the Nazis allowed them, get rid of your Jews.</span> <span id="s1638">So that was a mixture of feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: Hank pointed out in his -- in his memoir about that, that just the distinction between Kat --</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: Katyn</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: -- tyn -- Katyn, K-a-t-y-n, which is where the -- the off -- Russian officers were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: That was Katcheen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: So this is a different place, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: That’s a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: It’s K-h-a-t-y-n, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: So it’s a di -- whole difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: I just wanted to point that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: No, it’s a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: In case somebody is listening to it and gets confused.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: No, it’s not -- that had nothing to do with the Russians killing the soldiers.</span> <span id="s1653">And did they kill the Polish soldier, or -- no, that’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Right, right [inaudible] Polish soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: But Katyn is so impressive.</span> <span id="s1656">And you hear -- it’s very quiet and you hear the bells every -- I think every minute or every half a minute, just -- I think, what would they do for the Jews, to remember them?</span> <span id="s1657">Stutthof had beautiful green grass and nicely kept barracks.</span> <span id="s1658">Big deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: When I was there, I was looking for my friend Iangard, for my friend So -- I -- I just almost expected to see them.</span> <span id="s1661">But is very peaceful and very quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: Did you go to Kaiserwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Yes, I did go to Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s1664">There is no more Kaiserwald the way I remember it.</span> <span id="s1665">There is a -- there was, at that time, a Russian installation.</span> <span id="s1666">And I took a picture of Kaiserwald and then a Russian soldier came over and he took me to the commandanture.</span> <span id="s1667">You’re not allowed to picture installations -- take pictures of -- and I -- now wait a minute, that was my home.</span> <span id="s1668">I wasn’t taking pictures of installations.</span> <span id="s1669">But they were really ready to lock me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: I assume they took the film away from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: I -- I think so.</span> <span id="s1672">But that was funny, being pulled in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: When -- I -- I was struck by -- by reading Hanks dispatches and y-you were really on very diplomatic sort of excursions --</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">Q: I mean, he’s really doing -- doing sensitive business deals --</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">A: I felt like a such bigshot.</span> <span id="s1677">Here are all those scientists, having all the slides on picture and talking about this and I am the only woman just being present at it.</span> <span id="s1678">I didn’t know what they talking about, but just the idea that I was there made me feel like such an important person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: But meanwhile, did they have any clue of what this visit meant to you?</span> <span id="s1680">I mean you’re -- you’re going back to these places where you’re -- you’re families were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: Well, I was never in -- in that surrounding of those scientific conversations, you know.</span> <span id="s1682">They could talk to me from doomsday -- from today til doomsday, I wouldn’t understand a word they were saying, but just that I was there, made me feel very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: But, I -- I mean, even from Hank’s point of view, he was revisiting Riga, but also on business, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1685">But that was a different part of -- I was talking about Minsk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: Yeah, he was -- we were entertained by the bigshot’s oaf -- government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Was that hard, to be revisiting this place and have all of these memories, which are obviously very overpowering, but to -- to -- to also be doing this sort of diplomatic business and it’s such a split between them.</span> <span id="s1689">It seems like it would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: No, I think it was very interesting and very satisfactory.</span> <span id="s1691">I say, almost, “Hitler eat your heart out.</span> <span id="s1692">Here I am.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Was there any acknowledgment between the people who Hank was working with and you that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: We are survivors?</span> <span id="s1695">No.</span> <span id="s1696">We took a trip around -- was it Vilna?</span> <span id="s1697">I think it was in Vilna, through -- the ambassador gave us his escorts and they were telling us what happened when the Russians took over the station and they killed there seven people and they have the crosses and the monuments and the flowers.</span> <span id="s1698">Was my life -- was my heart bleeding for them?</span> <span id="s1699">No.</span> <span id="s1700">You’re talking about seven people.</span> <span id="s1701">I talk about hundred and thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Did you tell them that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: No.</span> <span id="s1704">I don’t think it would make any -- why would I tell it to them?</span> <span id="s1705">They are two people who are taking us on a tour.</span> <span id="s1706">They were not people who were responsible.</span> <span id="s1707">That’s the way they felt about it.</span> <span id="s1708">So am I going to compare my twozig is bigger than your twozig?</span> <span id="s1709">I did not think it will serve a purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: And he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: Do you agree with me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: I -- I think it would have been di-difficult to bring it up, but -- you know, I -- I don’t want to -- I wouldn’t -- I would -- I’m just interested in knowing how it -- how it happened, more than anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: No, I know.</span> <span id="s1714">I just ask, off the record, I ask whether you think it was a proper approach?</span> <span id="s1715">You are not going to create battles -- fist battles on every step, when you are visiting and you are somebody’s guest.</span> <span id="s1716">Would we be invited to a political discussion, that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s1717">But we weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: There’s one point at which -- I’m -- I’m not sure what trip it was on, but -- but Hank in his writings, mentions the issue of -- there’s a round table discussion and the -- the -- it’s sort of -- I guess it was when you were in Minsk.</span> <span id="s1719">And -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1721">We went to the territory which was affected by the Chernobyl fallout.</span> <span id="s1722">So it wasn’t in Minsk, but it was further down and yeah.</span> <span id="s1723">Oh, I remembered that very clearly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Tell me [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: Well, we were a group of eight, nine people.</span> <span id="s1726">Very friendly, very cordial, very loving, very attentive and we having dinner.</span> <span id="s1727">And the leader of the group brings up the question of -- around the table -- what’s your religion, how do you feel about it?</span> <span id="s1728">And then it came to me, what’s your religion?</span> <span id="s1729">I say, “I’m Jewish.”</span> <span id="s1730">And like a blanket of silence fell over the whole group.</span> <span id="s1731">There were no more questions, except Hank was able to say, “And by the way, I am Jewish, too.”</span> <span id="s1732">That was the end of the discussion, but it -- the whole atmosphere changed.</span> <span id="s1733">There was no more talks, there was no more -- nothing, just -- so Hank, after we finished dinner, Hank went to Ralph and said, “Look, if that interferes with the mission, because I am Jewish, I will be too glad to resign.</span> <span id="s1734">So you can continue and whatever.”</span> <span id="s1735">And Ralph says, “Well, so far nobody approached me about anything.</span> <span id="s1736">So why -- why don’t you just let it rest?”</span> <span id="s1737">Next morning, it was like nothing ever, ever happened.</span> <span id="s1738">So yes, is there an underlying anti-Semitism everywhere?</span> <span id="s1739">Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Do you think that still exists --</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: -- in the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: Yes, ma’am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: In New York City, in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yes, ma’am.</span> <span id="s1746">Everywhere.</span> <span id="s1747">I think so.</span> <span id="s1748">But then it’s the other side of the coin, the Jews are very prejudiced too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Do you have any examples of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: [indecipherable] my mother.</span> <span id="s1751">The schvartza.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: I mean what about -- what about -- what about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: She was very prejudiced.</span> <span id="s1754">A schvartza is not an equal.</span> <span id="s1755">A schvartza’s a Negro.</span> <span id="s1756">[indecipherable] my mother was much more superior, she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1757">And you can go on and on and on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Have your feelings about Zionism changed and what -- I mean, what are your feelings about Israel nowadays?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: I don’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s1760">I wouldn’t like to live there.</span> <span id="s1761">Since I am not well informed, I really cannot express any opinion.</span> <span id="s1762">I think they probably dislike everybody who’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1763">I don’t necessarily mean just Arabs, but I think they probably -- and that’s just an assumption -- feel that whoever is not Jewish, is some -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: This is a continuation of an interview with Bella Mischkinsky, this is tape number four, side A. Is there anything else you want to say about your -- your trips?</span> <span id="s1765">Yo -- did you ever visit Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1767">The biggest disappointment.</span> <span id="s1768">I never wanted to go there, but I promised Professor Goldenberg to go, because Hank promised her and he no longer is here, so I just took his place.</span> <span id="s1769">And we went to Lódz.</span> <span id="s1770">I found Lódz oppressive, dirty, smaller, unfriendly -- nothing like the city I grew up in.</span> <span id="s1771">I don’t think it’s my imagination, I think the city changed and it -- under the Russian occupation, it did change.</span> <span id="s1772">I think there is a big hatred of the Jews -- Jews there and the reason I am saying it, because there was just a very small plaque, indicating -- just honoring the Jews and a woman pass -- we were -- looked at it and took a picture and a woman passed by and spit.</span> <span id="s1773">So, that does not indicate love and kindness.</span> <span id="s1774">We had hard time getting directions to where the ghetto was -- people didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1775">So -- the house I lived in looked like the biggest slum.</span> <span id="s1776">So that was not a pleasant visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Was the -- any of the original house still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: A part of the house I lived was there, I wish it wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1779">It’s dilapidated, the stairs are broken, the railing is broken.</span> <span id="s1780">I tried to visit my grandparents house and I rang the doorbell and I got the door slammed in my face.</span> <span id="s1781">So it was not a good visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: You got the door slammed in your face after you had told them who you were and why you were visiting, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Well, I said -- yeah, my grandmother was -- so, that was my experience with Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: What happened to your grandparents, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: Well, my grandfather died before the war.</span> <span id="s1786">My grandmother was taken out of the Loder ghetto, with the transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: To Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: No.</span> <span id="s1789">She was killed before.</span> <span id="s1790">Irene was with her, I was not in the Loder ghetto.</span> <span id="s1791">But Irene was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Did you see anybody you had known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Were you avoiding looking for people that you had known?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: No, I didn’t avoid anything.</span> <span id="s1796">It just was not a good visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">Q: How long did you stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: One day.</span> <span id="s1799">One day too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: And you really hadn’t wanted to even return?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s1802">But Myrna wanted to go to the places I was and you start with the place you lived in.</span> <span id="s1803">We could not go to Riga, it was too complicated.</span> <span id="s1804">You needed visas, you needed just -- so we didn’t go to Riga, we just went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1805">We went to Kraków and when -- we went to the sites of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1806">To Stutthof, to Majdanek, to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1807">Where else?</span> <span id="s1808">Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: What was your impression of a -- of these places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Well, as I told you before about my impression of Stutthof, it wasn’t the place I remembered.</span> <span id="s1811">It was all nice and green and grassy and whatnot.</span> <span id="s1812">But I was never in Majdanek or Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1813">I only heard about those camps later.</span> <span id="s1814">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1815">I only heard about those camps later, after the war.</span> <span id="s1816">Those were devastating, devastating places.</span> <span id="s1817">Because they were different than -- from what I knew as a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1818">There were no barracks.</span> <span id="s1819">People weren’t kept there, they were unloaded on the platform and sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1820">So that was different than my experiences were.</span> <span id="s1821">So you saw stones and stones and stones.</span> <span id="s1822">And they all presented human beings at one point.</span> <span id="s1823">That was terrible.</span> <span id="s1824">Auschwitz was not that terrible, because I read about it a lot.</span> <span id="s1825">I had an idea what it is, I know what the barrack represents, I know what the gas chamber represents.</span> <span id="s1826">And the reason I was -- I wanted to go to Birkenau-Auschwitz, because Irene was there.</span> <span id="s1827">So I wanted trace back what her life looked like.</span> <span id="s1828">But, I mean every camp is shocking, but it wasn’t such a novelty that I could not visualize it, whereas Majdanek was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: So you -- what -- what year was this that you -- that you went with -- with the circle of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: I think last year, I -- I’m not quite -- I think last year or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: A couple of years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: No, just a year and a half, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: And now, as a affluent citizen and survivor of camps, I’m going to cruise to the Scandinavian countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: You’re going to visit the re -- Holocaust sites in Finland.</span> <span id="s1836">Tell me about your -- I -- I noticed, fishing through the -- your file and Hank’s files that you had made an effort to volunteer for the Holocaust Museum early on, before Hank started volunteering at the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1837">And you had been frustrated by not getting a response.</span> <span id="s1838">And then eventually Hank started volunteering.</span> <span id="s1839">Did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: Did I make that comment?</span> <span id="s1841">I don’t recall it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Just something I found in your files.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1844">Hank volunteered and I didn’t want to volunteer at the same, together.</span> <span id="s1845">Stupid, but I didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s1846">But then when Hank passed away -- yeah, I think it was difficult to -- had to make appointment and na dada, whatever.</span> <span id="s1847">But when Hank passed away, I had no problem talking to Arwin and saying I would like to volunteer.</span> <span id="s1848">And she did it immediately.</span> <span id="s1849">She was a great influence for me to volunteer in the Holocaust Museum -- for the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1850">I loved her approach, her attitude, her calm efficient way of doing things.</span> <span id="s1851">I felt very comfortable, almost like I have a protector who is taking Hank’s place.</span> <span id="s1852">And I was very -- not sorry, but sad when she left, because I just felt -- she’s still going to be my friend or I am going to be her friend, let’s put it that way, but it’s a distance away and things have a way of slipping by.</span> <span id="s1853">But I found the people at the museum very friendly.</span> <span id="s1854">The young man who’s responsible for my directions, what’s his name?</span> <span id="s1855">Dillon.</span> <span id="s1856">The young man who is taking care of my work in the archives, Dillon is very helpful, very understanding.</span> <span id="s1857">I just love to work -- I almost feel I work for him, because he represents the person I respond to, and he taught me a lot of things.</span> <span id="s1858">I just love him.</span> <span id="s1859">It’s too bad he is so young or too bad I am so old.</span> <span id="s1860">But I love that guy.</span> <span id="s1861">And he’s -- I think a -- a big asset to the museum.</span> <span id="s1862">But so are other people.</span> <span id="s1863">I work a half a day at the museum on the floor and it gives me a chance to interact with the public and other volunteers and that’s a great experience.</span> <span id="s1864">I think the museum -- or the people I work with are trying to make the museum a very interesting place for the visitors and a very comfortable place.</span> <span id="s1865">I think they all obliging, they all courteous and it’s good to see so much people coming -- so many people coming and visiting.</span> <span id="s1866">And what’s also good to see, that they not necessarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s1867">So it’s good to see an interest among other people, but just Jews who have the impression that the Holocaust museum is just his m -- their museum.</span> <span id="s1868">It isn’t.</span> <span id="s1869">It’s a educational institution for everyone and I hope it’s going to stay that way.</span> <span id="s1870">I just don’t want the Holocaust to be put together in a bag with any other killings of other countries, because the Holocaust was a unique experience, different than the killings and murdering of people which took place in other countries.</span> <span id="s1871">It doesn’t mean that it’s -- I advocate it, I am just saying that I feel the Jewish Holocaust was strictly a Jewish issue.</span> <span id="s1872">What one country, with so much education, was so susceptible to murder of hundreds of thousands of other people, only because they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1873">They weren’t fighting for anything.</span> <span id="s1874">They didn’t defend anything.</span> <span id="s1875">They had no weapons to fight back.</span> <span id="s1876">They were just led -- the term is the Jews went like sheep.</span> <span id="s1877">Well, they were led like sheep.</span> <span id="s1878">I do resent the criticisms that Jews did not fight back and they went like sheep.</span> <span id="s1879">Well, every survivor fought back, because he is alive.</span> <span id="s1880">And lots of them -- thousands of them who wanted a life, fought back too.</span> <span id="s1881">To survive a concentration camp run by the Nazis, the White Russians, by the Latvians, was a fight.</span> <span id="s1882">It was a struggle to survive.</span> <span id="s1883">And I felt a little bit resentful when in the beginning the question was, “Why didn’t you fight?”</span> <span id="s1884">Who is asking the question?</span> <span id="s1885">People who have their dignity?</span> <span id="s1886">Who are not hungry?</span> <span id="s1887">Who are not being separated?</span> <span id="s1888">Who are not being treated like vermin?</span> <span id="s1889">They are asking why didn’t you fight back?</span> <span id="s1890">My question is, “Why didn’t you fight for us, with all the things you had available, if you just choose to use them?”</span> <span id="s1891">And saying we didn’t know is not an answer, because it’s not a fact.</span> <span id="s1892">So, I did resent that.</span> <span id="s1893">I think every survivor is a hero.</span> <span id="s1894">I think every inmate of a concentration camp was a hero.</span> <span id="s1895">Yes, and we survivors are heroes because we proved that they were not as efficient as they wanted to be and they did leave so many Jews still alive.</span> <span id="s1896">Jews who became human beings who are assets to every country they live in.</span> <span id="s1897">That’s, to me, a hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Do you remember when -- we were talking a little earlier about -- about the receptivity of people in this country to listening to -- to -- to really being interested in the experiences of survivors and to wanting to know.</span> <span id="s1899">Can you -- can you talk more about ho -- when you started really talking about it and started feeling like people were wanting to know what had happened to you and how -- how -- how the -- that came about, how that influenced --</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: I am not sure who started the trend.</span> <span id="s1901">I think it was schools who started or maybe synagogues.</span> <span id="s1902">I don’t know when it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Even in -- just in your own life, in your own personal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: But in my personal life we always talked about it among my friends who were also survivors.</span> <span id="s1905">And strangers or people who became my friends, but were not survivors and did not share my life, I was not going to sit down and talk to them about my experience.</span> <span id="s1906">And if they already were aware of the Holocaust, they had the sensitivity of saying, “We cannot ask her, because it’s too painful.”</span> <span id="s1907">So I don’t quite know when it started and how it started.</span> <span id="s1908">But what I do remember is that I was extremely resentful when I was asked, “Why didn’t you fight back?”</span> <span id="s1909">And I said to myself, “Are the remaining Jews embarrassed and ashamed?</span> <span id="s1910">They need heroes to say, hey look what we did?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Wh-Who asked you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: Oh, many a people.</span> <span id="s1913">That was a very -- “What I don’t understand -- why didn’t you fight back?”</span> <span id="s1914">Was a very common question.</span> <span id="s1915">And I really did not feel to an-answering that, because to me it was, would you like to be proud of your Jews, so you proud of the people in Warsaw ghetto who resisted?</span> <span id="s1916">Is that’s what you need or do you want to talk about the survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: The Holocaust Museum, working on the floor and meeting various people who are coming through, many of them non-Jews, most of them non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1918">Have you gotten into discussions with them?</span> <span id="s1919">Do they discover that you’re a survivor?</span> <span id="s1920">Do they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Tell me -- tell me a story about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Oh, well there are no big stories, but we say, “Oh, there’s that --” And I say, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1924">She’s -- and I say, “Oh, by the way,” I might volunteer that information, “and I am a survivor.”</span> <span id="s1925">I think I am a human face, with a nice personality, so hey, I’m a survivor, I’m a part of society, I am here.</span> <span id="s1926">And I always get that smile of sympathy and almost the outstretched hand, “Oh, I’m so glad you’re here.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: And there’s a feeling of -- is there a feeling of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">A: It -- it never fail -- almost a feeling of admiration.</span> <span id="s1929">“You went through all that, what we saw today?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: How does that feel, to be -- to be on the receiving end --</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Great.</span> <span id="s1932">Great.</span> <span id="s1933">Not quite, but there is not shy away or there is no -- there just a very warm feeling that we so glad they are survivors.</span> <span id="s1934">I never heard -- and I don’t know that doesn’t exist, anybody who would say, “Oh God, he didn’t do a good job, that Hitler.</span> <span id="s1935">He left too many
