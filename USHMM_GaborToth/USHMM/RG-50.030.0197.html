id="s10">Q: Would you please tell us your name, when and where you were born, and what you remember about your family and town life before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I was born in 1932, 1st of February, in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s12">My name was Dorotka Goldstein, Goldstein really, and what I remember from my home, well, we have been a very nice Jewish family.</span> <span id="s13">My father was director of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.</span> <span id="s14">I had a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s15">My mother, what I heard and would remember, was a very nice, uh, lady, uh, kept a very nice home.</span> <span id="s16">Everybody knew that she was the best, uh, cook and bake, baked wonderful cookies.</span> <span id="s17">What do I remember?</span> <span id="s18">We had a very nice apartment in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s19">I think that we were well off to do people.</span> <span id="s20">My father was a partner in a newspaper too, so we had a maid.</span> <span id="s21">I remember she was taking me to school, the maid.</span> <span id="s22">I remember Saturdays that my father brought cake and tea to the bed to my mother.</span> <span id="s23">I had dolls.</span> <span id="s24">I had my own room.</span> <span id="s25">Much of the city of Warsaw I don't remember, but, uh, I remember that we had a nice life.</span> <span id="s26">I had lots of toys.</span> <span id="s27">I loved my Daddy.</span> <span id="s28">He was a very good looking man, and everybody said that he was very good looking man.</span> <span id="s29">I quarreled with my brother, but I didn't quarrel with my sister because she was 10 years older than me, and I was the youngest and the prettiest and everybody called me called me Coquetka(ph) because I was standing before the mirror for hours, looking at myself, that what I remember, and putting on all kinds of clothes from my mother so that I can act before the mirror .</span> <span id="s30">What do I remember?</span> <span id="s31">I remember one day, the only day that I have that I remember, that I went to the movies, was a movie with [Franczeska Garla (ph)] and she found a child on a steps of a church and then I came home and I said that I am not the real child of my mother and daddy.</span> <span id="s32">I probably am a found child from a church.</span> <span id="s33">That's what I remember as a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Oh, I don't remember much school because I was, I think I went only to a first grade, and then the war started, so I don't remember anything about school.</span> <span id="s36">I don't think that I was in the school more than a, more than a few months, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What about Jewish observance?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: It's a combination.</span> <span id="s39">Look, my mother was born to Hertzog (ph) family, which as you know is a religious family.</span> <span id="s40">And my grandfather was with Koftan (ph), black, uh, but he was a modern one.</span> <span id="s41">He had a company that dried peanuts, was a wealthy man.</span> <span id="s42">My father came from an academic family.</span> <span id="s43">His sisters were all learned, learned people.</span> <span id="s44">His brother- in-law was one of the most famous violinists in Poland and Krakau.</span> <span id="s45">So there was a combination.</span> <span id="s46">I don't know if we kept kosher.</span> <span id="s47">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s48">But there was a combination of my mother who came from a very religious family and probably she did not keep that at home because she married a man that was not religious.</span> <span id="s49">If we kept kosher, I don't know.</span> <span id="s50">We had a non-Jewish maid.</span> <span id="s51">I don't know, I don't know if we were</span></p> <p><span id="s52">kosher or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Was the family Zionistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Oh, oh, oh.</span> <span id="s55">Very much so!</span> <span id="s56">My father visited Palestine, and, uh, my father was a very charitable person, very well known in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s57">When Hitler started to throw out the Jews from Germany, he opened a kitchen and he gave hot meals to the people.</span> <span id="s58">That I do remember.</span> <span id="s59">My father was a very charitable person, not only because he had a wonderful heart, but I think in his position he had to be.</span> <span id="s60">And I do remember that in our home Jabotinsky was in our home.</span> <span id="s61">I remember that.</span> <span id="s62">I didn't know who he was, but I know now that I live in Israel who Jabotinsky was.</span> <span id="s63">You know, he was a Zionist, my father.</span> <span id="s64">If you call it Zionism.</span> <span id="s65">Today, I am not so sure that you can call a Zionist that lives outside of Israel, but if you call it, yes, he was a Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What do you remember about what happened to you and your family and friends when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: About friends, I don't remember anything about friends.</span> <span id="s68">I didn't have any friends.</span> <span id="s69">My father escaped and, uh, he escaped with, uh, most important people, Beck, President Beck, and so on, through Romania to Vilna.</span> <span id="s70">We endured the worst, Warsaw ghetto, but he managed to take us out.</span> <span id="s71">And we ran away and we came to Vilna.</span> <span id="s72">In Vilna, we were together and the short time before Hitler entered Vilna too, and when Hitler occupied Lithuania, my father, there was a knock on the door, and, uh, the Sturmfuhrers entered, and said, Victor Goldstein?"</span> <span id="s73">and he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s74">They took us all out and in, on the street, they shot him and said, "You were a Jewish journalist and Zionist," and took out a revolver and shot him.</span> <span id="s75">And that was the end of my father.</span> <span id="s76">And soon, there was, uh, and soon there was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s77">If I remember very well, the scene of the death of my father was that my mother cried.</span> <span id="s78">Did I cry?</span> <span id="s79">I don't know what, I didn't know what death was.</span> <span id="s80">I probably cried only because I saw my mother cry, and this is so far away from me that I really don't know my feelings as a child.</span> <span id="s81">I was so small, but we entered the Vilna ghetto and we were with my sister and brother til the liquidation of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Can you describe the life in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: The life in the ghetto I can better describe than other things.</span> <span id="s84">You know in the ghetto, there were schools for children.</span> <span id="s85">What we did, we didn't learn much in the schools, we were, we learned how to sing.</span> <span id="s86">I know all the Yiddish songs from the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s87">I sang them.</span> <span id="s88">I have a record with all those songs.</span> <span id="s89">I have done it in London.</span> <span id="s90">So I knew all the songs.</span> <span id="s91">But you have to understand that the Jewish children did not have the right to live, so a few times in the week they came to take out the children, so the schools had bunkers, and we were given brown paper and pencils to keep quiet.</span> <span id="s92">So, if you can call it a school, I wouldn't call it, but it was a place where the children came, and every day less and less children came because the children were taken out of the ghetto and put in, and killed.</span> <span id="s93">So less and less children were in those classrooms, if you call them classrooms.</span> <span id="s94">But I was lucky, and I stayed until the end, and during some days, my mother did not send me because we had to eat and there was, and horse meat was very expensive.</span> <span id="s95">There was no other meat, so she would send me to sell cigarettes and matches on the street.</span> <span id="s96">And as I was a good looking child, people had pity on me so they bought matches and cigarettes.</span> <span id="s97">I came home with the money.</span> <span id="s98">One day I remember, I got beaten up by mother because I gave the money to two children that were helping me and they were they said, they told me that they are hungry and they will help me sell the cigarettes and they were screaming, "Buy from her, the cigarettes, and not from somebody else," so we sold everything and I had money, so I gave them money.</span> <span id="s99">And I came home and my mamma, mother gave me on my tushie (ph) because she said, "Well, now with what will be buy the horse meat?"</span> <span id="s100">And the horse meat was very good.</span> <span id="s101">It was a delikatesse, this horse meat, and she always said if he don't have the money, we won't eat meat.</span> <span id="s102">So, days in the ghetto, look, it was different in the ghetto than it was in the concentration camp, (a) Because we were still stronger.</span> <span id="s103">We had more food, but we lived a frightened life, a very frightened life.</span> <span id="s104">I don't remember much laughter, much smiling.</span> <span id="s105">First of all, my mother was already a widow.</span> <span id="s106">My sister, who married in the ghetto, Zunder Leizersohn, who was one of the first partisans in Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s107">He was smuggling out the people to the outside of the ghetto for the, how do you say, , woods, and on the last trip of his he wanted to take my sister with him and they were caught, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s108">So I do remember that having two widows in this, in this apartment, which we lived, and my sister loved this man very much.</span> <span id="s109">I remember he was a very good looking man, and she was 10 years older than me and it was a tragic that he was killed while wanting to take her out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s110">So to live with a mother that cried about her husband and with a sister that cried about her husband in a, in a place where there was no much happiness, so, but that was already the wonderful time, because after that it came only the terrible time.</span> <span id="s111">So if I look back to the time in the ghetto, it was paradise towards what happened to me afterwards.</span> <span id="s112">So therefore I feel that when I speak about the Vilna ghetto, because I was very short time in the Warsaw ghetto, I first of all, you know, you get brain washed a little bit, that this is your life.</span> <span id="s113">And as a child, I didn't know that there was a different life.</span> <span id="s114">I didn't understand why, why are we suffering.</span> <span id="s115">So, you know, I suppose that for the people that had been much more grown up and much older than me, life was probably unbearable.</span> <span id="s116">I didn't have sleepless nights from being afraid what would happen to me tomorrow.</span> <span id="s117">I suppose that my mother did.</span> <span id="s118">So the time in the ghetto, as a child, I learned a lot of songs and there were children to play, still, and so I would played, and in the nights, my mother would put me in the, in the bunker because she was afraid the Germans came, come in and, uh, uh, would take us away.</span> <span id="s119">We were, uh, taught not to be loud.</span> <span id="s120">When we were sitting in the bunkers we hardly spoke to each other because we were explained that if you speak the Germans would come and kill you.</span> <span id="s121">So as children we were taught to do things which normal children outside of the ghetto wouldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">But it was happy, because I have children.</span> <span id="s123">In the concentration camp, I didn't have one.</span> <span id="s124">Nobody talked to me.</span> <span id="s125">In the ghetto, yah.</span> <span id="s126">We were playing, we were playing with stones (cough), excuse me, we were playing with, you know, like little stones, to, uh, we were singing.</span> <span id="s127">Was terrible, but it was terrible, but it was not so terrible as the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Can you sing one of the songs for us?</span> <span id="s129">One you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: I remember many songs, but I am not comfortable to sing a song which has to do like a song which I have sang Polish (ph).</span> <span id="s131">If I translate it: "Buy from me the cigarettes, only from me because they are not wet from rain.</span> <span id="s132">Buy from me and have pity on me.</span> <span id="s133">Polish (ph).</span> <span id="s134">Buy from me because I am an orphan."</span> <span id="s135">Those were very said songs.</span> <span id="s136">The songs that were, the majority of the songs of the Holocaust were written in Vilna.</span> <span id="s137">Vilna had the theatre, and the majority of the songs were written there, and I know them from that, and I hope that one day you will come to Israel, and there is a record which I have done when I was in London, His Master's Voice.</span> <span id="s138">But then, you know, I was 19 years old and I wanted to do that to remember.</span> <span id="s139">So I had this song and another song which I sang, and the record was level and , which was also very famous song of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s140">which was also written for the Vilna, .</span> <span id="s141">Those are the songs that I have learned in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s142">I have not sang them anymore, because I am a happy person.</span> <span id="s143">I have wonderful songs now to sing.</span> <span id="s144">So, but, if we talk about it, yah, those were the songs that I have been singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: What do you remember about the deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Of the ghetto, the dates of the liquidation of the ghetto, I can tell you.</span> <span id="s147">Anyhow dates I couldn't tell you.</span> <span id="s148">It wouldn't be real if I tell you, but it was the liquidation of the whole Vilna ghetto and they took us out and there was a selection.</span> <span id="s149">There was the right side and there was the left side, and naturally my sister and my brother were on a different, with the men, my mother and my sister on the right side and I was put on the left side.</span> <span id="s150">Little did I know that the left side is death, but I didn't want to be alone without them.</span> <span id="s151">So with all the screaming which went on, and there was screaming going, because I have seen that woman was holding a baby in her hand and she was screaming not to, the German wanted to take away the baby and put her on the right side, so she was screaming that way that he took the baby and threw it on the wall of the ghetto, and the baby died in a minute.</span> <span id="s152">That is in front of me.</span> <span id="s153">So I saw that I don't want to be without my mother.</span> <span id="s154">So there was so much confusion and I was such a little girl that I ran way without anyone seeing it to the right side and I found my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s155">And from there we went to, we were deported to Kaiserwald-Riga, and in Kaiserwald-Riga, my memory takes me to a very terrible scene.</span> <span id="s156">We already knew, I mean, we already knew, even the children that there are gas chambers.</span> <span id="s157">And they took us and they undressed us and they said we have to go into the showers.</span> <span id="s158">Not showers.</span> <span id="s159">for the people already knew the showers are not showers, but gas.</span> <span id="s160">And I became so hysterical that I said to my mother and that I vividly remember, "You can die.</span> <span id="s161">You are old.</span> <span id="s162">I still want to live.</span> <span id="s163">Don't let me go there.</span> <span id="s164">I don't want to go into the showers."</span> <span id="s165">And she wanted to calm me down and she said, "No, it's not to be to die.</span> <span id="s166">It's just to wash."</span> <span id="s167">And I couldn't listen to her.</span> <span id="s168">I throw myself on the floor.</span> <span id="s169">"I am not going there.</span> <span id="s170">You are old.</span> <span id="s171">You can die.</span> <span id="s172">I don't want to die."</span> <span id="s173">But anyhow, we had to go in, and my memory takes me that I was so hysterical that I really, when they put on the water saw that this is not water, but this was water.</span> <span id="s174">We had to wash.</span> <span id="s175">We had to wash.</span> <span id="s176">They gave us soap.</span> <span id="s177">We had to wash, and we got our establishing dresses, those clothes with, how do you call them, in German stripe.</span> <span id="s178">That what I remember, and then the hell started.</span> <span id="s179">We were deported from there to Dinenwerke, and from Dinenwerke we were deported to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s180">As I understand now by being in Washington that Stutthof was a 100,000 people.</span> <span id="s181">I never realized that it was such a big concentration camp.</span> <span id="s182">And there I was with my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s183">What did we do in Stutthof?</span> <span id="s184">There was no work in Stutthof, but they let us work.</span> <span id="s185">They took us from, you had to carry stones from one side to the other side.</span> <span id="s186">You had to fill bags of cement and carry them on your shoulder to the other corner of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s187">Very little food, very little food.</span> <span id="s188">And slowly, slowly, my mother was dying from hunger.</span> <span id="s189">She was not even a human being anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">She was such a skeleton.</span> <span id="s191">Had big eyes and such blue under her eyes.</span> <span id="s192">No hair.</span> <span id="s193">If I loved her, no.</span> <span id="s194">Because she was not a mother anymore.</span> <span id="s195">She was a skeleton.</span> <span id="s196">And then one day when we were lying on the floor and somebody came to say that your mother died, go and say to her goodbye.</span> <span id="s197">And I turned my head and I saw they slapped her to this corner where all the dead were and I said this is not my mother, and I didn't even want to say goodbye to her.</span> <span id="s198">And I was left with my sister.</span> <span id="s199">And still I had my sister.</span> <span id="s200">It wasn't so bad, because she was young and she warmed me up and I don't know if I missed my mother so much because now that I reason to myself, there was no much love that a child felt and I myself am a mother, and I understand in this circumstances, where you see your own children dying from hunger and crying, "Mother, I am hungry," and she couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s201">So what kind of love.</span> <span id="s202">Everybody was to himself, and her thoughts I don't know, but I am intelligent enough to understand today that she was suffering, seeing her two daughters.</span> <span id="s203">If she gave us a piece of bread, I don't even remember if she gave us her piece of bread, because the piece of bread that we got was very little.</span> <span id="s204">And how unselfish can a person be when he is dying from hunger to give the last piece of bread?</span> <span id="s205">I don't know.</span> <span id="s206">I don't remember if I got from her a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s207">The fact is that she died from hunger and I didn't, so she might probably have given sometimes to me her piece of bread.</span> <span id="s208">And from then on it was just slowly dying because I had typhoid, there were hours we were both sitting and taking the lice, that we all had lice all over, and the scratching all night long, the scratching that what I remember.</span> <span id="s209">You scratched yourself.</span> <span id="s210">They were biting you and you took it like this.</span> <span id="s211">I must saw sometimes I did get sandwich from a German.</span> <span id="s212">I must say that sometimes I did get a sandwich from a German.</span> <span id="s213">Sometime, they did have pity on me.</span> <span id="s214">Sometimes I got beaten up because I couldn't pick up cement, you know, but I must say to the world today, and this is what I always say and this is what I continue to say, "I don't trust the Christian world anymore."</span> <span id="s215">For me, I cannot separate the Germans and the Polacks and the Bulgarians from the Christian world.</span> <span id="s216">I cannot separate.</span> <span id="s217">I am Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">They were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s219">It maybe will take another 50 years that I will trust the non-Jewish people, because where were they?</span> <span id="s220">Do you know how many times in the Warsaw ghetto I was spit on me, there were spitting because I had the yellow star.</span> <span id="s221">Has nothing to do with the Germans.</span> <span id="s222">How many time did I hear the word in Poland, Jude, which means Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">And I was asked by your media people sometimes, "How do I feel to the Christians?"</span> <span id="s224">And I would say always, "Yah, today I am 57 years old, 58.</span> <span id="s225">I know that there are good people and bad people, but I will never forgive them.</span> <span id="s226">I'll never forgive them that they didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s227">That the world did not do anything to save us.</span> <span id="s228">And I don't know why the hatred for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s229">I have never done anything wrong in my life.</span> <span id="s230">Not before and not now!</span> <span id="s231">I feel I am the same as them.</span> <span id="s232">I'll never forgive that, the world.</span> <span id="s233">Never forgive the Americans for not doing anything and never forgive the world for standing by and seeing that I was dying.</span> <span id="s234">No, and my sitting here is because I do want that the people should know.</span> <span id="s235">I do want that the people should know that although the world is beautiful and although today they try sometimes to fight against prejudice, I as Dora Roth will never forgive the Christian world for not doing enough and not doing so that I should have not had to suffer 6 years.</span> <span id="s236">This is why I live therefore in Israel.</span> <span id="s237">I have chosen to live in Israel as a 13 year old child.</span> <span id="s238">When I went into the orphan home and they asked me where do you want to go, which orphan home do you want to go, to a Zionistic one or to an orphan home which stays in Poland, and I didn't understand what Zionism was, but I said I want to go to Palestine because I want to be surrounded by Jewish people and not by Christians because I did not trust them.</span> <span id="s239">Until today, I fight my own feelings.</span> <span id="s240">That's true, because I have seen good Christian people.</span> <span id="s241">In Israel, we have a Righteous Avenue for all the Christians that have saved the Jews, but I myself I fight this feeling because it is not good to generalize.</span> <span id="s242">But I suffered so much, looked to stand in front of the gas chamber and I was the third one to stand and my sister was put there and two Germans looked at me and said, "Look at this beautiful Jewish child.</span> <span id="s243">Rotten Jewish Child.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Ferfluchte (ph) is rotten in German.</span> <span id="s245">She has such beautiful eyes.</span> <span id="s246">She shouldn't die yet.</span> <span id="s247">Took me out and said, "Roth, get out."</span> <span id="s248">And my sister, knowing where she was going, made with her hands so I shouldn't follow her.</span> <span id="s249">She died.</span> <span id="s250">And you know what, how can you even today, when you go back to that moment, how can you believe that someone has the right to save me because of my beautiful eyes.</span> <span id="s251">This is only what I had?</span> <span id="s252">Only beautiful eyes?</span> <span id="s253">I was a human being, a child.</span> <span id="s254">Hadn't done anything wrong!?</span> <span id="s255">So my feelings to the Christian world is not, is not the best, and probably I'll die that way.</span> <span id="s256">Is not that I would do any harm to anyone, and if a child would be hungry on the street, I certainly wouldn't ask him, "Are you Jewish or non-Jewish?"</span> <span id="s257">That's not with me.</span> <span id="s258">I would give the child, whoever the child is.</span> <span id="s259">But we are speaking here, you are speaking to me because you want my feelings to, and my story to tell to people that will live after me.</span> <span id="s260">So this is my feelings and I am not ashamed to say it.</span> <span id="s261">This is how I feel.</span> <span id="s262">I don't have anyone except my brother who is not ready to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s263">I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s264">He is just closed up to this topic.</span> <span id="s265">You can never ask my brother about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s266">It is taboo in his home.</span> <span id="s267">He doesn't even ask me how my mother died.</span> <span id="s268">So it's me that talks about it.</span> <span id="s269">My life afterwards was very good.</span> <span id="s270">Although I was shot by a German in the last day in Stutthof, before the war finished they got an order to go into the bararacks and to shoot everybody that is still alive.</span> <span id="s271">It was in the morning I got 2 bullets in my back with machine gun, but the Russians came a few hours later and saved me.</span> <span id="s272">I was operated four times.</span> <span id="s273">They couldn't find the second bullet, but they did afterwards.</span> <span id="s274">And I went to Palestine but in Germany, Nuremberg, I got high fever and I developed double tuberculosis, and I, all the children went, and I had to be sent to Marano, first to Grupino to a sanitorium which the Nuns had and then to a Jewish hospital and I stayed 3 years.</span> <span id="s275">I had a pneumothorax of my left side, to push the lungs so that it shouldn't breath on its own.</span> <span id="s276">And, in 1952, I came to Israel, and married a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s277">Unfortunately, my husband died from cancer 11 years ago.</span> <span id="s278">We have two children, Alreet, she is 33, a criminologist; Donny, 27, he is, he finished the Army, he finished the studies, cinematography, communication and media.</span> <span id="s279">And I have 2 grandchildren.</span> <span id="s280">I have a 7 year old grandchild and a 2 year old grandchild, and my son-in- law is a dentist.</span> <span id="s281">We live very nicely in Israel.</span> <span id="s282">I love my life.</span> <span id="s283">I became a fund raiser.</span> <span id="s284">I fund raise for the United Jewish Appeal.</span> <span id="s285">I am a fund raiser in Israel.</span> <span id="s286">I dedicated my life to the Jewish people and I do it already since 10 years.</span> <span id="s287">I enjoy my life.</span> <span id="s288">I enjoy very much living.</span> <span id="s289">And just to tell you that I don't hate, there was a program in Israel, they asked people that speak German to invite German children to their home.</span> <span id="s290">I put my name on it, and I had 2 German children in my home because I have 2 children.</span> <span id="s291">So, I can tell you that they week that they have been was not easy because every time we talked I thought to myself maybe their grandfather was the one to put my sister in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s292">Yet, I have done it because I felt that with hatred, and I really mean it, you will not go far.</span> <span id="s293">I remember so many times hurting from the non-Jewish people, You are feshtunken Jude (ph), you stinking Jew.</span> <span id="s294">So when those two German children were in my home, as I am a very, very, very clean person to the extent my children were suffering, I always said, "Well, did you, did you have a shower."</span> <span id="s295">And they said to me, "Oh, Dora, you don't have to have a shower every day."</span> <span id="s296">The German children, and I said, "No, you don't" Oh, I think you do."</span> <span id="s297">And then I didn't want to let them know that I felt they have to understand that I am very peculiar on that, so I said to them, "But, you know, there was a time that the German people said that we stink, we Jewish people.</span> <span id="s298">Now smell, Donny and Alreet.</span> <span id="s299">Do we smell differently than you?"</span> <span id="s300">Then I was sorry that I said it because it is not the children's fault what happened and I was very happy that they went to Germany and I am sure they were talking to their parents or if they had still grandparents that this was a normal family with normal children with no stinking and no smelling.</span> <span id="s301">We laughed together.</span> <span id="s302">We played together.</span> <span id="s303">I showed them Israel, and it was my way of saying, "I don't hate.</span> <span id="s304">I really don't."</span> <span id="s305">My way of saying maybe if everybody would do that in the world, there wouldn't be the hatred.</span> <span id="s306">That's true.</span> <span id="s307">But I myself am not a normal person as all of you.</span> <span id="s308">I look at life differently.</span> <span id="s309">With all that, I had a wonderful life, a wonderful 26 year marriage, I have started, I have never been in a classroom.</span> <span id="s310">I have 2 new university degrees.</span> <span id="s311">I have achieved really the maximum one can achieve in such circumstances that I have been left when I was only 17.</span> <span id="s312">I entered the ghetto, was 7; I came out to the free world, I was over 17 because I was also 3 years in a hospital.</span> <span id="s313">So I really achieved the maximum one can achieve.</span> <span id="s314">But in my, deep in my heart, I do, when I walk on the streets and see the smiling people, sometimes I say to myself, "Where were you?"</span> <span id="s315">And I carry that and my days today I enjoy things much more powerful than others.</span> <span id="s316">I enjoy to open the window in my garden, in my home in Israel and see the blue sky.</span> <span id="s317">I live in a very nice house with lots of flowers.</span> <span id="s318">I enjoy everything around me.</span> <span id="s319">I enjoy tremendously the beautiful things in life.</span> <span id="s320">I enjoy theatre.</span> <span id="s321">I go to concerts.</span> <span id="s322">Maybe I enjoy too much because I just want to have it, what I didn't have.</span> <span id="s323">People ask me what kind of a mother was I. Over protective?</span> <span id="s324">No.</span> <span id="s325">No.</span> <span id="s326">I said often the children said, "Mother, show a little bit more love."</span> <span id="s327">Because I said well, if they said I have a headache or I have temperature, I would say, "Uh, that's nothing.</span> <span id="s328">It will go away."</span> <span id="s329">I feel that I was a very good mother, but not over protective.</span> <span id="s330">I have never told my children my life.</span> <span id="s331">They didn't want to hear it.</span> <span id="s332">My children don't want to hear about the Holocaust, and I try to not to talk to them.</span> <span id="s333">I do speak to high school children in Israel and here.</span> <span id="s334">But my own children would like to see a normal mother and the Israeli children don't think that the Holocaust was such a great heroism.</span> <span id="s335">I always thought that I was a great hero, but in Israel, no, they don't want to know that their mother was once hungry, that their mother was once saw the most terrible rape.</span> <span id="s336">They don't want to hear that.</span> <span id="s337">So, to tell a life of 6 years to someone like you is very difficult.</span> <span id="s338">It's very difficult to tell you the story from day 1 til the end, chronologically, because (a) there are many things which I don't remember and many things which I don't want to remember.</span> <span id="s339">But I understand that one has to talk.</span> <span id="s340">If I am almost the youngest, then probably soon you won't have anyone to talk.</span> <span id="s341">But I don't think that it's possible or feasible or you name it, to go back to everyday life and I see my 7 year old grandchild.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">The other day I called her up and she said, "Bring me a pair of glasses with birds on it."</span> <span id="s343">You know, I am talking to me.</span> <span id="s344">I said , what do you want?</span> <span id="s345">She said, "Grandmother, you have to bring me a pair of glasses, American glasses, with birds on it."</span> <span id="s346">7 years old!</span> <span id="s347">And I said to myself, "How wonderful it is to be 7 years old and to want glasses with birds."</span> <span id="s348">And while talking to you I say to myself, "What did I want when I was 7 years old."</span> <span id="s349">And therefore it is so very difficult for me to put it together, you know, and to say, well, on Sunday, I did this, on Monday, I did this, and year after year.</span> <span id="s350">It wouldn't be even real, because I don't remember, I don't want to remember.</span> <span id="s351">I want the Holocaust behind me.</span> <span id="s352">I have lived, since 1952 that I married, I lived a very normal life, a very happy person.</span> <span id="s353">I said yes to talk, because I feel it is important.</span> <span id="s354">I try to be real, but how real can one be in telling a story that I was hungry, when today I am on a diet.</span> <span id="s355">Really!</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Can you pick up on particular incidences such as the mass rape that you witnessed?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yes, we were punished in Stutthof for, I still had my mother and sister then, and then we were punished for 3 women escaped the camp.</span> <span id="s358">You know, I was in Auschwitz lately, and I saw the wires, the electric wires, and it was a flashback to this moment.</span> <span id="s359">I don't understand how they escaped.</span> <span id="s360">I really don't because the electric wires were not always on, but when they saw someone very near or when they saw someone that wants to touch them, they put it on and they were dead.</span> <span id="s361">Now, how those three women escaped electric wires, I don't know.</span> <span id="s362">But they did.</span> <span id="s363">They couldn't find them, and we were punished, 12 hours naked in cold weather, and additional punishment was they took out 4 or 5 and I don't remember how many women, and in front of all the women that we stood in a row, you know, they raped in a rape that I have never read or seen it, not in a movie and not on the television, and certainly you can say that we have a terrible television with all kinds of stories.</span> <span id="s364">And to see those young women raped by the men there with sticks, and my mother was near me and she took her hand and put on my eyes, I shouldn't see for the first time sexual intercourse.</span> <span id="s365">I have never seen sexual intercourse.</span> <span id="s366">I remember in my home the bedroom of my parents was far away from my room.</span> <span id="s367">I have never heard anything.</span> <span id="s368">I have never seen anything.</span> <span id="s369">And I was too small child.</span> <span id="s370">I never dated.</span> <span id="s371">This was not the ages of, I wasn't of the age to date.</span> <span id="s372">So to see that, I understand that my mother didn't want me to see this.</span> <span id="s373">Why did she hope that I will be alive and probably she thought if I see it, maybe I will be shy of men or whatever.</span> <span id="s374">But the men, the Germans saw what she did with her hand, and took her out of the row, and beat her up so that all her teeth fell out, the front teeth fell out.</span> <span id="s375">To tell you, when I married I am so, I am honest to tell you I have never even thought about this scene.</span> <span id="s376">When I first started to have sexual intercourse with a man, it never took me back there to that scene.</span> <span id="s377">I wished my mother would have known it.</span> <span id="s378">This is probably my strong nature that I have.</span> <span id="s379">I know how to disconnect myself, and when I started to date my husband, he was my first date, and my husband, I felt loved and I loved, and I didn't feel like thinking about what happened so many years ago.</span> <span id="s380">As I say, I wish she should have known it, that I became a normal person.</span> <span id="s381">In any way normal, except in the many things that I enjoy life maybe more powerful than all of you and that kind of a feeling of "Where were you?"</span> <span id="s382">And I don't want to put any guilt on anyone, especially I talk to people who weren't even born when I talk to them, as probably you, yourself, but I do ask the question again and again and again, "Where were you?</span> <span id="s383">Why did you let me rot there?"</span> <span id="s384">And that is what is in my life, but I try to do the best I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Are there any other particular incidences that are vivid memories for you that you would like to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yah, we were once put in a train going back and forth 3 days, 3 nights and, you know, they filled up the box car to the maximum, closed the windows and the doors, and to go 3 days and 3 nights without having a bathroom, you can imagine, without food, you can imagine what happened there.</span> <span id="s387">And I was very small and I was pushed out from my small space that they got and all of a sudden nobody wanted to give me back my little space.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">And so I was thrown from one corner to another.</span> <span id="s389">I was all bruised up, and then all of a sudden after being so tired and crying, I sat on someone and this person did not say anything.</span> <span id="s390">So I was sitting and sitting and sitting and I was so grateful.</span> <span id="s391">I remember vividly that I did speak to that person all the time until I fell asleep and then I wanted, when they opened the door, I wanted to say thank you for letting me rest finally, after being thrown from one corner to another, and that person was dead.</span> <span id="s392">To see those eyes, you know, you turn around and you say, "Gencuie(ph), which means in Polish, "Thank You," and those two big eyes, that was a scene which is, I also don't forget so easy.</span> <span id="s393">And there were many things that, many things in my life that I could talk about, but</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: The more things that you can share, the better.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Do I want to share everything?</span> <span id="s396">This is the question.</span> <span id="s397">Do I want to share everything I know or everything?</span> <span id="s398">Well, I don't think that I do want to say everything.</span> <span id="s399">Not because I don't want others to know, but I want to be happy and yesterday, I cried and the day before, I cried.</span> <span id="s400">Today I cry.</span> <span id="s401">Usually when I live in Israel, I don't.</span> <span id="s402">I don't talk Holocaust.</span> <span id="s403">It is, I don't!</span> <span id="s404">I live a very normal life, but I understand you need to show the world that it was true.</span> <span id="s405">I am sure that there were people that will hear my voice will say, "Well, she has a vivid imagination."</span> <span id="s406">Some people will not believe it, as today some people don't believe it.</span> <span id="s407">I mean not everybody believes it.</span> <span id="s408">But what could I tell you more?</span> <span id="s409">I loved my sister very much.</span> <span id="s410">She was very good to me.</span> <span id="s411">It's difficult.</span> <span id="s412">It's difficult to talk about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Really!</span> <span id="s414">It's a tough topic to talk, especially when I really am a very happy person.</span> <span id="s415">I am.</span> <span id="s416">I am extremely happy person.</span> <span id="s417">Even as a widow, I must say.</span> <span id="s418">I had wonderful 26 years, and I repeat it because it was given to be as a present.</span> <span id="s419">Others didn't have it.</span> <span id="s420">Not my sister, not all my family, not my mother, not my father, and I have to be grateful that I was chosen by God, or I don't know.</span> <span id="s421">It's a philosophical statement, by God or not by God, I was chosen to be alive and to enjoy life.</span> <span id="s422">So I do want to enjoy life very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Dora, if we take a little break at this point, do you think you might be able to go back to Stutthof and give us a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Fine.</span> <span id="s425">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: They are suggesting you mentioned that you were alone, and when we come back we can talk about being alone, if there were other people there that you knew, how people interacted with one another, things like that, not only the degradation, but perhaps the way people reached out and touched one another.</span> <span id="s427">We realize that this is very difficult for you, but it is so important to have it though.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Do you have a tissue?</span> <span id="s429">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s430">I certainly do.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: I wasn't ready for this crying, so I didn't take a tissue with me.</span> <span id="s432">Q: Go back to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s433">Tell me what you can.</span> <span id="s434">Ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: You are asking me about Stutthof.</span> <span id="s436">Now Stutthof was the last phase of my life under the Nazis.</span> <span id="s437">You have to remember that I was already very, very down.</span> <span id="s438">I had flacktiphus (ph) which is, means typhoid with spots.</span> <span id="s439">I had typhoid which means diarrhea.</span> <span id="s440">My sister was not there anymore.</span> <span id="s441">I was all alone.</span> <span id="s442">People did not talk to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: How old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Well, I was 12.</span> <span id="s445">I was 13 when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s446">You see even the age when I tell you, it is an assumption that I was 12 or 13.</span> <span id="s447">I, you know, because I really didn't know how old I was.</span> <span id="s448">I remembered only that I was born in the 30s, on 1st of February.</span> <span id="s449">That I remember, because I remember the birthday parties that were given to me.</span> <span id="s450">But when I was in the hospital after I got my bullets, they asked me, "How old are you?"</span> <span id="s451">And I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s452">And why didn't I know?</span> <span id="s453">Because when I had my mother still, when they were cleaning up the concentration camp from children, she would say to me, "If the Germans catch you, tell that you are 15, 15, 16."</span> <span id="s454">When we would go away from the camp, she would say, "Go and ask this Germans for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s455">Tell him that you are a little girl of 10.</span> <span id="s456">Of 9.</span> <span id="s457">Of 8."</span> <span id="s458">It went on and off.</span> <span id="s459">Once I was older because she was afraid that I would die if I say that, if they find out that my real age, and when she wanted me to beg for a piece of bread, she understood that maybe they would have some pity on a smaller child.</span> <span id="s460">So when I woke up after 3 days without conscious because I lost a lot of blood, being already on the verge of dying because I had typhoid and no food, no water, for the last time before the Russian entered.</span> <span id="s461">I woke up in a hospital in a wide bed with infusion here, infusion there, a cast, and they asked me how old I am and I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s462">I really didn't know.</span> <span id="s463">And piece by piece I have, when I came to Israel, and I found my brother and I found an Aunt that was in Siberia.</span> <span id="s464">She is 85 years old now, and she was telling me I was born in 32.</span> <span id="s465">She remembers it, but I said, I don't care if I was born in 31, 32, or 33.</span> <span id="s466">It was in the 30s.</span> <span id="s467">So I was very small, and I was probably the only child already at the last year that was left in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s468">Or maybe there were, but its 100,000 people.</span> <span id="s469">I knew only my barrack, or maybe the second barrack.</span> <span id="s470">Also, I didn't know people by name.</span> <span id="s471">Nobody was interested in me, and I wasn't interested in them.</span> <span id="s472">It was a gray life of getting up at very early in the morning and then thy had appell(ph) which means you had, they had to count you.</span> <span id="s473">We all, as you see, we don't have the number, but we had the number, Stutthof a number of, the iron number on a chain, which you wore all day long and all night long.</span> <span id="s474">And they never called you by name.</span> <span id="s475">They called you by number.</span> <span id="s476">What should people, grownup people that were hungry and were afraid, talk to a child that was not their family.</span> <span id="s477">Anyhow they knew that I am going to die because if the Germans will come and clean up from unwanted people, I will be the first one to go.</span> <span id="s478">So to say like today when you see a child on the street and this child has pain or something or a child lost his way, you ask, "Little girl or little boy, where do you want to go."</span> <span id="s479">Many times when I see a child crossing the street, "I say don't cross even when is green.</span> <span id="s480">Keep my hand."</span> <span id="s481">I'll cross the child.</span> <span id="s482">That was not in the camp.</span> <span id="s483">It wasn't!</span> <span id="s484">And I understand why.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Because everybody was afraid and frightened and hungry and thirsty and worked out and beaten up and so, the psychology was not the place in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s486">Psychology today, everybody today runs to the psychologist if he has the slightest problem.</span> <span id="s487">We didn't have psychologists.</span> <span id="s488">And people, even if they knew about psychology, which probably some knew, what, they were, we were not human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: What made you keep going in Stutthof after your mother and sister were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: I don't know if it is that I have very strong nature that I did want to survive.</span> <span id="s491">But those are words of today.</span> <span id="s492">I don't know why was I so strong.</span> <span id="s493">But I am a very strong person, and I remember, I have a diary so I take it out from the diary what I have written in 1945, 6, 7 when I was in the hospital, that when I felt hungry, really hungry to an extent that I tried, that I couldn't even think about anything else, I was thinking about the food which once upon a time I tasted.</span> <span id="s494">Bananas and oranges and chocolate.</span> <span id="s495">And I really felt that in the mouth, so that kept me.</span> <span id="s496">The fantasy!</span> <span id="s497">I developed probably a very big fantasy.</span> <span id="s498">I talked to myself.</span> <span id="s499">Today, even, sometimes I just talk to myself.</span> <span id="s500">I tell myself stories.</span> <span id="s501">And I am a very strong natured person.</span> <span id="s502">When my husband died, at the cemetery there was a very big funeral.</span> <span id="s503">He was a doctor.</span> <span id="s504">In the war, he was a high ranking officer, and we had lots of friends.</span> <span id="s505">Jews, non-Jews, Arabs.</span> <span id="s506">He had an office in Nazareth, and they loved him, so the funeral was thousands of people.</span> <span id="s507">The police came, and here a Jewish funeral in Israel is not very nice to look at.</span> <span id="s508">And the moment that they put the body in the hearse, I felt that I am going to faint and I don't like people to see me, not crying and not, I don't like anybody to pity me.</span> <span id="s509">There's nothing to pity at, so I said to myself, "How can I overcome this feeling of despair."</span> <span id="s510">And I said, "Well, I was married 26 years, wonderful life.</span> <span id="s511">I'll have another 26 of wonderful life."</span> <span id="s512">And that kept me of not fainting.</span> <span id="s513">And I make this analogy because probably even as a child I was the same one.</span> <span id="s514">It's my nature.</span> <span id="s515">I did not let myself die.</span> <span id="s516">Like people, I am sure that my mother, not only from hunger she died, as from saying, "I don't want anymore to live.</span> <span id="s517">There is nothing to live for."</span> <span id="s518">I don't have that kind of a nature.</span> <span id="s519">I was 6,3 years pneumothorax, pneumothorax is every 8 days they put you a needle, death sick, in your lung, and put air.</span> <span id="s520">It is a terrible, painful thing.</span> <span id="s521">And every 8 days I said to myself, "Oh, again, it's the pain."</span> <span id="s522">But I over came that.</span> <span id="s523">My nature is very strong, and I feel that has to do a lot why I survived and others didn't because let's face it, not everybody died in the gas chamber, not everybody died from bullets, not everybody died from beaten up, or from hunger.</span> <span id="s524">Many, many died from not wanting to live anymore.</span> <span id="s525">And I always wanted to live.</span> <span id="s526">Always!</span> <span id="s527">And I feel today when I reason to myself, "Why me, and 1,500,000 children not?"</span> <span id="s528">Is because I am a tremendous strong character.</span> <span id="s529">I have it in me.</span> <span id="s530">I over come hunger.</span> <span id="s531">I over come pain.</span> <span id="s532">For me to say to somebody will tell you, "You have to go to have an operation tomorrow."</span> <span id="s533">It's nothing!</span> <span id="s534">I went through four operations.</span> <span id="s535">Nothing!</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Can you describe the last day in the camp.</span> <span id="s537">What it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: The last day?</span> <span id="s539">Oh, we knew that the war is coming to end.</span> <span id="s540">That even I knew.</span> <span id="s541">But we knew because they were saying that the tanks, that they hear the roaring of the tanks of the battle.</span> <span id="s542">And, uh, I was lying in the barrack.</span> <span id="s543">We didn't get water.</span> <span id="s544">I was very sick, very sick.</span> <span id="s545">When they weighed me, I was 18 kilo.</span> <span id="s546">I don't know how much it is in pounds, but 18 kilo is very little, is very little.</span> <span id="s547">No hair.</span> <span id="s548">I had all stains on my body.</span> <span id="s549">I still have a few left.</span> <span id="s550">And the last day I did hear of lot of "Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu..." And I heard that people were praying because it was the end.</span> <span id="s551">And then, in the morning, people were hopeful.</span> <span id="s552">But in the morning, two Germans came with a machine gun and we heard that they were already in the barracks, in the other barracks.</span> <span id="s553">We heard the screaming.</span> <span id="s554">And I was lying on my tummy, and I got the two bullets in my back.</span> <span id="s555">I have quite a few holes on my back.</span> <span id="s556">I never did a plastic surgery on it.</span> <span id="s557">Never disturbed me.</span> <span id="s558">But, uh, and then I fainted.</span> <span id="s559">The last thing which I knew is that, and I remember it because I wrote it also in the diary, that from here til here, it's over.</span> <span id="s560">I don't have, I have only half a body because the fire of the bullets, you feel such a hot, such a heat, and you faint.</span> <span id="s561">You don't, you lose your conscious.</span> <span id="s562">I lost a lot of blood, and they told me that I was lying there 2 hours or something like that and the first tanks came in and with every battalion comes a field hospital, and male nurses came and they found this little girl still alive.</span> <span id="s563">So they took me in, into the hospital and I was operated, the first bullet was taken out.</span> <span id="s564">And they thought it is only one bullet and as it was broke and everything, they put me in a cast, but that was a terrible mistake, because I got an infection and they had to take out the cast and operate again to find, they knew already, that there must be a foreign body inside, with such a terrible infection.</span> <span id="s565">But it was very painful to lie in a cast which was full with infection, terrible painful.</span> <span id="s566">But here again, I wanted to live, and I survived that too.</span> <span id="s567">It wasn't very easy to live 3 years in a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s568">First was the Nuns.</span> <span id="s569">I didn't speak Italian.</span> <span id="s570">Not a word Italian.</span> <span id="s571">And they knew it.</span> <span id="s572">Every night, I took a piece of bread and a potato, put it under the pillow.</span> <span id="s573">Maybe tomorrow there won't be food.</span> <span id="s574">Every night they took it away in the morning, and every night I put back from the dinner a piece of bread and a potato.</span> <span id="s575">So to say that I was a total, normal person when the war was over, probably not if this was my daily routine of hiding a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s576">But afterwards, I got used to, I started to speak Italian.</span> <span id="s577">I was the only child in the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s578">The only child!</span> <span id="s579">This, in my life, the problem is that I never had a childhood.</span> <span id="s580">Wherever I was, I was the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: What sanitarium was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Grupino.</span> <span id="s583">It was an Italian, you know 45 years ago, tuberculosis was an illness that was contagious.</span> <span id="s584">You never went out from there.</span> <span id="s585">Therefore, the Nuns were there because they were so committed.</span> <span id="s586">They were not afraid to get the illness.</span> <span id="s587">But then a Jewish hospital was opened, and so they transferred me to there.</span> <span id="s588">But even there, I was the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">There were 2 or 3 17 or 18 year old, but I was the only child wherever I went I was the only child.</span> <span id="s590">It shows you only that the number of the 1,500,000 is so real, because today wherever I go, and I say I am a Holocaust survivor, and they say, "How old were you?"</span> <span id="s591">And I say, "7 when I started."</span> <span id="s592">They say, "No, it's impossible."</span> <span id="s593">I don't know how many Holocaust survivors you met, but I have met at The Gathering in Israel, I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s594">The NBC reporter took me from, aside and said, "Can I speak to you as a second generation?"</span> <span id="s595">And I talked to him, and I said what do you say, you look so young.</span> <span id="s596">He said I am the first cast.</span> <span id="s597">Because lately when we gathered in Jerusalem, the people were old people.</span> <span id="s598">I felt like I was again the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: In Stutthof, did you work?</span> <span id="s600">Was it slave labor or did you just kind of stay in the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Some days we worked, and some days we stayed in the barracks.</span> <span id="s602">Work, what it is.</span> <span id="s603">You didn't go out to work.</span> <span id="s604">Stutthof did not go out to work.</span> <span id="s605">We worked, some women probably worked in cleaning up and some in ironing for the Germans and some in there, they wants, the labor was to carry stones from one corner to another, cement, cleaning up, you know, the asphalt.</span> <span id="s606">No, we did not work, productive work like going out in an ammunition or in a painting factory or whatever.</span> <span id="s607">I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: What about in Kaiserwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Kaiserwald was a transfer, uh, camp.</span> <span id="s610">It was not, I don't know if in Kaiserwald, people lived more than for 2 or 3 or 4 weeks.</span> <span id="s611">It was like from Kaiserwald, they were sent to Stutthof to Dinenwerke, whatever.</span> <span id="s612">Kaiserwald was in Riga.</span> <span id="s613">I have never seen Riga.</span> <span id="s614">But Kaiserwald is in Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: How did you move from Kaiserwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Trains.</span> <span id="s617">By trains, yah.</span> <span id="s618">Always trains, always trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Can you describe the transport?</span> <span id="s620">Was there a lot of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: A lot of people in one.</span> <span id="s622">But there were trains just for suffering like I did describe to you.</span> <span id="s623">And there were trains that they transported you from one place to another.</span> <span id="s624">Those trains, they transported you from one place to another, the window was open.</span> <span id="s625">So there was light in, and they did stop.</span> <span id="s626">They did stop to take you out to do whatever you had to do.</span> <span id="s627">Those trains which I described to you, I was once, those were just back and forth for some, no destination.</span> <span id="s628">It's just another way of making you suffer.</span> <span id="s629">Look, you ask me again and again about Stutthof.</span> <span id="s630">It was a miserable, daily life.</span> <span id="s631">You know, uh, many Holocaust survivors say that there was no greenery.</span> <span id="s632">I recently was, I was in Auschwitz, and I saw around there was green grass.</span> <span id="s633">Trees!</span> <span id="s634">Why didn't we see that.</span> <span id="s635">It seems to me that all they have burned the grass, or, I don't know, but we never saw any greenery.</span> <span id="s636">There was always grayness.</span> <span id="s637">The barrack was gray.</span> <span id="s638">The cot was gray.</span> <span id="s639">Everything was gray.</span> <span id="s640">Today is around there, nature makes it when it's raining and sunshine, there is growing grass somewhere.</span> <span id="s641">We never saw grass.</span> <span id="s642">We never saw any greenery.</span> <span id="s643">No flowers!</span> <span id="s644">Sometimes blue skies, when the sky was blue, was blue.</span> <span id="s645">I don't know if we noticed the sky as is blue.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Was there any attempt on the part of the inmates to mark the passage of time either secular time or Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Maybe there was, but not with me.</span> <span id="s648">Nobody taught me anything.</span> <span id="s649">Nobody taught me about religion.</span> <span id="s650">Nobody taught me about Jewishness.</span> <span id="s651">Nobody told me why, why are we in concentration camp?</span> <span id="s652">No.</span> <span id="s653">I have no memory of somebody saying, "Come little girl, I'll teach you how much is 2 and 2," or "Tell me about your, the name of your doll."</span> <span id="s654">I don't remember anybody asking me that.</span> <span id="s655">No.</span> <span id="s656">But maybe it's my own story.</span> <span id="s657">Maybe other grownup, more children, or, yes, when I had my sister, we did talk.</span> <span id="s658">We fantasized.</span> <span id="s659">She was very, she was so good to me.</span> <span id="s660">But once I was alone, but I think everybody was alone.</span> <span id="s661">Maybe there were grownup people that had friends.</span> <span id="s662">I was even alone sleeping in this gray, there were another 3, 4 women, but nobody covered me with a blanket or gave me a kiss or whatever.</span> <span id="s663">I don't remember ever, ever getting any love in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s664">And I don't know why should they if everybody was so afraid that the next day they'll all take them to the hospital which they made some kind of, I have heard, that they made all kinds of things in the hospital.</span> <span id="s665">I was never, never in the hospital there.</span> <span id="s666">And sometimes I have seen coming back from a barrack, from another barrack and the people had, and the woman had head blue, and they were crying.</span> <span id="s667">So what should I have told.</span> <span id="s668">Today when somebody is crying, I ask, "why do you cry?"</span> <span id="s669">But I didn't ask even why do you cry.</span> <span id="s670">Because everybody was crying sometimes.</span> <span id="s671">I was crying sometimes too.</span> <span id="s672">Was a very lonely life in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s673">Very lonely!</span> <span id="s674">It was the end.</span> <span id="s675">Don't forget that that was already 44.</span> <span id="s676">It's not like 39, 40, 41, 42, where you still had the hope that some miracle mishirhole(ph) or the Messiah will come.</span> <span id="s677">44, I don't believe that people had any hope of surviving.</span> <span id="s678">I don't believe it.</span> <span id="s679">You just were there saying, "When is my, it's me that will go to the gas chamber?"</span> <span id="s680">And every day, you saw those, the groups of people going in and never coming back.</span> <span id="s681">I didn't count them.</span> <span id="s682">I don't know, but they never came back.</span> <span id="s683">And if someone that knew you was asleep and she didn't come back, I wasn't explained why didn't she come back, and I wasn't, must tell you, I wasn't even interested too ask, "Where is she?"</span> <span id="s684">I wasn't intelligent enough, maybe, to ask, "Where is this person that the other night was sleeping near me?"</span> <span id="s685">I was so small.</span> <span id="s686">Take my own grandchild, 7.</span> <span id="s687">What does she interested in?</span> <span id="s688">I was not different than a 10 year old child.</span> <span id="s689">I speak to 10 and 9 year old children.</span> <span id="s690">I listen to their questions, and they live already in a life where Holocaust has happened, where they are exposed to brutality and the television.</span> <span id="s691">Your television is very brutal.</span> <span id="s692">And I was not exposed to that.</span> <span id="s693">There was no television in those times.</span> <span id="s694">I hardly could read.</span> <span id="s695">So I couldn't even read terrible things.</span> <span id="s696">So, a lonely life.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: I'd like to ask you once more if there are any particular incidences that stand out in your mind that you would like to have recorded on this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I would like to say to the women and mothers that will listen to me that the love of a Jewish mother or any other mother, I don't know, I am Jewish so I am speaking about the Jewish mother, was so strong that one day, you know, that tracks would always come to clean up the concentration camp from old, sick, invalids, and children, and my mother always managed to save me.</span> <span id="s699">And one day, she didn't hear the whistle of the tracks and it was too late, and as you know we didn't have any bathrooms, but we had pits where we did what we had to do.</span> <span id="s700">And in despair, she took the little girl and she threw me there inside, praying to God that it wasn't deeper than I, my height, and I was standing there til here til the tracks went away, and she came out and took me out.</span> <span id="s701">There was no hot water, and she washed me with cold water.</span> <span id="s702">Didn't have any hair, so it wasn't so terrible.</span> <span id="s703">But the smell couldn't come out from me, and people didn't like to sit near me.</span> <span id="s704">I remember , "Get away, take away, that smelly child."</span> <span id="s705">That I remember very vividly, and I am telling it to those people, to those women that have children and that will listen, that the love of a mother, and she did not really know if she could take out me alive, because if it would have been fuller, I would have been drown in that, but I did stand til here, could still breath.</span> <span id="s706">Eh, I don't know if people, even that will listen to my story, if they comprehend what happened in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s707">I don't know, because I, myself, when I am talking to you, I ask myself, "Do you really comprehend what went there?"</span> <span id="s708">Because I think that the two people that are sitting here as gentlemen, and you don't.</span> <span id="s709">You don't!</span></p> <p><span id="s710">You have never heard it.</span> <span id="s711">You have never seen it.</span> <span id="s712">And I hope that you will never, never feel it.</span> <span id="s713">That to tell a story like that 45 years later, that a mother throws the child from desperation into a pit and thinks, "Well, maybe she'll drown and maybe not."</span> <span id="s714">I don't think that you understand it, because I don't understand it either.</span> <span id="s715">I don't understand it.</span> <span id="s716">It's difficult to talk about it.</span> <span id="s717">I hope other people will learn a lesson from it, but it's unheard what, what happened there.</span> <span id="s718">It's unheard.</span> <span id="s719">It was never in the history, and nobody can convince me there was anything like it in the history of humankind.</span> <span id="s720">We had wars, we had pogroms, we had Armenian people, we had Biafra--you name it.</span> <span id="s721">But systematically kill people in the way like the Germans did, and the number and the number.</span> <span id="s722">When I think about it, that uh a earthquake takes 400 people and the whole world is shocked.</span> <span id="s723">We send everything possible to save the people, to help them; and 1,500,000 kids, like myself, and nobody send anything, and nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s724">I cannot, and will not ever, 'til I live, understand what happened.</span> <span id="s725">What happened with the world?</span> <span id="s726">And I think it's important that people hear you.</span> <span id="s727">I spoken in Northshore, in Salem school to 105 children.</span> <span id="s728">Not even one Jewish child was there in the classroom.</span> <span id="s729">Was in the gym.</span> <span id="s730">There were mostly blacks, Puerto Ricans--American children.</span> <span id="s731">And I talked to them about the Holocaust, and told them about some of the stories.</span> <span id="s732">And the children just were quiet, and some had tears in their eyes.</span> <span id="s733">And one child, black child, asked me--such a clever little boy--asked me, "Mrs. Roth, can I ask you a question?"</span> <span id="s734">And he says, "Are you angry?"</span> <span id="s735">I said, "How can I explain that?"</span> <span id="s736">I said, "Yes, and No.</span> <span id="s737">I am angry and not angry.</span> <span id="s738">Angry that nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s739">Not angry because I do have that luck that I am telling you this story."</span> <span id="s740">So I shouldn't be totally angry.</span> <span id="s741">And it's so important, in my opinion, to really...to tell that story to the children.</span> <span id="s742">Because uh they will learn from it, the lesson.</span> <span id="s743">How much, I don't know.</span> <span id="s744">The world is very, the world is very brutal, still, but maybe they'll learn it from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s747">Thank you, too.</span> <span id="s748">All of you that.</span> <span id="s749">And I am sorry that I don't like to cry.</span> <span id="s750">There is nothing to cry, really, but it's difficult to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
