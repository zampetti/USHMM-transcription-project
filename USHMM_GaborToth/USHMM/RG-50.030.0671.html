Ginsberg, G-I-N-S-B-E-R-G.</span> <span id="s24">Geller, G-E-L-L-E-R.</span> <span id="s25">By the way, Ginsberg has been spelled several different ways in the time since we left Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s26">At one time it was Gunsburg, G-U, with an umlaut, and B-U-R-G.</span> <span id="s27">But we've gone by Ginsberg now for the last 60 years, I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Thank you for elaborating on that.</span> <span id="s29">Can you tell us where you -- when you were born and where?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s31">I was born April the 10th, 1933, in the town of Moravska Ostrave in Czechoslovakia, sometimes known as Maehrisch-Ostrau because German was spoken there, also.</span> <span id="s32">It was actually part of Moravia.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Can you also spell Moravska Ostrave, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes, it's M-O-R-A-V-S-K-A.</span> <span id="s35">Another word, Ostrave, O-S-T-R-A-V-E.</span> <span id="s36">And Czechoslovakia, which no longer exists, but is now the Czech Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s38">Can you please tell us the names of your mother and father?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s40">My father was Gerson, G-E-R-S-O-N, Ginsberg.</span> <span id="s41">And my mother was Blanche Basia, B-A-S-I-A.</span> <span id="s42">That was a Polish name.</span> <span id="s43">Ginsberg, maiden name of</span></p> <p><span id="s44">E-H-R-L-I-C-H.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: And what years were they born?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A : My father was born, actually, July 7th, 1897.</span> <span id="s47">And he was born in a city called Szinov, S-Z-I-N-O-V, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s48">And my mother was born in Krakow, Poland, on the 13th of March in 1904.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: And what was the primary language that you spoke at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: It was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q:uestion: Was it -- are you talking about Czechoslovakia or when we moved to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: I'm talking about Czechoslovakia right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Well, Czechoslovakia, it was Czech, but also sometimes German.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s55">But no Polish, because your mother is from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A : No.</span> <span id="s57">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s59">What was the occupation of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: My father was, actually, a fur merchant and he had a business.</span> <span id="s61">In those days, that was okay.</span> <span id="s62">Now fur merchants aren't regarded very well.</span> <span id="s63">And my mother used to work in his business.</span> <span id="s64">He was actually Q:uite successful and owned property, actually owned property in Berlin and had a house for his parents in Szinov where he was born, and traveled a great deal all over Europe and even to Canada.</span> <span id="s65">This is all pre-war, of course.</span> <span id="s66">And he did end up on business in London before the Germans invaded, but we were there and they would not allow us to join him.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did you have any siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s69">I had a wonderful brother by the name of Oskar, O-S-K-A-R, and, unfortunately, lost him at a very young age of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s70">But he did survive and go to England and then America with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And when was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: He was born November 16th, 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: What else do you remember about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A : He was a fantastic, wonderful, giving young man.</span> <span id="s75">We were very close.</span> <span id="s76">As youngsters, of course, he used to tease me.</span> <span id="s77">But we had a very, very wonderful relationship where he lived -- after we came to the United States and after I was married and moved out to California, we would travel back and forth, send children back and forth, our children to visit.</span> <span id="s78">He took my sons up to Yosemite when he came out for a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s79">We celebrated weddings, of course, and Bar Mitzvahs of our nephews.</span> <span id="s80">And they came out to celebrate things out here in California with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: So he -- right.</span> <span id="s82">He moved from England to the -- or he stayed in England when you moved to the U.S. or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A : No.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A : No, he actually came to the U.S. on his own as a teenager.</span> <span id="s86">He was 19, I believe, and he came on the Q:ueen Mary.</span> <span id="s87">I came with my parents.</span> <span id="s88">I was 15 when we came from England to America, and that was in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A : But he preceded us –</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A : -- by a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: We'll talk more about your time in England, but first I wanted to know more -- do you remember -- what else do you remember about Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A : Well, interestingly enough, I find it hard to believe, but I remember the Germans marching in.</span> <span id="s95">We lived in a very lovely apartment in Czechoslovakia -- in Moravska Ostrave.</span> <span id="s96">And I was only six -- not even six years old, but I do remember the Germans marching in in the Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s97">And to this day, we have never ever considered getting a Mercedes Benz, which, I guess, doesn't make a lot of sense.</span> <span id="s98">But it was a -- something that I remember seeing the Germans, you know, with the Heil Hitler with the arms out and the soldiers.</span> <span id="s99">And certainly not understanding what was going on, but knowing something was really wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: And how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A : Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s103">Let's talk a little bit more about your family life before the Germans arrived.</span> <span id="s104">Did you live in an apartment or a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: We lived in an apartment.</span> <span id="s106">Czechoslovakia, as opposed to Poland, was really Q:uite modern.</span> <span id="s107">It was a very modern city.</span> <span id="s108">And later on I may talk about a cousin of mine who visited Czechoslovakia as a child, and then after surviving Auschwitz, was on the death march and marched through Czechoslovakia and remembered.</span> <span id="s109">And he has written a book, which I'll discuss later on.</span> <span id="s110">He now lives in Israel.But we were really Q:uite well-off.</span> <span id="s111">But we had -- since my mother worked, we had people to help take care of me and my brother.</span> <span id="s112">And we had a really lovely apartment with lovely furniture.</span> <span id="s113">And I went to a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s114">It was actually a Jewish kindergarten.</span> <span id="s115">I still have pictures, you know, all dressed up for Mother's Day on tricycles and -- it was -- it was a very, very nice life in Czechoslovakia for my parents and, of course, for us until everything changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: So you and your brother had a nanny.</span> <span id="s117">What about maids?</span> <span id="s118">Were there maids as well to help out?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: We had -- yes.</span> <span id="s120">Yes, we had people -- yes.</span> <span id="s121">In fact, even someone who cooked and -- yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A : We lived pretty comfortable in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: And what special occasions or holidays did you celebrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: My father -- Q:uite religious in fact -- Heschel Shabbat.</span> <span id="s126">And I don't know if you know what that means, but he observed the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s127">And, of course, we celebrated Friday nights and had Shabbats dinners and all the holidays.</span> <span id="s128">You know, from (?</span> <span id="s129">casa?)</span> <span id="s130">always and Purim.</span> <span id="s131">Purim was a big thing, especially as a child, you know, you get dressed up.</span> <span id="s132">And my mother was a very modern lady and she had been a skier and they had been in Paris.</span> <span id="s133">And I have pictures of them and -- not on the actual Eiffel Tower, but, you know, one of the funny pictures with an Eiffel Tower and them hanging out of it, my father and my mother.</span> <span id="s134">They were amazing parents, both of them.</span> <span id="s135">Just amazing people up until the very end.</span> <span id="s136">Unfortunately, as you'll hear, my father died Q:uite young after what he went through.</span> <span id="s137">But my mother lived to be 89 and was a truly amazing lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s139">What else do you remember about the city before the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, not really that much.</span> <span id="s141">I mean, I remember that I went to a school, like a kindergarten.</span> <span id="s142">And we used to go to the park and things were very nice.</span> <span id="s143">It was pretty much an industrial city.</span> <span id="s144">Right now, I think it's -- I haven't been back there.</span> <span id="s145">We've been back to Prague several times with my husband.</span> <span id="s146">But I've not gone back to Moravska Ostrave.</span> <span id="s147">And I've heard, you know, that there's a lot of pollution because there are factories and coal burning things.</span> <span id="s148">So we haven't -- I haven't gone back there.</span> <span id="s149">But, as I said, we have been to Czechoslovakia, to Prague, and to cal -- (?</span> <span id="s150">Calurvi?)</span> <span id="s151">-- it was called Bard, (ph) but it had a different name in Czech.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Saleveece barry (ph) I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: And what were some of the activities that you and your brother participated in together?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A : In Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Really --</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: I know you were Q:uite young.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A : Not much because he was older and he was in school, and I, you know, played with children.</span> <span id="s160">And just like here, you know, if you're in kindergarten, your activities are a little different than if you're four years older.</span> <span id="s161">But we did visit our grandparents and we had visitors from, as I mentioned before, my cousins Zvi Barlev, whose book by the way, is in the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s162">I donated it.</span> <span id="s163">It's in several different museums.</span> <span id="s164">He did write about his experience, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Do you remember the title of the book?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Yes, it's called "Would God it Were Night."</span> <span id="s167">His name is Zvi Barlev.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Can you spell his name for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A : Z-V-I, and the second name B-A-R-L-E-V.</span> <span id="s170">However, that's his Israeli name.</span> <span id="s171">His Polish name was Bleicher.</span> <span id="s172">B-L-E-I-C-H-E-R.</span> <span id="s173">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And the book actually talks about the ordeal of a Jewish boy from Krakow through Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Gusen, Gusen.</span> <span id="s176">And it talks about the death march after Auschwitz, you know, before it was liberated, and his walking through the town that he visited when he was a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: I assume you attended synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: You said your family was religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I am a very active member of synagogue here in Riverside, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And do you remember how many other Jews were in your area at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A : Oh, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s183">Are you talking about Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Sorry, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A : That I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A : We -- I remember London very well, the synagogue, because I used to go with my father all the time.</span> <span id="s188">But in Czechoslovakia, no, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s189">But we definitely were members.</span> <span id="s190">In those days, as I said, my family, my father in particular, was Orthodox, my mother not as much.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s192">Now, in Czechoslovakia, do you remember any instances of anti-Semitism before the Germans came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A : I don't.</span> <span id="s194">I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Have you -- has anyone told you -- did your parents tell you about any?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: No.</span> <span id="s197">As opposed to things that were going on in places like Poland and Lithuania, no.</span> <span id="s198">Czechoslovakia was -- no.</span> <span id="s199">It was only formed between the World Wars, and it had really progressive governments and it allowed the Jews, you know, to own property.</span> <span id="s200">And my father, as I mentioned -- I mean, at the age, I think, of 24 bought an apartment house.</span> <span id="s201">Actually, the apartment house was in Berlin.</span> <span id="s202">You know, so, of course, those were times when there was, you know, major problems economically in Germany.</span> <span id="s203">So -- but he was a very -- well, he was a wonderful man, but he was a very astute businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: So let's talk about when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s205">Do you remember when that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A : I think it was in March of 1939.</span> <span id="s207">It may have been a little bit earlier, but I think it was in 1939.</span> <span id="s208">Actually, Czechoslovakia was given -- land was given to the Germans in 1938, but I don't think they marched into Moravska Ostrave until 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s210">You said before that you remember that.</span> <span id="s211">Can you tell us more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A : Well, I find it difficult to believe this myself, but I was in the street, maybe with a nanny or something or with the maid.</span> <span id="s213">You know, somebody, not my mother.</span> <span id="s214">And I remember the cars and I remember the Germans coming in.</span> <span id="s215">And then a very interesting thing is that a German came over to me and there was like, a candy store right there.</span> <span id="s216">And I was a cute little child, and he said to me in German -- I spoke German at the time -- that I have a little girl like you at home, and actually took me into the candy store and bought me a piece of candy.</span> <span id="s217">I mean, that's the kind of thing -- you know, it seems really a weird thing to remember, but that --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Do you remember anything else about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No.</span> <span id="s220">No.</span> <span id="s221">And, obviously, he wasn't in one of the cars, though, he was probably marching.</span> <span id="s222">Because it was a whole, you know, like, a march into town.</span> <span id="s223">And it was a big city, I mean, it was a cosmopolitan city.</span> <span id="s224">I don't know how many people, but, you know, it had cinemas.</span> <span id="s225">It was a very contemporary city.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Do you remember what happened after he bought you candy?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No.</span> <span id="s228">He just went on his way and I probably was taken upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s230">So you lived near the candy store?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes, the candy store was very close.</span> <span id="s232">And maybe that's what we were doing downstairs.</span> <span id="s233">It's hard, I was six.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A : But it's amazing, even to me, that -- well, you know, it's a pretty momentous situation.</span> <span id="s236">I mean, there's so many things that I don't remember later, although I do remember -- well, we will go into that, how we left.</span> <span id="s237">And that was an amazing situation, too.</span> <span id="s238">But you probably will want to ask me Q:uestions about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Yeah, definitely.</span> <span id="s240">We'll get into that in a little bit.</span> <span id="s241">Do you remember anything else about when they came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A : No, I don't.</span> <span id="s243">Because after that, I don't -- things didn't change that much at that point.</span> <span id="s244">I mean, I think I still, you know, went to the kindergarten and -- at that point.</span> <span id="s245">You know, later on, of course, it was totally changed and the children were sent to Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s246">Most of them, you know, was murdered.</span> <span id="s247">But in the very beginning, it hadn't hit yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s249">So in March they -- you remember them coming in, and then when did you leave for Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A : Okay.</span> <span id="s251">Now, it's very difficult for me to give you an actual date, but let me tell you how we left for Krakow.</span> <span id="s252">The Germans -- my mother wanted to take us to England where my father was.</span> <span id="s253">And there was no way she could get permission, but somehow she was able to talk -- now, you know, this was something that I found out a lot later -- to someone in the German, well, authority -- and she was a charmer.</span> <span id="s254">She was an absolute charmer.</span> <span id="s255">And she was able to talk them into her taking her two children to visit her father who was dying in Krakow.</span> <span id="s256">That was my grandfather.</span> <span id="s257">He was actually dying, he did have stomach cancer.</span> <span id="s258">And so we just put on clothes, you know, a couple layers of clothes and went on the train and went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s259">The amazing thing is, that she was able to ship things to London.</span> <span id="s260">You know, which is an unusual story, because, you know, usually you just leave everything and that's the end of it.</span> <span id="s261">But to this day, I have menorahs.</span> <span id="s262">My daughter now has beautiful candlesticks, and, you know, many things.</span> <span id="s263">And I was asked if I would donate stuff to the museum, and, actually, I want to keep it for my children, and grandchildren --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s265">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: -- to have.</span> <span id="s267">But she -- she was able to ship things.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So she shipped the items before you left for Krakow or to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A : Yes -- no, to London, to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s271">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A : And -- but then when we left, we left with nothing and went on the train and went to Krakow.</span> <span id="s273">And she stayed with my grandfather and I was taken care of by, you know, my cousins and aunts and my brother, too.</span> <span id="s274">And my grandfather died.</span> <span id="s275">And he died, actually, I guess it was beginning of August of 1939.</span> <span id="s276">And she sat Shiva.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">I don't know if you know what that is, Shiva is the seven days that you sit after someone dies.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: And then she tried to talk her sisters and brothers to let her take their children to London.</span> <span id="s280">And everybody said, no, you know, he's got Czechoslovakia and that's going to be it.</span> <span id="s281">You know, he's -- you know, that's -- and they -- nobody left except for my mother, my brother, and I. And we went across Poland and went to a port called Gdynia at the time because it was part of Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Can you spell that for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A : G-D -- gu din (ph) -- N-I-A I think.</span> <span id="s284">Gud (ph) -- oh, Y. Let me just write it out.</span> <span id="s285">The thing is that that port changed many times.</span> <span id="s286">That port was called Gdansk and also Danzig when it was part of Germany.</span> <span id="s287">Danzig.</span> <span id="s288">And Gdynia would be G-D-N-Y -- gu din (ph) -- A I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s290">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s292">And Gdansk is probably easier to spell.</span> <span id="s293">It's G -- gurs (ph) -- D -- dunk.</span> <span id="s294">G-D-E-N-A-S-K I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s296">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: But it's been -- you probably can look it up.</span> <span id="s298">Danzig the different names that it's gone under.</span> <span id="s299">You know, these things went back between Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s300">So we took a ship and went across the English Channel --</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So this is your mother, yourself, and your brother, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Right.</span> <span id="s303">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And how did she get permission to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A : Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A : She -- I don't think she -- I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A : I don't think -- you know, it was still -- you know, she had a passport, I think, and you were able to travel in Europe.</span> <span id="s310">I mean, this was before the Germans invaded and -- I mean, my father had gone to England from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s311">They traveled all over, all over Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: And so, you know, they had passports or whatever they needed to travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And what was your father doing in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: He went on business, you know, to -- no, my father went on business.</span> <span id="s316">But my father was a worrier, and that will explain what happened to him later.</span> <span id="s317">And he, I think, foresaw that things were going to happen, and so he went to, to England on business.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s319">So he was the one who instigated you coming across to London to meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A : Right.</span> <span id="s321">Right.</span> <span id="s322">Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s323">I mean, we wouldn't have gone otherwise.</span> <span id="s324">He -- he had gone.</span> <span id="s325">And I can't tell you how long he was there, but I can tell you that when he -- we came there, he was only 39.</span> <span id="s326">He was in the hospital with a heart attack.</span> <span id="s327">So the pressures and the strains, you know, of the family -- and between my father and my mother, they were able to get us over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Did you need special permission from the British to stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A : No.</span> <span id="s330">That's such an interesting thing because the British -- actually, there were many refugees that came to England.</span> <span id="s331">Most countries, including America, including, you know, so many countries, even in South America and Australia, you know, nobody really wanted the Jews to come.</span> <span id="s332">But my father was there on business, and it's not just -- we then made friends with a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s333">In fact, I'm still a close friend of somebody who came from Moravska Ostrave that were close friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s334">The name was Winer, (ph) and she's now married.</span> <span id="s335">Her name is Honey Arnold.</span> <span id="s336">She's still alive and she's in England.</span> <span id="s337">And we're still in touch and close.</span> <span id="s338">We visit there and they visited here.</span> <span id="s339">And they came to London.</span> <span id="s340">And there were probably oh -- not dozens -- there were many, many people that came to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">And that is amazing.</span> <span id="s342">I don't know, because I know the British have not always been wonderful, they were very difficult.</span> <span id="s343">We were in London at the time of Israel being established, and certainly the British were pretty bad about letting Jews into Israel.</span> <span id="s344">So we were just very lucky.</span> <span id="s345">We did have an -- my mother had an aunt there, her sis -- her mother's sister lived in England for many years.</span> <span id="s346">And so we actually lived with her for a little while until we got established in England.</span> <span id="s347">But that was not an easy time either, because it was wartime and the Blitz and everything else.</span> <span id="s348">But, you know, these are things that, as I got older, you know, I remembered more things about what happened and our evacuation and the bombings and going into the underground shelters.</span> <span id="s349">And so it was a difficult time, but as children, you sort of adapt to what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: We'll talk about -- more about the Blitz in a minute.</span> <span id="s351">Can you first tell us -- did you have other family members that stayed behind in Moravska?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s353">Well, actually, in Szinov.</span> <span id="s354">My two grandparents, my father's -- my father was an only child, and the only family we had were his parents.</span> <span id="s355">And we used to visit -- oh, that was something I forgot to mention.</span> <span id="s356">As a child, we used to go out to Szinov and they had a big garden with fruit.</span> <span id="s357">And we used to go and pick berries.</span> <span id="s358">So we had a -- really had a very nice childhood in the beginning.</span> <span id="s359">Well, it was pretty short.</span> <span id="s360">But they stayed there and, unfortunately -- well, maybe fortunately for him, my grandfather also passed away.</span> <span id="s361">But my grandmother, Ella, her name was Ella Brenner, his name was David Ginsberg, she did not survive and was killed by the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Was she deported to a concentration camp or -- A : Yes.</span> <span id="s363">But, actually, not from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s364">Because of my mother's big -- my mother had a very big family as opposed to my father.</span> <span id="s365">She actually went to Krakow, and from there she was deported.</span> <span id="s366">And I don't know exactly where or when, but she was killed, as was my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s367">They were both killed by the Nazis, as were a couple of my mother's siblings and some children, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: If you -- we do some research here at the museum, so if you're interested in finding out more information, we might be able to look that up for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A : Well, that would be great.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Her name was Ella Brenner -- well, Ginsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A : And my other grandmother was Erlich, Eva Erlich, maiden name of Corow.</span> <span id="s374">(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: And I think after the recording, maybe if you can email me the information, and I'll pass it on to the researchers here.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A : Well, that would be very, very good.</span> <span id="s377">Yeah.</span> <span id="s378">My cousin, by the way, Zvi Barlev who ended up, besides writing the book, being with the Israeli Diplomatic Corp.</span> <span id="s379">He was -- after all he'd gone through, he was first secretary in London.</span> <span id="s380">Actually, it was in Buckingham Palace with the Q:ueen.</span> <span id="s381">He was also first secretary in Sweden and lived in Stockholm for a while.</span> <span id="s382">He did a lot of research.</span> <span id="s383">And we, actually, you know, have a -- he put together a family tree.</span> <span id="s384">Not so much of my father's side like Ella Ginsberg, but of the Ehrlich side, which was my mother's maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Did you spend a lot of time with him growing up, or was he a different age?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A : He was older.</span> <span id="s387">He was, you know, Q:uite -- well, several years older, and not that much.</span> <span id="s388">Because he lived in Krakow, he visited us and we visited there.</span> <span id="s389">But it, you know -- a visit would be a short visit.</span> <span id="s390">But I've been very close to him.</span> <span id="s391">We've been to Israel now 26 or 27 times.</span> <span id="s392">And so, you know, we've been in touch.</span> <span id="s393">And they've been here.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Because he -- as I said, you probably can find the book at, you know, at the museum.</span> <span id="s396">So that -- but there are a lot of books that have been written, but, of course, this one was published -- I guess it was a self-publish thing by Vantage.</span> <span id="s397">And it did have a forward, actually, I think, by Elie Weisel even.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A : It was translated from the Hebrew, not only into English, but into Swedish and Norwegian.</span> <span id="s400">And so the book was in a few different places.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: When you first came to London, did you live in an apartment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A : No, we went to live with my great aunt.</span> <span id="s403">It was my grandmother's sister.</span> <span id="s404">We lived with her.</span> <span id="s405">She had a house at Six and Andrews Grove in Stamford Hills.</span> <span id="s406">And we lived with her because my father was in the hospital, as I said, with a heart attack.</span> <span id="s407">But once he recovered, then we moved into an apartment at Two Stamford Hill Mansion.</span> <span id="s408">And that's where we lived until -- I mean, we lived there the whole time, but I was -- we were evacuated part of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Where did you go when you were evacuated?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A : A village, which is now a bigger town, called Kennington, outside of Oxford.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Kennington --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Was that just you and your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: And my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A : And my father used to come on the weekends.</span> <span id="s417">He would be working in the city.</span> <span id="s418">He was still working, he had his business.</span> <span id="s419">But terrible, terrible strains.</span> <span id="s420">Terrible strains, you know, trying to keep the family as safe as possible.</span> <span id="s421">In fact -- and I mentioned this to Ashley, but I will tell you, I guess, it was in 1940 things looked so bad in England.</span> <span id="s422">And we thought that -- the Germans had invaded everywhere -- that it looked like they might be coming into England, too.</span> <span id="s423">So my father, being the worrier that he was, said we're going -- we had an uncle in America.</span> <span id="s424">He said we're going to send the children to America.</span> <span id="s425">And we stood in line and applied for all the papers that you need for that and got everything and were scheduled to take a ship and go to -- actually, I think it was Canada, but then America.</span> <span id="s426">It left from Liverpool.</span> <span id="s427">And that ship was sunk, and, I think, 70 some odd children died on that and other people.</span> <span id="s428">But at the last minute, my father decided we're stick -- keep the family together.</span> <span id="s429">So even though we had all the papers to go, we didn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: So it would have just been your mother and you and your brother on the ship and he would have stayed in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A : Actually, I think it would have just been the children, just my brother and I.</span> <span id="s432">You know, like -- it was like the Kindertransport, but it was a little different.</span> <span id="s433">You know, it was something that they were trying to arrange to get kids out of England when it looked very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A : And I don't know about my mother at that point, but I do know that we had all the papers we needed.</span> <span id="s436">And then the discussion with the family and my father said, no, we're going to stay together.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Do you remember anything else about that, what he explained to you about first going on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A : Right.</span> <span id="s439">He said, you know, I -- that the family needs to stay together, but we'll try and stay safe.</span> <span id="s440">And we did in those days of the Blitz.</span> <span id="s441">It's an amazing thing, Heather, but the kids used to like to go down into the Underground because they'd run around with all their friends.</span> <span id="s442">You know, children are amazing, I mean, how they adapt to different things.</span> <span id="s443">And we would go into the shelters, you know, when the sirens would go off.</span> <span id="s444">And then we'd be with other kids and other friends.</span> <span id="s445">And that -- they sort of learn to adapt to the situation.</span> <span id="s446">And it was interesting because a lot of schools closed.</span> <span id="s447">But there was one school that stayed open, and it happened to be a convent, a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s448">And, of course, I was Jewish, as were a number of my friends, and the convent allowed us to come.</span> <span id="s449">And not only allowed us to come to the school, but we had asked if when they had their catechism and everything else, could we have a Jewish teacher come in and they allowed us to do it.</span> <span id="s450">So for part of the time -- and I ended up with a very -- even though I was evacuated and in Kennington in a one-room schoolhouse with my brother, who was four years older than I was, and then coming back to London and going to the convent, by the time I came to America -- we're getting ahead of ourselves -- but I started high school.</span> <span id="s451">And because of the years of education I had, they put me in as a freshman.</span> <span id="s452">But after I was there for six months, I became an upper junior because of all the subjects we'd already had, even during the wartime.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s454">And we'll talk more about that in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A : I know.</span> <span id="s456">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s458">Can you talk more about -- did you understand what was going on in London at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A : Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: What did you understand about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A : We understood that the Germans were bombing and were hoping to come into England.</span> <span id="s462">And we really felt, maybe because where we came from -- the British may not have felt this way, maybe they felt a little stronger, you know, that no one is going to come in here.</span> <span id="s463">But after seeing what had happened in Europe, there were times that we really thought that the Germans would come in and invade Britain or London.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And did you understand why they wanted to come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I understood that Hitler wanted to rule the world and get rid of the Jews, one of the things that he wanted, one of the main things that he wanted.</span> <span id="s466">And the amazing thing is that somewhere or other they said that somewhere in his background there was some Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s467">And, you know, sometimes those -- you can get Jews sometimes that are so self -- not that he was Jewish, I'm not trying to say that.</span> <span id="s468">But they can be self-hating and worse than anyone else against the Jews.</span> <span id="s469">We did understand that, as Jews, we were very vulnerable.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Well, I know there was anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s472">But when I think about my experience at the convent and the friends that I made and that -- one of the gals that was in my class actually became the mother superior, and I visited her on one of our many visits to London.</span> <span id="s473">I really had very positive feelings about, you know, how other people treated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: How did you know that there was anti-Semitism if you didn't experience it yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A : Well, I imagine -- I knew what happened.</span> <span id="s476">Well, I didn't know at that time about things like the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s477">But I knew that -- that's a good Q:uestion.</span> <span id="s478">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A : I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s482">Maybe it was -- A : But there definitely was anti-Semitism in London.</span> <span id="s483">I mean, I've read many things.</span> <span id="s484">You know, people resented the Jews coming in and taking jobs away and things like that.</span> <span id="s485">So I know that it definitely existed.</span> <span id="s486">But we happened to live in a very Jewish area.</span> <span id="s487">It's even more Jewish now than when we lived there, Stamford Hill.</span> <span id="s488">And so our friends with Jewish -- now, there was a Catholic school there, but we belonged to a synagogue and attended services and really participated in Jewish life there, again, celebrated the holidays.</span> <span id="s489">Friday nights my father would bring home people for dinner without even talking to my mother.</span> <span id="s490">So we'd always have guests at Friday night dinners.</span> <span id="s491">And things were rationed, but somehow we managed.</span> <span id="s492">In fact, I remember my parents never eating an egg because they wanted to give -- we got two eggs or something -- giving the eggs to, you know, to my brother and me.</span> <span id="s493">They figured we needed them more than they did.</span> <span id="s494">So we had, really, you know -- they were difficult times.</span> <span id="s495">And we certainly didn't have the same kind of life that we had in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s496">My mother was not working.</span> <span id="s497">But, you know, she had to clean the house and clean the floors.</span> <span id="s498">And I'd help her, you know.</span> <span id="s499">So it was a different, different life, but still --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Was your father working?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Yes, my father was working.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And as a fur merchant or -- A : Yeah, still in the fur business, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you remember anything else about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A : He had a partner, I remember, Arpud, (ph) and must have done okay because, you know, we had food as much as we could, you know, with rationing.</span> <span id="s505">We had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s506">We were always --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: So you managed to keep a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s511">Interestingly enough, and at least in London.</span> <span id="s512">And in Kennington, I have no idea because they had never seen a Jew before.</span> <span id="s513">And when we came there, they actually wanted to know if we had horns.</span> <span id="s514">And, again, my mother, ended up charming them.</span> <span id="s515">She'd invite them over and she'd bake strudel and stuff.</span> <span id="s516">And there we were billeted or lived with an Anglican minister in his house, you know, when we were evacuated, my mother, my brother, and I. And when my father came, he would stay there, too, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Was it just him or did he have a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A : No, he was single.</span> <span id="s519">His name was Reverend Williamson.</span> <span id="s520">And he particularly, I must say, liked me.</span> <span id="s521">That might sound difficult today.</span> <span id="s522">But as long as we lived in England, he would never forget my birthday.</span> <span id="s523">And he was very kind to us, too.</span> <span id="s524">So, you know, it's interesting, you know, with all the anti-Semitism going along, the people that we dealt with were very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Did you meet a lot of other people in Kennington as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A : Oh, yes, I did.</span> <span id="s527">We lived next to a girl who became one of my best friends there by the name of Marge Hoggnet.</span> <span id="s528">(ph) I've lost touch with her.</span> <span id="s529">She eventually moved to America.</span> <span id="s530">But I -- I tried to locate her.</span> <span id="s531">Not Jewish, they were farmers.</span> <span id="s532">And they had chickens and they actually had sheep.</span> <span id="s533">And I actually helped with -- I didn't really help, but I was there and they let me do some sheering of sheep.</span> <span id="s534">And so it was, again, a different -- very nice people.</span> <span id="s535">And they -- a lot of it had to do with the way that my mother behaved and, I guess, the way we behaved.</span> <span id="s536">And we -- there was only a one-room schoolhouse, you know, where all the kids went to school together.</span> <span id="s537">As I said, I went to school with my brother, but -- who was four and a half years older than I was.</span> <span id="s538">But we had a schoolhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Were you in the same class?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A : Yes, it was just one room.</span> <span id="s541">Oh, yes, just one class.</span> <span id="s542">It was just one class.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: So you went to school in Kennington and then a different school when you were in London?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A : Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: And how long were you in Kennington?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A : Well, we were there two different times.</span> <span id="s547">One was earlier, you know, when the Blitz was really bad.</span> <span id="s548">And the second time -- and I don't know the exact dates, you probably can look that up -- when the buzz bombs came over and they decided it was too dangerous to stay in London.</span> <span id="s549">The buzz bombs were the ones that you could hear, and then when they stopped they would drop and blow up whatever they landed on.</span> <span id="s550">And that was later, you know, maybe in '43.</span> <span id="s551">The first one was maybe around</span></p> <p><span id="s552">'40, '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Do you remember how long you were in Kennington each time, was it months or years?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A : It wasn't years.</span> <span id="s555">It would be several months.</span> <span id="s556">Because we would go to Oxford, and near Oxford there was actually an American Air Force base and we used to see the Yanks.</span> <span id="s557">And there was an expression that the kids there used, got any gum, chum.</span> <span id="s558">You know, just -- you know, it was something that we would say if we met an American.</span> <span id="s559">And I did meet a couple of them.</span> <span id="s560">But, you know, how old was I, 10, 11, something like that.</span> <span id="s561">We were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Do you remember anything else about the Americans on the base?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: We didn't ever go to the base.</span> <span id="s564">They were just young, nice guys.</span> <span id="s565">You know, this was -- actually, let's see, America went into the war in '41, so the first time -- I don't think they were -- the first time we were there, I don't think they were even at war yet.</span> <span id="s566">But there were some American soldiers that did come to Europe.</span> <span id="s567">And there was a base -- and I don't know exactly where it was -- but it was somewhere near Oxford.</span> <span id="s568">Oxford is a beautiful city, very historic.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: So what else do you remember about the Blitz and -- A : Well, after it was over, we would go outside and we would try to collect shrapnel.</span> <span id="s570">Now, none of the buildings where we lived, you know, were hit or blown up.</span> <span id="s571">But there was -- you know, there was a lot of damage.</span> <span id="s572">And one of the things that we did as kids is we would go out, you know, and collect shrapnel.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And did you find a lot of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: We found some.</span> <span id="s575">Found some.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: And who did you collect it with?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A : Other kids, other children that I was friendly with.</span> <span id="s578">Like, even this girl that I mentioned to you, but there was -- there were other friends, you know, that we made as youngsters, you know, from school, from the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s579">Usually it was in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Did you ever talk amongst yourselves about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: In the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s584">Yeah, we did.</span> <span id="s585">I don't think we realized how, how horrific it was in Europe, you know, as children.</span> <span id="s586">Certainly my parents did.</span> <span id="s587">And I know that they did communicate for a little while.</span> <span id="s588">There was a ghetto in Krakow where all the family was, including the grandmother.</span> <span id="s589">And they got a picture of her -- that's my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s590">And -- but as I mentioned to you, my father, you know, the stress and the strain was really tremendous on him.</span> <span id="s591">Tremendous.</span> <span id="s592">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Your grandmother was able to write to your mother, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A : In the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A : In the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s597">But, you know, then things got much worse.</span> <span id="s598">And we didn't really talk about these things like -- we always had dinner together.</span> <span id="s599">And I think my parents tried to have us have as normal a life as you possibly could.</span> <span id="s600">One of the things that was rather interesting was that, as a youngster -- and this is when I -- I don't even remember at what age -- I developed appendicitis and I didn't want to admit it.</span> <span id="s601">And, actually, it ended up rupturing.</span> <span id="s602">This was the days before penicillin.</span> <span id="s603">And my father, who is very religious -- and, as I said, we were as kosher as we could be, you know, and we were.</span> <span id="s604">You know, we kept separate dishes and -- for whatever food we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">And when I was in the hospital -- I'll never forget this -- and they didn't have much meat or anything else, and the only thing they had was bacon.</span> <span id="s606">And he said I want you to eat that because it's more important, you know, to save your life than to worry about kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: How long were you in the hospital for?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A : Good Q:uestion.</span> <span id="s609">You know, it's funny how you remember some things and don't remember others.</span> <span id="s610">But it was ruptured and I was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s611">As I said, there were no antibiotics at that time.</span> <span id="s612">And it was probably at least a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Do you remember what year that was or how old you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A : No.</span> <span id="s615">Isn't that funny?</span> <span id="s616">I don't.</span> <span id="s617">But I was little, maybe nine.</span> <span id="s618">Eight, nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Do you remember being underground during the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And how -- can you tell me more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A : Well, there were different ways that we could be underground.</span> <span id="s623">There were shelters, which were near the apartment.</span> <span id="s624">And people from the apartment would go to the shelter and stay there until there was, you know, there was a siren, and then there was an all clear siren.</span> <span id="s625">So you would go to that.</span> <span id="s626">But the ones that I remember the most is when we went into the Undergrounds, which -- have you ever been to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A : Then you know how deep they are.</span> <span id="s629">And we would go down to the Underground and actually sleep down there.</span> <span id="s630">And you're going to ask me how often did we do that, I don't know, but it was Q:uite a few times.</span> <span id="s631">And as children, we actually -- I'm not going to say had -- but we actually, you know, we went around and saw our friends and -- it's such a strange situation where you live in a difficult situation, but you kind of adjust to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: What was the environment like down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A : A lot of people, and, you know, with blankets and they would sleep down there.</span> <span id="s634">And all -- you know, families would sort of stay together.</span> <span id="s635">And it wasn't that often that we'd go into the Underground.</span> <span id="s636">But thefew times that I remember, it was not that -- it sounds like an awful experience, but it wasn't.</span> <span id="s637">I don't know how to describe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did you bring food with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s640">Yeah, we'd bring some food with us.</span> <span id="s641">Yeah, maybe sandwiches or something, whatever.</span> <span id="s642">Whatever you had because there wasn't that much available.</span> <span id="s643">Talking about food, another thing I will remember always is my father buying me a peach for two and six pence, which was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s644">That was a Q:uarter of a pound.</span> <span id="s645">And it was -- you know, it was something I just remember, because fruit -- you know, it was hard to get fruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: And that was something you took down there into the Underground with you –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: -- to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No.</span> <span id="s650">That was the time that we were actually in the West End and somebody was selling fruit and he bought it for me.</span> <span id="s651">We still did things, you know, I went with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: And, at this time, you were also still going to school, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s654">Yes.</span> <span id="s655">Yeah, I went to school all the time that we were there.</span> <span id="s656">And we had -- you know, we had to work hard and study hard.</span> <span id="s657">And we had good teachers.</span> <span id="s658">Some were nuns, some were not nuns.</span> <span id="s659">I remember a Sister Ursula who had a very good sense of humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Now, what else do you remember about the nuns?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A : Well, they were strict.</span> <span id="s662">You know, on my report cards -- which I think I still have somewhere -- it was -- I was a very good student at the time.</span> <span id="s663">I usually -- this gal who eventually became mother superior and I were always like, first, second in the class.</span> <span id="s664">And on my report card, I'd have all these nice grades.</span> <span id="s665">And then on the conduct, it would say very good conduct but she talks too much.</span> <span id="s666">So I guess I'm still doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: And your brother was not in the same class with you at this time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: No.</span> <span id="s669">No.</span> <span id="s670">No.</span> <span id="s671">This was an all girls' school.</span> <span id="s672">He was in another school and he had a lot of -- he was very social and he had a lot of friends, too.</span> <span id="s673">And I remember the friends, and, you know, they were handsome young men.</span> <span id="s674">And they used to, you know -- used to bother them and they would always sort of try to get rid of -- from all their activities, I guess.</span> <span id="s675">That's the way, you know, it is with brothers that are older.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: So outside of school, do you remember spending a lot of time with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Not that much.</span> <span id="s678">Because he -- you know, he was with his friends and I was with my friends.</span> <span id="s679">And we did spend time at home.</span> <span id="s680">And when we were in Kennington, we were in the same school.</span> <span id="s681">And he put up with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Now, what was London like after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Well, it -- 1945, you know, things slowly, slowly started getting better.</span> <span id="s684">And, of course, this is where -- by that time, I was 12 and --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Do you remember when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A : Ended?</span> <span id="s687">Yes.</span> <span id="s688">Yes.</span> <span id="s689">And there were, you know, big celebrations.</span> <span id="s690">And -- but then the thing that I remember a lot is how I felt as a Jew with the fact that Britain was not allowing, you know, Jews to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s691">We were -- oh, I was part of a youth group, and it was a Zionist youth group.</span> <span id="s692">It's called B'nai Akivah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Can you tell spell that for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: B'nai is capital B, apostrophe N-A-I, Akivah is A-K-I-V-A-H.</span> <span id="s695">Named after Rabbi Akivah.</span> <span id="s696">And we had a lot of activities.</span> <span id="s697">I even went -- after the war, I even went to a camp, you know, which was like, in the country with this group, you know, where we would do a lot of, you know, singing and dancing like, a lot -- and other activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Do you remember where in the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A : I don't.</span> <span id="s700">I don't remember where it was, but it was the country.</span> <span id="s701">And there's a lot of beautiful country not far from London.</span> <span id="s702">You know, whether it's Somerset or -- a lot of very nice places.</span> <span id="s703">And so we were very committed to, I guess, to Zionism.</span> <span id="s704">My father actually attended the last Zionist Congress, which is the 12th Zionist Congress.</span> <span id="s705">That was the last one.</span> <span id="s706">I think that was in 1920-something.</span> <span id="s707">It was after World War I. And my mother, too.</span> <span id="s708">I mean, she was in Israel.</span> <span id="s709">She went to Israel in 1948.</span> <span id="s710">She was on one of the first boats that went to Israel.</span> <span id="s711">Actually, she sat at the table with Leonard Bernstein's parents and remembered the conversation of how disappointed he was that his son didn't go into his business.</span> <span id="s712">That's Leonard Bernstein, musician, of course, I'm sure you know.</span> <span id="s713">And 1948, we saw her off to go to Israel for the first time right after it was established as a state.</span> <span id="s714">And she went many times.</span> <span id="s715">And once we were able to, my husband and I, as I told you, we've been there many times, too, and have remained very close to, not only Zvi, but we had three other first cousins that survived and ended up in Israel.</span> <span id="s716">One has passed away, two are still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So would you consider that your parents were very politically active?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A : They were great supporters in any way that they could of Jewish causes, synagogue, of Zionism, of Israel being a Jewish state.</span> <span id="s719">And so in that way, I mean, they -- my father went to the Zionist Congress, but I don't remember -- you know, there weren't anymore after that.</span> <span id="s720">So I -- you know, and I don't think he was that involved in organizations.</span> <span id="s721">He was more involved in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s722">He went to synagogue every Saturday and --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: And this was in London or --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: No, in London and then in New York.</span> <span id="s725">Unfortunately --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: -- in 1948, he went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s728">He had an aliyah and he had his last heart attack and he died.</span> <span id="s729">And he was only 52 or three.</span> <span id="s730">So he got us through all this stuff and brought us to America and he died.</span> <span id="s731">A tremendous loss.</span> <span id="s732">Then my mother carried on in the most amazing way with my brother.</span> <span id="s733">And I'm the only one that actually was able to go to college.</span> <span id="s734">I worked, but went to school and graduated.</span> <span id="s735">But my brother worked with my mother.</span> <span id="s736">They opened up a store and were successful again.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A : They did very well financially.</span> <span id="s739">I mean, I shouldn't say very well, you know, they -- you know, were able to live very good lives.</span> <span id="s740">As I said, my mother was able to travel, go to Israel, see her family.</span> <span id="s741">But, as I've said a few times, she was probably one of the most amazing people I've ever known.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Well, I do want to hear more about your brother and your mother in New York.</span> <span id="s743">But just going back to London for a minute, you said your father had a heart attack in London in 1948, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: No.</span> <span id="s745">No.</span> <span id="s746">He had a heart attack in 1939 when we came there and he was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s747">Then he did not have another heart attack.</span> <span id="s748">He suffered, though, you know, in walking.</span> <span id="s749">He had angina.</span> <span id="s750">And -- but he worked and he traveled back and forth, you know, to Kennington and did all the things.</span> <span id="s751">And helped me when I was in the -- was there for me when I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s752">And then my -- we came to America and my mother had a brother here living in New York City.</span> <span id="s753">And at first, we lived with him for a very short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: What year did you come to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Do you remember how that you received permission to travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A : No.</span> <span id="s758">But I know that they got all the papers that we needed.</span> <span id="s759">And I guess because of my uncle and my father's, you know, business connections, we were able to come.</span> <span id="s760">But not until after the -- you know, this was three years after the war ended.</span> <span id="s761">I think they actually wanted to come to America earlier, but as I had mentioned to you, they couldn't come -- oh, I didn't mention this.</span> <span id="s762">But they were Polish, both of them were Polish, and the Polish Q:uota -- there was a Q:uota system here -- and the Q:uota was closed and they couldn't come in.</span> <span id="s763">My brother and I were Czech and the Czech Q:uota was not closed.</span> <span id="s764">And that's why we were able to get all the documents that we needed to come here on that children's transport, which was sunk.</span> <span id="s765">So originally they were going to send us and then they decided -- my father particularly decided he wasn't going to split the family.</span> <span id="s766">And if they couldn't come, then we would all stay together.</span> <span id="s767">But in 1948, I guess it was opened up.</span> <span id="s768">You know, this was after the war.</span> <span id="s769">They were still on their Czech -- I mean, Polish passports, but they were able to come at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And do you remember -- A : After, after America saw what Hitler had done, I guess they became a little more lenient.</span> <span id="s771">I mean, that was a difficult time.</span> <span id="s772">I'm sure you've read the story of the Ship of Fools, you know, where all these -- no one would allow the ships to come in and the sent them back to Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Do you remember taking the ship across the ocean?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s775">It was called the SS Degrasse.</span> <span id="s776">It was a French ship.</span> <span id="s777">And it was -- you know, it's sort of like a cruise.</span> <span id="s778">It was very, very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: And can you spell that for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: SS is just S-S.</span> <span id="s781">And de is D-E and grasse is G-R-A-S-S-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s783">What else do you remember about being on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: It was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s785">We, you know, were able to play games and we had lovely food and entertainment.</span> <span id="s786">I mean, it was a nice ship.</span> <span id="s787">You know, I mean, it wasn't as nice, probably as -- you know, the liners today.</span> <span id="s788">But after someone who had lived in England and been through the war, it was lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: How long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A : I think it must have taken well over a week, maybe ten days.</span> <span id="s791">I don't know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: And was it calm weather or -- A : Yes.</span> <span id="s793">Yeah, we didn't have any -- I don't remember any problems with getting ill or seasickness or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: And do you remember your first impression on arriving?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A : Oh, it was very exciting to see the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s796">And, yes, it was amazing.</span> <span id="s797">It was just amazing.</span> <span id="s798">And my uncle and aunt were there waiting for us.</span> <span id="s799">And it was in Manhattan, they lived on 52nd Street and 8th Avenue in a lovely apartment.</span> <span id="s800">And they had no children and there --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: This was your father's brother, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: No, my mother's –</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A : -- brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A : My father was an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A : I don't know if I mentioned that.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Yes, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A : No one else.</span> <span id="s811">But my mother was one of six children.</span> <span id="s812">The oldest was killed in a concentration camp and the youngest was killed with his wife and his baby son.</span> <span id="s813">But her other sister went through Auschwitz and survived, and the brother also survived and they ended up in Israel.</span> <span id="s814">And they're the ones who had my cousins.</span> <span id="s815">And that's one of the reasons she traveled there as often as she did and the reason that we travel there as often as we do.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s817">Do you remember arriving at the apartment, your, your uncle's apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A : Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A : It was beautiful.</span> <span id="s821">We took an elevator.</span> <span id="s822">It was a very nice building.</span> <span id="s823">It's still there.</span> <span id="s824">I mean, they're gone, of course.</span> <span id="s825">But, you know, it was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s826">And my uncle was a very warm, lovely, wonderful man.</span> <span id="s827">His wife was very nice.</span> <span id="s828">She was actually Italian, Italian Jewish, and he was from Poland.</span> <span id="s829">You know, he was sort of the renegade in the family.</span> <span id="s830">He ran off in the 20's or something, you know, to come to America.</span> <span id="s831">And family was very religious, my grandfather in Poland was a Talmudic scholar.</span> <span id="s832">This was the wife that worked, they had a restaurant, and so it was a religious family.</span> <span id="s833">And Uncle Henry --</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: What was his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A : My uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: grandparents name, it was my mother's maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: And what about your aunt, what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: The one here in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A : Her name was Lena.</span> <span id="s842">Her maiden name was Ronga.</span> <span id="s843">R-O-N-G-A.</span> <span id="s844">But, of course, after she was married it was Ehrlich.</span> <span id="s845">And, as I said, they were a wonderful couple, no children.</span> <span id="s846">And so they really were very, very good to my brother and to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: What do you remember about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Well, Uncle Henry had a variety store.</span> <span id="s849">And that's actually what my mother finally went into after my father died.</span> <span id="s850">In those days, it was called the Victory Five and Ten.</span> <span id="s851">And the store was on 9th Avenue and 55th Street.</span> <span id="s852">And it was sort of like the old Woolworth's, not as big, but it sold everything, you know, from toys to pots to dishes to cleaning supplies.</span> <span id="s853">It's a five and ten, like a variety store.</span> <span id="s854">In those days, you know, in the 40's and early 50's, that was before all the, you know, Wal-Marts and K-Marts and all those discount stores.</span> <span id="s855">And they did very well.</span> <span id="s856">In fact, Uncle Henry had the store across from the NBC studio on 9th Avenue.</span> <span id="s857">And Harry Truman did his series there.</span> <span id="s858">And they came to my uncle's store to purchase stuff for -- this was an interview series with Harry S. Truman had he was president.</span> <span id="s859">And my uncle went over, met Harry Truman, took pictures with Harry Truman, gave pictures to all the family.</span> <span id="s860">And he was like my mom, very outgoing, very gregarious and a very warm human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: What were some of the things you did together as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A : Oh, he would take us -- oh, my gosh.</span> <span id="s863">The first -- as soon as we came here, I think we drove to -- was it -- where did we drive?</span> <span id="s864">Was it Philadelphia or to Washington?</span> <span id="s865">You know, he wanted to show us everything.</span> <span id="s866">And, you know, he wanted -- he loved America.</span> <span id="s867">He was a tremendous patriot.</span> <span id="s868">And he always said, you know, when he goes abroad -- and he was one that had come to visit us in London when we were living there.</span> <span id="s869">He said when I come back to America, I kiss the ground.</span> <span id="s870">He was a tremendous patriot.</span> <span id="s871">Tremendous patriot.</span> <span id="s872">So he tried to show us all the good things of America and took us to the country.</span> <span id="s873">In fact, they built or bought a cottage, a nice cottage up in the mountains, where was the mountain?</span> <span id="s874">I've forgotten.</span> <span id="s875">Not -- no, they called it rump -- it was in the Catskills they called Ramat Gan after Israel.</span> <span id="s876">And we'd all go up there.</span> <span id="s877">Not only did we go up there, but he'd invite my husband's sister and my husband's parents.</span> <span id="s878">And we'd go up there and friends and we would have picnics and barbecues.</span> <span id="s879">And all the cousins got to play together, you know, my children, and my brother's children, and my sister-in-law's children who all got to know each other up at Ramat Gan at my Uncle Henry's place.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Can you spell Ramat Gan?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Well, I'm sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: Can you spell Ramat Gan.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A : Oh, Ramat Gan.</span> <span id="s884">Okay.</span> <span id="s885">It's a place in Israel, actually, and he named his little property there after it.</span> <span id="s886">It's R-A-M-A-T, and then separate word, Gan, G-A-N.</span> <span id="s887">And it is a suburb of Tel Aviv, actually, now Ramat Gan.</span> <span id="s888">It's a big suburb.</span> <span id="s889">It's a diamond center in Tel Aviv, but he named it after.</span> <span id="s890">They were all very strong Israel supporters.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: What was life like for your family and how did you -- how did they earn a living?</span> <span id="s892">Did they help your uncle with the store?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A : No.</span> <span id="s894">What happened was that my father -- they decided to open another Victory Five and Ten in Astoria where we finally moved.</span> <span id="s895">Astoria is in New York.</span> <span id="s896">It's in Q:ueens in the suburb of -- you know, in Q:ueens.</span> <span id="s897">Are you familiar –</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A : You're familiar with New York, of course.</span> <span id="s900">And so my mother, and, originally it was supposed to be my father, were going to open another Victory Five and Ten.</span> <span id="s901">Of course, my uncle had all the connections and all the -- you know, probably helped with some of the financing and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s902">And then my father died very suddenly of a heart attack.</span> <span id="s903">As I told you, he went to the synagogue on a Saturday and had an aliyah and actually died on the bimah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A : This was in 1948, right after we came to America after he had gone through everything to bring us here.</span> <span id="s906">So I told you -- I didn't tell you -- I mean, this goes back, really, to Czechoslovakia and to England.</span> <span id="s907">I was extremely close to my father.</span> <span id="s908">He would read me stories and tell me stories.</span> <span id="s909">And I had a very, very close relationship to my father.</span> <span id="s910">And when he died, I wanted to jump into the grave with him.</span> <span id="s911">I was so devastated.</span> <span id="s912">I was 15 years old.</span> <span id="s913">But, you know, it was, it was just such a terrible shock.</span> <span id="s914">One of the main reasons was that I had always gone to synagogue with him.</span> <span id="s915">And that Saturday I had not gone.</span> <span id="s916">Not that it would have made a difference, but it was devastating.</span> <span id="s917">And, meanwhile, my uncle helped my mother and then my brother, who was only -- in 1948 he was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s918">He had gone to university in London, actually.</span> <span id="s919">He had gone to the University of London and had studied business and some other things.</span> <span id="s920">But then when we came to America, he would have gone to university.</span> <span id="s921">But after my father died, he helped my mother run and establish the store, plus they had Q:uite a bit -- they had other help.</span> <span id="s922">And I used to go in and help, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: This was the second store, correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A : The second store.</span> <span id="s925">And then after a while, after a while, my brother opened a third store.</span> <span id="s926">So it wasn't Q:uite a chain, but there was three stores, and this one was in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s927">So there was one in Manhattan, one in Q:ueens, and one in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s928">And they were all the Victory Five and Ten.</span> <span id="s929">And they were, again, you know, not terribly -- you know, when I say successful, they made a good living.</span> <span id="s930">That's how -- you know, they -- definitely what, in today's political scene, would be called, you know, the middle class.</span> <span id="s931">So -- and, you know, they were able to enjoy all the things, you know, whether it's the theater or whether it's the -- you know, dinner or traveling.</span> <span id="s932">It was not easy.</span> <span id="s933">My brother really gave up going to school.</span> <span id="s934">And I ended up being the only one that went to college.</span> <span id="s935">But I would work, also, in the store, as well as other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: How did your life change after your father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A : Well, it was -- we all became a lot closer to each other and realized how important family is, which I do to this day.</span> <span id="s938">And my husband and I have made sure that we take -- or try to be with our children and grandchildren and go places with them.</span> <span id="s939">And family, you know, became very, very important to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: That we realized that, you know, money comes and goes, possessions come and go, but the people that you love and are close to are the things that are the most important in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A : And we've tried, you know, to -- as best as we can, you know, to instill that in our family.</span> <span id="s944">As I said -- well, after -- well, this is a lot later after I got married and we settled out here, we would do trips and national parks, you know, and driving trips and a lot of things with family.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: What year did you start college?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I started college in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s948">And how old were you then, 17?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A : Right.</span> <span id="s950">Yeah.</span> <span id="s951">Because the -- yeah, I – and then I graduated in 1954.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: And how did you decide to go to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Well, that was another thing that really was -- well, I always loved learning and going to school.</span> <span id="s954">And as I had mentioned before, I had been a good student, even in London, even though it was sporadic, you know, here and there.</span> <span id="s955">But I loved to read and I loved -- liked to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Did you finish any high school in New York before you started college?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s958">I finished what is called theBlackboard Jungle, Long Island City High School.</span> <span id="s959">I think that's where they actually filmed that movie, the Blackboard Jungle.</span> <span id="s960">It was a tough school.</span> <span id="s961">But, again, I tried to tell my grandkids this, you know, it's important the friends that you make.</span> <span id="s962">And people made a lot of fun of me because I spoke with an English accent.</span> <span id="s963">People often say to me, oh, you grew up in London, how come you don't have an English accent?</span> <span id="s964">I said, well, Long Island City High School took care of that because they would taunt me.</span> <span id="s965">And so, you know, I spoke</span></p> <p><span id="s966">American.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And what did you study in college?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Business and retailing and business.</span> <span id="s969">You know, that was my family's field.</span> <span id="s970">You know, my mother had a store, and so I studied at the BaroQ:ue School on 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue.</span> <span id="s971">It was the College in the Sky, you know, it was not a campus, it was a tall building.</span> <span id="s972">And that's what I studied there.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Were there options for different fields at the time and business was the path that you were interested in?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A : Yeah.</span> <span id="s975">They had -- well, BaroQ:ue was a school that specialized in business.</span> <span id="s976">But you could also do, you know, prelaw, accounting.</span> <span id="s977">It was primarily -- there was also a city -- as part of City College, and City College had an uptown branch, which, you know, had all the sciences and humanities.</span> <span id="s978">I mean, we took those courses, you know, psychology and English and, you know, all the same kind of courses.</span> <span id="s979">But the primary, you know, major was retailing and business administration.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: And what was college like?</span> <span id="s981">Were you still living at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s983">Yes.</span> <span id="s984">I'd commute from -- I'd take the subway and commute from Astoria, which was at the end of the line, Ditmars Station, and I'd have to change and get down to 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue.</span> <span id="s985">But, you know, New York is -- with subways, you can get around.</span> <span id="s986">And that's what I did.</span> <span id="s987">And we -- you know, it was a good school.</span> <span id="s988">I joined a number of organizations.</span> <span id="s989">I was part of Boosters, which was the service organization.</span> <span id="s990">And, you know, we'd do different functions.</span> <span id="s991">I was also part -- I couldn't afford sororities, so we had a house plan.</span> <span id="s992">And I was in Riner 54.</span> <span id="s993">And that was very fortunate, because at one of the house plan parties that we had, I met my husband.</span> <span id="s994">So -- and we've been married now for 58 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Well, we'll hear more about him in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s997">I do, I do have a tendency to jump around.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s999">What, what classes did you take?</span> <span id="s1000">Do you remember specifically any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A : Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: And what was -- A : Well, I took statistics, I took business administration.</span> <span id="s1003">I did take -- I did take psychology, I took marketing, I took English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: What were your plans when you finished school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A : I thought I'd try and get into an executive training program and work for, you know, a large corporation, a company.</span> <span id="s1006">And I did work for a while at Saks Fifth Avenue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Did you like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A : Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: What -- how long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A : That was just a part of while I was in school, so it was like, a year.</span> <span id="s1011">You know, it's -- like a trainee or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Did you do that for the experience or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A : Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: -- did you need the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A : The work experience, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1017">Were you paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s1019">Not very much.</span> <span id="s1020">Not very much.</span> <span id="s1021">In fact, my first job out of college, I hate to even tell you what I was paid.</span> <span id="s1022">You'll maybe ask later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: What was your first job after college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A : My first job out of college was working for a department store called Gertz, which was on the Island.</span> <span id="s1025">You know, it was easier because I lived there and, you know, I applied and I was hired.</span> <span id="s1026">And, again, they had like, an executive training program.</span> <span id="s1027">And then I became an assistant buyer in the children's department.</span> <span id="s1028">And I worked there, actually, until we left New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: What -- what responsibilities did you have as an assistant buyer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A : Well, I would go into the market and, you know, I would work on the floor, help train the salespeople.</span> <span id="s1031">Help with the -- you know, pricing and displays and the things that are involved with retailing, which is also going down to the drain as people buy everything on the internet.</span> <span id="s1032">But, you know, in those days that was that was the way to shop.</span> <span id="s1033">And I really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s1034">And I liked working with people, both the people that were the salespeople and the customers.</span> <span id="s1035">You'd also wait on customers.</span> <span id="s1036">You know, you were on the floor.</span> <span id="s1037">So even though you were an assistant buyer and you'd go into market, as you know, New York has a big clothing market.</span> <span id="s1038">And it was exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: And how long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A : Okay.</span> <span id="s1041">I graduated in 1954.</span> <span id="s1042">And not very long, because we -- I got married in 1954 right after I graduated.</span> <span id="s1043">And I, you know, continued working, because my husband was a student.</span> <span id="s1044">And then when he finished his training, we moved to California.</span> <span id="s1045">And that was in 1956, so it was really just a couple of years that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1047">And what was your salary there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A : I think I was getting $55 a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: How about your salary at Saks Fifth Avenue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A : Oh, I think that was less.</span> <span id="s1051">That was less.</span> <span id="s1052">I don't even remember that.</span> <span id="s1053">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A : In fact, you know, as I think about it, Ican't even remember -- maybe I did not get a salary.</span> <span id="s1056">Maybe it was just a training thing.</span> <span id="s1057">I, I thought -- you know, I don't remember exactly about that.</span> <span id="s1058">But I know that my husband and I lived on that.</span> <span id="s1059">And it was pretty interesting, because, you know, you had a hamburger, you know -- at that point we didn't take money from anybody, we just managed on what I made.</span> <span id="s1060">It was a different time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Did you move in together once you got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s1063">But not before, which is also a different time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: Did you have an apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A : Yeah.</span> <span id="s1066">We subleased an apartment from someone else and lived in Rego Park, which is also in Q:ueens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: What was your husband studying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: And why did you move to California?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A : Okay.</span> <span id="s1071">That's -- are you sure you want to ask that Q:uestion?</span> <span id="s1072">My husband was what they called draft bait.</span> <span id="s1073">And so when he applied after his internship -- which was very tough in those days.</span> <span id="s1074">And it was a good thing I was working because if not, I don't know if this marriage would have lasted.</span> <span id="s1075">But it was -- I'm just making that comment.</span> <span id="s1076">But he was working 36 hours on, 36 hours off, and, you know, just exhausted from his internship.</span> <span id="s1077">And a very good internship at Mount Sinai, New York.</span> <span id="s1078">But when he finished the internship and he went looking for residencies, they said, sorry, but, you know -- at that point there was a doctors' draft – so we can't take you, you know, because you may be drafted out of the program.</span> <span id="s1079">And then he applied to something called the Barry Plan.</span> <span id="s1080">And that allowed you to take training and delay, but you signed up to go into the service after that.</span> <span id="s1081">You still committed to going to the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">So then he went back to all the same places.</span> <span id="s1083">He had very good training.</span> <span id="s1084">And they said, oh, we'd love to take you, but everything is filled.</span> <span id="s1085">And it turned out, unfortunately, for someone, that someone in California developed, as it was, testicular cancer and had to drop out of the program.</span> <span id="s1086">And the program had an opening in Long Beach and that's how we ended up in Long Beach.</span> <span id="s1087">We did go back later after the service to New York to finish training.</span> <span id="s1088">But once you lived in California in those days, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1089">And so -- you know, after everything, we ended up back in California.</span> <span id="s1090">And it also ended up that we brought our parents, both his parents and my mother out here.</span> <span id="s1091">And they lived here for a good 20 to 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: I was going to ask you about that, how it felt leaving your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A : I hated leaving my mother and my brother.</span> <span id="s1094">I really was not a happy camper at all.</span> <span id="s1095">But I love my husband.</span> <span id="s1096">And that's where he went, so I went with him.</span> <span id="s1097">You know, Ruth, whither thou goest, I will go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1099">After -- afterwards you brought your -- both sets of parents with you to California?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A : Right.</span> <span id="s1101">Right.</span> <span id="s1102">And they lived in Riverside.</span> <span id="s1103">And it was a very good time for them.</span> <span id="s1104">Just my mother, of course.</span> <span id="s1105">My brother visited, my sister-in-law, and we're very, very close.</span> <span id="s1106">We had a double wedding with Arnie's sister.</span> <span id="s1107">In fact, that's why I'm having the interview today because this week we're going to my brother-in-law's 80th birthday.</span> <span id="s1108">They live in Florida.</span> <span id="s1109">And we've celebrated our major anniversaries together.</span> <span id="s1110">We had all of our families, all of our kids and grandkids altogether for our 50th anniversary.</span> <span id="s1111">Very, very close family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: So your family now is in mainly California and Florida, but not New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A : Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A : I have two nephews.</span> <span id="s1116">My brother's sons still live in New York, but that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: What did you do when you arrived in California?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A : Well, I actually worked for a while.</span> <span id="s1119">Not in retailing, but I worked in a school that teaches business.</span> <span id="s1120">It was a private school.</span> <span id="s1121">And then I went back to school when my kids were in school and I got a master's and then I went back to teaching college.</span> <span id="s1122">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A : -- my husband ended up, you know, practicing here.</span> <span id="s1125">He's retired, but still teaching as a volunteer giving back to the community because he loved what he did.</span> <span id="s1126">And even though he's over 80, he still goes in and teaches residents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: And is your husband Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A : Yes, very Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Where was he born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: In the Bronx.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1132">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: We're both very committed to Judaism.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: And how many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: That's another difficult Q:uestion.</span> <span id="s1136">I had three children.</span> <span id="s1137">Unfortunately, I lost a son to a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1138">My kids all went into medicine.</span> <span id="s1139">He was a doctor but he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: -- had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1142">In other words, a bad, bad family history.</span> <span id="s1143">I have now two children, a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s1144">They both live in California and they're both practicing physicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: And how many children do they have?</span> <span id="s1146">I know you said you're a grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A Right.</span> <span id="s1148">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1149">My daughter and her husband have twins, a boy and a girl.</span> <span id="s1150">The loves of our lives.</span> <span id="s1151">And my son has four sons, the other four loves of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: And are they both close to you physically?</span> <span id="s1153">Are they near you in California?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A : Physically, not as close as I would like.</span> <span id="s1155">But my daughter and her husband live up in Santa Cruz, California, so it's an hour's flight.</span> <span id="s1156">My son lives in the San Fernando Valley, which is about an hour and 20 minute drive.</span> <span id="s1157">But we still get together Q:uite a bit.</span> <span id="s1158">In fact, we were just with my son and daughter-in-law down in San Diego with the children this past weekend.</span> <span id="s1159">That's why we haven't been around, you know, I had to give you this date.</span> <span id="s1160">And then the next day we were with my son, daughter-in-law, and one of their children, because three of their kids are now in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1162">Why did you return to school to get your master's and what was it in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A My master's was in -- also in business administration and marketing.</span> <span id="s1164">I went back because I thought I would like to teach.</span> <span id="s1165">I liked working.</span> <span id="s1166">I did a lot of volunteer work with students on different projects when my kids were in school.</span> <span id="s1167">I was pretty involved, and I decided that I would like to teach.</span> <span id="s1168">So in order to teach, you know, business in a college, you needed, you know, a further degree, which is what I did.</span> <span id="s1169">I took it at Cal State San Bernardino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: And did you start teaching after you graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A : Yes.</span> <span id="s1172">I never taught on a full-time basis, I really only taught part time.</span> <span id="s1173">I taught at a community college, and, really, it was a very good experience.</span> <span id="s1174">And some of my students have done very well.</span> <span id="s1175">And then after that, I taught at, again, state university, actually, where I got my master's.</span> <span id="s1176">Because I knew the people there and so then they hired me there, too, and I taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: How many years did you teach for altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A : How many years did I teach?</span> <span id="s1179">Probably 15.</span> <span id="s1180">I stopped teaching when my mother became Q:uite ill and I decided I wanted to take -- help her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1182">Is your mother still in California or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: No, my mother died.</span> <span id="s1184">She died in 1993.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A : No, she would be -- she was born in 1904, so she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1189">But she did live to be 89 and worked in our synagogue, ran the gift shop, was very popular, was very involved in the community and was very happy here, as were my in-laws.</span> <span id="s1190">Very involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1192">Is there anything else you can tell me about California that we haven't touched upon or that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A : Well, we live in a very -- you know, it's a nice community.</span> <span id="s1194">It has its problems, smog and probably a lot of other things because we're ringed by mountains.</span> <span id="s1195">But a very close community, especially through the synagogue, which is where we have a lot of our friends.</span> <span id="s1196">And I'm involved in something called Osher and something called LIFE, which is Learning is Forever, which is through the University of California in Riverside which is for seniors.</span> <span id="s1197">And we have lectures and programs and different things.</span> <span id="s1198">So, you know, it's very nice being in a university town.</span> <span id="s1199">As I told you, I enjoy learning.</span> <span id="s1200">And so, I think -- as I used to tell my students, learning is not for making a living, it is for living and you should learn as long as you can.</span> <span id="s1201">And so I enjoy that.</span> <span id="s1202">I also volunteer with an organization called HiCap, which is health insurance counseling.</span> <span id="s1203">Because I helped my mother when she was ill.</span> <span id="s1204">And seniors -- because I'm a senior, too -- but a lot of seniors have a tough time navigating the healthcare system, and probably is going to get worse, you know.</span> <span id="s1205">So that's something that I volunteer with.</span> <span id="s1206">And then I do stuff through the synagogue, you know, on education.</span> <span id="s1207">And my husband, as I told you is still teaching.</span> <span id="s1208">And we -- and whenever we have an opportunity to be with our kids and grandkids, we do that.</span> <span id="s1209">When my daughter was working and her husband was working, she sent her twins down for a summer and they spent the summer here.</span> <span id="s1210">And I'd take them, you know, for swimming lessons.</span> <span id="s1211">But that was a number of years ago.</span> <span id="s1212">They now just started high school.</span> <span id="s1213">And we just figured we had better enjoy, enjoy the family when they still have time for us.</span> <span id="s1214">Because, as I'm sure you know, Heather -- I don't know, you're an intern.</span> <span id="s1215">Are you in school or out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Actually, no, I'm a permanent staff member.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1218">Okay.</span> <span id="s1219">So -- but, you know, as you get more involved, whether it's with education or with jobs, you know, you don't have as much time for grandparents and families.</span> <span id="s1220">So whenever we have a chance -- we're actually heading to Israel in October for the 100th anniversary for Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1221">All of us are -- my mother and my daughter and my daughter-in-law, my granddaughter and I are all life members.</span> <span id="s1222">And right after that, it turns out that it's grandparents day at my twins' high school and they just started high school.</span> <span id="s1223">And so we're going right from Israel up to Santa Cruz so we can be there for that.</span> <span id="s1224">And we're also going up for Sukkot -- unfortunately, it's not as easy to get together for holidays.</span> <span id="s1225">All our children belong to synagogues, which makes me very happy that they're involved.</span> <span id="s1226">And what will happen with the next generation, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1227">But we took everyone to Israel a couple of years ago.</span> <span id="s1228">Actually, it was five years ago in 2007.</span> <span id="s1229">There were 14 of us that went.</span> <span id="s1230">So we feel it's very important, you know, for our family to know, know Israel and to know the history of the Jews and to be proud of who they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: Have you also been back to Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A : Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Or Czech Republic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A : Yes, we have.</span> <span id="s1235">We've been back there a couple of times.</span> <span id="s1236">Not gone back to Moravska Ostrave because I probably would not even remember where to go.</span> <span id="s1237">And also I've heard that the city is not a terrific place to visit now.</span> <span id="s1238">But I -- I don't know, we may still try to go back, but I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1239">But we've been to Prague and we've been to other parts.</span> <span id="s1240">And Prague is a beautiful, beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1241">And, of course, you may know that Hitler had maintained a lot of the places there, supposedly as a museum to an extinct people.</span> <span id="s1242">So the Altneuschul, which is the oldest synagogue, and we went there for services -- is been in -- it has been in practice since 1200.</span> <span id="s1243">Of course not during the Holocaust, but it's still there.</span> <span id="s1244">A wonderful museum.</span> <span id="s1245">Have you ever been to Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: I have not, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A : Well, it's an absolutely, beautiful, beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1248">And a lot of Americans have gone there to work, young people, too.</span> <span id="s1249">So we have -- I have -- both my husband and I have been back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: I know you said you've also been back to London a lot, does that include Kennington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A : Yes, we did go back to Kennington and it really has changed.</span> <span id="s1252">I did find the house that we lived in and -- but it's become much more metropolitan.</span> <span id="s1253">You know, more of a little town or city compared to the country village that I remember.</span> <span id="s1254">It was really a real village.</span> <span id="s1255">You know, the people next door to us, you know, had sheep and chickens and Marge, their daughter, was my best friend.</span> <span id="s1256">And, you know, we used to play together all the time.</span> <span id="s1257">So I'm sorry that I lost contact with her.</span> <span id="s1258">One thing I try to do, I still have that -- you know, several friends that I went to school with at the convent that have visited me here and that I visited in London.</span> <span id="s1259">So we -- you know, we've kept -- we're still in touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1261">Is there anything else that you want to touch on about anything that we've covered that you think is really important that you want to add that I haven't asked you about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: No.</span> <span id="s1263">I think, not only have you asked me things, that I probably, you know, said more about things than you wanted to know.</span> <span id="s1264">Actually, there was one little thing that I did mention to Ashley before, and that is a story of another cousin of my mother's who left Vienna and tried to go to Switzerland after Germany had already invaded.</span> <span id="s1265">And when she got to the border with Switzerland, she needed to go to the bathroom her name was Celia Summerville -- well, no, it was Celia Mohrer.</span> <span id="s1266">She later married and her name became Celia Summerville and she was an artist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Can you spell her name for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Celia, C-E-L-I-A, and Mohrer was what she was at the time that she left Vienna.</span> <span id="s1269">She was a very young woman.</span> <span id="s1270">M-O-H-R-E-R.</span> <span id="s1271">And her parents were actually in London.</span> <span id="s1272">And my mother helped -- they were older and my mother helped take care of them because they were like an aunt and uncle of hers.</span> <span id="s1273">But when Celia left Vienna at the border, she needed to go to the bathroom and she got off the train.</span> <span id="s1274">And the Nazis got on the train and cleared off all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1275">And then she got back on the train and went into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1276">And from there she came to live with us for a while in London, then she moved into her own place.</span> <span id="s1277">But she then moved to America and married a Summerville and they lived right near Harvard on Cambridge Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s1278">And they had only one son, and he's -- he's a Ph.D in epidemiology.</span> <span id="s1279">And she -- he was working in New Mexico, she moved there, we went to visit her, and then, you know, she passed away and he moved up to Alaska.</span> <span id="s1280">And this summer, he called me and said he was getting married, and could we come up to this little town of Palmer outside of Alaska so we went up there.</span> <span id="s1281">So just wanted to mention that to show you how family is so important, that my husband and I dropped everything that we had planned and decided to go back up there and we did.</span> <span id="s1282">And we went to the wedding and it was -- he was thrilled and his new wife was thrilled.</span> <span id="s1283">And we're very happy for him because now he has a whole family rather than being all alone.</span> <span id="s1284">And one other thing I do want to mention, you know, I told you about our really tremendous loss.</span> <span id="s1285">It was with me all the time, my oldest son.</span> <span id="s1286">His son just got out of the IDF in Israel.</span> <span id="s1287">He was in the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s1288">And that's another reason we're going to Israel in October.</span> <span id="s1289">Not only for the Hadassah's 100th anniversary, but also to see him and the rest of the family.</span> <span id="s1290">So that's something you didn't ask about maybe you wanted to know, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: No, we like details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A : But I just thought, you know, this -- the story of -- she was called Cilly, Celia.</span> <span id="s1293">It sounds -- C-I-L-L-Y.</span> <span id="s1294">And she was wonderful young lady and I got to know her very well in London.</span> <span id="s1295">We have some of her paintings, which were exhibited at the Fogg Museum in Harvard.</span> <span id="s1296">And, so, you know, it's just important to stay close to family.</span> <span id="s1297">I hope you have a good family and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A : -- realize how important they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: So she was in the bathroom when the Nazis cleared the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A : Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Did she realize what was going on and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: No.</span> <span id="s1304">She got back on the train and didn't realize until she realized that all the people that were traveling with her or near her were gone.</span> <span id="s1305">You know, and then from Switzerland she came to England and she stayed with us for a little while.</span> <span id="s1306">And then she, you know, moved into her own apartment, and, you know, did different things, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Did she know what happened to the Jews that were taken off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A : No.</span> <span id="s1309">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A : No.</span> <span id="s1312">I don't think there'd be any way, you know, of knowing.</span> <span id="s1313">But -- and I can't even really tell you what exactly what year it was, because we were already in London when she came.</span> <span id="s1314">And she came through Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1315">But, you know, this was another one of these stories, sort of like the one about the ship we were supposed to be on that -- you know, it's just by chance that we're here.</span> <span id="s1316">And that's why it's so important to do the best that you can with your life as long as you can.</span> <span id="s1317">Which sometimes isn't as long as you want, but, you try.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1319">Okay.</span> <span id="s1320">I'm going to stop the recording now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1322">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Um, hold on one minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
