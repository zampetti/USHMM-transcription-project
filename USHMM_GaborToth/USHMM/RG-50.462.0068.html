good enough to tell us a little about your earliest memories of your childhood, and name of the town where you were born, and your date of birth and a little about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">SS: Yes, I was born in a town called Skuodas, S-K-U-O-D-A-S, Lithuania.</span> <span id="s7">That is near the Latvian border.</span> <span id="s8">It was Lithuania but on the Latvian border.</span> <span id="s9">The reason, I lived, we lived actually in a town called Schweksna, S-C-H-W-E-K-S-N-A, but since the town burned down, my mother went in her home town where she came from and gave birth to me.</span> <span id="s10">I was youngest in the family.</span> <span id="s11">I had two sisters that were older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">NL: And what was your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">SS: My date of birth is March 27th, 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">NL: And the names of your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">SS: Dora, or Dvorah, and

name?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">SS: And my father’s name was Shaya, Shaya Herzl, and the last name was Oscherowitz O-S-C-H-E-R-O-W-I-T-Z.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">NL: And your father’s work?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">SS: Well, my grandfather, which I am named after, he was a merchant.</span> <span id="s22">He used to buy flax and the seed of the flax, and export this to England and Germany and to Russia, but when my grandfather passed away, my father took over the business and he did the same thing until, of course, till the, the Russians came in in 1940, and then he worked for the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">NL: Yes, we’ll get to that.</span> <span id="s24">Now...</span></p> <p><span id="s25">SS: My father had--we were altogether in our family about 76 or 77 members.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">NL: Cousins and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">SS: Cousins, and my father had two brothers, one of them was a rabbi in Vilna, Rabbi, Rav Oscherowitz, and one was also a merchant.</span> <span id="s28">And then he had one sister, she had a drug store, which is apothecary, and the other ones were housewives.</span> <span id="s29">One had a shoestore.</span> <span id="s30">There were about four sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">NL: So your family was middle-class.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NL: You were fairly prosperous.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">SS: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NL: And you enjoyed a good standard of living?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">SS: Yes, fairly, because my grandfather used to hold the money for the whole town [unclear] the synagogue of the city, of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">NL: What were your relations with your playmates when you were a youngster?</span> <span id="s38">Did you have any non-Jewish playmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">SS: Yes, I had.</span> <span id="s40">I had one, one that was very close.</span> <span id="s41">In fact, he is the one that survived.</span> <span id="s42">In fact, he was in the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">SS: He was the one--I played with him because they also had an apothecary, and they were very close to me, and we went to school together, but mostly there were Jewish children and we went to school together and cheder and...</span></p> <p><span id="s45">NL: You went to cheder first?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s47">I went to cheder.</span> <span id="s48">I started going to cheder at the age of almost five, and I went to shul every day.</span> <span id="s49">There was a very religious man by the name of Nosen [phonetic].</span> <span id="s50">He was, he didn’t have no children and they kind of adopted me, and I stayed there more than anywhere else, and I went to cheder till from the morning till the night.</span> <span id="s51">Late at night we used to come home with the Laterne, lantern.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s53">So it was an Orthodox Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SS: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NL: Strictly religious community?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">SS: Very strictly, strictly Orthodox, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">NL: And about how many Jews were in the town?</span> <span id="s58">Do you have any...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">SS: I would say about, close to, well, families was about 120.</span> <span id="s60">There could have been about 350, 400 Jews in the shtetl.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NL: But a small percentage of the whole population?</span> <span id="s62">Or, was it largely a Jewish...?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">SS: It was, in our town there was, I would say, maybe 35% Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">NL: So it was a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">SS: A small town, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: Now, when did you go, when did you start public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">SS: Public school I started at the age of six, and that was a Jewish school, public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">SS: And then you went till about twelve o’clock or one o’clock and then you went to cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s71">And this is what most of the Jewish children did?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">SS: Most of the Jewish children did, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">NL: So you learned Lithuanian, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">SS: Yes, we learned Lithuanian and then we learned, when the Russian came in, we learned Russian.</span> <span id="s75">That was a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s77">Now what can you say about the relations between your parents, let’s say, and other Jewish adults and the non-Jews in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">SS: Well, in the non-Jews, there was a very good relationship, although there was a lot of antisemitism in Lithuania, but we had a President and a Parliament, and we were not persecuted per se, like pogroms or anything like that, but there were incidents, because they always said “dirty Jew”, and when they get mad, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">NL: When you speak about the President...</span></p> <p><span id="s80">SS: He was not bad to the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">SS: His name was Smetona, and I think that he died in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s84">But there was social and, I guess, political discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">SS: Yes, there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">NL: Quotas and...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">SS: Yes, there was always discrimination but not--we did not feel it as bad as...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">NL: In Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">SS: In Poland, perhaps, or any other areas.</span> <span id="s90">This was, of course, 1918, or since after the war when Lithuania became independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NL: Independent, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">SS: Because before, they belonged to the Czar.</span> <span id="s93">In fact my father was an officer in the Czar’s army.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">NL: Now, you went to public school, then, until you were about nine, I guess, eight or nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">SS: Yes, at the age of--well, actually, afterwards, after I finished, I went to a non-Jewish school and then I went to cheder afterwards, because you only had in the Jewish schools, only so much.</span> <span id="s96">You could only go up to a second grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">NL: I understand.</span> <span id="s98">Now, when the Germans marched into Poland in 1939...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">SS: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">NL: Was your family at all aware of the significance of that?</span> <span id="s101">Were they worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">SS: We were worried what was going on, we knew that Jews were getting beaten up and hurt in Germany, because we were on the border, right on the border; in fact, the German border was five miles away.</span> <span id="s103">Lithuania had a portion of, called East Prussia, Memel, Memelgebiet, or in Lithuania was Klaipeda and that part was taken from the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s104">The Germans took it away in 1938, I believe it was, and all the Jews had to leave and they went, of course, to Israel or to Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">NL: So you knew that German Jews were suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s107">We knew that they were suffering, but we did not know that this could happen to us, because in 1940 the Russians came in, and we thought the Russian is a giant.</span> <span id="s108">That could never happen to us and and, therefore, but you were worried, and we also had a lot of Polish Jews that came from Poland, escaped into Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s110">They thought they would find refuge.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">SS: They would find refuge because the Russians were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">NL: Right.</span> <span id="s113">So, then, in '39 you didn't feel any particular crisis?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">SS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">NL: And the Russians came in in 1940...</span></p> <p><span id="s116">SS: They had also a pact.</span> <span id="s117">And they made a pact that the Russians will stay wherever they stay, and they will get the Lemberg area, Galicia, and he would allow him to--Non-Aggression Pact act, but that, of course, didn't last too long, just a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">NL: Right.</span> <span id="s119">Now, what were some of the early measures that were taken by the Russians that affected your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">SS: Well, when the Russians came in, being my father was well-to-do, first of all they confiscated the house that we have, and then they put us into a certain area in the house, and they moved in their Communist Party because we had a tremendous big apartment and with a big hall.</span> <span id="s121">And that was built in 1938, the house, so they took this away and, then, finally they were told that they would have to move out altogether, but this happened--the war broke out with Germany, so they did not get a chance, and we did not have to move out, yet...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">SS: Until the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">NL: And then your father became an employee?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">SS: He became an employee of the, of one of these--for the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">NL: For the Soviet Government.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">SS: Government, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">NL: Now, how did the Soviet presence affect Jewish life?</span> <span id="s129">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">SS: Well, I remember that a lot of Jews already were afraid perhaps to pray, especially the younger people.</span> <span id="s131">They figured, well, maybe they would be seen, because they did not want, they didn’t want these Jews, you know, to practice their religion.</span> <span id="s132">For that matter, any religion they were against, they were against any religion.</span> <span id="s133">But, in Lithuania, Judaism was very strong, and we didn't care whatever happens, we went to synagogue and, specially, people used to go three times a day, and on Saturdays, of course, it was always full.</span> <span id="s134">Everyone went and we didn't--at that time it wasn't yet strictly enforced by the Russians that we shouldn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">NL: Were you aware of any Jewish youth movements, Zionists or Bundists?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">SS: Yes, we used to have Betar and Zionistische, different Zionist movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">NL: And, were you part of any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">SS: No, I was...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">NL: Or were you too young?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">SS: Yes, I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: Did the Jews suffer under the Russian presence, or do you think they managed to exist fairly well?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">SS: They managed to exist.</span> <span id="s143">They confiscated the big stores from the well-to-do, and they had to go to work.</span> <span id="s144">In fact, perhaps they worked in the same place what they owned in many cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NL: But as employees?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">SS: But they put Lithuanians, you know, that were already in the Bolshevik, in the Communist movement, as overseers.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NL: Was there a lot of pressure, as far as you know, for Jews to join the party?</span> <span id="s148">And did some Jews join?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">SS: No, it was not pressure, but a lot of the Jews wanted to join so they should be able to get a better "in" with the government.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">NL: Right.</span> <span id="s151">Now, did your education change when the Russians came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">SS: Well, the education system was such that you had to teach, it was mandatory Russian, and the system of classes was already different, because by us was first six grades in public and then you had to go from one to eight class Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s153">When the Russians came, when you finished school, five up to ten, you were out from Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s154">There was ten classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">NL: Ten classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">SS: Ten classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">NL: So, you were in a Russian-type school for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">SS: A year, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">NL: And I guess you learned Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">SS: Yes, at that time I learned.</span> <span id="s161">I already forgot a lot, but I still...</span></p> <p><span id="s162">NL: But you learned it?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">SS: I speak seven languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">SS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NL: That is so remarkable.</span> <span id="s167">And was there much indoctrination?</span> <span id="s168">Were you aware that there was propaganda?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s170">There was indoctrination as far as the youth, Pioneer.</span> <span id="s171">In fact they wanted me to belong to the Pioneer, and maybe I even attended some Pioneer meetings, because my sisters--they were already, already, they were already older than I am, and they were talking about belonging to the--what do they call it, Komsomol, the youth, but it didn't materialize.</span> <span id="s172">It wasn't easy to get in because you had to bring up that you are, that you were from the Proletariat.</span> <span id="s173">If you were anywhere like my dad was, there was difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">NL: A capitalist...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">SS: Yes, and a lot of them, my father’s, they sent to Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">SS: Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s178">But they didn’t get to my father yet.</span> <span id="s179">I don’t know what would have happened if they would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">NL: Yes, there were some arrests and exiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">SS: Yes, exiles, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">NL: And I guess Zionist leaders also may have suffered?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">SS: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">NL: Now, the war, of course, came very suddenly to the Soviet Union, in June.</span> <span id="s185">Do you remember when you felt the presence of an invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">SS: Yes, exactly, I remember distinctly, vividly.</span> <span id="s187">On June the 22nd, Sunday morning around three o’clock, being we lived only five miles away from the border, we heard that shelling upon our town and constantly, and then so we--my father gathered all of us together and we didn’t know where to go, so we ran in the fields, you know.</span> <span id="s188">We wanted to go, because we knew if we gonna be caught by the Germans, it’s not gonna good.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">NL: You had no warning from any other...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">SS: We didn’t have no warning.</span> <span id="s191">In fact, the night before there was all the celebrations were made, because that was the day when the Russians came in into Lithuania, exactly a year ago, and that was supposed to actually be a celebration, and the Russians, they had these, they called it, in Russian zelionye shapki, green berets.</span> <span id="s192">There were these border patrol, and being it's on the Baltic Sea, we were close to the Baltic Sea, they had all by the tens and tens of thousands of soldiers, and we felt pretty secure.</span> <span id="s193">We thought that the Russians will defend, you know, and conquer Germany with no pain, with no problem, but it turned out otherwise, because when we went to the fields, we saw a lot of Russians with their rifles, you know, going back.</span> <span id="s194">Some of them were without an arm already, bandaged, you know, with the horses running by themselves.</span> <span id="s195">It was a whole thing...</span></p> <p><span id="s196">NL: Chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">SS: Chaos, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">NL: So the Russians were retreating.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">SS: They were retreating, and they were taken into prison by the thousands and thousands and thousands, and they also had a group of the soldiers, they were called the Workers' Group.</span> <span id="s200">They were, I think, from Manchuria, but they were Russians, and they were stationed in our area, and they also were in prison, and a couple of hours later we saw Germans already in our town, and we were surrounded everywhere and we couldn't go back neither here nor there.</span> <span id="s201">They were faster that--where could you run?</span> <span id="s202">Please!</span> <span id="s203">So what happens, it was that we had to go back to town, and in one week they told us, in the same week, they said the Lithuanians had already white bands and they marched, you know, because they were trying to take revenge because some of these--we had a few Jewish people that were in the Communist Party and they used to confiscate from them, you know, the grain, they confiscated not because they wanted it, because it was a government order, and what they did is, for these people, the Communists, they stuffed them with grain down the throat and they suffocated.</span> <span id="s204">They, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NL: They suffocated?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">SS: And they shot a few girls that worked in the Kommandantur, in the German, in the Russian, in the Russian command post.</span> <span id="s207">They were only secretaries, you know, but still they knew exactly what it was and they took revenge from a lot of these Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">NL: It must have been horrendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">SS: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">NL: So, then, what did your family do?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">SS: We went back to town.</span> <span id="s212">We went back to our house, and then it came an order that all the Jews must go in the Jewish quarter, because there was a quarter called the Jewish Street where we went to cheder in school, and they took us all in that little, in that street, crammed everybody in, maybe six families into one, and that's the way--waiting what's going to happen, and in the meantime, daily, they were taking us to work.</span> <span id="s213">So--but it only happened until the 28th, the 22nd was when the war broke out and the 28th, the 27th was a Friday night, Friday afternoon, and they gathered all the Jews together at the Jewish synagogue and they said--when the Germans came, the SS came with the Lithuanians, and they went from town to town, the Lithuanians pointed out where all the Jews lived and where they were Jewish homes and they took them all, only men, to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s214">When they came into my house, they asked me, they asked my mother, and I laid down on the couch, you know, I didn't want to see them.</span> <span id="s215">I was afraid, so I covered myself, so when the SS came in they asked my mother, "Who is sleeping here?"</span> <span id="s216">And she said, "That's my little boy."</span> <span id="s217">And he says to my mother, "Mitkommen!</span> <span id="s218">Let him come along with us."</span> <span id="s219">And they took me and that's how I happened to survive, or else I would have stayed there with everybody else in that home town, which they were three months later, of course, they were all shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">NL: They weren’t deported?</span> <span id="s221">They were just shot in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">SS: In town.</span> <span id="s223">That’s what happened.</span> <span id="s224">We were to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s225">In the synagogue, when I came already, I saw my father, I saw the rabbi, I saw many other people.</span> <span id="s226">They continued to bring young men, strong people and also the old, some of the old, and there was a few young like me, and there they had a doctor from the town, and he was a good man.</span> <span id="s227">His name was Dr. Velunis [phonetic].</span> <span id="s228">He was a Lithuanian, and we asked him, “Are they going to shoot us?”</span> <span id="s229">And he motioned to us like this.</span> <span id="s230">He had to examine every one of us and we were examined down on the first floor, and upstairs there was the woman’s part where the women used to daven, pray, so there was a big stairs, and as we finished, first of all, there was a barber.</span> <span id="s231">He made--town barber, and an antisemite, too.</span> <span id="s232">He made us a cross, this way and this way in our hair, so they called it Lausenstrasse, you know, for lice a promenade, and then we got beatings.</span> <span id="s233">From here as we go up each stair, there was an SS guy with a whip.</span> <span id="s234">Till we go up there, you know, they really, they really let us have it and they told us to bring along whatever rings we had, gold, you know.</span> <span id="s235">And that was Friday night.</span> <span id="s236">The rabbi, the rabbi’s beard was cut, and they gave another Jew, which he happened to survive that Jew, he’s still in--as far as I know he’s still alive in Florida--I met him a couple of months ago.</span> <span id="s237">They told him to hold the rabbi’s--they cut his beard and they told him to hold the hair in his hands, and this man had to put a torch to his hair and burn it.</span> <span id="s238">They had to ship our Torahs, the books, the prayer books, the shawl, the taletsim, everything on the ground, and they told us to tramp on it, you know, walk on it in the back of the synagogue for about a couple of hours with all kinds of calisthenics, and with your arms and crawling on the ground and jumping, and each time if you didn't do the way they told you, they tortured.</span> <span id="s239">They threw dollars, American dollars, and rubles on the ground, to see if somebody of us, being we are already in pain and agony and being tortured, to see if some of us will pick it up.</span> <span id="s240">It was laying around purposely as a temptation.</span> <span id="s241">Can you imagine their sadistic minds?</span> <span id="s242">So, we were there until Saturday morning, and Saturday morning, before they took us out--we didn't know where we were going--and they told all these women to come to bring us food, so the women came and brought us, you know, Shabbes food, they didn't know what is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s243">[Mr. S. is agitated.</span> <span id="s244">Taping is stopped.]</span> <span id="s245">So when these women came with the food, they thought they would be able to see us, and as they approached the gate that was close to the synagogue, the SS started to shoot over their heads, so they thought they were going to be shot, so they ran away.</span> <span id="s246">They went back; they wouldn't let them see us.</span> <span id="s247">And, therefore, one of these White Band Lithuanians that is now in Chicago, he brought it up a package for me from my mother.</span> <span id="s248">Some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">NL: Some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">SS: Some food but they, they took it away afterwards anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">NL: But he tried?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">SS: He tried, yes.</span> <span id="s253">But he was with the Band, he was like one of them, like the others, yeah, he went from town to town and house to house pointing out where the Jews are.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">NL: He knew you in town and he was trying to do a little favor?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">SS: He knew me because I played with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">SS: In fact, I saved his life in the big pond.</span> <span id="s258">We were going skating and he fell in, and I held onto him until his uncle came and rescued him because he was also small.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">NL: He was trying to repay you...</span></p> <p><span id="s260">SS: If not, he would have been dead, if I didn’t hold on, and I could have, could have fallen in myself.</span> <span id="s261">So, Saturday morning the trucks came along and they took us and they loaded us all up, and they took us to a camp in, near Heydekrug [or Heidekrug] in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">NL: Do you know how you would spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">SS: H-E-Y-D-E-K-R-U-G.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">NL: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">SS: Yes, it’s not far from Memel.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">NL: From Memel?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">SS: Yes.</span> <span id="s268">There was an SS captain by the name of Dr. Scholl [phonetic].</span> <span id="s269">He had a big brick factory and he had a big farm, and he wanted us, he got permission for the Jews to work for him, and, of course, we were under the SS guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">NL: And your father was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">SS: My father was with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">NL: Was he still rather husky?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">SS: Oh yes, my father was very strong and husky and physical, yes, and when we got there in the, in Heydekrug, they subdivided us to various different, five miles away, another camp, 50 miles to another camp, but he was the one in charge of the whole, of the whole group that he took out from Schweksna.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">NL: Were there any other children of your age there?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">SS: Just about--a little older, maybe 12 or 13, about three or four.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">NL: And, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">SS: Well, when I got into the camp, they saw me what I am, and they asked me, the guard, that was not the main guard, he was a lieutenant, he made me to clean his apartment, clean his shoes, bring food to the, to the guards, and that kind of, that kind of work, light work, peel potatoes...</span></p> <p><span id="s278">NL: You were really an exception?</span> <span id="s279">How do you understand the reasons why you were kept there?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">SS: I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">NL: It was a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SS: It was a chance, why they kept me I’ll never know.</span> <span id="s283">To this day I don’t know.</span> <span id="s284">Maybe--[unclear] Reboyne Shel Oylem [God, The Lord] had a purpose, I don’t know, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NL: Really uncanny.</span> <span id="s286">So you worked at these odd jobs...</span></p> <p><span id="s287">SS: I remember, yes, and my father and everybody else, they worked on the streets.</span> <span id="s288">They used to dig ditches and making the ground, level off the ground.</span> <span id="s289">Then we worked also in the gravel factories.</span> <span id="s290">And every month there was selections.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">NL: Every month?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">SS: Every month.</span> <span id="s293">So they selected who didn't, and they used to ask, "Who wants to go home?"</span> <span id="s294">But, of course, there was no home.</span> <span id="s295">They was actually being shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">NL: But lots of people fell.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">SS: Oh [unclear]--me and my father, my father wanted to go home, so they put his name down, to send him, but then this guard that I cleaned his shoes, I asked him, I said, "My father is going home, and I would like to go with him if I could."</span> <span id="s298">He says, "No, you we need yet, you cannot go," but this was already, it was every month, and then the 28th of Elul, which is just one day before Rosh Hashana, we learned from the people that the border was already opened, you know Germans was already in Lithuania, we learned that all the women and children, they told them to gather together and bring their jewelry, and possessions, whatever clothes, they are going to see the men, us, that were taken to work.</span> <span id="s299">They put them all in trucks.</span> <span id="s300">The Lithuanians drove the trucks, and the SS were there and they took them from our town.</span> <span id="s301">Six kilometers out in the woods, there were already the ditches digged, and the SS troopers, and the Germans and the Lithuanians, they were drunk, were already drunk, they had machine guns ready.</span> <span id="s302">They told them to undress in front of the graves, to get all of the possessions, took everything away, and they machine gunned everyone of them to death.</span> <span id="s303">Some of them were even alive and they buried them alive.</span> <span id="s304">The blood came through the ground the next, the next morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">NL: How did you hear about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">SS: From the Lithuanians at camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">NL: At camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">SS: At camp.</span> <span id="s309">They used to work in Germany also, they used to go back and forth and they used to drop, when they walked by, they dropped a note when they walked by and that’s the way we found out, and a lot we found out after the war because...</span></p> <p><span id="s310">NL: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s311">Now, what made your father change his mind?</span> <span id="s312">These reports, or did his superior?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">SS: All right.</span> <span id="s314">When he wouldn’t let me go and I said, “Since I cannot go, can my father stay?”</span> <span id="s315">So he let him stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">NL: You said, “Can my father stay?”</span></p> <p><span id="s317">SS: Yes, and because I had contact with him.</span> <span id="s318">I could talk to him.</span> <span id="s319">Because, you know, usually you cannot talk to them, but being that I, that I cleaned...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">NL: You did personal services for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">SS: That’s right.</span> <span id="s322">And then I used to sometimes get leftovers, you know, what he used to throw out and I used to take it.</span> <span id="s323">He didn’t see those things, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">NL: He never saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">SS: But I, and I used to give them to my father, and my uncle at that time was still there, because that was before Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s326">That was from ‘41 to ‘43.</span> <span id="s327">I was already two years...</span></p> <p><span id="s328">NL: You were here at Heydekrug.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">SS: At Heydekrug, from ‘41 to ‘43.</span> <span id="s330">And then it came...</span></p> <p><span id="s331">NL: You stayed on as this personal valet?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">SS: No, later on already I already worked on the field also, because I worked with a guy from, he was also a party man but he was also a civilian, and I used to work with him.</span> <span id="s333">They used to measure the roads and there was tabloids [phonetic], and I used to carry the tabloids for him in the rain and the cold, you know, and once...</span></p> <p><span id="s334">NL: You were still the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">SS: I was still the youngest.</span> <span id="s336">Once, I went with food, for the, to bring the food back, and they let me go alone, without a guard, to bring the food for the guards, from the kitchen, from the SS kitchen, and I used to go into a house, there was one house that the woman was very sympathetic and she used to give me bread...</span></p> <p><span id="s337">NL: Is that so.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">SS: But one day it was raining...</span></p> <p><span id="s339">NL: A German woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">SS: A German, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s341">She was, you see, she was an older person.</span> <span id="s342">There was quite a few of them, you know, they were very good but they couldn’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s343">They used to make believe they dropped something and it used to be bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">NL: In the field?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">SS: In the field where we worked.</span> <span id="s346">You know, we worked like a gang group, so when I walked in there, I used to go in there, she used to give me soup, and used to give me bread, and I used to put it in there, and one day it was raining and for some reason the guards--came with the Kommando...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s348">NL: This is tape one, side two, continuing our interview with Mr. Sherron.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">SS: So, when I saw them going back and I was supposed to go bring them the food, I turned around because I had some bread on me.</span> <span id="s350">I turned around and I went back to the camp so, and then they started, the guards started to shoot at me, because, you know, we had a yellow patch on the back.</span> <span id="s351">We had to have a yellow patch on the back and on the arm, and they saw so they one of the Jewish people, it was the, a Lagerführer, not a Lagerführer, he was a, like a Kapo, but we didn’t have a Kapos there, so he says, “Don’t shoot.</span> <span id="s352">He’s going back because he sees us,” so they stopped shooting.</span> <span id="s353">When I came back, the guard told this, this, the Lagerführer, the commander of the camp, what happened, what I did, so he, and that was the one that I cleaned his shoes and his rooms and everything else, he told me that I should melden, I should report.</span> <span id="s354">And I reported and they lined up all the Jews, you know in line, and he gave me ten beatings with his, with his, not with his, his fist, his whip, and my father had to see this, and you know, next day I was black and blue, oh, I collapsed on the floor.</span> <span id="s355">I was a kid, and then, “From then on in from now on,” he says, “that will happen to every one of you if you are going to do something like this.”</span> <span id="s356">So, then, of course, we knew that nobody else...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NL: Could you go to the clinic or was there any way that you could...</span></p> <p><span id="s358">SS: There was no clinic.</span> <span id="s359">We didn’t have no clinic there.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">NL: There was no care.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">SS: No, no, nothing, no care, no care, and incidentally, that commander of the whole group that took us out, that had permission to keep those Jews for his purpose, he was a doctor himself.</span> <span id="s362">He was a doctor, but I do remember that in one, in one case that he treated a Jew.</span> <span id="s363">He must have been about 19 or 20 years old.</span> <span id="s364">He broke his arm, and he put his arm in a splint for some reason.</span> <span id="s365">He himself, he himself, maybe he wants to practice to see what’s what, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s366">You know it was very difficult to figure them out.</span> <span id="s367">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s368">Here I am, you know, cleaning his room and shining his shoes, and when it came for me to get a beating, he beat me good.</span> <span id="s369">He didn’t give me one or two, he gave me ten for having a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s370">So, that was, we were there till 1943, but these things were back and forth.</span> <span id="s371">Then we wanted to get clothes, we didn’t have no clothes.</span> <span id="s372">We saw clothes that came from our homes, you know.</span> <span id="s373">They send it to us, and we also saw clothes that people wore when they were taken from us back home, so we knew what happened to them.</span> <span id="s374">What they did, is that they took them to the border in the same area and that’s where everybody got shot.</span> <span id="s375">In 1943, I think it was around June or July, there came an order that all the Jews has to be liquidated.</span> <span id="s376">I mean has to be, has to be free, Germany has to be free from all the Jews in this area.</span> <span id="s377">So they put us, they gathered us from all these camps, from Heydekrug into the main camp, which was Heydekrug itself, and we were for two days in a, in a barn.</span> <span id="s378">Now we didn’t know what was going on but we knew it’s no good.</span> <span id="s379">We figured something is--we thought we’re going to be shot, also.</span> <span id="s380">Finally, Dr. Scholl came along and he said, “Since you are good workers, you are going to a very good place that you will really enjoy being there.</span> <span id="s381">You'll be all together.</span> <span id="s382">I'm giving you a good recommendation that, that you are one of the best workers that I had, and you will enjoy where you are at.”</span> <span id="s383">We didn't know where we went.</span> <span id="s384">We were traveling, but we were put in the cattle trains; we were traveling for about eight days and, of course, my uncle--he was shorter, he was unshaven--and of course, some of the others, and from our transport there were about 500 people, we came, and that was Auschwitz, Birkenau.</span> <span id="s385">There was a selection, left, right, left, right, and my uncle, of course, he went to the left.</span> <span id="s386">My father was to the right.</span> <span id="s387">They sent me also to the left, which was the truck, and I thought by truck would be much better, but I wanted to be with my father and I saw my father on the other side.</span> <span id="s388">In that back and forth, back and forth, I jumped down that truck, I went back to the group that had to be selected yet, and this time, an SS man pointed me to the right, and that was where the Kommandos, where they made the selections.</span> <span id="s389">I went into the group to be walking in, and I was right next to my father, and we went into the camp.</span> <span id="s390">I thought, you know, walking would be more difficult than on the truck, but as it turned out, it was, it was better, and when we came into the camp, we saw women with violins, and I remember distinctly the march even today in my ears, and I thought this was heaven.</span> <span id="s391">You know, for two years we were already in a slave camp with hunger and beatings prior to that in Heydekrug, and you know what they used to do in Heydekrug Camp?</span> <span id="s392">In the middle of the night the SA and the SS used to come in, and they used to make us "Up, down, up, down," from our bunks and make all kinds of calisthenics, sports, they called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">NL: In the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SS: In the middle of the night, three o’clock and they used to bang with the butts, you know, into the doors and you know when you heard them, we right away, and this was going on for two years, for two years.</span> <span id="s395">Finally, when we got into this camp, we thought this is going to be heaven, and then when we got into this camp, first of all, they gave us right away a number and they told us to go into a Entlausung, which is a delousing place, and when we went in there, we saw, of course, these showers and everything else.</span> <span id="s396">It could have been a different shower, too, you know.</span> <span id="s397">Thank God, but, this was the real, and they gave us with cold water, and then they disinfected us and they gave us the striped clothes, the first time we had striped clothes.</span> <span id="s398">Prior to that we had civilian clothes, with, with the yellow badge, and then we went in a quarantine.</span> <span id="s399">We were in Birkenau in the quarantine with the Gypsies, and well, the Gypsies were in one Block, we were in another Block, and after that, we worked, after the quarantine we used to go and work then in different, for I.G. Farben, different areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">NL: Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s401">You were still probably the youngest?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">SS: I was 11 years old.</span> <span id="s403">When I got to Auschwitz I was 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">NL: There were no other children that age?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">SS: Well, yes, there were, there were.</span> <span id="s406">There were some.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">NL: Did they sleep with the men, did they sleep with the men in the same bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">SS: In the same bunks as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">NL: They didn’t have a separate bunk for children?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">SS: I was told that there was a separate bunk for children, that there were younger children.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">NL: There were younger children.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">SS: There were younger children, but they were separately.</span> <span id="s413">The way I heard, I mean, I don’t know, but I didn’t see it myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: But you stayed with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">SS: I stayed with my father and there was another few from, from when we went on the, on the regular, on the detail work, to do, to do the work.</span> <span id="s416">Actually we got, they gave us a, our Kommando was Gleisanschluss crematorium.</span> <span id="s417">What does that mean?</span> <span id="s418">It means that, instead of the, when the train comes in from all of the transports, instead for them to go by truck into the crematorium, into the gas chamber, we build, our Kommando built tracks, so instead of going by selection, they should be able to go in right into the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">NL: And you worked in that detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">SS: I worked in the detail, and we saw every day coming from Greece, transports.</span> <span id="s421">I will never forget as long as I am going to live, there was one transport came in in Auschwitz, everybody from Saloniki, everybody was dead; there was probably a convoy of about maybe 25 to 30 trucks, at least.</span> <span id="s422">There was one girl alive.</span> <span id="s423">She was sitting on the top of a dead pile of the dead corpses from the transport, because they must have been probably about two weeks on the transport, and she also went in.</span> <span id="s424">It stands out in my eyes, you know, her face, and she went, also went into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s425">Of course, the other ones, they didn’t have to gas them any more, because they were dead, but they just probably took off the gold and the clothes, and they went straight into the, into the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">NL: You worked with your father on those details?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">SS: On these details.</span> <span id="s428">Not only with my father, but with some of our group, too, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s429">NL: It’s a wonder you didn’t go mad.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">SS: [groans] Did you know what I used to do?</span> <span id="s431">When they used to finish up the, the food, they used to give us, you know, potato, potato peels, sometimes you saw a potato, sometimes not, you know the rations what they gave us in Auschwitz or Birkenau, I’m sure that you are very well aware.</span> <span id="s432">I used to with, I remember with this finger, I used to go in, into this pot, they had a big pot, you know, to carry, when they carried these foods, and I used to clean it out like this, you know, and try to scoop up whatever I can.</span> <span id="s433">They used to give us cigarette rations.</span> <span id="s434">You see, my dad did not smoke and I did not, I used to sell...</span></p> <p><span id="s435">NL: Cigarette rations?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">SS: They gave cigarettes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">NL: But no food.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">SS: No food.</span> <span id="s439">They used to give us, I think, three or four cigarettes a day, a week.</span> <span id="s440">I used to sell, my father did too, sell those cigarettes for bread, and there was people that did not care about food, they didn’t care if they lived or died or what happened to them.</span> <span id="s441">They wanted that smoke and cigarettes, and they, they went fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">NL: And you were able to swap your cigarettes?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">SS: Oh yes, I sold mine.</span> <span id="s444">I was so hungry.</span> <span id="s445">I was constantly hungry.</span> <span id="s446">There wasn’t a day that I didn’t suffer from hunger and, you know, hunger pain is, is so severe that, that, you know, and in the cold, you used to stay, four o’clock in the morning, they made us to get up.</span> <span id="s447">Gong was four o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s448">After that they made us stay in line, used to eat fast to drink up that coffee Ersatz that they used to give you...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NL: The Appell?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s451">And then right in line for three hours, for two hours, two-and-a-half hours, it varied, and God forbid, if somebody was missing, you’d stay until they found him whether he was dead or alive.</span> <span id="s452">There was even an order that everyone of them, when he goes out to bring some dead back, and if somebody, lots of them died, when they came back, this person, this dead person had to be accounted for in line, which is so the number could be recorded that this is dead.</span> <span id="s453">And then in...</span></p> <p><span id="s454">NL: Take a few minutes--And how was Father managing?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">SS: Well, my father was, by then he was already weaker and he didn’t feel too good.</span> <span id="s456">He was a very strong man.</span> <span id="s457">He weighed maybe 210 pounds, and he was tall, was a six-footer, you know.</span> <span id="s458">So finally there came an order that, from Auschwitz that they are looking for Jews that do not speak Polish, that are not from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">NL: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">SS: That was also in, was in ‘43, later in ‘43.</span> <span id="s461">At that time they asked us, “Who wants to go to another camp?”</span> <span id="s462">And I said to my Dad, “Let’s run from here, wherever it is, it couldn’t be worse than this is.”</span> <span id="s463">So we volunteered and lots of other people volunteered.</span> <span id="s464">Incidentally, when we got to Auschwitz, from the whole group, there remained 180 people, from the 500.</span> <span id="s465">The rest of them went already into the, into the crematorium.</span> <span id="s466">And after the quarantine, after we worked, they were selected to go to Warsaw, and they took only Jews that do not speak Polish.</span> <span id="s467">Being Lithuanians, they did not know that Polish and Russian is the same, and we didn’t volunteer anything.</span> <span id="s468">We were taken out with a group; there was Hungarian Jews, some Hungarians.</span> <span id="s469">There was not many Hungarians in ‘43 in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s470">They went in ‘44 later on.</span> <span id="s471">There was a few Lithuanians, there was only our group of Lithuanians, the Lithuanians that were in the Kovno Ghetto, we were from them far, far away and they were not even, they did not even know that we exist, a camp into East Prussia.</span> <span id="s472">They were with their families until 1944 in the Kovno Ghetto, and then they were liquidated, you know, some of them in the Ninth Fort, a [unclear] that I am sure that you are familiar with.</span> <span id="s473">But with us, we were the first ones right from the beginning without our, of course, our families were already also gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">NL: This was the end of ‘43, after...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">SS: In ‘43, yes.</span> <span id="s476">They took us and then we didn’t know where we were going.</span> <span id="s477">They took all of the French Jews, but these French Jews, they were also from Polish, Polish descent, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">NL: Foreign Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">SS: Yes, foreign Jews.</span> <span id="s480">But they didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s481">So there were Holland Jews, from Holland.</span> <span id="s482">We had Holland a lot, too, and all these Jews they do not supposedly speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NL: And about how many were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">SS: We were about 5,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">NL: 5,000?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">SS: Five thousand they took and we didn’t know where we were, but they were, they took us in the cattle trains and, of course, the SS were right in front.</span> <span id="s487">They kept the whole front for themselves, but we were, and it was about four days, I think, we were traveling, and when we got, we found out, let out, we didn’t know where we were.</span> <span id="s488">We see a, a..</span> <span id="s489">.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">NL: A field of rubble.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">SS: There was rubble and everything was full of it all around, and then we saw a place where they left us off and that was a jail, and that jail we found out is the name Pawiak.</span> <span id="s492">And we were there for about, I think, four or five weeks.</span> <span id="s493">While being there, we went and we built barracks in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s494">That happened to be Warsaw, incidentally.</span> <span id="s495">And we found it out it was Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">NL: You knew, of course, that the ghetto had been destroyed?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">SS: No, we did not know.</span> <span id="s498">We didn’t know a thing.</span> <span id="s499">We were, we completely didn’t know.</span> <span id="s500">In fact we didn’t get no correspondence, we didn’t know how the war was going.</span> <span id="s501">We only know that when the Germans are mad, it must be bad for them.</span> <span id="s502">We kind of, you know, assumed that way.</span> <span id="s503">But prior to that, while we were in Auschwitz, they made us write letters back home.</span> <span id="s504">Maybe they want to find out if somebody is alive yet or whatever.</span> <span id="s505">I wrote a letter to my cousin in Kovno, where she was, and you know, my cousin received that letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">NL: What did you have to write?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">SS: That we are fine, that, well we knew that they are going to censor it, read every line that we write, we are working, we are all together and everything is nice, the food is very good and we enjoy being where we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">NL: They may have wanted to use it for propaganda?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">SS: Maybe, whatever it was, but that letter came in Kovno Ghetto to my cousin.</span> <span id="s510">She happened to survive, too, but she was in Kovno Ghetto.</span> <span id="s511">She was in Stutthof and then she, from Stutthof, of course, she was liberated.</span> <span id="s512">I don’t know in what camp.</span> <span id="s513">She is now in Phoenix, Arizona.</span> <span id="s514">But from when we got to Warsaw, we built barracks and we were transferred from there into the barracks.</span> <span id="s515">That barracks that we built, it was near the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s516">They, near the Judenrat, they called that Konzentrationslager Warschau.</span> <span id="s517">That was K.L. Warsaw.</span> <span id="s518">We built crematoriums in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s519">The Obersturmbandführer, the commander, just came from Lublin, Maidanek.</span> <span id="s520">They had liquidated Lublin at that particular time, Obersturmbandführer Weiss with his clique, and they brought all of them to us, and they were in charge of that concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">NL: And were Jews then gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">SS: Not yet.</span> <span id="s523">You see, it wasn’t finished yet, because that was in ‘43, and in ‘43 we got used to, when people died in Warsaw, they got new transports, brought in new ones from various areas and then it started in ‘44, they started to come in from Auschwitz, Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s524">So we had Hungarian Jews there, but not Polish-speaking, but some of them, there was from Czechoslovakia, which is Slovak, is very similar.</span> <span id="s525">They spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s526">We cleaned the ghetto.</span> <span id="s527">We cut those, those, we knocked out all the cement around the bricks, cleaned it up so they wanted to probably rebuild the whole area.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">NL: And destroy the evidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">SS: That is correct.</span> <span id="s530">Destroy the evidence, or whatever.</span> <span id="s531">We were, there was hell there.</span> <span id="s532">Everybody died from typhus, spots typhus, black fever.</span> <span id="s533">One morning I contacted that, too.</span> <span id="s534">I was out for four weeks.</span> <span id="s535">Now, they took me away to the so-called Revier they called it, it was a hospital, so-called hospital.</span> <span id="s536">Now that hospital in itself was smelling from the stench of the people.</span> <span id="s537">You know, there was no sanitary conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">NL: No water?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">SS: The straw sacks, you know, where we were sleeping, was infested with bacteria, with everything.</span> <span id="s540">I do not know what happened to me because I do not remember a thing in those four weeks that I was in that Revier.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">NL: You were perhaps in a delerium?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">SS: I don’t know what happened to me, but I know that after, they brought me back to the barracks that I was originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">NL: And you were better?</span> <span id="s544">You must have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s545">SS: Yes, I felt better.</span> <span id="s546">I felt stronger.</span> <span id="s547">And, then, there was a French Jew that was in charge of that barracks, and he sent me to work in the kitchen, in the prison kitchen for the barracks, and while I was there, a few months, I used to get extra soup.</span> <span id="s548">I used to give it to my father and...</span></p> <p><span id="s549">NL: A little more food.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">SS: A little more food.</span> <span id="s551">In fact, if I hadn't helped my father, he wouldn't be alive today.</span> <span id="s552">And then one day there was a selection, and they was going to take everybody, so I went to the Kapo of the kitchen, and he was a German a German, he was a criminal.</span> <span id="s553">He had a green triangle, you see, which I'm sure you probably heard about it.</span> <span id="s554">There were different colors.</span> <span id="s555">There was homosexuals.</span> <span id="s556">I think that they had black, or there were also Jehovah's Witnesses.</span> <span id="s557">I'm sorry, homosexuals had pink.</span> <span id="s558">Black was for the ones that were saboteurs, I think...</span></p> <p><span id="s559">NL: And socialists.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">SS: And Jews had red and yellow, which was the star of David.</span> <span id="s561">We had on the left and over the heart here and also on the pants on the right side, with your number out.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">NL: By the way, did the Gypsies have a special insignia, do you know, the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">SS: The Gypsies had also a, but I do not remember what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">NL: Did you have any contact with the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">SS: No, we did not, we did not.</span> <span id="s566">They were on the other side.</span> <span id="s567">Although we could have talked to them, it was only a barbed wire.</span> <span id="s568">But we didn't dare.</span> <span id="s569">We had, we saw Russian soldiers there, prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s570">They died like flies.</span> <span id="s571">They mistreated them in the beginning.</span> <span id="s572">It was, you know, they were losing the war at that time, I think, Paulus' Sixth Army or Fourth Army, I don't know which one.</span> <span id="s573">The Germans, from Field Marshal Paulus, they retreated and they were getting a beating, and that's why it was the worst for everybody.</span> <span id="s574">So, anyway, there was a selection in Warsaw and I went to this, and I said, "Can you do something?</span> <span id="s575">My father shouldn't have to go."</span> <span id="s576">So he sent me to one of the guys that was also a Czechoslovak Jew.</span> <span id="s577">He was the one that had all these figures about how many Jews are here, how many Jews are there, and he was hidden in the, where all the foods are hidden, in such a room, storage, until the selection was over, and when the selection was over they let him out, but a lot from our camp that came from Lithuania went with that selection.</span> <span id="s578">I think somewhere near Breslau they sent them.</span> <span id="s579">Not a single person survived.</span> <span id="s580">All dead.</span> <span id="s581">So now, I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s582">Maybe they just took them out and killed them, or whatever.</span> <span id="s583">Never one survived, and then we were there until 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">NL: You were able to get your father a special designation?</span> <span id="s585">He wasn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s586">SS: No, he worked, he worked the same as everybody else, the same detail, but yet on that day when there was this selection, I asked if something could be done...</span></p> <p><span id="s587">NL: And so this man...?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">SS: Right.</span> <span id="s589">He figured that since I was a child, you know, little, he figured that I needed somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">NL: Another person.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">SS: A Czechoslovak Jew, yes.</span> <span id="s592">And then, what happened was, he came out afterwards, you know, and went back to work with everybody else, and happened another case that he survived.</span> <span id="s593">While we were in Auschwitz, that I forgot to mention to you, every Sunday, every Sunday, there was selections.</span> <span id="s594">I remember Dr. Mengele coming up to me once.</span> <span id="s595">He used to go with a lot of officers, you know, and when I stood up, you know, and I was, and I made myself like this...</span></p> <p><span id="s596">NL: As tall as you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">SS: Tall, and you know, he says to me in German, “Du brauchst Dich garnicht gross machen.</span> <span id="s598">Ich sehe was Du bist.”</span> <span id="s599">“You don’t have to make yourself big.</span> <span id="s600">I see what you are...” But he passed by...</span></p> <p><span id="s601">NL: And you weren’t an especially tall...</span></p> <p><span id="s602">SS: No.</span> <span id="s603">But they asked me how old I am, and I said, I said that I am 15.</span> <span id="s604">I lied about my age because, you see, when you are in camp, being that you are undernourished, and you know, you could get away with a lie a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">NL: But you knew enough to know you had to lie.</span> <span id="s606">Survival was...</span></p> <p><span id="s607">SS: We know so much, you know.</span> <span id="s608">When you are in such a situation as a child, you know, somehow your brains works differently and you remember vividly.</span> <span id="s609">You remember details, and that's what happened.</span> <span id="s610">In these selections, what they used to do one day for recreation, we used to take our jackets, our jackets upside down, put through our arms through this way and button up in the back and here they used to load us up with stones, and we used to carry from the camp to the outside of the camp for about 10, 15 yards and then back for three to four hours every Sunday, just to make us, you know, suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">NL: Sadistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">SS: Sadistically, and all kinds of sports.</span> <span id="s613">They taught us how to put the heads up and the heads down, you know, how to approach an officer, which way with the right gestures.</span> <span id="s614">Otherwise, you know, if you didn't do the right way, right away you got slapped.</span> <span id="s615">We saw all kinds of tortures and beatings in the barracks.</span> <span id="s616">You know, there was, in Auschwitz, the barracks there was one long barrack and then supposedly was heat that was supposed to go through.</span> <span id="s617">They used to make us jump in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s618">They used to come in, “Up and down and up and down,” and the boards used to fall on the noses, you know, we used to get, it's unbelievable what we went through.</span> <span id="s619">It’s so inhumane what one human being can do to another, and yet such a people that, you know, gave us Beethoven, Goethe.</span> <span id="s620">It's...</span></p> <p><span id="s621">NL: It’s baffling.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">SS: It’s baffling, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">NL: Now, excuse me.</span> <span id="s624">I just want to ask you this, Mr. Sherron.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SS: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">NL: Were there Lithuanian or Ukrainian guards who also perpetrated...</span></p> <p><span id="s627">SS: Yes, I wanted to mention this.</span> <span id="s628">While we were in Birkenau, one day we were sitting there, you know, the sun was coming down and it was in the quarantine, I hear whistling, the Lithuanian hymn.</span> <span id="s629">I says, “My God, what is going on here?</span> <span id="s630">I mean, that could not be a Lithuanian...” And, by golly, there were Lithuanians, there were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s631">There were the guards on those guard houses, you know, around the camp, and we used to go in and out, and it was marked “Arbeit macht frei,” and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">NL: So, these auxiliaries, they were...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">SS: They were worse than the Germans even, some of them.</span> <span id="s634">Some of them were much, much worse, and another thing, while we were in Auschwitz, they used to, in the morning, they used to call the prisoners to come to the, to the gate, to the wires, you know, to the gate.</span> <span id="s635">Usually, when you don't know, you come fresh, you know, as a prisoner, when a German calls you, you come, but you had the right not to go, because if you did go, they had the right to shoot you, and that's what they did.</span> <span id="s636">They used to call people.</span> <span id="s637">You used to see hundreds and hundreds and hundreds every morning lying flat on the ground, dead, because they used to call them, you know, and as they went, they shot them.</span> <span id="s638">We used to hear during the night all kinds of, during the night hours, shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">NL: How did you learn, not to?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">SS: The people that they were there before told us, “Don’t do it, don’t do it, don’t go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s641">NL: So you had to know when to respond and when not to respond?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">SS: Respond.</span> <span id="s643">When to respond and when not to respond, you know, and some of them couldn't judge at the same time, and that was a human being's life was a fly.</span> <span id="s644">A dog was more important to them than a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">NL: They did it for the sport?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">SS: They did it for the sport.</span> <span id="s647">Just to torture you, to ridicule you.</span> <span id="s648">They used to call you all kinds of names and they didn't call you by the name, they called you by the number, and they called you Sau Schwein, pig and all that kind of numbers, I mean names.</span> <span id="s649">So, we were there till 1944.</span> <span id="s650">Now in 1944, the Russians approached the Weichsel River in Warsaw, and there was talk that they were going to send us away.</span> <span id="s651">Actually, what they wanted, they wanted to kill us right there and then, but the Bürgermeister came, and he said, the Gauleiter, rather, came, and he said, "The Russians are too close.</span> <span id="s652">I don't want anything to happen to the concentration camp, Warsaw, in the camp.</span> <span id="s653">Take them out of here because it is too close, and when this is getting out, they are going to annihilate everything.</span> <span id="s654">The Russians are too close."</span> <span id="s655">So what they did, they left about 200 people behind and they took all of us in away.</span> <span id="s656">We walked from Warsaw to a town named Kutno.</span> <span id="s657">That is on the way to Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">NL: Can you spell it please?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">SS: K-U-T-N-O.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">NL: And was this in the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">SS: That was in the summer.</span> <span id="s662">When the first people walked--you know, it’s a group of 5,000, the ones in the back just couldn’t keep up, because by the time they came to get the first step, they might be like from here to, you know, four, five blocks away.</span> <span id="s663">So the ones in the back, luckily we were more or less towards the front, you know, we had not much food, we didn’t have no, nothing to drink, so we walked day and night.</span> <span id="s664">Well, actually at night they didn’t let us walk, but it was very close to night.</span> <span id="s665">We used to dig the ground where we stood over the night to get water, and would you believe that we had water?</span> <span id="s666">We digged and we got water.</span> <span id="s667">One place we marched from Warsaw, we came to a town called Otwok and there was a big, big river, and they says, “You can go into the and drink that water,” and everybody jumped right in, and as everybody started to jump in, they started to machine gun, to shoot and everybody started to run right away out because we wanted to, it was so hot.</span> <span id="s668">You know, we couldn’t, we couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s670">NL: This is a continuation of our interview with Mr. Samuel Sherron, tape two, side one.</span> <span id="s671">Just before we get to the Einsatzgruppen, could you tell us how many days you were on this march from Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">SS: On this march to Warsaw, we were about three to four days, from Warsaw to Kutno.</span> <span id="s673">We didn't know what town we are going, but Kutno was the last one.</span> <span id="s674">We got finally on the road.</span> <span id="s675">When we got to Kutno, we slept overnight; it was raining, pouring, and we were in the fields, open, and the guards were around us, and they put us into the cattle trains, 110 to a cattle train, and the front doors were right open for themselves, and we were cut off on the sides.</span> <span id="s676">We could not even stand, we just had to sit one, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s677">NL: Against the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">SS: Against each other.</span> <span id="s679">We had some Greek Jews, and this I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s680">There was, the thirst was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s681">The Greeks, they could not take it so much, you know, they drank their own urine, and you know urine is salty by itself, and I saw this with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s682">When we came, finally when we arrived with, we marched off with about 5000 inmates, we came to Dachau but maybe about two-and-a-half thousand.</span> <span id="s683">The others are all dead.</span> <span id="s684">When we got to Dachau after a week on the train, when we got to Dachau, there was a lot of selections then.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">NL: Now, before we go into that, do you want to go back and tell us about the Einsatzgruppen?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">SS: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">NL: ...jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s688">You were in Barbarossa.</span> <span id="s689">[Mr. Sherron may have mentioned this while the tape was off.]</span></p> <p><span id="s690">SS: Yes, well, the Einsatzgruppen.</span> <span id="s691">They were organized that they had Lithuanians, Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s692">Latvians, Estonians, with the SS behind the Gestapo and the Sicherheitdienst.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">NL: Security.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">SS: Security.</span> <span id="s695">They went from town to town in every town in Lithuania, in Latvia, not so much in Estonia, because there wasn't so many Estonian Jews.</span> <span id="s696">In the Ukraine, in White Russia, Minsk, Pinsk, Vallamir [phonetic], all of these towns, and they were shooting Jews from, by the night.</span> <span id="s697">They used to take them out in masses, thousands of thousands of thousands.</span> <span id="s698">They, in fact, some of the guards used to go insane.</span> <span id="s699">The only way they could do it, is they used to make them drunk.</span> <span id="s700">Now these groups were organized before.</span> <span id="s701">In fact there was a, I learned that afterwards, there was a camp near Dresden.</span> <span id="s702">They were sent there in Saxonia, how to [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">NL: To be trained?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">SS: To be trained for that particular details.</span> <span id="s705">They had a Sonderkommando, they called them.</span> <span id="s706">And they went, they went, that group nach Osten, [East], it was called Barbarossa--they probably killed, they killed over two million Jews that way alone, by going from town to town, and their hands were bloody.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">NL: Now, did you hear about this or...</span></p> <p><span id="s708">SS: Well, we could not see because we were already in concentration camps, but we heard already from eye witnesses that ran away from the, from the death graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">NL: You heard it after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">SS: Right after the war.</span> <span id="s711">My cousin, in fact, my cousin ran away with the partisans.</span> <span id="s712">He fought in the woods and he mentioned that he saw, he saw, he knew what was going on in the Perony woods [Ponary].</span></p> <p><span id="s713">NL: Near Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">SS: Near Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">NL: Yes, and in Babi Yar.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">SS: In Babi Yar.</span> <span id="s717">Well, Babi Yar was already in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s718">But that was specially...</span></p> <p><span id="s719">NL: That was specially organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">SS: Organized for that particular...</span></p> <p><span id="s721">NL: They went with the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">SS: With the German Army.</span> <span id="s723">So when we got to Warsaw, to Dachau, we were in Dachau for about a month, and then from Dachau we went to...</span></p> <p><span id="s724">NL: What did you do there, Mr. Sherron?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">SS: In Dachau we were, we were in transit, and tells us again what we can do and what we cannot do, like a quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">NL: Did you get any better food?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">SS: Not much, it was a little better than Warsaw but...</span></p> <p><span id="s728">NL: Not enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">SS: No, never enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">NL: Never enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">SS: You were always hungry and you walked around in hunger and in pain constantly, constantly.</span> <span id="s732">I weighed maybe about 60 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">NL: At the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">SS: Yes, 60, 65 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">NL: So from Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">SS: So from Dachau they sent us to Mühldorf, M-Ü-H-L-D-O-R-F.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">NL: The camp in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">SS: The camp in Germany, Niedersaxonia, Lower Saxony.</span> <span id="s739">No, Nieder Bavaria, Lower Bavaria, pardon me.</span> <span id="s740">That’s quite a distance from Munich, because Munich is Oberbayern, in Upper Bavaria.</span> <span id="s741">That was Nieder Bavaria.</span> <span id="s742">And there already we had our commander was an SS; not an SS but was a Wehrmacht captain, but his assistant was SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">SS: We built, we used to go to the Hauptbaustelle, the main work place.</span> <span id="s745">We built a building so when the Luftwaffe wants to repair their planes, they should be able to fly, I mean to taxi underneath, so they shouldn't be outside and being conspicuous or bombarded by the Allies.</span> <span id="s746">And we worked there two shifts, day and night.</span> <span id="s747">We carried the cement on our backs, and there where my father, I think, developed bronchial disease in his lungs from the dust, because he was very sick at the very end, before he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">NL: Did you work under one of the big industrial enterprises like Farben?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">SS: That must have been I. G. Farben because I didn’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s750">It was called Hauptbaustelle.</span> <span id="s751">We did have those Yellow Hats there, and they were plain Germans, and they probably belonged to the party, I am sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NL: Did they work side by side with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">SS: They didn’t work.</span> <span id="s754">No, they gave the orders.</span> <span id="s755">They were the big shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">SS: We worked, only the inmates did the work.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">NL: Were there non-Jewish workers?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">SS: A few, very few non-Jews, also criminals.</span> <span id="s760">But not as much as we had in Warsaw or Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s761">In Warsaw, I think they had a whole barracks full just of Germans.</span> <span id="s762">There was a German barrack that Jews were not allowed to be with.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">NL: And was the food here a little bit better, or a little more?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">SS: Not more, but maybe it was a little bit better, but here again, you were still hungry, you were still hungry.</span> <span id="s765">And there we had already Jewish women that used to work also in the details in construction.</span> <span id="s766">We worked day and night and that was torture there.</span> <span id="s767">We used to have to carry those bags with cement and pour in with the water to mix, you know, the cement mixers, and from there we used to carry on these lighters [unclear] right into, you know, into the place, you know, and that consisted of iron and cement for the outside walls.</span> <span id="s768">We did not finish that job, because we were there only a year, and then, of course, in 1945, around April the 18th or the 20th, it became an order that we are going to be transferred and exchanged into the Alps, that everybody was going to be exchanged for German troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">NL: You knew already the Germans were losing the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">SS: Well, apparently we had that feeling that something is wrong, but we did not know.</span> <span id="s771">We only prayed one thing.</span> <span id="s772">We could not understand that there was a war going on, and we knew the Americans were involved--why could not this place be bombed?</span> <span id="s773">In Auschwitz more so than anywhere else because this was-- [Mr. Sherron began to sob here], like a machine that went day and night.</span> <span id="s774">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s775">NL: They easily could have bombed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">SS: They should have bombed it.</span> <span id="s777">And at that time, at least much more Jews would have been, we would have maybe been killed, but so what?</span> <span id="s778">At least so many Jews would have been alive, maybe millions, the Hungarian Jews that came late.</span> <span id="s779">For them it sure was plenty of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">NL: There were over four hundred thousand that perished that could have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s781">SS: That’s right.</span> <span id="s782">So, finally they put us into a cattle trains, and we were traveling for a couple of days, and all of a sudden the doors were opened up and we were told that it was in Pocking, P-O-C-K-I-N-G, in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">NL: In the Alps?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">SS: Close to the Alps, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">NL: The doors were opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">SS: And they say, “You can go.”</span></p> <p><span id="s787">NL: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">SS: So everybody was happy, and everybody was trying to jump and dance, and kiss whoever survived and then all of a sudden, you see the Germans coming, the Luftwaffe, no SS, the Luftwaffe.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">NL: Bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">SS: No, no bombing.</span> <span id="s791">They surrounded us and they said, “You Jews, you escaped,” and they put us all in a big field, and they had machine guns on the street, and they were ready to kill us, to shoot us.</span> <span id="s792">My father says to me, “Come, son, give me your hand, and if we will die, we will die together.”</span> <span id="s793">And I gave him my hand, and then, excuse me [pause while Mr. Sherron composes himself] and then, the Bürgermeister from that town came and he said, “The Jews did not escape.</span> <span id="s794">They were told that they can leave.”</span> <span id="s795">You see, but we didn’t know what they know, what the Bürgermeister [mayor] did--the Americans were close by, they were close by.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">NL: So he wanted to save himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">SS: I’m talking, about April already, maybe the 25th or 26th.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">NL: Oh, close to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">SS: We didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s800">So again they took us back into the group, into the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">NL: They responded to the Bürgermeister.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">SS: Yes, they listened, and they did not kill us.</span> <span id="s803">They gathered us together again, and they put us back into the trains, and again started to go back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s804">Then, and the Germans already had their machine guns on top, the Americans with their planes saw a transport with the machine guns on top--they thought it’s a Army, German Wehrmacht--and they started to shoot up the train.</span> <span id="s805">They shot us up as we were running out, and they opened up the doors again so we should go underneath, the SS guards, and a lot of them got killed that way by the Americans, because these planes they came down low over our heads, and the bullets strayed.</span> <span id="s806">Then they gathered us back again and again into the trains, we went back, and we were going forward and we go back again; we knew that something isn’t right.</span> <span id="s807">We thought that maybe they would take us into the right place to let us out, and then that would be the end.</span> <span id="s808">I mean they shoot us.</span> <span id="s809">Finally, the 28th of April in a town called Seeshaupt, S-E-E-S-H-A-U-P-T, near Feldafing, or Mittenwald, or Garmisch, it’s all in the same area, the doors were opened up.</span> <span id="s810">We were afraid to go because we thought maybe it was another trick, and we see a different kind of army, and then we saw that it was the USA.</span> <span id="s811">We started to jump, and then the Americans came over to us and they said, “Don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s812">You are free and you can do whatever you want.”</span> <span id="s813">And they gave us rations, and they gave us food, and people started to drink.</span> <span id="s814">You know, they had evaporated milk, cans of milk, and a lot of them died.</span> <span id="s815">A lot of my friends...</span></p> <p><span id="s816">NL: You knew enough not to eat or drink too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">SS: I drink, too, but I figured I wait, I am free, I’ll eat a little at a time, because I didn’t want to stuff myself.</span> <span id="s818">I thought I’m still in camp, I’m going to put away a little bit away for later.</span> <span id="s819">You know it’s a psychological thing.</span> <span id="s820">And then we were liberated right near Feldafing, at Seeshaupt.</span> <span id="s821">And from there we were transferred, of course.</span> <span id="s822">I was in Feldafing about one week, and then I went to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">NL: Did you get some medical treatment?</span> <span id="s824">Did you and your father get some medical treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SS: Yes, we got some medical treatment.</span> <span id="s826">My father got some medical treatment.</span> <span id="s827">Somebody went to [unclear].</span> <span id="s828">There was a, for lung-sick people in Bavaria.</span> <span id="s829">My father was sent there.</span> <span id="s830">He was there for a while and he developed polycythemia, which is a very rich thick blood.</span> <span id="s831">Every month or whatever reached a certain grade #60, they have to take it out a bottle full to thin it out, but the doctor kept him a long time and later, of course, in the years he suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s832">He developed a heart obstruction and enlarged liver and spleen, and before he died in June at the age of 88, in fact, yesterday he would have been 89 years old would he have lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">NL: Amazing.</span> <span id="s834">He must have been very hardy.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">SS: Yes, yes, he was.</span> <span id="s836">And you know, to me he was, he was never old.</span> <span id="s837">I always see him as young, as I knew him.</span> <span id="s838">And, of course, my mother, she was a very educated person.</span> <span id="s839">She taught at the University of Riga.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">NL: Before she was married?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">SS: Yes, mathematics.</span> <span id="s842">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s843">And her brother was an actor in the Jewish theater.</span> <span id="s844">He painted, he got a prize for painting Herzl’s, Dr. Herzl’s picture.</span> <span id="s845">He was very much involved in Zionism.</span> <span id="s846">So that was the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">NL: You stayed with Father in Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">SS: Only one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">NL: And then Munich.</span> <span id="s850">You went to Munich together.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">SS: And then we went to Munich together, and then I somehow or other, I got involved with the American Army, and I was with the American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">NL: You were by then about 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">SS: Well, 15 or 16, and I came here at the age of 16.</span> <span id="s854">I told them, I lied to them, too.</span> <span id="s855">I wanted to be with the Americans, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">NL: Did you work with them or just...?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">SS: I worked with them.</span> <span id="s858">I was, we used to confiscate cars from the Germans, from the Nazis, and give it to the military personnel.</span> <span id="s859">So actually I was in the Military Government.</span> <span id="s860">We used to go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s861">We had the SS troops there, prisoners.</span> <span id="s862">We used to get them to fix cars, and they were stationed in Dachau.</span> <span id="s863">I used to wear a uniform, oh yeah, with a gun and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">NL: A little bit of vengeance.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">SS: Vengeance, but I didn’t take no vengeance.</span> <span id="s866">But I should have.</span> <span id="s867">They wouldn’t give me the same courtesy the way I gave it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">NL: Wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">SS: Of course not.</span> <span id="s870">And they say, “Me?</span> <span id="s871">I was a good SS man.”</span> <span id="s872">The only man that was good was a dead one.</span> <span id="s873">You could tell.</span> <span id="s874">They had marking over here, too.</span> <span id="s875">One guy escaped from us, you know, but he was a mechanic.</span> <span id="s876">But you know, everybody says, “We were in the front, we were not behind.”</span> <span id="s877">We knew exactly what was going on.</span> <span id="s878">And everybody says to me, “Samuel, in your opinion, do you think that the German population, they claimed that they did not know about this.”</span> <span id="s879">And I’ll say, I’ll tell them that, “There was no German family that didn’t have anyone on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s880">They came for vacation or whatever during the two or three years.</span> <span id="s881">They seen a lot.</span> <span id="s882">There is no way that they would not tell their wives or their brothers or sons, to the parents...”</span></p> <p><span id="s883">NL: And train conductors.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">SS: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">NL: And camp commanders.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">SS: But on the other hand, now, they tell me, “How do you feel about the Germans now?”</span> <span id="s887">I must say this, these Germans, and you have a lot of them here, and you have a lot of the non-Germans that are here in the United States that actually killed Jewish children.</span> <span id="s888">They were guards, but you know, go find them.</span> <span id="s889">The dead people cannot come from the ground to point the finger, but the ones that we do know, they should get their punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">NL: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">SS: Without fail.</span> <span id="s892">And now it’s later, and they already lived so many more years.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">NL: It’s the terrible criminal neglect, criminal neglect of our government.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">SS: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">NL: They protected them since the ‘50's.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">SS: Oh, absolutely they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">NL: And, now...</span></p> <p><span id="s898">SS: Did you hear about Barbie?</span> <span id="s899">Did you hear all these things?</span> <span id="s900">These are open facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">NL: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s902">There are hundreds in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">SS: Hundreds.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">NL: You see, and this Mrs. Holtzman unfortunately is no longer in Congress.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">SS: Yes, she is not.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">NL: She pushed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">SS: But she pushed it, yes.</span> <span id="s908">And, you know, so many of them came in as D.P.s, as Displaced Persons.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">NL: They lied.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">SS: Some are in Chicago right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">NL: And in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">SS: That’s right.</span> <span id="s913">And I asked my, the guy that is in Chicago now, and I asked him, I said, “Look, you were there, maybe my mother, maybe my sisters survived.</span> <span id="s914">Maybe they are somewhere in Russia.”</span> <span id="s915">He says, “No, I saw them on the truck.”</span> <span id="s916">Now what does he got business to see them on the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">NL: He’s saying that he saw your relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">SS: He saw them.</span> <span id="s919">My mother and my sisters on the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">NL: On the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">SS: To go to that main execution place, that execution spot.</span> <span id="s922">So he says, “Well,” he says, “everybody was watching there.</span> <span id="s923">They was taking those poor Jews, you know, so, and that’s what happened.”</span></p> <p><span id="s924">NL: Well, Mr. Sherron, I can’t express our thanks deeply enough.</span> <span id="s925">Would you want to say a few words now to the young generation?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">SS: Well, I can say this: that we must, as long as we are still alive and actually witnesses, live witnesses, to these murderous acts, and to the genocide, we must remember and tell our generations and our children and our children’s children for generations to come, that this such a massacre, on the Jewish people should never come again, and not only to the Jewish people, but this could happen to anybody.</span> <span id="s927">Therefore, we must tell Jewish children and non-Jewish population that they should be on guard constantly against dictatorship, against such lunatics like you have now, Khadafi, or a few years back, you know, you had Idi Amin or Khomeni, still the same type.</span> <span id="s928">And for this you must guard ourselves because what the Jewish people suffered, six million of them, I don’t think that ever in the history of mankind was actually a systematic killing and genocide ever happened what happened between 1935 and 1945 within the Hitler era.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">NL: No precedent.</span> <span id="s930">No parallel.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">SS: No precedent, and so many innocent women, children, old men, learned men, rabbis, professors, so many people that gave so much to humanity--and they were the first ones to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s933">Thank you again very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">SS: Thank you for having me.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Ninth Fort was a killing site on the outskirts of Kovno where thousands of prisoners, mostly Jews, were murdered by Germans and Lithuanians
